Notes:<br>

1. The figures exclude any first-time buyers who bought a property without the need for a mortgage.<br>

2. The source of the data, the Survey of Mortgage Lenders, does not differentiate between genuine first-time buyers (those who have never been owner occupiers) and other first-time buyers (who have previously been owner occupiers).<br>

However, estimates from the most recent Survey of English Housing&quot; data suggest that, currently, as many as 26 per cent. of so-called first-time buyers are in fact returning owner occupiers.<br>

The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the Identity Cards Scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.

For this cohort it is estimated that 65 per cent. of employed graduates&#151;six months after leaving&#151;are in jobs using their degree skills, and this rises to 70 per cent. after one year, and to nearly 80 per cent. within three and a half years <sup>1</sup> .

 Improving the stability of looked-after children&#039;s lives, and thus reducing the number of placements which they experience, is one of the Government&#039;s key objectives. The Department for Education and Skills has a public service agreement target that, by 2008, 80 per cent. of children under 16 who have been looked after for 2.5 years or more will have been in the same placement for at least two years or be placed for adoption. We are working closely with local authorities to ensure that this target can be met: we have issued a range of tools and guidance to help authorities commission placements for children more effectively; we have a programme of work in place to improve the support received by foster carers; we are looking at ways in which to encourage better use of friends and family placements; we are working to reduce unnecessary delays in public law cases; and we have introduced independent reviewing officers to chair individual children&#039;s reviews. These all have important contributions to make in securing improved stability for looked after children.

 The major indigenous diseases of UK wheat and barley crops are favoured by wet weather, particularly in spring and summer. With current production systems and cereal varieties, high temperatures and low rainfall reduce the incidence of cereal diseases. Other risks are monitored as part of the UK&#039;s surveillance programme for plant quarantine diseases. Generally, these risks are unlikely to increase as a result of high temperatures and low rainfall.

Approximately 31 per cent. of GFATM funds go to malaria&#151;and 49 per cent. of all GFATM funds are used for drugs and commodities, including anti-malarial treatments. These funds support both government and NGO programmes. The UK has provided &#163;48.5 million to the Roll Back Malaria Partnership since 1998 and we are also a major donor to the World Bank which has recently announced the Booster programme for Malaria Control programmes.

<a name="stpa_32">From 1998&#150;99 to date, UK support at country level to specific malaria programmes was approximately &#163;58 million.

 By i-dialling I take it that the hon. Member means rogue diallers on the internet running up large bills for consumers. The Government asked Ofcom to carry out a review of premium rate services regulation to ensure that the right level of protection is in place to protect consumers. Ofcom has now produced its report with recommendations designed to improve the effectiveness of premium rate regulation. We are working with the premium rate regulator, ICSTIS, and Ofcom to implement these recommendations as soon as possible. This Department is currently consulting on implementing recommendation 6 from the Ofcom report on increasing the maximum fine for breaches of the ICSTIS code from &#163;100,000 to &#163;250,000.

<p><a name="st_70"><a name="50713w08.html_spnew9"><b> Barry Gardiner: </b> 
 The Government are determined to improve the UK&#039;s payment culture. That is why we introduced legislation giving suppliers a statutory right to claim interest on late paid bills. The Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 provides a useful tool for companies suffering from late payment to use &#039;if they wish&#039; to claim compensation and interest on late debts. The legislation sets a default period of 30 days if there is no other agreed credit period. The default period does not constitute a statutory credit period and therefore its strict application cannot be enforced.

<p>
<a name="50713w08.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_47">The interest rate, at 8 per cent. over the Bank of England base lending, rate is the highest in Europe for late payment legislation. In comparison the EC directive

on late payment sets a rate of 7 per cent. over the ECB rate. The legislation also allows for a compensation amount up to &#163;100 to be claimed in addition to the interest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50713w08.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_48">In a recent survey the Credit Management Research Centre of Leeds university found that overall, 62 per cent. of firms reported that they do specify their rights to customers under the late payment legislation and that 75 per cent. of large firms are more likely to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50713w08.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_49">The Government want more companies to agree credit terms and define payment periods up front, using the legislation as a backup measure to their normal trading relationship.

<sup>(5)</sup> Guide to quality: The Coefficient of Variation (CV) is given to indicate the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the better the quality. Figures that have a CV value greater than 20 per cent. are considered to be unreliable. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV, e.g. for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>

<sup>(6)</sup> In 2004 a number of supplementary surveys were introduced to improve the coverage of ASHE. Data is presented for 2004 both including and excluding these supplementary surveys. The data excluding supplementary surveys enables a direct comparison to 2003.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE) carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a 1 per cent. sample of all employees.<br>

2. The ASHE replaces the New Earnings Survey (NES) from October 2004. The main difference between the ASHE and NES being that estimates are weighted to population totals from the Labour Force Survey.<br>

3. Average gross weekly earnings for adult full-time employees whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence.<br>

 The Financial Ombudsman Service (FOS) is an independent body that adjudicates consumer complaints against FSA authorised firms.

<sup>(9)</sup> Guide to quality: The Coefficient of Variation (CV) is given to indicate the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV, e.g. for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent., we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>

 Notes:<br>

1. The Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, (ASHE), carried out in April of each year, is the most comprehensive source of earnings information in the United Kingdom. It is a 1 per cent. sample of all employees.<br>

2. The ASHE replaces the New Earnings Survey (NES) from October 2004. The main difference between the ASHE and NES being that estimates are weighted to population totals from the Labour Force Survey.<br>

3. Average gross weekly earnings for adult full-time employees whose pay for the survey period was not affected by absence.<br>

 A proportion of Drug Treatment Testing Orders (DTTO)/Drug Rehabilitation Requirement (DRR) funding is not specifically allocated to cover the costs of offenders referred to non-governmental voluntary bodies. Funding for DTTO/DRR treatment and testing in England is allocated via the Pooled Treatment Budget to local Drug Action Teams (DATs) who decide what treatment and testing to commission in their locality and from what sources. Different arrangements exist in Wales where areas have responsibility for commissioning DTTO/DRR treatment and testing provision locally from their probation funding allocations. Information about the cost per capita of offenders on DTTOs/DRRs referred to non-governmental voluntary bodies is not available centrally and could be collected only at a disproportionate cost.

 There are three early release schemes: the Home Detention Curfew Scheme, the Early Removal Scheme for foreign national prisoners subject to deportation and parole for prisoners serving a determinate sentence of four years and over. There are no plans to abolish the Home Detention Curfew Scheme or the Early Removal Scheme. Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 2003, offenders are sentenced according to the risk they present to the public. Sexual and violent offenders who present a significant risk will receive an extended sentence, under which the entire custodial period set by the court may be spent in prison if the Parole Board believes it is necessary: or an inter-determinate sentence, under which the offender must spend a minimum period of time in prison, and can be kept in prison indefinitely if the Parole Board believes it is necessary. Other offenders, who do not present this risk, are released on licence halfway through the sentence. Offenders must now remain on licence until the end of sentence, under reforms brought in under the Act.

<a name="stpa_97">Under the current law the provisions governing claims for trespass against the person mean that a claim for child abuse must be brought within six years of the date on which the cause of action arose, although this period will not start to run until the child reaches the age of majority. Under the proposals in the Law Commission&#039;s 2001 report Limitation of Actions&quot;, a claim in relation to child abuse would have to be brought within a period of three years from the date on which a claimant knew (or ought reasonably to have known) the facts giving rise to the cause of action, the identity of the defendant, and that any injury, loss or damage was significant. The court would have a discretion to disapply this limitation period if it considered that it would be unjust not to allow the claim to proceed. In July 2002, the Government announced their acceptance in principle of the Law Commission&#039;s recommendations subject to further consideration of certain aspects. Legislation will be introduced to implement those recommendations which are accepted when an opportunity arises.

<i>[holding answer 13 June 2005]:</i> Parenting is strongly relevant to juvenile antisocial and criminal behaviour and can be associated with increased risk or it can be a factor which protects children and young people from being involved in such behaviour. There is evidence, however, particularly from the United States, that parenting interventions which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Jul 2005 : Column 1095W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
include the improvement of parenting skills can be effective in reducing antisocial and criminal behaviour.
 An independent evaluation of the Youth Justice Board&#039;s parenting programme published in 2002 found that most parents valued the parenting programmes they had undertaken and wished they had received such support earlier. The study observed a reduction in offending but the lack of a comparison group meant that this could not be attributed to parenting programmes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50713w19.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_101">Youth Offending Teams have adapted programmes underpinned by evidence of effectiveness and some have developed their own programmes based on such evidence. Since 2002 the Youth Justice Board has introduced an effective practice quality assurance review process as part of a management system to improve the quality and volume of parenting interventions being delivered by Youth Offending Teams.

 The importance of physical education in prisons is well recognised. All prisons are required to deliver PE that meets the need of the regime, supports the delivery of education and vocational training, contributes to the resettlement of prisoners and delivers programmes that have been specifically developed to support offending behaviour interventions. The percentage, balance and contents that each PE programme contains will depend upon national and local needs. In 2004&#150;05 some 7.9 million hours of PE were delivered within prisons in the public sector. The total number of hours achieved in contracted establishments is not centrally held, although all prisoners in contracted prisons are offered the opportunity to undertake PE on a frequent basis.

 Local probation boards have a statutory duty to work with victims of sexual or violent offences where the offender receives a custodial sentence of 12 months or more. Victims are provided with a single point of contact with the Probation Service, through Victim Liaison Officers (VLOs), from whom they can receive information and make representations about key stages in an offender&#039;s sentence, such as temporary leave and release on licence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50713w21.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_115">When an offender is being considered for release on temporary licence, a prison governor will seek information from the supervising probation officer about appropriate licence conditions.

<a name="50713w21.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_116">Prior to the offender&#039;s conditional release, the supervising probation officer, having taken into account the victim&#039;s representations, may recommend that conditions be imposed forbidding contact with the victim, members of the victim&#039;s family or other named individuals, or may prevent the offender entering a specified geographical area.

During the period of the licence, the VLO will maintain contact with victims and their families. If, after offenders have been released, victims have concerns about offenders breaching conditions not to contact them or entering an exclusion zone, they should inform the VLO. The VLO will, in turn, notify the offender&#039;s supervising officer of this breach and the offender may either be warned about his/her behaviour or recalled to custody.

<a name="stpa_118">Once statutory supervision of an offender ends, the conditions put in place to protect victims will no longer apply.

 We have been working with the Home Office to identify areas where the Identity cards Scheme could provide business benefits. On 28 June 2005, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary placed in the Library a paper containing the latest estimates of benefits of the Identity Cards Scheme which shows that the benefits outweigh the costs once the scheme is fully operational. The cost of equipping premises will depend on the nature of the use of the Identity Cards Scheme and the type of identity check(s) necessary to deliver the business benefits. In some cases, benefits could be realised without the use of card readers and the cost of installing any readers needs to be considered alongside future plans to refresh or upgrade IT systems. As the design of the scheme matures, during and after the procurement exercise, so will our understanding of where the scheme will be of most benefit which will allow us to further refine our estimates of costs and benefits.

 The Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) will give assistance not compensation to people whose defined benefit occupational pension schemes started to wind up underfunded, with insolvent employers, before the start of the Pension Protection Fund. The aim is not to replace all members&#039; losses, but to give significant help to those most seriously affected, and the Government believe that its commitment of &#163;400 million of public funds over 20 years is an appropriate provision for that. The &#163;400 million figure reflects information available, at the time of the original announcement on FAS in May 2004, about the extent of relevant pension scheme failures. It also reflects a judgment on what it was reasonable to provide from public funds.

The embargo prohibits the transfer of arms to any part of DRC, subject to certain exemptions for humanitarian activities and for official DRC and UN troops. It also provides for a travel ban and assets freeze on individuals who violate the embargo.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

3. Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

4. Not known&quot;&#151;records from which data compiled do not clearly indicate the sex of the patient.<br>

<p><a name="st_259"><a name="50713w28.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 The needs of older people with mental health problems are the focus of a standard in the national service framework for older people. Where an older person has severe mental illness due to a psychotic illness, he or she will require the packages of care set out in the national service framework (NSF) for mental health, and the same standards should apply as for working age adults. Non-drug treatments such as psychological therapies are listed among the range of effective interventions for people with mental health problems in both the NSF for mental health and for older people.

<p>
<a name="50713w28.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_150">The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) regularly considers the use of non-drug treatments in the development of clinical guidelines for the treatment of a range of mental health problems such as depression and dementia.

<a name="50713w28.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_151">The NSFs for mental health and older people include standards on mental health promotion, which requires health and social services to promote mental health for all and combat discrimination against individuals and groups with mental health problems, and promote their social inclusion.

Notes:<br>

1. The Department collects primary care trust expenditure information on national health service and non NHS staff. The table shows the total expenditure on the occupational categories requested.<br>

2. Southend PCT was created on 1 April 2000. Therefore, expenditure cannot be shown from 1997&#150;98 until this date.<br>

3. The table contains the relevant information for 2000&#150;01 to 2003&#150;04, which is the latest available.<br>

4. Expenditure in the first year is nil or lower than in later years. This is due to the fact that the PCT was setting up services.<br>
