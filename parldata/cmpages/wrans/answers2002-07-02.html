<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority's Strategic Plan sets out priorities for development of the national rail network. In addition to national strategic priorities it includes increased funding for the Rail Passenger Partnership scheme, which is available to support local schemes. It is for local authorities to promote, through the Local Transport Plan process, the public transport modes best suited to their area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Work is under way on the review of bus subsidies, including fuel duty rebate, announced in the April Budget. We will take this forward over the coming months. It will build on ongoing work by the Commission for Integrated Transport, due to conclude in the autumn, and other related studies. It will also invite views from other interested bodies.

<a name="20702w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Over 320 community transport organisations have already applied for eligibility to receive fuel duty rebate. Eligible organisations will be making their first claims for payment this autumn. This funding will enable the improvement and expansion of services which have an important role in improving accessibility and combating social exclusion.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department has an extensive programme of road safety research covering a wide range of topics including development and evaluation of a variety of road humps and traffic calming works designed to reduce road accidents and encourage improved driving styles. Full details of current research and summaries of results of completed research are provided in a Road Safety Research Compendium, which is available on the Department's website and in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="20702w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Pike: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has to change the policy in relation to the use of speed limit repeater signs; and if he will make a statement.  [65781]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Local authorities are required to sign all speed limits where the speed limit has been created by way of a speed limit order. The exemptions are where the road is a restricted road (30mph indicated by a system of street lighting) where repeater signs are strictly prohibited, or on roads where the national speed limit applies.
<P>

<a name="20702w01.html_para4">However, we are looking at signing as part of the overall package on developing improved speed management. The issue of speed limit repeater signs will form part of our considerations.
<P>
<P>

<a name="20702w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Visibility rules for those areas participating in the safety camera netting off scheme were announced on 3 December 2001. These state that fixed site camera housings should be clearly signed and made visible by being painted or marked in yellow. Mobile enforcement units should also be clearly marked and visible to drivers. Areas currently outside the netting off scheme would need to comply with all the visibility requirements as a condition of joining.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Trespass and vandalism is a serious problem for the railways.
<P>

<a name="20702w01.html_para5">It is very disappointing that over half of all train incidents are due to vandalism. The Government are pleased that all sections of the rail industry recently came together in the National Route Crime Group to examine and promote ways of tackling trespass and vandalism on the railways.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what his assessment is of the impact on congestion of children being driven to school.  [63730]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 16 per cent. of cars on urban roads at 8.50 am in term time in 1998&#150;2000 were taking children to school. This is a reduction from 20 per cent. in 1995&#150;97. We have asked local authorities to include strategies for further reductions in their local transport plans and have increased funding for associated measures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 None. I understand that the Scottish Executive is working with the promoting authorities for the scheme to try to find the way forward. Signal design and engineering resources remain at a premium within the rail industry although Railtrack and the Strategic Rail Authority are taking steps to address the shortage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 We are currently finalising a series of regional consultation documents on airports and air services, between them covering the whole of the UK, which we intend to publish shortly. These consultation documents include an assessment of current airport capacity to meet demand for air travel up to 2030, and identify the capacity enhancements which might be required over that period under a range of policy scenarios.

19. <a name="20702w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Baron: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the trends in train punctuality over the last five years.  [63733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Between 1997 and 2000 the rolling annual average Public Performance Measure (PPM), which measures punctuality and reliability, slowly declined from about 90 per cent. to 86 per cent. as the number of train kilometres ran (passengers and freight) increased by some 20 per cent. Punctuality and reliability fell sharply after Hatfield due, in large part, to the temporary speed restrictions imposed to deal with gauge corner cracking and other rail defects. The rolling annual average PPM fell to 75 per cent. though it is now rising. The Strategic Rail Authority is working with the rail industry to achieve substantial, lasting improvements in performance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is a primary objective for the Strategic Rail Authority to work with the rail industry to achieve substantial lasting improvements in performance. &#163;400 million has been allocated to a new Rail Performance Fund set up to co-invest with rail companies in short-term schemes to improve reliability for passengers.

<P>
<a name="20702w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The UK Government is keen to liberalise the UK-US Air Services Agreement as we would like consumers to benefit from increased competition and airlines to benefit from improved access to the world's largest market. But that competition has to be on fair terms. We are currently reviewing a range of options that are open to us.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w02.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Our 10-Year Plan reflects our commitment to light rail in major cities. However, whether light rail offers the most appropriate and cost- effective response to local transport needs is a matter, in the first instance, for the local authorities concerned, to consider while formulating and reviewing their Local Transport Plans. Thereafter, any light rail scheme or other major transport project would need to undergo rigorous appraisal, and examination under any relevant statutory procedures, before funding approval could be considered.

 My Department's guidance to local authorities on Local Transport Plans covers many of these matters.

<a name="20702w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The negotiation of the PPP contracts is a matter for London Underground. However, I understand that, in line with guidance from the Office of Government Commerce, preferred bidder decisions were taken at the time they were because it was judged that the advantages to be gained from maintaining competitive tension were outweighed by the disadvantages of higher procurement costs and an increased risk of bids being withdrawn.

<a name="20702w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In line with the provisions of the GLA Act 1999, the Secretary of State for Transport intends to appoint an independent arbiter. At periodic reviews, the arbiter has the power to set prices at a level appropriate for an economic and efficient infrastructure company. Prices set by the arbiter at these reviews could be either higher or lower than those currently expected. At this stage, it is not possible to say either by how much or in which direction they might vary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Under our plans for modernising the London Underground, private sector infrastructure companies will carry out an investment and maintenance programme that is expected to amount to at least &#163;16 billion over the first 15 years of the contracts. This will be funded through a combination of private finance and payments from London Underground. The payments London Underground make will vary in line with the level of performance the infrastructure companies deliver. In total, we expect some &#163;6.2 billion in private finance to be raised in the first 15 years.
<P>

<a name="20702w04.html_para3">The Government will not guarantee any private sector finance. However, the Secretary of State does intend to issue a letter of comfort in relation to the London Underground PPPs.

 <i>[holding answer 1 July 2002]:</i> The use of seat belts in buses for non-urban operation is estimated by the Department to reduce fatal and serious injuries to seated passengers by 30&#150;40 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20702w04.html_para6">The Department has made no such assessment on the fitting of seat belts to trains. However, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), which is responsible for monitoring and enforcing safety on the railways, advises that although the use of properly fitting seat belts could in certain circumstances protect passengers in a train accident, it is not persuaded that the fitting of seat belts in trains is a reasonably practicable safety precaution. While some passengers may use seat belts voluntarily, there would be little point in fitting them without reasonable expectation that they would be relatively widely used.

 There are no statutory screening tests for employees of transport companies.
<P>

<a name="20702w05.html_para0">The Government are aware that many transport operators already have strict policies that may include screening programmes.

<P>
<a name="20702w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Drug screening is already used by the majority of police forces who have trained officers in the techniques of drug recognition and tests of impairment. Devices that detect the presence of drugs chemically are being developed and tested by a number of commercial companies. If these prove successful and appropriate, they may be used to assist the police at the roadside. Under current legislation the police do not have the same power to test drivers at the roadside for possible drugs as they do for alcohol. It is the Government's intention to amend the legislation to enable this.

 Railtrack's duties in respect of asset maintenance are primarily those set out in its network licence, in particular Conditions 7 and 24. Railtrack also has duties set out in regulated track access agreements with train operating companies. Railtrack produced asset maintenance plans for civil engineering (track and structures) in 1998 and for signalling assets in 1999. These formed critical inputs to the Rail Regulator's periodic review of access charges which concluded in October 2000. Railtrack also must produce a Network Management Statement (NMS) annually, in compliance with Condition 7 of its network licence. The NMS sets out how the company will manage the operation, efficiency and capability of its assets to meet the reasonable requirements of its customers.

 The Transport Research Laboratory (TRL) monitored trials on the effectiveness of variable speed limits outside schools. Variable message signs were installed outside schools that reduced the speed limit typically one hour around school arrival and leaving times. The results showed very little reduction in vehicle speeds and the report concluded that as a speed reducing feature they were ineffective.

Figures for 2001 are not yet available. Stages include all travel by bicycle but trips only include those where cycling was the main mode of travel. Averages are taken over all the population living in households, not just cyclists. The volatility of the single year figures is likely to be a result of the relatively small sample sizes and the geographical clustering of the sample. Cycling patterns over individual years are also very dependent on the weather. <P>

 The Department has not funded any cycle lanes in the last four years. Since December 1999 local transport capital allocations have been provided to English local authorities outside London through the local transport plan system. Apart from major local transport schemes (those with a gross cost exceeding &#163;5 million) funding is allocated in the form of a single block allocation the use of which is at the authorities discretion. Such funds can be used to implement cycle lanes but it is for authorities to decide their local priorities.

 This information is not held centrally. Local cycling strategies contain plans for up to 4,300 km of new cycle routes in England by 2005, but it is for individual local traffic authorities to monitor and hold the details of cycle lane provision in the area they control.

<a name="20702w09.html_para3">The decision on retrofitting existing aircraft is considered carefully against a number of factors, such as the type's remaining in-service life, flight safety record, cost and operational considerations. As a result of such considerations, a decision was taken (before the Mull of Kintyre accident) to install an accident data recorder and a cockpit voice recorder, as part of the helicopter health and usage monitoring system modification. This modification has now been installed in the entire in-service Chinook fleet.

 The Defence Electronic Commerce Services (DECS) Public Private Partnership (PPP) provides an electronic portal and associated infrastructure through which we can do business more effectively with our industrial partners. DECS hosts software applications, each of which are contracted individually. The first service, covering e-purchasing, has already enabled the DLO's Non-Project Procurement Office to generate savings of over &#163;350,000 and the savings for May 2002 alone were estimated to exceed &#163;100,000 when compared to the cost of transacting business in the traditional manner. We expect further savings to be generated as the DECS applications are developed and become more widely used across the Department. However, because DECS is designed to enable the defence acquisition community to operate more effectively, savings are not broken out and attributed directly to the system itself, or to management practise or inventory effectiveness.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if the RAND report on type 45 procurement options has been published; and if he will make a statement.  [66802]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The RAND report on acquisition options for the type 45 destroyer has now been published. A copy has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="20702w11.html_para0">RAND is a very experienced and influential organisation and has been conducting analyses of military shipbuilding, the industrial base, and competition issues for two decades. The Ministry of Defence commissioned RAND last year to carry out an independent study into a range of alternative procurement strategies for our future warship programme over the next 15&#150;20 years, with particular reference to options for type 45 destroyers. This followed receipt of an unsolicited bid from BAES Marine proposing that they should build all 12 ships planned for the class. This differed from the type 45 shipbuilding procurement strategy at that time which envisaged Vosper Thornycroft building one of the first batch of three ships and competing with BAES Marine for later batches.
<P>

<a name="20702w11.html_para1">Initial results from the study were used to help inform the MOD's decision to proceed with a revised procurement strategy for the type 45, in which each of the two shipbuilders, BAES Marine and Vosper Thornycroft, will be allocated modules (or blocks) of the ship to build. The revised strategy was announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 10 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 675&#150;85.
<P>

<a name="20702w11.html_para2">RAND's analysis indicated that there would be roughly an even chance that competitive production of the type 45 by two shipbuilders would yield about the same overall cost as sole-source production. Noting that a competitive strategy could lead to one shipbuilder building most of the ships, RAND also investigated alternative strategies to direct work to each of the two shipbuilders to keep both involved in building warships.




<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2002 : Column 234W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20702w11.html_para3">The RAND results also suggested that, for strategies that directed type 45 work to a number of shipyards, allocation of blocks is more cost-effective than the allocation of whole ships, because the work force increases productivity as it gains experience of building the same blocks. Such a strategy will also have the advantage of keeping both shipbuilders in the type 45 programme and potentially available to compete for future warship programmes. In addition, the revised strategy is likely to provide better value for money in the longer term than the unsolicited proposal, if it enables competition to be pursued on other warship programmes.
<P>

<a name="20702w11.html_para4">Following the type 45 decision, RAND continued their study, taking a broader look at the foreseeable balance of demand and supply in the warship building sector, and the potential effects of different procurement approaches. The report does not make specific recommendations concerning procurement strategies for future programmes, although it has helped clarify issues regarding block production (which is likely to be employed for the future carrier). It also provides an indication of the size of work force that will be required to sustain the future programme.
<P>

<a name="20702w11.html_para5">RAND's work has already helped the MOD to arrive at a pragmatic solution for the type 45. The report will also provide a valuable source of information for further study of the warship building sector.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 7 March 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 474W, to my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, West (Mr. Bailey). The amphibious assault capability is currently provided by the Landing Platform Helicopter (LPH) HMS Ocean and four Landing Ships Logistic (LSL). Following a series of highly successful operational deployments, HMS Ocean will shortly enter a docking period to conduct essential maintenance and planned capability enhancement, and will be unavailable for tasking until the autumn. During this period the amphibious assault capability could, if required, be provided by HMS Ark Royal in the LPH role and other platforms as may be required.
<P>

<a name="20702w11.html_para6">In 2003, as well as HMS Ocean and four LSLs, the LPD replacement ship, HMS Albion, will become available to provide our amphibious assault capability. The new ship will be significantly more capable than her predecessor, HMS Fearless, able to deploy embarked forces much more quickly&#151;by air and by sea&#151;and will use new landing craft with 20 per cent. more landing capability and a Ro-Ro type configuration for rapid embarkation of vehicles.

 <i>[holding answer 1 July 2002]:</i> The threshold constitutes point 1 of the upper pay scale and all threshold payments made to teachers by maintained schools are fully reimbursed by the Department. The rate of subsequent progression along the upper pay scale is for schools to determine in the light of teacher performance and in accordance with the School Teachers Pay and Conditions Document. The Department is contributing a grant of &#163;90 million to schools in 2002&#150;03, largely to support such progression.
<P>

<a name="20702w11.html_para11">Progress along the leadership group pay scale in maintained schools is also by performance points awarded at the discretion of the governing body. Here, the Department is contributing a further grant worth 60 per cent. of the cost in 2002&#150;03 and schools are contributing 40 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20702w11.html_para12">The grants will support special schools in the same way that they do other maintained schools. The impact on their budgets will depend on the decisions taken by individual schools.

<P>

<a name="20702w12.html_para1">The CRB is striving hard to improve the situation. A recovery programme has been introduced, and the Bureau's current expectation is that, by August, the present backlog of applications will have been cleared, and the Bureau will be achieving its previously published service standards of providing 90 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures within three weeks, and 95 per cent. of Standard Disclosures within one week.

<a name="20702w12.html_para2">My Department has already put in place contingency arrangements with the CRB. Under those arrangements, CRB staff are trawling the backlog of applications, and checking new applications, to identify those in respect of teachers and other key staff for schools. For those applications the CRB is performing checks of my Departments List 99. If that check is satisfactory the employer or agency will be able to appoint the person provisionally. The full criminal record and police check will be performed and the relevant Disclosure issued by the CRB as soon as possible after that. Those interim arrangements will stay in place until the CRB is fully up to date and meeting its performance standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to her answer, Ref 38091, of 5 March 2002, if she will amalgamate information for performance indicators in higher education in the UK to allow comparison to be made of the socio-economic background of students entering all high ranking universities with those entering all other universities.

 The entry requirements of higher education institutions will vary from course to course and from year to year. Nevertheless, I have set out data which shows the Performance Indicators for the entry of young people by social class to undergraduate courses. The Government introduced aspirational funding for high ranking universities to support their efforts to recruit more young people from state schools. Institutions which currently receive this funding are listed first, followed by other institutions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what schemes the Government have introduced since May 1997 to promote energy conservation and energy efficiency within the services sector; and what their impact has been on energy consumption per square metre within <i>(a)</i> commercial, <i>(b)</i> retail and <i>(c)</i> Government offices.  [63373]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government has introduced a wide range of measures to encourage energy efficiency in all sectors of the economy, including the commercial, retail and public sectors, which includes the Government Estate. The Climate Change Levy was introduced in April 2001 to encourage the more efficient use of energy. As part of the Climate Change Levy package, an Enhanced Capital Allowance scheme was introduced to provide fiscal incentives for businesses to invest in energy efficient technologies. The Carbon Trust was also set up to encourage business and the public sector to take up low carbon and energy efficient savings and measures.
<P>

<a name="20702w13.html_para7">The Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme provides free information and advice to these sectors. Since 1997, it has been delivering targeted energy efficiency briefings to boardrooms in the retail sector to raise awareness of energy efficiency, which has had a positive response. The Programme has also concentrated on providing groups within the commercial office sector with information on the business benefits of taking up energy efficiency measures.
<P>

<a name="20702w13.html_para8">The Government Estate has had energy efficiency targets since 1990&#150;91. We introduced a new 1 per cent. per year greenhouse gas reduction target in 2000&#150;01, which will be reported on later this year. We are also developing new energy efficiency targets for the Government Estate, based on an assessment of the Estate's performance against national standards.

<P>

<a name="20702w13.html_para9">The Best Practice Programme estimates its impact on annual energy efficiency improvements for the commercial and retail sectors. Actual consumption and floor space data are not collected on an annual basis, but for calendar years 1998&#150;2000, total energy efficiency improvements stimulated by the Programme are estimated to have been 7 per cent. for the retail sector and 6 per cent. for the commercial sector.

<a name="20702w13.html_para10">Annual consumption and floor space data are collected for the central Government Estate (excluding Ministry of Defence) to monitor performance against the Estate's energy efficiency target. Energy consumption in the Government Estate per square metre fell by 6 per cent. between 1997&#150;98 and 1999&#150;2000. Since this figure is collected on a different basis from the figures quoted above for the retail and commercial sectors, it cannot be directly compared.

 There are no trial sites of GM plants in the UK for the production of vaccines under the deliberate release regulations. However, my Department is funding one research project which seeks to produce transgenic plants that express GM antibodies, which will provide protection against E.coli O157:H7 when ingested by livestock. If effective this would have the potential to reduce the level of E.coli O157 in livestock and hence reduce the risk of zoonotic transmission. The total cost of this project over three years and nine months is &#163;350k.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures the Government are taking to protect sites of special scientific interest from development.  [64708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In England, Planning Policy Guidance note 9 (PPG9) advises local authorities on nature conservation issues, including the importance of sites of special scientific interest (SSSIs) and how they are to be treated in Local Plans and the planning framework. Planning authorities are required to consult English Nature before granting permission for development in, around or likely to affect SSSIs and to consider using their powers to impose conditions where necessary to avoid any damage to sites. Where a planning authority proposes to grant consent despite advice from English Nature to the effect that adverse impacts are likely to arise, the authority must inform English Nature so that it can consider whether to ask the Deputy Prime Minister to call in the application.
<P>

<a name="20702w14.html_para3">Improved measures to protect SSSIs have been taken by amendments to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, introduced in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. These concern both owners and occupiers and also public authorities in the exercise of their functions. Additional international nature conservation designations bring further levels of protection.
<P>

<a name="20702w14.html_para4">The Government indicated in the Green Paper&#151;"Planning: delivering a fundamental change"&#151;that it intended to review all PPGs. The review of PPG9 will enable it to be updated to reflect the recent legislative changes.
<P>

<a name="20702w14.html_para5">In Wales, policy on planning and nature conservation is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the National Assembly.

[64308]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The current EC directive on packaging and packaging waste is fully implemented by the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) and the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations 1998. A revision to the directive has been proposed. When this is finalised it is expected that it will be fully implemented in the UK through amendments to the existing regulations. Compliance with these regulations is monitored by the Environment Agencies. The new directive is expected to include higher targets for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. As targets increase it will be necessary to recover more packaging material from the household waste stream, and we would therefore expect businesses and local authorities to work together closely to ensure that adequate household collection systems are set up.

<a name="20702w16.html_para0">At their meeting in Halifax, G7 Finance Ministers noted the World bank's Education Action Plan and strongly endorsed the expeditious implementation of a plan focused on programme quality and measurable results. They pledged that, "each of us in turn will work to support the 'Education for All' goals with countries that have credible education plans and strong policy commitments in place. We urge other donor Governments and the multilateral development banks to join us".

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w16.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I suspended this project in May 2000 as it was no longer appropriate given the turbulent political situation and clear evidence of misuse of the vehicles for political ends. The Government of Zimbabwe placed the procurement contract directly with Land Rover Exports Ltd. The Crown Agents were not involved in the contract, but administered the grant account on behalf of the Zimbabwe Government.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w16.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department has not received any representation since 1998 regarding the amount of GDP Pakistan spent on arms imports in general. DFID is working with the World bank and IMF to track Pakistan's reform programme, including the pattern of fiscal expenditure. Pakistan's defence budget as a percent of GDP has been broadly stable around 4 per cent. over recent years. However, Pakistan's intention to reduce defence spending is under threat given the current stand-off with India.
<P>

<a name="20702w16.html_para1">The total value of UK standard individual export licences (SIEL) applications for which licences were issued in 1999 and 2000 was &#163;11.5 million and &#163;6 million respectively. By contrast, Pakistan's budget defence expenditure between 2000&#150;01 was approximately &#163;1.6 billion.

By September this year there will be 142 specialist sports colleges supporting 742 SSCos and 3,576 primary link teachers. SSCOs will be key in delivering the entitlement for all 5 to 16-year-olds to two hours a week of high quality school sport and physical education within and beyond the curriculum.

 <i>[holding answer 1 July 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's announcement on 13 May of a programme of modernisation and radical change followed a full day seminar in October 2001, 



<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2002 : Column 262W</I><P>
discussion at the Tourism Summit of Ministers in March 2002 and a Tourism Forum meeting in April 2002. In addition, there has been close consultation with Alan Britten (chairman of the English Tourism Council) and with chairs of regional development agencies as well as informal discussion with many people in the tourism industry over the last year.
<P>

<a name="20702w18.html_para0">Since that announcement, good progress has been made in developing plans for the domestic marketing of English tourism. I have chaired two meetings of a small steering group, comprising senior representatives of the English Tourism Council, British Tourist Authority, Tourism Alliance, regional development agencies, regional tourist boards, Local Government Association and the private sector. We have considered a model for public-private coalition for domestic marketing and made an initial assessment of priorities for strategic delivery of other support to the industry, including considering the roles to be played by the regional development agencies, regional tourist boards and local government.
<P>

<a name="20702w18.html_para1">In due course, we will make a further statement on the marketing of English tourism within the UK, a role which is not currently carried out at national level. However, the events of 2001 illustrated its huge potential and we intend to respond to that opportunity, since it will increase the long-term growth potential and sustainability of the industry. The industry is fully in support of this strategic change and key areas that the new organisation (a radically reformed English Tourism Council) is likely to consider are: the development of a national marketing strategy (including e-tourism and the usefulness and appropriateness of websites such as visitengland.org.uk); thematic marketing of England within the UK along the lines of what the British Tourist Authority does successfully abroad; engagement of the private sector (including match funding); and more efficient coordination of the huge expenditure on tourism marketing that already takes place at regional, sub-regional and local level.
<P>

<a name="20702w18.html_para2">The English Tourism Council has worked effectively to take forward much of what was set out in the Government's 1999 strategy, Tomorrow's Tourism; it has also engaged the regional tourist boards to work efficiently together, including piloting new ideas and disseminating the results of those projects. I am pleased with this progress and we now want to increase the emphasis on delivery and results. The regional development agencies are best placed, working in partnership with the regional tourist boards, to do much of this. Accordingly, we will radically change the English Tourism Council into a body that focuses on marketing and associated activities such as e-tourism and relevant research. We have not yet decided on any transfer of functions to the bodies referred to in the question and no changes are planned to visitengland.org.uk. We will make a fuller announcement once we have completed our deliberations.

The strategy aims to: encourage good citizenship among young people; reduce the number of violent crimes; reduce the level of property crime; reduce the impact of drugs and alcohol and make Newport a safer place. Change will also be evinced by the Welsh Assembly Government's own social inclusion programme, which includes the Communities First initiative.

<a name="20702w19.html_para6">The general factors taken into account in assessing the applications for licences to conduct the research are as set out in the Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and in the Chief Inspector's paper on the cost/benefit assessment published as part of the Animal Procedures Committee annual report of 1997 (both are available in the Library). In determining whether and on what terms to grant a project licence, section 5 (4) of the 1986 Act requires that the likely adverse effect on the animals concerned must be weighed against the benefit likely to accrue as a result of the programme specified in the licence.
<P>

<a name="20702w19.html_para7">The severity bands assigned were determined according to the principles set out in the relevant sections of the Home Office Guidance on the Operation of the 1986 Act. The assessment of the severity band for the project as a whole reflects the number of animals used on each protocol and actual suffering likely to be caused as result. It is based on the overall level of cumulative suffering to be experienced by each animal, not just the worst possible case. It takes into account the proportion of animals expected to reach the severity limit of the protocol and the duration of the exposure to that severity limit, the nature and intensity of the adverse effects, and the actions taken to relieve the suffering. Professional judgment must be applied by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate (ASPI) on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="20702w19.html_para8">Under the provisions of the 1986 Act, animals can only be used in scientific procedures when there is no alternative way to achieve the objective concerned, such as using computer models, cell cultures and other in vitro methods. This condition applies to the research conducted at Cambridge university and (ASPI) challenged, verified and advised this is the case. ASPI is composed of medical and veterinary graduates with a wide range of experience and expertise in the biomedical sciences, including research methods not involving the use of living animals.

 The NIO's Public Service Agreement (PSA) was first published in October 2000 to cover the three-year period 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04. As the PSA targets effectively embrace virtually all of our departmental activities, the cost of seeking to meet our PSA objectives is essentially the same as our total departmental expenditure. For 2001&#150;02 (the first year of our PSA) this is currently estimated at &#163;1.052 billion.

 The Nuba Mountains ceasefire agreement is working well. Both the Government of Sudan and the SPLM/A have participated fully in the Joint Military Commission. This has resulted in redeployment of Government troops out of the relevant sectors and of the SPLM/A forces into agreed positions. Humanitarian assistance is being delivered to a region to which access had been denied for a considerable period. The population of the area now enjoys freedom of movement and the ability to cultivate on a wider scale than has proved possible in recent years. The agreement runs out next month.

 On 19&#150;20 June, a senior official from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office led a UK delegation at the first formal UK/Turkey Human Rights Dialogue, in Ankara. There was a frank and constructive discussion of the human rights situation in Turkey, the measures recently taken to improve it and what remains to be done to ensure the rights of all, including the Kurds.

 The Berlin European Council (March 1999) set a ceiling of 35 billion euro in payments for new member states for 2004&#150;06. Based on its proposals for phasing in EU policies to new member states, the Commission estimates the cost to the EU budget of up to ten new member states acceding in 2004 to be 28 billion euro for the period 2004&#150;06. This can be financed well within the ceiling on Own Resources (which will remain at 1.27 per cent. of GNP). The Commission's proposals remain the subject of negotiation and no estimate of the cost for individual applicants is given. The Government's view is that the final package must respect the overall financial ceilings agreed at Berlin.

The arrangements must also ensure that GCHQ and SIS do not take any action to further the interests of any United Kingdom political party. I am satisfied that the arrangements are in place to meet those requirements.

 A review of certain rules and procedures for the Exhibitions and Seminars Abroad (SESA) Scheme was concluded in March this year. This put forward a number of options for change which were subsequently refined into a set of recommendations. A wider ranging review of the needs of British Trade International's customers is currently under way. This is a strategic review to develop a simpler, more coherent and effective portfolio of services and it is sensible that the outcome of the work on SESA should now feed into this wider review. We shall not therefore be making significant changes to the SESA terms and conditions at this time, although one change is being made. This is the removal of the requirement for a minimum group size when groups of companies attend events with SESA support and therefore the removal of the need for a separate "niche" category for support.

The total is expected to increase by about 25,000 per year over the next two years, prompted by the Government grants available, and the fact that low-cost LPG fuel is now available in all areas of the country.
<P>

<a name="20702w23.html_para9">All vehicles used on public roads in the UK have to be licensed annually. Generally such licensing includes payment of a duty of excise (Vehicle Excise Duty) on the licence but a number of vehicles are exempt from payment of duty. All of the vehicles included in the table as PLG, buses, goods, and special vehicles are subject to payment of VED. The category "other vehicles" includes motorcycles and other miscellaneous vehicles.

It highlights the Government's employment strategy that seeks to ensure that the most help is given to those who face the greatest difficulty finding work. In this context, the plan covers policies such as the New Deal for Disabled People, which extend to blind and partially-sighted people, as well as other people with disabilities.

However, integrating into the labour market all those with a disadvantage will remain a priority for the UK and for Europe. Therefore, measures in this area are likely to be reported on in the next and future Employment Action Plans.

<a name="20702w24.html_para1">The Government believe that people should be able to make an informed choice when they plan their retirement, so that they have accumulated sufficient pension savings to provide the income they wish to receive. Our pension forecasting programme will help to achieve this by showing savers how much they can expect on retirement at state pension age.
<P>

<a name="20702w24.html_para2">The Government are also committed to active ageing. We are tackling age discrimination in employment, not least so that older people have increased opportunities to retain or find work, and are not forced into early retirement. Our Age Positive campaign promotes to employers the business benefits of an age-diverse work force, including the recruitment and retention of older workers. We are encouraging employers to adopt more flexible approaches to retirement for the benefits it can offer businesses and the increased choice and opportunities it offers individuals for a later more active retirement. The report 'Flexible Retirement&#151;a snapshot of large employers' initiatives', published on 17 June, showed that some larger companies are indeed adopting more flexible retirement policies. There are also signs nationally that approaches to early retirement have been changing, as each year for the last four years the employment rate of people aged 50 to state pension age has increased faster than the overall employment rate.

 Newly self-employed people who are liable to pay Class 2 National Insurance contributions are required by law to register with Inland Revenue "immediately" but this term was not further defined. Following public consultation, we have established a set time-limit for registration. At its introduction in January 2001 the modified requirement was advertised through the national, regional and ethnic press and on local radio stations. The requirement is clearly stated in all the Inland Revenue leaflets and guidance on starting up in business. Inland Revenue is evaluating the effectiveness of the new requirement and a report will be issued later this year. In 2001, the first year that the new requirement was in force, the number of self-employed people registering with Inland Revenue increased by 19 per cent. over the number registering in the year 2000.

Short-term concentrations (measured over 4 to 7 days) at all locations were low in comparison with concentrations that have been shown to produce irritation (see Table). Thresholds for sensory irritation in the majority of subjects are reported as 0.6&#150;1.2 milligrams per cubic metre for formaldehyde and the World Health Organisation guideline is 0.1 milligrams per cubic metre. The highest concentrations were observed at the traffic dominated site at London Marylebone Road and the industrial site at Hull. No indoor measurements were taken. My Department does not have plans for further measurements of aldehydes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20702w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 May 2002]:</i> The choice of new vaccine was made on the basis of advice from the scientific community and from across Government. The advice of experts under the auspices of a specially convened sub-group of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation was sought specifically in relation to strain type and vaccine efficacy. Their advice was that there was no significant difference between the two strains on scientific grounds. Vaccines based on both strains were considered to have been effective in the past, and both strains are expected to produce effective new vaccines for the future.
<P>

<a name="20702w27.html_para0">Though vaccines based upon both strains were used as part of the World Health Organisation's eradication campaign, there was a greater body of evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of the Lister strain vaccine than for the New York City board of health (NYCBH) strain. The Lister based smallpox vaccine, preferred by the UK Government, has been challenged in the field more often by the more severe form of smallpox (<i>variola major</i>) than the NYCBH strain.
<P>

<a name="20702w27.html_para1">A dual approach, using a different strain for UK vaccine to that preferred by the US Government, as in the past, is considered to offer the best scope for successful new vaccine production, and provides a fall back mechanism if difficulties arise with the production of either vaccine.

 Government policy on disclosure of interests by members of public bodies was set out in "Quangos&#151;opening the doors" (1998). This policy is reflected in model codes of practice issued by the Cabinet Office for adoption by these bodies. Bodies' codes require that board members should declare in a register for the purpose any personal or business interest which may, or may be perceived to, influence their judgment, and that the register should be kept up-to-date and open to the public. The codes also state that board members should not participate in the discussion or determination of matters in which they have an interest and should normally withdraw from the meeting if their interest is direct and pecuniary.

 The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) is responsible for monitoring the safety of medicines on the UK market, and has well-developed procedures in place for pharmacovigilance, enabling early identification and prompt action in relation to drug safety issues.
<P>

<a name="20702w28.html_para3">The yellow card scheme, introduced in 1964 after the thalidomide tragedy, has a world-wide reputation for effectiveness in detecting previously unidentified drug safety hazards. All newly introduced medicines are monitored intensively for at least two years, during which time the safety profile of the medicine is frequently reviewed to ensure that it is appropriately reflected in the product information for health professionals and patients. In addition to spontaneous reports of suspected adverse reactions, the MCA evaluates data on drug safety from a range of sources. In 1999, MCA acquired the general practice research database and its post-licensing division is now evaluating its potential in contributing to effective pharmacovigilance.

<a name="20702w28.html_para4">The capability for early action on emerging safety issues is reflected in the MCA's high level and operational targets. These measure performance in terms of the time taken to make newly received spontaneous adverse reaction reports available for review and analysis by pharmacovigilance assessors. MCA's performance against targets is published annually and in 2001&#150;02 all targets were met or exceeded, against a background of a 55 per cent. increase in spontaneous adverse reaction reports.

 A national survey of national health service provision, undertaken early in 2001, found that 114 NHS trusts provided nursery facilities for their staff. The Government recognise that there is a need to provide support for parents working in the NHS in order to be a good employer, to improve the working (and home) lives of staff, and to recruit, retain and return key staff. For this reason, we have made over &#163;70 million available for the NHS child care strategy, to develop an additional 150 further on-site nursery schemes by 2004. 60 new nursery schemes were funded last year and a further 30 have had funding allocated already this year. In addition, we expect all new build hospitals to include an on-site nursery in its plans.
<P>

<a name="20702w29.html_para5">We are expanding the NHS child care strategy to cover other forms of child care and to ensure that all staff groups are included. We have pledged additional funding for the NHS child care, building up to &#163;100 million, to do this.

<a name="20702w30.html_para8">And for coronary heart disease, work is in hand to standardise four existing data sets on paediatric cardiac care, acute myocardial infarction, adult surgery and angioplasty to ensure they are consistent and to develop a more comprehensive data set. The paediatric cardiac care and acute myocardial infarction data sets are being collected and used to monitor services. Collection of the adult surgery data started in April 2002 with the aim of having robust national comparative data on the clinical quality of care by 2004.

 Laser treatments to overcome problems caused by ophthalmic disease are available within all large ophthalmology units. Treatments such as capsulotomies following cataract extraction, photocoagulation and focal laser for diabetic retinopathy, and laser for macular disease are available within national health service hospitals. The NHS does not provide laser surgery to correct refractive errors, which can be successfully corrected by spectacles or contact lenses.

<P>
<a name="20702w31.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have accepted in full and implemented the recommendations of the independent pay review body for nursing staff for the last four years without staging pay awards. From April 2002 all nursing staff will have received an above inflation increase of at least 3.6 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20702w31.html_para1">Pay has increased across the board for all nurses employed in the national health service by at least 26 per cent. in cash terms since 1997.
<P>

<a name="20702w31.html_para2">The introduction of nurse consultant posts has extended career opportunities for senior nurses who wish to remain in clinical roles and provided the opportunity to earn salaries of over &#163;46,000.
<P>

<a name="20702w31.html_para3">We are working with unions, professional organisations and employers to introduce a new pay system that will offer nurses and other staff working in the NHS a more attractive career structure, fairer pay and consistent conditions of service.
<P>

<a name="20702w31.html_para4">The development of a child care strategy is a key element in improving working lives for staff in the NHS and plays a key role in the recruitment and retention of staff. Our child care strategy centres on providing good quality, accessible and affordable child care. The main focus of the strategy currently is the development of around 150 on-site nurseries with subsidised places. Funding available from April 2001 amounts to over &#163;70 million. Around a further 7,500 places will be created by 2004.

 The Department has a contract with GlaxoSmithKline to supply a fixed quantity of single vaccines for national health service use per year. These vaccines are owned by the Department. We use a private company (Farillon Ltd.) to store and distribute these vaccines to ensure that NHS needs are met. Any excess or remainder stock is made available for sale to private customers.
<P>

<a name="20702w31.html_para5">We have instructed Farillon to manage orders so that the excess of vaccine stock is available equitably to all private clinics.

<P>
<P><I>2 Jul 2002 : Column 312W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20702w31.html_para6">In Autumn 2000 all apples and pears supplied to the original national school fruit scheme pilots were from the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20702w31.html_para7">We do not have comprehensive data on the origin of fruit in the much larger number of pilot sites in autumn 2001. We did not begin to collect such data until the regional expansion of the national school fruit scheme that started in April 2002, since when nationally contracted suppliers have routinely been providing detailed information on the origin of fruit.
