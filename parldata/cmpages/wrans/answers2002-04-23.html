 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> Results of a five-year research programme, funded by NERC, DEFRA, the water industry and the Environment Agency, were published by the agency on 26 March. This followed on from an earlier programme of research, which demonstrated the presence of feminised roach in a number of UK rivers, an apparent relationship between severity of feminisation and proportion of treated sewage effluent in rivers, and implicated natural and synthetic steroids in effluent as the causal agents.




<P>
<P><I>23 Apr 2002 : Column 134W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20423w03.html_para4">The results of the second phase of research can be summarised as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The continued presence of feminised male roach in several UK rivers was confirmed and reported in a second species, the gudgeon, although to a lesser extent.
<P>
<BR>
In laboratory studies, severely feminised male roach produced fewer and less viable sperm than control fish. Consequently their fertility was reduced.
<P>
<BR>
The oestrogenic (feminising) components in treated effluents include natural and synthetic steroids and alkylphenol ethoxylates and their degradation products, which may act in combination.
<P>
<BR>
Natural steroids degrade rapidly in rivers, but synthetic steroids are more persistent. Some may adsorb on to suspended or bed sediments, although levels were below the limit of detection in field studies in two rivers.
<P>
<BR>
There does not appear to be a problem with feminised male fish in every UK catchment and it does not seem to be an issue in Scotland.

cultural activities, contested parish elections". The purpose of the indicator is to measure on a national basis the trend over time.
<P>

<a name="20423w04.html_para1">The indicator which was first reported on in April 2001 in the State of the Countryside report is still under development and we recognise that there are a number of short-comings in the data from which it has been compiled. For instance, the indicator does not reveal the extent to which smaller settlements and parishes are able to take up community activities in neighbouring parishes. Furthermore, communities in all sizes of parish may exhibit community vibrancy in other ways than those assessed through the Rural Services Survey.
<P>

<a name="20423w04.html_para2">The Countryside agency intends to look at the whole issue again, through consultation on the methodology, rather than amending individual classifications.

<a name="20423w04.html_para3">Differing views over individual classifications is inevitable but the Countryside agency would prefer to address these in a review of the indicator rather than on a case-by-case basis.

 <i>[holding answer 23 April 2002]:</i> The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs was created on 9 June 2001. The new Department brings together staff previously employed in parts of both DETR and the Home Office with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Robust data on staff in post in DEFRA were not available until recently. An assessment was undertaken on 15 March 2002 and the resulting data are included in the table. This position reflects the staff profile for permanent staff in the core-Department on that date.

<P>
<a name="20423w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 We are making good progress in tackling child poverty although we acknowledge that much still needs to be done. Full details of the measures taken, and the results achieved, can be found in the Government's annual report on tackling poverty. "Opportunity for All" and the Scottish Executive's annual Social Justice report, "A Scotland where everyone matters".
<P>

<a name="20423w06.html_para0">Tackling child poverty in Scotland requires action from both Government and the Scottish Executive. The "Opportunity for All" report highlights five headline indicators of child poverty: low income, worklessness, health inequalities, educational attainment and housing. Health, education and housing are devolved matters for the Executive. The Government have taken direct action in the areas it is responsible for. On income, for example, the working families tax credit benefits over 119,000 families in Scotland. And we are currently reforming the tax credits system, to improve it further. On worklessness, we have, for example, invested in the new deal: the new deal for lone parents has helped around 14,500 people into employment.
<P>

<a name="20423w06.html_para1">The Government have taken a number of other measures which help reduce child poverty including the national minimum wage; action on personal indebtedness and family-friendly employment measures to help people stay in work and meet family commitments. Tackling child poverty is, and will remain, one of our top priorities.

 The Millennium Development Goals have a deadline of 2015 in most cases.

Individual developing countries are being encouraged to set and monitor country-relevant interim targets within their poverty reduction strategies. DFID's PSAs/SDAs set targets based on the MDGs for the period up to 2006. Analysis of progress towards these targets is set out in DFID's Departmental Report 2002, which will be published on 24 April. Plans for the implementation of the Millennium Declaration are set out in the UN Secretary General's report "Road map towards the implementation of the UN Millennium Declaration". The UN will report annually on global progress and indicate whether we are on track to meet the goals. As well as setting development targets, the Millennium Declaration renews the commitment of member states to the fundamental principles of the UN, including freedom, equality, tolerance, human rights, peace and security and respect for the environment; and emphasises the needs of Africa and the need to strengthen the UN.

However, some Film Council board members are employed by, or are directors of, the three lottery film franchise companies&#151;DNA, the Film Consortium and Pathe Pictures Ltd. They may be credited by virtue of that role on relevant franchise films. Those titles have not been listed in the following table.

 The Digital Television Action Plan, posted on www.digitaltelevision.gov.uk on 20 December, sets out a series of actions for Government and stakeholders to promote digital television and to prepare for switchover. We began a consultation on 11 December 2001 seeking views on the basis on which we should plan the use of spectrum once analogue transmissions cease, including what level of coverage would be required by terrestrial television for public service broadcasting and for pay-tv services. The consultation closed on 5 April 2002 and we are considering the responses.

 I understand from the Independent Television Commission (ITC) that around 2,000 homes in north Devon may experience difficulty in receiving good quality analogue signals. However, the ITC also advise that, depending on the quality of individual aerial installations, reception is often possible in areas where signal strengths are low, though a degradation in picture quality may be noticeable.

 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> UK Sport is the lead agency for the Government's anti-doping programme. Its Chairman Sir Rodney Walker has met Mr. Paul Edwards and his advisers to hear his concerns regarding his life ban on participation in athletics. This resulted from a second positive drug test, which was the subject of an independent review of the evidence, a disciplinary hearing chaired by an independent QC and an appeal hearing also chaired by a QC. UK Sport are seeking further information and views from the parties concerned. It would not be appropriate for Ministers to intervene in individual doping cases.

 I have received a number of representations recently from hon. Members on behalf of their constituents and from performers of live music calling for the abolition of the exemption which provides for up to two musicians to perform live in public houses without a public entertainment licence. These include a number of similar letters sent to me as part of a campaign. I have also received representations arguing that all live music should be exempt from licensing, that some licence

<P><I>23 Apr 2002 : Column 154W</I><P>
fees are excessive, that some conditions attached by local authorities are disproportionate and that the current licensing regime deters spontaneous singing in public houses.
<P>

<a name="20423w08.html_para0">Our plans for the modernisation of the licensing regimes were set out clearly in the White Paper "Time for Reform" (Cm. 4696) published on 10 April 2000. We proposed that the current exemption from public entertainment licensing that allows two musicians to perform live in premises licensed for the sale of alcohol should end. This is because one or two live musicians using powerful microphones and amplifiers can make more noise and so generate more nuisance for local residents than three without. Alcohol and public entertainment licensing will be integrated into a single scheme. This would remove at a stroke a considerable amount of existing red tape and reduce the licensing costs which currently deter many venues from providing live music and dancing. The reforms will be implemented by means of primary legislation to be brought forward as soon as parliamentary time permits.

 The increase in publicly planned funding for higher education institutions in England in 2001&#150;02 over 2000&#150;01 is now estimated to be &#163;396 million, the difference being due mainly to the re-classification of planned expenditure to support widening participation in that year. The accounts for 2001&#150;02 are not yet closed and will not be finalised until November 2002.
<P>

<a name="20423w09.html_para2">For the subsequent two years the increases are now expected to be &#163;292 million and &#163;304 million respectively. The differences are due to provision of funding for the British Academy being made via the Higher Education Funding Council for England from 2002&#150;03, and this increase being offset by a further re-classification of planned expenditure for widening participation in those years. It is intended that these increases will be spent in the years for which they are allocated.

The aim is to reflect the population served by the NHS.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what changes the Budget of 17 April will make to the provision of education in Herefordshire.  [51649]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the Budget an additional &#163;85 million investment in 2002&#150;03 in school and college buildings in England. This means that every maintained school in England, including those in Herefordshire, will receive in 2002&#150;03 an additional allocation of about 20 per cent. of New Deal for Schools Devolved formula capital for schools. Details of changes to funding for education will be announced when the spending review has been completed in the summer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what provisions of race relations statutory provision apply to access to school places for children of asylum seekers.  [51801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 There are no specific statutory provisions that apply in respect of the access to school places for children of asylum seekers.
<P>

<a name="20423w10.html_para4">Section 17 of the Race Relations Act 1976 makes it unlawful for school admission authorities to discriminate against a person <i>(a)</i> in the terms that it offers to admit a child to the school, <i>(b)</i> by refusing or deliberately omitting to accept the application for the child's admission to the school as a pupil, or <i>(c)</i> where the child is a pupil at a school (i) in the way that the pupil is granted access to any benefits, facilities or services or by refusing or deliberately not allowing the pupil access to them or (ii) excluding them from the school or subjecting them to other detriment.
<P>

<a name="20423w10.html_para5">Section 18 of the same Act makes it unlawful for an LEA to perform any act which constitutes racial discrimination, not covered by section 17, when carrying out any of its functions under the education legislation.
<P>

<a name="20423w10.html_para6">These apply to all children, including those of asylum seekers.

 Only one proposal for a change of school category has been rejected by a School Organisation Committee since the change of category regulations were introduced in September 2000. Proposals published by the governing body of Olney Middle Community School, to become a Foundation School, were rejected by Milton Keynes School Organisation Committee in March this year. The Committee stated that their reason for rejection was that the proposals were not in the best interests of education in the area because they did not demonstrate how the change would support improving standards.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The percentages in column 1 are those shown for each LEA in the annual comparative table published by the Department on 29 June 2001, except in the cases of Halton and Westminster, whose figures have been revised in the light of subsequent information. (Subsequent information from two other LEAs does not affect the calculation of their delegation percentages rounded to the nearest 0.1 per cent.). As in the case of the annual comparative table, the Corporation of London and the Isles of Scilly have been omitted.<P>





2. The calculations underlying column 2 are based on the rounded percentages in column 1. As in column 1 and in the annual comparative table, delegated funding includes devolved Standards Fund grants, but not School Standards Grant. <P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much money was realised by each local education authority from the disposal of school playing fields in each of the past five years.  [51919]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The exact amount of money raised by each local education authority from the disposal of school playing fields is not known. In those cases where disposal has been approved, the disposal transaction, whether it is a sale, land exchange or the granting of a lease, might not yet be concluded. It is not possible, therefore, to say exactly what proceeds have been raised. Proceeds from the disposal of school playing fields can only be used to help improve sports and education facilities at maintained schools.
<P>

<a name="20423w12.html_para0">The table shows the proceeds that each local education authority expects to raise from approved applications to dispose of areas equal to, or larger than, a small sports pitch of 2000m <sup>2</sup>  suitable for use by the under-10s.

 Earlier this month we announced that Telford and Wrekin Council, Nottingham County Council, and the London borough of Lewisham had been awarded beacon status for their good practice on access and mobility. Aided by increased local transport plan funding, and the sharing of good practices, authorities can help to make our society more inclusive by improving access to work, healthcare, education, and other key services and facilities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessment he has made of the extent to which local authorities are meeting their obligations under the Road Traffic Reduction Acts 1997 and 1998.  [49410]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w13.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 It is only the 1997 Act that places an obligation on local authorities. Local authorities in England (outside London) submitted road traffic reduction reports as part of their full local transport plans in July 2000. Copies of these reports have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. In the Government's view the majority of the reports met local authorities' obligations under the Road Traffic Reduction Act 1997 in full.

 We are currently working with local government to develop options for the new grant distribution system.

We will then implement our decisions in time for the 2003&#150;04 local government finance settlement.

 S.I. 2001, No. 3335, did not introduce self-certification. Self-certification was introduced into the Building Regulations through S.I. 2002, No. 440. This recognises schemes for the self-certification of the installation of combustion appliances, replacement glazing and plumbing work.

competence within the industry; help tackle the problem of 'cowboy builders' by identifying reputable firms to consumers; and will start to assist local authorities with enforcement, as they can devote more resource to tackling those, who either wilfully or in ignorance, fail to comply with the Building Regulations.

<a name="20423w14.html_para2">The regulatory impact assessment we undertook prior to laying the regulations, identified that the financial benefit to firms of introducing self-certification would be &#163;104,685,000, taking into account the cost of joining the recognised schemes. These savings arise from firms not having to pay building control fees. Other savings, such as those that would arise from relief from the internal administrative expense and delay in complying with the procedural requirements of the Building Regulations, were not calculated. I understand that the schemes involved have experienced very considerable interest from potential members, and the savings are likely to be higher than the earlier conservative estimate.

The results of the consultation were favourable. We consulted again in 1999 with the document 'Taking Forward Self-Certification Under the Building Regulations'. The consultation went to 250 organisations and a list of these has been placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="20423w14.html_para4">I believe that self-certification is a very significant step forward for promoting competence in the construction industry, and providing rewards for those who voluntarily subscribe to schemes which are designed to protect society from the adverse effects of poor building work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions which of the services of his Department have not been reviewed under the Better Quality Services Initiative; and when they will be reviewed.  [50313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w15.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Better Quality Services (BQS) programme was launched in 1998 and adopted by the Cabinet Office in the Modernising Government White Paper of 1999 as a means of delivering continuous improvements in the quality and effectiveness of Government activities and services. It requires all Government Departments to review every activity and service over a five-year period starting in October 1999. The scheme covers all activities in Departments, agencies and executive non-departmental public bodies, and is similar in remit to the Best Value programme in local government.
<P>

<a name="20423w15.html_para0">The review of the Department's activities and services under the scheme started in 1999. The central Department has completed 12 reviews to date and others are on-going. There are still 53 activities and services to review. Our agencies and executive non-departmental public bodies have their own programmes of performance review.
<P>

<a name="20423w15.html_para1">Following an evaluation of the BQS scheme in September 2001, the management of the scheme by the Cabinet Office ceased. However, experience has shown that BQS is a useful management tool, particularly in examining central corporate management functions. Departments have therefore been encouraged not to discontinue its use simply as a result of central co-ordination ceasing, but to consider its use alongside other management tools, as appropriate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 4 March 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 84W, regarding rent and council tax arrears in England and Wales, for what reason his Department does not provide information on council tax arrears by local authority in England.  [50329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w15.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Department does not at present collect information from local authorities on the level of council tax arrears, and so individual figures are not available. National estimates of the level of council tax arrears are derived from the results of a voluntary survey that is carried out each year by the Institute of Public Finance. These estimates were given in my answer of 4 March.
<P>

<a name="20423w15.html_para2">The Department is giving active consideration to collecting this information for future years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 requires that where an applicant for a renovation grant is a tenant or owner occupier then he is subject to a prescribed means test. This test requires that if any such applicant is receiving voluntary help from a third party towards meeting general living expenses, such as food, clothing, fuel for heating and local taxes, then this support, other than the first &#163;20 of any such regular payment, is treated as part of an applicant's income for the purpose of the means test.
<P>

<a name="20423w16.html_para1">The Act also specifies that a tenant can only qualify for a renovation grant if he is required by the terms of his lease to carry out the relevant works. In these circumstances no regard is paid to the financial means of the property manager. Local authorities have discretion to decide the level of grant they should make available to a landlord but are required to have regard to the extent to which the landlord is able to charge a higher rent for the premises following the completion of works.

The principal purposes for which grants may be paid are for making a dwelling fit, putting a dwelling into reasonable repair, providing home insulation or heating facilities, providing satisfactory internal arrangements or conversions. Grants may also be made for the cost of radon remedial works.

 Many factors can cause rails to break. These are not only matters of the metallurgy, manufacture and maintenance of the rails themselves, but are also strongly influenced by the volumes of traffic, the design of the vehicles running over the track and the quality of maintenance of those vehicles. The industry's Wheel Rail Interface System Authority (WRISA) is investigating all aspects of this complex technical interaction.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2002]:</i> The Secretary of State has had full regard to the implications of the Community guidelines on state aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty as it relates to Railtrack in administration and any financial support to be provided to Network Rail if its bid for Railtrack plc is successful. The Government's guarantee of commercial borrowing by Railtrack plc is consistent with section 3.1, paragraph 23, subsections b and d of the Guidelines.

 With relation to oil, the MARPOL Convention has contained requirements for the segregation of ballast water from cargo oil in tankers constructed after 1983. Since August 1999 the seas around the UK and out to the west of Ireland have had Special Area status under the MARPOL Convention; this means a total prohibition on the discharge of any cargo-related oil which may be entrained with ballast water.

 Government support for local authorities' concessionary fares scheme is met through general grant. The Local Government Finance Settlement 2002&#150;03 increased general grant in the current financial year by 5 per cent. on a like for like basis. Local authorities are responsible for decisions on their spending priorities bearing in mind their statutory responsibilities and the wishes of their electorate.

Of this we estimate that some &#163;443 million is for travel for pensioners and disabled people on local bus services, including schemes that are more generous than the statutory half-fare requirement. We have no separate figures for the cost of half-fare travel on buses.

 Detailed inventories of chemical weapons and other munitions disposed of in Beaufort's Dyke are no longer available; many records were destroyed after the disposals as a matter of routine custom and practice in view of the fact that sea dumping of munitions, including CW-filled items, was then an acceptable method of disposal. Where records of disposals do remain in existence, they have been released to the Public Record Office. From those existing records, it is known that some 14,500 tons of 5 inch artillery rockets filled with phosgene were dumped in Beaufort's Dyke in July 1945. There are no records which indicate that other chemical weapons, including mustard gas, have been disposed of to that dump

site. As to the potential risk posed by chemical weapons, the long-held consensus of international scientific opinion is that munitions on the sea bed present no significant risk to safety, human health or the marine environment, provided they remain undisturbed.
<P>

<a name="20423w18.html_para0">Phosgene is destroyed by hydrolysis on contact with seawater. The surveys of Beaufort's Dyke conducted by the then Scottish Office in 1995 and 1996 found no residual traces of chemical weapons in that dump site. A copy of the 1996 report by the Scottish Office, entitled 'Fisheries Research Service Report 15/96'. which confirms the findings of the surveys, is available in the Library of the House.

 Transport aircraft are one of the capability shortfall areas which European Union member states have identified in the European Capabilities Action Plan (ECAP).

 The direct costs of mounting the sentries at Edinburgh castle are in the order of &#163;84,000 each year. The indirect cost is the fact that the soldiers concerned are not available for military training or other duties. These costs cannot be readily quantified.

<P>
<a name="20423w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Soldiers acting as sentries at Edinburgh castle are aware that they have no guarding or security role, and this is not conducive to good morale. In terms of resourcing, providing these sentries throughout the summer months is a heavy drain upon the single battalion which is available for public duties in Scotland and, as such, represents an inappropriate use of highly trained military manpower.

 The verification framework (VF) was introduced in May 1998 and aims to tighten the gateway onto housing benefit and council tax benefit. It does so through a set of defined standards for collecting and checking evidence before a claim can be paid and during the lifetime of the claim. From April 2002 the VF has been separated into three modules allowing authorities to introduce the scheme incrementally.
<P>

<a name="20423w20.html_para10">Authorities who apply to join the scheme receive a one-off payment as set-up funding and funding to continue operating once they become fully compliant with the scheme module or modules that they have chosen.

<a name="20423w20.html_para12">In August 2000, a number of local authorities already compliant with the VF took part in a departmental survey <sup>1</sup>  of the cost to local authorities of setting up and running the framework. The results of the survey indicated that implementation and operating costs vary considerably between local authorities, so it is not possible to provide a generalised estimate of the costs for local authorities.

It will also ensure that pensioners no longer lose a pound in their benefit for every pound of pensions or other savings they have built up. From age 65 pension credit will give pensioners a cash addition of 60p for every &#163;1 of income they have above the level of basic state pension up to a maximum of &#163;13.80 week (&#163;18.60 a week for couples).

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement on Government policy relating to publication of census information, with special reference to information contained in the website at http://learningcurve.pro.gov.uk/ FocusOn/census/what is/intro.htm printed on the census forms for England and Wales; and what action the Public Record Office has taken to amend the information published on its website.  [51181]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w22.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The specific reference is to the PRO's Learning Curve website, which is an on-line teaching resource, structured to tie in with the History National Curriculum from Key Stages 2 to 5. Its investigation "Focus On . . . The Census" is intended to encourage schools to consult census material. At one point it states "To encourage people to provide the correct details, the Government has always guaranteed that any personal information will not be made available to the public for 100 years."
<P>

<a name="20423w22.html_para2">This statement compresses into a single sentence the various assurances which Governments have provided about the confidentiality of census returns at different times. Early census schedules assured individuals that the information collected from them would be published in "General Abstract only" and would not be used for "the gratification of curiosity". Although the precise wording has differed for each census, all assurances given on the forms have been to the effect that information would be kept confidential. In 1966, under Section 5(1) of the Public Records Act, the Lord Chancellor signed Instrument 12 which closed the decennial censuses for 100 years.

 The Commission funds not for profit organisations in three ways. First it pays not for profit organisations under contract to deliver legal aid services to the public by means of the Community Legal Service Fund. This accounts for most of the payments to the not for profit sector.

what action her Department has taken since May 2001 in regard to bringing the benefits of market liberalisation to rural consumers.  [51950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w24.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The benefits of energy liberalisation have been extended to rural consumers. Research undertaken by OFGEM shows that 35 per cent. of gas customers and 32 per cent. of electricity customers in rural areas have switched supplier, compared with 38 per cent. of gas customers and 41 per cent. of electricity customers in urban areas. The differences in the rate of customer switching in rural areas are in part due to the inability of consumers in areas without mains gas to take up "dual fuel" deals.
<P>

<a name="20423w24.html_para4">To address this, the Government have established a working group to look at issues surrounding extension of the gas network, as part of their Fuel Poverty Strategy. The group reported in November 2001 and its report was published on the DTI website http://www2.dti.gov.uk/ energy/gasnetworks/index.htm.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w24.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 There is no definition of the term "vulnerable customers" in draft energy market liberalisation legislation under discussion in the European Council and Parliament. Member States will therefore be free to define the term in any national implementing legislation. The definition used in the UK for the purpose of the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy is as follows: "vulnerable households are those at risk of ill-health from cold conditions&#151;older householders, families with children and households who are disabled or suffering from a long-term illness".

[51951]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w24.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The UK Government do not take a position on individual European Parliament amendments not included in the Commission's revised text. Approximately 500 amendments to the internal market legislation currently under discussion were tabled by MEPs, around 150 of which were accepted in the European Parliament's Plenary vote. It is now up to the Commission to decide which amendments to accept and to present these to the council in a revised text. It would be pointless to take a position on every amendment as the majority of them will not appear in the revised Commission proposal.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether prisoners who maintain their innocence and who refuse to attend a sex offenders treatment programme will be <i>(a)</i> denied parole and <i>(b)</i> have limited privileges.  [49832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w27.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Refusal to participate in the sex offenders' treatment programme as a consequence of a prisoner maintaining his innocence is not of itself a bar to the release of prisoners on parole licence. An assessment of the prisoner's current level of risk is the pre-eminent factor in determining whether he/she may be granted parole. Offending behaviour programmes, such as the sex offender treatment programme, depend upon a prisoner being willing to discuss their offending. Therefore, such programmes are not open to prisoners who deny their guilt. Whilst the absence of reports on a prisoner's progress on such programmes makes it more difficult to make an assessment risk, it should still be possible to make one, taking into account, among other things, the prisoner's attitudes and behaviour during sentence.
<P>

<a name="20423w27.html_para0">The criteria for earning and retaining privileges will depend on a number of factors, including attitudes to and involvement in sentence planning and a willingness to make constructive use of their time in custody. Where a prisoner refuses, for any reason, to address their offending behaviour this may be relevant when assessing a prisoner's privilege level and may be sufficient to deny a prisoner enhanced status.

<a name="20423w27.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Government believe that prison must be used as effectively as possible and targeted where it is most necessary. It should be used for incapacitating dangerous, violent and other serious offenders but prison sentences should be as long as necessary for punishment and public protection, and no longer.
<P>

<a name="20423w27.html_para1">The reform of the probation service, with its central focus on reducing re-offending means that rigorously enforced community sentences are a real and tough alternative to imprisonment. As part of the work taking forward the recommendations of the Halliday report on the sentencing framework we are looking at new forms of community penalties. We aim to encourage greater use of community penalties for some non-violent offenders such as those convicted of theft and handling or fraud.
<P>

<a name="20423w27.html_para2">We are addressing the recent increase in female prison population by taking forward the Government's strategy for female prisoners.

<a name="20423w27.html_para4">Prior to release under the Home detention Curfew arrangements, the Probation service undertakes a home circumstances assessment of every prisoner's release address to confirm that the proposed accommodation is suitable for the monitoring equipment, that other persons residing at the address understand the impact of the curfew and have been given the opportunity to raise any issues which they wish to be considered, and that there are no issues relating to victims which would give cause for concern if the prisoner were to be curfewed to that address.

 The Prison Service's policy in relation to psychological interventions with prisoners is that these should be carried out in line with the standards for applied psychologists set by the British Psychological Society.

<P>

<a name="20423w27.html_para5">Group based interventions aimed at reducing the risk of re-offending are subject to scrutiny by a panel of Prison Service, Probation Service and external practitioners and academics with expertise in relevant areas of work.

 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2002]:</i> A major conclusion of Improving Lives was that large numbers of people who are eligible for registration as blind or partially sighted are not registered. We recognise this problem and the Department has set up a group to investigate ways to improve the way we notify and register sight loss. This group includes representatives of several members of the Improving Lives Coalition.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> A programme of National Health Service trust-based patient surveys began in January this year, with all acute hospital trusts carrying-out a specially designed survey which seeks the views of a randomly selected group of patients&#151;about 500 in each trust. This will become an annual survey. The main areas covered include; admissions, nature of the hospital ward, staff attitudes, care & treatment (pain management etc), leaving hospital and how the patient feels after their experience.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) feedback directly to trusts, where service improvement programmes will pick up on the findings of the survey and will then be used to deliver year on year quality improvements.

Then, through the liaison of the Trust board and (subject to legislation) the new 'Patient Forum', an action plan will be established which takes forward the issues identified, and outlines how real improvements to the quality of the patient experience will be delivered within the trust. At the national level, a survey of coronary heart disease (CHD) patients reported during year 2000, (fieldwork having taken place during 1999). The survey looked at the quality of NHS care for both inpatients and day patients treated for CHD. The results were published on the Department's website and fed back to participating trusts, thus providing a national overview of patients' opinions of their treatment. A further national survey&#151;looking at the experience of cancer services patients, was carried out in 2001 and will report later this year to individual trusts, the 'cancer networks' and via the website. A general practitioner patient survey is also taking place this year (began January '02). As with the acute IP survey above, this will inform both the national performance ratings in the summer, and improve the quality of primary care/GP services, via feedback to all existing primary care organisations, so that appropriate actions can be taken. Next year (reporting 2003) a more specialised survey will be devised to better relate to the comprehensive range of primary care trust-based services.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many contracts his Department has with consultants; what level of professional indemnity insurance is standard in contracts with small consultants; whether he can make exceptions to the level of professional indemnity insurance; and what recent discussions he has had with other Government Departments about the level of professional indemnity insurance.

<P>
<a name="20423w31.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2002]:</i> The Department does not centrally hold a record of individual contracts.
<P>

<a name="20423w31.html_para1">In the past the Department sought a professional indemnity of not less than &#163;5 million, as the standard sum. Since risks vary between contracts, it is no longer deemed appropriate to resort to a single standard level of indemnity and current Department consultancy contracts include the following paragraphs as standard:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"17.2 The Contractor shall effect and maintain with a reputable insurance company a policy or policies of insurance providing an adequate level of cover in respect of all risks which may be incurred by the Contractor, arising out of the Contractor's performance of the Contract, in respect of death or personal injury, or loss of or damage to property. Such policies shall include cover in respect of any financial loss arising from any advice given or omitted to be given by the Contractor.
<P>
<BR>
17.5 The terms of any insurance or the amount of cover shall not relieve the Contractor of any liabilities under the Contract. It shall be the responsibility of the Contractor to determine the amount of insurance cover that will be adequate to enable the Contractor to satisfy any liability referred to in Condition 17.2."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20423w31.html_para2">The Department has not specifically discussed the issue of professional indemnity in consultancy contracts with any other Department. In this and all matters pertaining to commercial contracts, the Department does give all due regard to best practice advice disseminated by the Office of Government Commerce.

<P>
<a name="20423w32.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Security arrangements at hospitals are a matter for the individual hospital trust to address. Many hospitals employ specially trained in-house staff for security services; others use external security companies.
<P>

<a name="20423w32.html_para1">Strong working relationships between the police and the national health service are essential if staff, patients and visitors are to be able to work and receive care in the best environment. While we do not hold details of every trust's arrangements centrally, we are aware that many trusts have made a dedicated room available within the accident and emergency department of the hospital for police use. Some trusts have a police station situated within the hospital grounds. All hospitals have developed close links with the local police force and hold security liaison meetings which include a police representative on the group. We are also aware that the Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Trust has an arrangement with the local police to fund a full-time police presence in the hospital with porters providing routine security services. South Devon Healthcare Trust and Royal Cornwall Hospitals Trust have similar arrangements in place. We understand that a number of other trusts are considering adopting comparable approaches.
<P>

<a name="20423w32.html_para2">All trusts have arrangements with their local police authority to provide specially assigned police officers in the event of a major incident involving firearms, or in a hostage situation.

<P>
<a name="20423w32.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 National health service organisations collect a wide range of data that are used locally within and between health care organisations to support a variety of purposes. Local arrangements therefore exist within health communities to performance manage the quality of data collected that reflect local circumstances.
<P>

<a name="20423w32.html_para3">All NHS organisations are responsible for the quality of their own data. A fundamental principle of data quality is that data should be right first time, at the point at which they are recorded. In relation to hospital data, this principle was supported by the recent Audit Commission report, "Data Remember", which stated that

<P>

<a name="20423w32.html_para4">All NHS trusts are expected to have a named senior manager responsible for data quality within their organisations by 30 June 2002. All chief executives will shortly be reminded of their responsibilities for ensuring that their organisation produces good quality data.

<P>

<a name="20423w32.html_para5">While the ultimate responsibility for data quality lies with NHS organisations themselves, there are a number of national initiatives which aim to support them in improving the quality of their non-clinical data. These include national performance monitoring of data quality, providing support and guidance material on improving

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on progress towards the replacement of thiomersal as a preservative in vaccines.  [48832]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w33.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The European Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products (CPMP) has developed regulatory guidance entitled "Points to Consider on the Reduction, Elimination or Substitution of Thiomersal in Vaccines". This regulatory guidance has come into operation since May 2001. It sets out recommendations and strategy for reducing, eliminating and substituting thiomersal as a preservative in vaccines. As indicated in this regulatory guidance, in an initial stage, a manufacturer may choose to reduce the amount of thiomersal while developing a thiomersal-free formulation with or without a substitute preservative. Since reducing or eliminating thiomersal could have an impact on microbiological quality, antigenicity, immunogenicity, reactogenicity and stability of vaccines, substantial developmental and validation work is necessary before such modifications can be implemented.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w33.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Between September 1999 and February 2001, the Department had largely undertaken Better Quality Services reviews of its support services and the functions and activities of its agencies. The Department was working with Cabinet Office to develop a rigorous approach for the review of policy.
<P>

<a name="20423w33.html_para3">Since March 2001 specific Better Quality Services activity has been incorporated into a fundamental review of the Department's services and activities, including policy areas. This fundamental review was carried out in the spirit of the Better Quality Services Initiative in line with Government policy. It has generated a programme of change that focuses on the Department's delivery contract and which aims to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 26 March 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 924W, on the running costs of his Ministers' private offices, for what reason those costs rose between 1997&#150;98 and 2001&#150;01.  [50340]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w34.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Costs of Ministers' private offices have risen since 1997&#150;98 in part because an additional Minister was appointed in 1999&#150;2000. The level of support provided to Ministers has also been improved over the period.

 Conciliation is a positive mechanism for resolving complaints at an early stage.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the estimated total NHS expenditure was on pathology services in 2000&#150;01; how many pathology services there are in England; how many public health laboratory services there are; and what estimate he has made of the number of private sector pathology laboratories.  [49041]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20423w34.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 2002]:</i> Information on pathology expenditure is not collected centrally; funding for pathology is included in the general allocation to the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="20423w34.html_para0">The Department does not hold a central register of pathology laboratories. However, we estimate that there are around 300 NHS Pathology services in England based in acute Trusts. These include up to 1700 separate laboratories providing diagnostic services for haematology, microbiology, biochemistry, histopathology/ cytopathology, immunology and genetics. We also estimate that there are approximately 250 pathology laboratories in the independent sector.
<P>

<a name="20423w34.html_para1">The Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) comprises 46 laboratories in eight regional groups, the Central Public Health Laboratory (CPHL) (incorporating seven reference laboratories and a scientific support services unit), and the Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC), both at Colindale, North West London. In addition, there are five PHLS collaborating centres serving the London population, and two other special laboratories.

requirements, i.e., to enable patients and healthcare professionals to access medical records, and to store a limited amount of emergency medical data. A number of studies have been conducted within the Department which looked at different options, including smart cards, and biometrics, to meet these business requirements. Our current view is that there are many issues that need to be resolved before decisions can be made about implementing a large-scale scheme involving smart card technology. These include the question of security and confidentiality. There are also technical, legal, cultural, funding and other issues which need to be addressed. The government's approach, therefore, is to test these concepts in pilot projects before considering further a wider use of patient-held smart cards.
<P>

<a name="20423w34.html_para2">The Department is currently funding a programme of pilot projects over a three year period to introduce occupational health smart cards for hospital doctors, initially doctors in training, in England. The company running the projects is TSSI (Thorn Secure Science Ltd.). This is not a patient-held smart card scheme, but we hope to learn lessons about the technology and other issues from this pilot programme.
<P>

<a name="20423w34.html_para3">Ministers and officials at the Department have both formal and informal discussions with private companies on a range of issues, including the possible use of smart card technology in healthcare. The Department is also represented on the Office of the e-Envoy's Smart Card Policy Working Group which includes private companies and other interest groups in its membership.

Unspent grant in excess of any end year flexibility allowed by the grant conditions is clawed back unless Ministers decide to waive recovery in accordance with the grant conditions.
