<a name="30918w01.html_spmin8"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 There are established procedures by which the views of members of the intelligence and security agencies are relayed to the JIC. Before a paper is taken by the JIC, it is discussed at working level and then considered more formally during inter-departmental meetings (called Current Intelligence Groups or CIGS) at which representatives reflect the agreed views of their agencies and Departments. If outstanding issues remain, staff are expected to raise the matter with their representative on the JIC who will bring it to the attention of the committee when appropriate. Additionally, staff in the security and intelligence agencies are able to take any concerns or grievances they have, and which they have been unable to resolve within their internal management chain, to the staff counsellor who acts as an independent adviser.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry has set a target of between 45 to 50 per cent. women in public appointments made by our Department. This target is supported by a number of initiatives my right hon. Friend has led over the past two years; for example, a national outreach campaign targeted at over 2,000 women from diverse backgrounds. These women are well represented at local and regional level, and have many skills needed to be successful when applying for national appointments. 



<P>
<P><I>18 Sept 2003 : Column 871W</I><P>
Our Department also produced a practical guide to enable others to carry on this outreach work and over 3,000 have been distributed. As part of the outreach programme, we have also commissioned research to learn more about what barriers women face when applying for public appointments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what further measures she is planning to prevent the publication of misleading advertising; and if she will list those advertisers issued with court orders in each year since 2000 to prevent the continued publication of misleading advertising.  [129937]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 Non-broadcast advertising is controlled mainly by self-regulation under which the Advertising Standards Authority is responsible for ensuring compliance with the British Code of Advertising, Sales Promotion and Direct Marketing. Providing legislative backing to the Code is the Control of Misleading Advertising Regulations 1988, which empowers the Office of Fair Trading to investigate complaints about misleading advertisements, and where necessary, to seek injunctions against further publication. OFT also have powers under the Enterprise Act (previously under the Stop Now Orders (EC Directive) Regulations 2001) to take action against misleading advertising that harms the collective interests of consumers. These powers are shared by Trading Standards Services. I have no plans to introduce any further measures in relation to misleading advertising.

 The Office of Fair Trading is responsible for licensing and investigating complaints regarding debt collectors and other bodies involved in the consumer credit market.
<P>

<a name="30918w02.html_para3">The current consumer credit licence categories do not distinguish between debt collection and certain other forms of licensed lending. However, a recent survey by the Credit Services Association, a major trade body for the sector, suggests there are approximately 400 debt collection businesses in the UK, 206 of whom are its members.

<a name="30918w02.html_para4">Separate debt collection complaint data have not been recorded over the full period in question.
<P>

<a name="30918w02.html_para5">In January 2003, the OFT set up a specialist team to deal with complaints regarding debt collection; issuing debt collection guidance in July 2003, which sets out practices affecting fitness to hold a consumer credit licence. There are currently 82 complaints under investigation.
<P>

<a name="30918w02.html_para6">In 2000, the OFT issued 20 debt collectors with notices that it was minded to revoke, refuse or vary licences; 10 in 2001 and five in 2002 to March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30918w02.html_para7">Data on adverse determinations have not been recorded over the period in question by industry type, and it is not possible to provide a comprehensive list of debt collectors that have had their licence refused or revoked at this time.
<P>

<a name="30918w02.html_para8">Where there is insufficient evidence to recommend formal action, the OFT also issues warning letters to companies. This activity helps to secure compliance and enables prompt action if future evidence of breaches is received.

<a name="30918w02.html_para9">Data on how many debt collectors have been banned in each year since 2000 have not been collated and this could be done only at disproportionate cost. The Consumer Credit Public Register includes details of everyone holding a licence, everyone who has applied for one, or had one revoked, suspended or varied. It is held by the Office of Fair Trading, and the public can search the public register by telephone or visit in person.

<P>

<a name="30918w04.html_para6">A number of studies have attempted to quantify these gains. The size of the estimated gains vary significantly depending on, among other things, the scale of liberalisation assumed to be implemented, the timing of liberalisation and the range of benefits taken into account.
<P>

<a name="30918w04.html_para7">These studies do not separately identify the effects on the UK economy, but they do suggest that the EU as a whole would benefit from trade liberalisation. A study by the European Commission <sup>1</sup>  , for example, estimated the gains to the EU from a global 50 per cent. cut in 



<P>
<P><I>18 Sept 2003 : Column 882W</I><P>
protection would be in the region of $92 billion. A reasonable assumption is that the gains to the UK would be roughly proportional to our share of EU GDP and external trade (around 17 per cent.). This would imply annual income gains in the region of $16 billion. Another study by Michigan University <sup>2</sup>  suggests that global elimination of trade barriers could increase EU incomes by as much as $500 billion. Again, assuming the UK gains proportionately, this could mean an annual boost to UK incomes of over $70 billion. The benefits would feed through gradually as liberalisation is implemented in many scenarios taking over a decade.
<P>

<a name="30918w04.html_para8">In addition, a successful round of trade liberalisation is likely to have a more immediate effect by providing a boost to global economic confidence. The scale of this benefit is impossible to predict but would certainly be considerable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Warsaw Convention will be subject to no further amendment or reform. The 1999 Montreal Convention, which is due to come into force internationally later this year, will consolidate, update and eventually replace all previous international agreements on air carrier liability, including the 1929 Warsaw Convention.
<P>

<a name="30918w05.html_para2">The purpose of the Warsaw Convention is to cover risks inherent to travelling by air, not damage occurring co-incidentally while in flight. For this reason, claimants must show that an "accident" had occurred. This question has been considered by the English High Court within the context of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) and it concluded that such an occurrence does not fall within the accepted understanding of an "accident". I believe the legal framework for establishing liability to be satisfactory and that it is for the courts to decide specific cases within that framework.

Once a scheme has been approved for inclusion in the Targeted Programme of Improvements there would be further statutory and non-statutory procedures including consultation.

<P>

<a name="30918w06.html_para5">The Chancellor announced in Budget 2003 that the Government would be consulting stakeholders on how best to ensure that future support for road fuel gases continued to reflect environmental and other policy objectives, with a view to announcing decisions on future duty rates and other forms of support in the 2003 Pre-budget Report. A joint Department for Transport, Treasury and Customs and Excise consultation document "Road fuel gases and their contribution to clean low-carbon transport: Establishing a consistent and durable framework of Government support" discussed the issues and invited comments by 17 September.

We will also publish a partial regulatory impact assessment and consultation document shortly, on our plans to implement the directive into UK law.

<P>
<a name="30918w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The Afghanistan Transitional Administration (ATA) has asked donors to concentrate on a few key areas of the reconstruction effort where they can have most impact. In response to this and after consultation with the ATA and other donors, the UK is concentrating on building the capacity of the Afghan Government, humanitarian aid and programmes to support the development of income generation.
<P>

<a name="30918w06.html_para7">Healthcare is not currently one of DFID's focus areas in Afghanistan, and we are therefore not involved in equipping hospitals. Nevertheless, we have funded a consultant that has worked with the Ministry of Health on hospital management.
<P>

<a name="30918w06.html_para8">We also fund Afghanistan's reconstruction effort through multi-lateral channels. The UK is the fourth largest donor to UNICEF and provided &#163;44 million overall funding in 2002. We provide 19 per cent. of the European Union's &#163;282 million package of reconstruction support for Afghanistan for 2003&#150;04, of which &#163;17.5 million is programmed for the health sector to help reduce infant and maternal mortality by providing a basic healthcare package. We are also contributing towards the World Bank's Afghanistan Health Sector Emergency Reconstruction and Development Project, which aims to help expand delivery of basic health services and works to ensure equitable access, particularly for women and children.
<P>

<a name="30918w06.html_para9">Since April 2002, the European Commission has worked with the United States to rebuild 72 hospitals, clinics and women's healthcare centres, revise the national curriculum for midwives and vaccinate &#163;4.3 million children against measles. Over 2003 and 2004, the EC will channel support through the Government to deliver health services to three million people and help to reduce the unacceptably high levels of child and maternal mortality.
<P>

<a name="30918w06.html_para10">UNICEF has supported Emergency Obstetric Care services in 20 districts and refurbished Malalai hospital, the largest maternity hospital in Kabul, with 15,000 deliveries every year.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development whether there is a consensus among European partners on the proliferation of small arms in developing countries.  [129854]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Over the last five years European states, through the European Union and its accession countries, have consistently demonstrated a commitment to support efforts to tackle the proliferation of small arms in developing countries through continuing EU programmes. Currently these programmes are enacted as part of the Joint Action on the European Union's contribution to combating the destabilising accumulation and uncontrolled spread of Small Arms and Light Weapons (SALW), adopted on 12 July 2002 by the European Council.
<P>

<a name="30918w07.html_para0">The EU aims to strengthen the efforts to reduce the availability and supply of SALW to areas of conflict or potential conflict, to contribute to the development of a range of international measures to limit the demand for SALW in such areas, and to help governments to cope with the problems these weapons cause.
<P>

<a name="30918w07.html_para1">The EU currently supports programmes in Cambodia, in central America through the UN Regional Centre in Lima and in conjunction with UNDP in south eastern Europe (the South Eastern Europe Clearinghouse on Small Arms in Belgrade). EU supported projects in South Ossetia and Albania have recently been completed. In the last three years, the EU has committed around Euro7.5million to these programmes, through the Common Foreign and Security Policy Budget.
<P>

<a name="30918w07.html_para2">In June 2003, EU member states agreed a Joint Position on brokering activities which requires members states to enact legislation to regulate activities of brokers, including brokering of small arms and light weapons.

 DFID and other Government Departments have received representations from several international and local NGOs about the human rights implications of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline.

[129200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 DFID's interest in the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) project is as a shareholder in the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the World Bank Group. As a shareholder, DFID has a responsibility to ensure that these institutions have properly assessed this project, including possible social and environmental impacts. EBRD and the International Finance Corporation of the World Bank Group are currently carrying out their normal thorough screening and safeguards procedures on the project. Once these procedures are completed, it is anticipated that they will present formal project proposals to their Executive Boards for discussion. As is standard procedure, DFID will make its decision on how to vote on the BTC project once it has received these formal proposals.
<P>

<a name="30918w07.html_para3">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, is responsible for the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD). ECGD is currently undertaking its due diligence process for the BTC project. The project sponsors are seeking cover from ECGD for the supply of UK goods and services, and for UK investments related to the project. Cover would only be given if the Department were satisfied that the relevant environmental, social and human rights impacts had been properly addressed, and that the financial and project risks were acceptable.

<P>
<a name="30918w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what assessment the Department has made of <i>(a)</i> the extent of extra-legal activity in developing countries and <i>(b)</i> the impact of extra-legal activity on economic development in these countries; and what assistance the Government are offering to increase legal economic activity in developing countries.  [129313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 We are not aware of any comprehensive assessment of the scale of extra-legal activity in developing countries. The impact of crime, in particular corruption, transnational organised crime and money laundering, is undoubtedly profound.
<P>

<a name="30918w07.html_para5">The Department provides a wide range of support to developing countries to help them address these areas. These include developing strong enforcement action against corruption and money laundering, such as strong and effective anti-corruption agencies and financial intelligence units, and establishing the full range of necessary preventive measures, such as strengthening capacity for public sector budgetary and financial management, procurement, accounting and audit; reforming civil service management, enhancing public oversight through strengthened parliamentary committees, developing measures to reduce judicial corruption and supporting civil society to promote transparency and accountability in public life. Helping countries to develop sustained improvements in the climate for productive domestic and foreign investment and facilitating greater private sector development also forms an important part of the Department's work.
<P>

<a name="30918w07.html_para6">We are pleased that negotiations for the United Nations Convention Against Corruption are nearing completion. This instrument will reflect a global consensus on the importance of tackling corruption and improving international co-operation, including the return of corruptly-acquired assets to the country of origin. The UK has played an active role in these negotiations.

 A specific separate assessment was not undertaken but clearly a strengthening of controls on the trade in arms will reduce the availability of arms, which fuel conflicts, erode security and stability and undermine sustainable development, thereby making it easier for development goals to be reached.

 The Department of International Development (DFID) works closely with the World Health Organisation (WHO) across a wide range of health issues. This includes working with WHO on the generic issues of improving access to health commodities and to supporting specific programme needs. DFID was also until recently a Board member of the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation (GAVI). GAVI is a public-private partnership focused on increasing children's access to vaccines in poor countries and discussions focus on issues around the availability of vaccinations in developing countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) and UNICEF also participate in that Board. The UK contribution to GAVI lasts till 2005 and amounts to &#163;35 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 DFID has aimed to assess the post-conflict situation in Kosovo in partnership with other international agencies, and with the Kosovo authorities. In December 2001, we worked with the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme, the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation, the International Organisation for Migration, the Dutch Government and the Statistical Office of Kosovo to produce Kosovo's first comprehensive poverty assessment. This showed that approximately 50 per cent. of Kosovo's population was living in poverty, with 



<P>
<P><I>18 Sept 2003 : Column 894W</I><P>
12 per cent. in extreme poverty. The assessment has since been used to assist the design and monitoring of social services and benefits.
<P>

<a name="30918w08.html_para0">Since then, we have focused on building the capacity of the Kosovo institutions to monitor social service delivery and poverty outcomes. We remain in discussion with other agencies on possible implementation of a second poverty assessment, and on the support needed by the Kosovo authorities to enable them to monitor poverty and deliver services effectively.

 All of DFID's education projects in Pakistan have a strong equity focus.
<P>

<a name="30918w08.html_para1">At the national level, DFID is supporting improvements to education management information systems so as to better monitor girl's education, through for example:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Northern Areas Education Project (&#163;6 million) supports increased female enrolment and participation in management and delivery through improved sector management and the development of community schools. Girls' enrolment in the Northern Areas at primary level has increased from 29,438 in 1996&#150;97 to 52,538 in 2002&#150;03 (an increase of 78 per cent.);

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 Over the last five years, DFID has supported developing countries to establish effective and equitable policies in relation to land and property, together with fair and efficient systems to establish and administer property rights, especially in Africa. Since this is invariably costly and long term, we seek to do this in partnership with others such as the international and regional development banks and the European Union. In Ghana and Malawi we are working alongside the World Bank and others to help establish practical, low-cost, and locally managed systems for land administration. In Uganda, Tanzania and Rwanda we have supported inclusive processes of debate and consultation leading to new policies and laws on land and property and implementation plans. We are about to embark on a similar process in Kenya and are in the process of identifying how best to assist in South Africa. In India and Bangladesh we have sponsored the development of new alliances and partnerships to secure the tenure of vulnerable groups, the regularisation and improvement of informal low-income urban settlements, assistance to low-income households in accessing land, and the piloting of a community led finance facility for poor communities to manage upgrading, resettlement and infrastructure projects in partnership with local authorities and the banking sector. In Guyana we are about to complete a project for and the establishment of the regularisation of a new Lands and Surveys Commission and the associated regularisation of tenure rights.
<P>

<a name="30918w08.html_para3">Globally, DFID supports efforts by the World Bank to establish and implement coherent and inclusive policies to secure and administer property rights in the developing world, and the Department is supporting UN-Habitat in the development of its monitoring system for MDG Target 11 'Improving the lives of 100 million slum dwellers by 2020', for which one indicator is secure tenure.
<P>

<a name="30918w08.html_para4">My Department is also funding research into the promotion of intermediate forms of tenure in urban areas, effective systems for the management of common property, and the improvement of administrative procedures so as to reduce the costs of legal and appropriate shelter for the urban poor.

<a name="30918w08.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what assessment the Department has made of the ability of poor people in developing countries to realise the value of property which they own; and what assessment the Department has made of the impact that property ownership regulations and systems in their country have on the ability of poor people in developing countries to release the capital in their property.  [129303]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 has found that in many developing countries poor people cannot realise the value of property they own. Their property rights are often informal and there are legal, administrative and financial barriers to poor people securing formal rights to land and property. However the department has also found that the promotion of property and private land titling and universal markets in land, as practised in developed countries, is not always appropriate. In many cases property ownership systems fail to recognise legitimate customary rights established over generations including those held by community groups. Standard 



<P>
<P><I>18 Sept 2003 : Column 896W</I><P>
models for titling land and property can sometimes marginalise the rights of the poor while favouring the better off.
<P>

<a name="30918w08.html_para5">The links between property rights and the ability to access credit and financial services are complex and context-specific. The department has found that the ability of the poor to accumulate assets, maintain their homes and make investments may not be greatly affected by their tenure status, depending primarily on their income earning and employment opportunities. As a result, whilst there may be good justification for extending formal property rights and simplifying property systems, financial service mechanisms need to be put in place that do not depend on the availability of titled property as collateral.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w08.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gardiner: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what assessment the Department has made of the time it takes to establish property ownership rights in developing countries and what impact this has on economic development in these countries.  [129316]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 has found that property ownership rights in developed countries have been established as a result of economic and social change over long periods. The establishment of systems to administer and regulate property rights has also been a long-term process, although in many circumstances legitimate rights may exist on the ground. In practice, formal procedures established in law for registering and transacting in property rights can be lengthy, complex, costly and inaccessible to the poor. The result is that informal rights and transactions are not recognised, reducing economic opportunities and increasing disputes.
<P>

<a name="30918w08.html_para6">The department has assessed the strengths and limitations of intermediary forms of tenure and the opportunities to regulate land rights at local and community levels&#151;both of which are procedurally and politically quicker, more practical and less costly than ambitious programmes to establish universal land titles. The department accepts that establishment of appropriate systems of property rights requires the pursuit of coherent objectives by governments over many years.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what recent assessment he has made of the impact of HIV/AIDS on the humanitarian situation in South Africa.  [129056]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 All agencies active in responding to the humanitarian crisis in Southern Africa recognise that the high HIV/AIDS infection rates there are both affecting the crisis and being affected by it. In countries such as Zimbabwe, where one in four adults is HIV-positive, current rates of malnutrition and mortality are closely related to the underlying AIDS pandemic. An estimated 2,500 deaths per week in Zimbabwe are due to AIDS.
<P>

<a name="30918w09.html_para0">We are still learning how HIV/AIDS affects the crisis, including recovery. Evidence from Malawi, Zambia and Zimbabwe shows that households affected by chronic

illness plant fewer crops and can afford fewer inputs like fertiliser. In some cases, households are shifting production to less labour intensive but also less nutritious crops. In addition, governments' capacity to respond to the crisis is undermined by the loss of public sector workers due to AIDS and other factors.
<P>

<a name="30918w09.html_para1">DFID is taking steps to integrate HIV/AIDS in its humanitarian programmes. Regionally, DFID is working to ensure that HIV prevention is integrated with food distribution, and that AIDS affected households receive food and care. We are also working closely with Governments, UN and non-governmental agencies to ensure that there is better understanding of the impact of HIV/AIDS on hunger and vulnerability. We are exploring how best to support longer-term safety nets for households affected by chronic illness. We also have a substantial programme of support for HIV/AIDS prevention and care, working with national AIDS councils and others to ensure appropriate multi-sectoral responses to the epidemic.

 The Government remain firmly committed to the 0.7 per cent. target.

It is the world's largest donor in terms of volume.
<P>

<a name="30918w09.html_para2">The UK continues to press all donors to increase their contributions to developing countries in line with the Monterrey Consensus and has recently proposed an International Finance Facility (IFF) which would allow donors, including the US, to mobilise increased resources for international development.

 The First Stage Report into Employers' Liability Insurance published by my Department in June identified a number of areas for further consideration and action.

Both the Government and stakeholders have continued to work on these issues and the Government will report in the autumn on the progress that is being made and any further steps we intend to take.

<a name="30918w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The issue of 'long-tail' risks was considered as part of the First Stage Report into Employers' Liability insurance published by the Department in June. The report found that concerns about long-tail risks were clearly keenly felt by insurers and might have an impact on decisions about capital provision but it was not able to translate these concerns into quantifiable impacts on pricing. Recent price increases appear to relate most closely to accident risk.
<P>

<a name="30918w10.html_para4">We understand that the Association of British Insurers has separately commissioned work that will attempt to quantify the impacts of long-tail risks on the market. They expect to complete this study later this year. The Government will consider this with interest.

premiums, conclusive or comprehensive evidence has proved very difficult to obtain. A particular obstacle is the difficulty of disaggregating premium increases as a cause from other factors.

The new Working Tax Credit has been extended to people aged 25 and over without children.

 Individuals of all ages have different preferences and it is right that people are free to choose to save for retirement in a variety of different ways. However, the Government believes that the best way to provide a secure income in retirement&#151;in excess of that provided by the state&#151;is through saving in a private pension during an individual's working life. In general, buying a house and putting money into a pension should not be seen as substitutes for each other. By saving in a pension individuals benefit from risk pooling and diversification, favourable tax treatment and over the longer term can expect strong returns to private pension investment. Furthermore, at the point of retirement, housing wealth is generally much more illiquid than any accrued private pension benefits and the market for equity release products is relatively small and trading down incurs high transaction costs.
<P>

<a name="30918w13.html_para0">People will want to take account of the relative risks of investing in different savings vehicles, particularly if these savings are for the long term. Above all, the Government are committed to seeking to provide individuals with information so that they can make informed choices about how and when to save to achieve the level of income in retirement that they expect.

 On 26 June EU Agriculture Ministers agreed an historic reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which will provide a more sustainable basis for European agriculture, as well as reducing some of the damaging impacts of the CAP on developing countries.
<P>

<a name="30918w14.html_para7">The agreement breaks the link between farm subsidies and production in order to reconnect farmers to their markets, reduce damaging environmental impacts and reduce bureaucracy, this is at the heart of our approach to sustainable food and farming. Subsidies will also be dependent on farmers meeting standards in areas like environmental protection, and animal health and welfare. For the first time there will be an EU wide switch of money from production subsidies to environmental and rural development objectives, and there is a new financial discipline which will trigger action to reduce subsidies if CAP expenditure is in danger of exceeding the agreed budget ceilings.

 <i>[holding answer 11 September 2003]:</i> The consumer cost of the CAP can be estimated by examining the difference between UK and world prices for agricultural food products. The notional taxpayer contribution to CAP expenditure can also be estimated though, in practice, UK taxpayers contribute to the whole EU budget rather than to specific components. Our latest provisional estimates for 2002 show a cost of the CAP to a notional family of four from higher consumer prices and levels of taxation of approximately &#163;8 to &#163;9 a week.

 After accession on 1 May 2004 nationals from the new member states and members of their families will have the right to work in the United Kingdom on the same basis as those from existing member states. While this will significantly increase the potential pool of workers able to work in English farming and horticulture, a number of independent studies looking at the scale of migration flows into the EU after enlargement suggest that there are likely to be only relatively small inflows into the UK. Predictions of migration flows are difficult to make, even at national level, so the impact on a particular sector such as farming and horticulture is even more uncertain.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research her Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the effect on the various sectors of the UK farming industry of (i) the legislative burden and (ii) the exchange rate of continental European competitors; and if she will make a statement.  [130206]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 No specific research has been commissioned or evaluated by the Department which compares the total level of legislative burden on the farming industry in the UK with the rest of the European Union. However, as set out in the "Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food" the Government are committed to better regulation. This means legislating only where necessary, doing so in a light

touch way and deregulating and simplifying existing legislation wherever possible. While some regulation is unavoidable if the Government are to safeguard public and animal health, environmental matters or public funds, modern regulations must not only be effective and efficient, but must also deliver improvements in ways which minimise the burden of compliance on the industry.
<P>

<a name="30918w15.html_para3">The euro-sterling exchange rate is an important determiner of UK farm incomes. A provisional assessment of the impact of the recent recovery in the euro and medium term prospects for UK farm incomes if this is sustained is published on the Defra website (http://statistics.defra.gov.uk/esg/reports/repfi.pdf).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what progress has been made in dealing with diseases among fish living in restricted cage accommodation.  [128820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 September 2003]:</i> Most farming of fin fish in cages takes place in the Scottish marine environment. The health status of farmed fish in the UK including those held in caged systems is closely monitored by the Fish Health Inspectorates reporting to the different administrations in the UK to ensure full compliance with the EU fish health regime as laid down in Council Directives 91/67/EEC and 93/53/EEC and implementing national legislation, The UK has a high fish health status and is currently free from the most serious fish diseases, Infectious Salmon Anaemia (ISA), Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (VMS) and Infectious Haematopoietic Necrosis (IHN), Stringent control programmes operate to maintain freedom from these diseases and to control other serious diseases which may be present in some farmed fish populations such as Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) and Bacterial Kidney Disease (BKD).
<P>

<a name="30918w15.html_para4">In March this year the Scottish Executive published "A Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture" which outlines a range of issues which are being addressed to help protect the health and welfare of fish farmed in caged and other systems including better management techniques to help reduce the incidence of sea lice infestation.

[129414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Grant aid for the fishing industry in south-west England is available under the EU FIFG structural fund programme. The current decommissioning scheme for fishing vessels in England is targeted to the sectors of the fleet which are subject to limits on their time at sea under the interim EU requirements for effort control to conserve cod.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much milk was produced surplus to requirements by UK farmers; and how much milk was imported in each of the last 10 years.  [128259]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is difficult to determine how much milk is produced that is "surplus to requirements". This will depend on whether one considers the requirements of UK processors and food manufacturers, both for products intended for domestic consumption or export, or the requirements of UK consumers. Nevertheless, I hope the data tabulated as follows on UK imports, exports, production, domestic use and self-sufficiency for the major milk products since 1991 gives an indication of the position.

<P>
<a name="30918w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 September 2003]</i>: The Government believe the public should have as much information as possible about this disease and is happy to meet all reasonable requests for information. However, the information obtained specifically in relation to individual premises, has been gathered in pursuance of the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate's statutory powers and on the basis of this information, where necessary, enforcement notices are issued to ensure compliance. In the absence of a statutory obligation to publish details identifying individual premises, to publish such details without consent could seriously jeopardise our ability to work with business in relation to the reporting and control of phytophthora ramorum.

 Defra funds a range of measures to assist the beekeeping sector in England through its bee health programme, which is delivered by the National Bee Unit (NBU), part of the Central Science Laboratory. In 2003&#150;04, the programme will cost &#163;1.235 million Under these measures, the NBU provides a free diagnostic and inspection service to beekeepers for varroa as well as training and technical advice to help them become more self-reliant in controlling the pest through improved bee husbandry. The NBU is also carrying out routine screening throughout England for varroa mites that are resistant to authorised pyrethroid-based treatments, having first detected them in August 2001. This year Defra also expects to spend around &#163;248,000 on research and development to support our bee health work. This includes a three-year project that extends an earlier MAFF-funded investigation by Horticulture Research International on the use of entomopathogenic fungi as a biological control of varroa.

 As part of the package of measures designed to establish minimum standards on asylum foreseen by the 1999 Tampere European Council, the Council Directive laying down minimum standards for the reception of asylum seekers (2003/9/EC) contains provisions for financial aid for asylum seekers. This lays down minimum standards for the material reception conditions of asylum seekers and their dependants.

<P>
<a name="30918w17.html_spnew13"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Unaccompanied asylum seeking children who are permitted to stay solely because of a lack of reception and accommodation arrangements in their country are not granted leave beyond their 18th birthday. Once they turn 18 they must leave or apply for an extension of their leave. If that application is refused, or they do not submit any such application, their details are passed to the relevant local enforcement office for removal action. Removal action in these cases is undertaken as a matter of priority.

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) is responsible for accommodating and supporting destitute asylum seekers and their dependants. Asylum seekers who request that accommodation be provided to them will be dispersed on a "no-choice" basis to one of the cluster areas around the UK. Cluster areas are ideally based in towns and cities where suitable accommodation is available and where there is potential to provide a link with existing multi-cultural communities and where the support of local voluntary and community groups is available.

<a name="30918w18.html_spnew0"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The Cigarette Lighter Refill (Safety) Regulations 1999 prohibit the sale or supply of such refills to anyone under 18 years. The Regulations came into force on 1 October 1999 and are enforced by local authority trading standards officers. Local Trading Standards departments have a key public protection role, carrying out surveys within their areas to find out whether shops are selling lighter refills to under age persons, and investigating possible legal breaches.
<P>

<a name="30918w18.html_para0">Although the number of deaths resulting from the abuse of butane gas refills and other volatile substances has remained fairly stable since 1991, the Government remain very concerned about any young person who dies in this way. We do not believe, however, that increasing the age limit to which the Regulations apply would help to any significant degree. Nor do we think a licensing system would add significantly to the controls which are already in place.

 There is provision in the Immigration Rules to assist those who have sought leave to enter based upon marriage, whose marriage subsequently breaks down during the probationary period as a result of domestic violence, to settle in the UK, providing they meet certain criteria. There are no plans at the moment to extend this provision to asylum seeking women, or to women and children who are victims of trafficking for sexual purposes.

 The Consultative Group on Country Information reported in December 1998. It recommended, inter alia, that an independent documentation centre should be established to provide country of origin information for use in the asylum process.
<P>

<a name="30918w19.html_para3">Home Office Ministers considered this recommendation, but at that time IND's priority was to support the recovery of asylum decision output through the expansion and improvement of advice to caseworkers, including implementing other Consultative Group recommendations about the format and content of country of origin information material produced by the Home Office's Country Information and Policy Unit (CIPU).
<P>

<a name="30918w19.html_para4">In 2001, the Home Office commissioned research into the production and use of its country of origin information material. By this time, the CIPU had established a track record for accurate research, with its reports being widely used as source documents by other countries and for material produced by non-governmental organisations. It was therefore decided to await the outcome of the research before proceeding with a feasibility study on the Independent Documentation Centre proposal.
<P>

<a name="30918w19.html_para5">The research, which was published on 1 September 2003 in a report entitled "Country of Origin Information: a user and content evaluation", noted the on-going debate about whether an independent documentation would be the best way to assure the objectivity of the country of origin material used in the asylum process. The report suggested that if it was decided not to proceed with the independent documentation centre, measures should be taken to ensure country of origin information produced by CIPU was impartial and objective.

<a name="30918w19.html_para6">Rather than establishing an independent documentation centre, it was decided to build upon CIPU's existing structures and strengths, and introduce measures to ensure the quality and accuracy of the country information products used in the asylum process. The Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provided for an independent Advisory Panel on Country Information to be established to provide recommendations on the content of Home Office country information and help to ensure that it is as objective as possible.

<P>

<a name="30918w19.html_para7">The Advisory Panel is chaired by Professor Stephen Castles, Director of the Refugee Studies Centre at the University of Oxford and held its first meeting on 2 September 2003. The minutes of the panel's meetings will be published in due course.

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced in February 2002 in his White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration with Diversity in Modern Britain", that he would be introducing charges in order to fund the modernisation of IND. The regulations were laid on 10 July. IND already charges fees in respect of Nationality applications and for Travel Documents, and since 1 April 2003 for Work Permits.

Many apply to extend their stay each year, and it is right that they should meet the costs of that.

Charging will help us to continue to improve the efficiency and speed with which we process these applications, leading to ever higher levels of customer service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w20.html_spnew0"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The National Crack Plan, which was published in December 2002, recognises the particular harm done by the supply and use of crack cocaine. It requires action under all four aims of the Updated Drug Strategy and focused particularly on the 37 areas that have been identified as high crack areas.
<P>

<a name="30918w20.html_para0">Examples of resulting activity include; the introduction of legislation to fast track the closure of crack houses; the introduction, in collaboration with overseas Governments, of measures to reduce the supply of cocaine from the Caribbean; the piloting and evaluation of crack treatment services to expand provision and determine what works best, and the extension of diversionary activity programmes for young people to 31 high crack areas.
<P>

<a name="30918w20.html_para1">There is still much to do to combat the harm caused by crack cocaine, but we are determined, through the National Crack Plan, to make a difference.

<a name="30918w20.html_para2">The UK adopts a multi-agency approach to combating illegal immigration. For the first phase, HM Customs and Excise committed a Cutter vessel; and for the second phase the Ministry of Defence provided a Nimrod aircraft for surveillance purposes.

 The United Kingdom has a range of measures aimed at preventing people using forged or improperly obtained documents entering the country. These include a network of Airline Liaison Officers overseas, a comprehensive visa strategy, international co-operation, development of expertise within the Immigration Service and special exercises.
<P>

<a name="30918w20.html_para3">In the UK, the lead is taken by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate National Forgery Unit (NFU) who have links with other agencies including the police. The NFU provides equipment, training and intelligence to immigration officers in the UK, and to those serving abroad, including Airline Liaison Officers. Immigration officers, specially trained in forgery detection work, are based at all UK ports. 9,664 fraudulent documents were detected at UK ports in 2002, an increase of 46 per cent. over 2001.
<P>

<a name="30918w20.html_para4">The NFU organises regular exercises targeting specific documents, which show a high rate of recorded abuse, and these have proven particularly effective. NFU also have a permanent presence at IND's main offices in Croydon, where they examine documents submitted in support of applications for leave to remain. In 2002, a total of 461 fraudulent documents was detected there.
<P>

<a name="30918w20.html_para5">As part of its external borders policy, the UK maintains a network of 25 Airline Liaison Officers at key locations abroad. They offer advice, training and expertise to airlines, to help prevent the carriage of inadequately documented passengers to the UK. British immigration officers are now working alongside their French counterparts in Calais, offering advice on the validity of travel documents. The UK also works closely with the EU and G8 states, exchanging information and expertise to combat passport abuse.

<a name="30918w21.html_para3">In order to provide a more comprehensive view of military preparedness, performance against Spending Review 2002 PSA Target 3 is assessed on the basis of the readiness state of all forces. Details of the basis for the assessment are set out in the Technical Note to the 2002 PSA targets, available on the Department's website http://www.mod.uk. At the end of the first quarter of financial year 2003&#150;04, the first time when performance was measured against Spending Review 2002 targets, 77 per cent. of force elements were assessed as meeting their readiness requirement with no critical weakness. These figures reflect the impact of both Operation FRESCO and Operation TELIC.

This estimate includes the procurement or modification of equipment, increased maintenance and stock consumption, civil sea and air charter and provision of infrastructure in-theatre.

 RAF Flying training sorties are not instructed to avoid coastlines as flying in such areas can be considered a normal part of training. However, in order to reduce the danger of bird strikes from concentrations of seabirds or waterfowl, pilots are advised as a general rule to cross coastlines obliquely, and at a minimum altitude of 500 feet. In addition they are advised to avoid crossing the coast over resorts and holiday beaches. It is not possible to completely avoid all tourist-dependent towns as to do so would increase the impact of low-flying on other nearby areas.

 As the Secretary of State for Defence announced on 30 January, our view at this stage of the assessment process is that the future aircraft carriers should be built by a combination of four UK shipyards. In addition to the Babcock BES facility at Rosyth, we would envisage construction work being carried out by: BAe Systems Naval Ships yard at Govan; Vosper Thornycroft at Portsmouth; and Swan Hunter on Tyneside. The involvement of other United Kingdom shipyards has not, however, been ruled out. No final decisions on the allocation of work&#151;including the construction of blocks and final assembly site&#151;will be made until the Demonstration and Manufacture contract is let in Spring 2004.

 Capacity within United Kingdom industry is kept under review to ensure that the requirements of the Navy for surface warship refit and repair work can be met. Rosyth dockyard has provided a significant element of that capacity for many years, both before and since privatisation, and should continue to do so as we move towards increased competition. In addition, Rosyth dockyard is one of four yards named earlier this year as having the potential for involvement in the construction and assembly of the new future aircraft carriers.

<i>[holding answer 16 September 2003]:</i> None.

The ITC is independent of the Government and responsible for safeguarding the public interest in broadcast television advertising.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w25.html_spnew0"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 When granting planning permission local authorities may impose conditions to secure the completion of elements of the development. Both the imposition of conditions and their subsequent enforcement if not implemented is at the discretion of the local authority. Any decision to assume responsibility for streets which are not maintainable at public expense is entirely a matter for the relevant local highway authority. The sewers that serve developments are normally adopted by means of an agreement under section 104 of the Water Industry Act 1991. After an acceptance period the sewers will be maintained by the sewerage undertaker. Drains to groups of houses may not be adopted, but the extent of such systems has been limited to 10 connections under a protocol produced jointly by Government, the water industry and house builders in March 2002. The protocol should limit the extent of drainage systems that are maintained by householders.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much has been <i>(a)</i> budgeted and <i>(b)</i> spent by his Department since April 2002 on combating (i) computer fraud, (ii) preventing theft of computers and (iii) safeguarding the security information held on computer; and if he will make a statement.  [128771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department of Health does not have specific financial budgets for combating computer fraud, computer theft or protecting its information. These areas are subsumed within a wide variety of other budgets. Responsibility, from 1 April 2002 to 1 April 2003, for countering fraud and corruption in all its forms within the Department of Health fell to the National Health Service Counter Fraud Service. From 1 April 2003 this responsibility was transferred to a newly formed special health authority, the Counter Fraud and Security Management Service.

<a name="30918w27.html_para4">The Department of Health takes the protection of its computers and information systems very seriously and complies with Her Majesty's Government's Manual of Protective Security. Security measures are kept constantly under review and the Department employs a dedicated and professional security unit as part of this commitment. The Department's information technology network achieved compliance with the British Standard 7799 which covers best practice for information security management at the end of 2002. In 2002 the Department of Health awarded a new service support contract to Computer Sciences Corporation and their security expertise was significant in them winning this bid.

<P>

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30918w28.html_para0">On 1 July, Parliament approved Regulations which will make significant changes to the employment provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act. Ending various employment and occupational exemptions will bring within scope of the Act over one million additional employers and around seven million jobs, in which 600,000 disabled people already work. These Regulations implement the main employment recommendations of the Disability Rights Task Force that were supported by the Government in our document "Towards Inclusion". As we have said, we shall be laying further Regulations in due course&#151;such as on occupational pensions&#151;which will make further changes to the DDA's employment provisions. All these regulations will come into force in October 2004.
<P>

<a name="30918w28.html_para1">Later this year we will publish a draft Disability Bill which will contain proposals on other measures recommended by the Task Force and outlined in "Towards Inclusion", such as changes to the DDA affecting the public sector, transport and premises, some widening of the definition of disability and covering membership of larger private clubs.
<P>

<a name="30918w28.html_para2">We intend that the draft Bill should undergo pre-legislative scrutiny. We continue to receive a wide range of representations from disability organisations, business, trade unions, employers, disabled people and others on civil rights legislation for disabled people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w28.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and, before April 2003, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) represented the UK Government in the negotiations on the proposed Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products that have taken place in the Council of Ministers Working Group in 2002 and 2003 under the chairmanship of successive European Union Presidencies. Before the publication in 2002 of the European Commission's formal proposals for a Directive the MCA had a range of discussions with the European Commission and representatives of other Member States, predominantly in the European Pharmaceutical Committee and an expert group set up by that Committee, about the emerging proposals.
<P>

<a name="30918w28.html_para9">During this period the MCA and later the MHRA has held discussions on a number of occasions with the UK herbal sector about issues and priorities to be pursued in the negotiations, notably the case for flexibility to take greater account of evidence of traditional use from outside the EU and to permit vitamins and minerals to be added to traditional herbal remedies registered under the proposed Directive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w28.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department of Health has set three objectives to support the elimination of mixed sex accommodation. A small number of hospitals have yet to achieve these objectives on every ward. This is because a number of new hospitals and healthcare facilities are currently in construction, which will upon completion bring all wards to the required standards.




<P>
<P><I>18 Sept 2003 : Column 977W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30918w28.html_para10">Guidance issued to national health service trusts on the achievement of the objectives made it clear that a variety of ward layouts and designs could be used to deliver separate sleeping accommodation, including the use of single-sex wards, or combinations of single-sex bays and individual rooms. Single-sex bays, together with increasing numbers of single rooms, are common features of modern hospital design both here and abroad, and can provide perfectly acceptable levels of privacy and dignity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 It remains the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs) to commission services for people with pain, taking account of the resources they have available and the needs of their wider populations. The Clinical Standards Advisory Group (CSAG) report on pain services, published in April 2000, highlighted variations in access to pain services throughout the country. It made recommendations to national hospital service acute trusts and commissioners on how pain services should be delivered in order to reduce variations to access.
<P>

<a name="30918w29.html_para0">It recommended that PCT commissioners should review local provision of pain services, looking particularly at the provision of more specialised treatments on a networked basis. In this review, account should be taken of the needs of both adults and children, and include patients with acute pain resulting from sudden illness or accident, as well as post-operative pain and chronic pain. Trusts should also agree with commissioners the services and resources which are appropriate to meet local needs.
<P>

<a name="30918w29.html_para1">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) has been reviewing pain management techniques as part of the Supportive and Palliative Care Guidance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State's letter of 15 January, PO1021981, what action he has taken as a result of the House of Lord's findings in relation to stem cell research and therapeutic cloning; and if he will make a statement.  [128416]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w29.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Government policy in this area of research has evolved following a number of influential reports, the most recent being that of the House of Lords Select Committee in February 2002. All of these reports have stressed the great potential of stem cell research and have concluded that no single source of stem cells should be worked on exclusively. The Government have made available, through the research councils, &#163;40 million over two years for stem cell research, including stem cells derived from embryos, adult tissue, and cord blood.
<P>

<a name="30918w29.html_para2">The House of Lords confirmed, in its judgement of 13 March 2003, that embryos created by cell nuclear replacement (commonly known as therapeutic cloning) are fully regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Subject to strict criteria, licences

 The cost to the House of Commons of maintenance and new works on the Parliamentary Estate in the financial year 2002&#150;03 was &#163;29.5 million. For the financial year 2003&#150;04 the forecast cost is &#163;24.2 million and for 2004&#150;05 it is &#163;18.4 million. Due to the many estate-wide services, it is not possible to provide accurate figures for individual buildings or to provide figures by calendar years.During the summer recess of 2002 approximately 1,200 contractors' personnel were employed on site and in the summer of 2003 the number is approximately 1,000.

<P><I>18 Sept 2003 : Column 982W</I><P>
2004&#150;05: we expect to introduce the entitlement on a partial basis in academic year 2004&#150;05. Subject to experience in that first year, the entitlement will proceed to roll out nationally from 2005&#150;06. This will enable us to test out the impact on demand. The cost will depend on learner take-up of the entitlement. We have to target a greater proportion of state funding towards priority groups, so those with the greatest need have opportunities to acquire relevant skills and qualifications. Over time, colleges and other providers will need to better focus their resources to support this aim.

 Professor Van de Linde has been asked to chair the Better Regulation Review Group, a committee of senior stakeholders from across higher education, to consider the issue of bureaucracy in higher education. The Group first met in March, since when it has been in regular discussions with the Department on regulatory matters, notably the Regulatory Impact Assessment of the White Paper The future of higher education, and aspects of it, such as the development of the Office for Fair Access. An important responsibility of the Group is to oversee the implementation of the recommendations of the Better Regulation Task Force report Higher education: Easing the burden. I look forward to receiving an interim report on the status of the recommendations from Professor Van de Linde in November.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The figures include those staff directly employed by the Partnerships and those seconded to Connexions from local partner agencies.<P>

2. In addition to personal advisers, Partnerships also employ other delivery staff whose main role is customer contact in support of the personal adviser role, but who are not qualified to give the in depth advice and guidance expected from a personal adviser. In 2001 there were 438.7 full time equivalent other delivery staff in the 15 Partnerships rising to 2,206.8 in the 42 partnerships in 2002 and 2,456.0 at the end of June 2003.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30918w30.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Hodge  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 17 September 2003]:</i> Connexions offers a service to all young people aged 13&#150;19 differentiated on the basis of need. It is not reducing personal adviser time in schools or colleges. There have been significant year-on-year increases in funding since Connexions was introduced in 2001&#150;02. In 2000&#150;01, before the start of Connexions, Careers service and New Start budgets totalled &#163;243 million; in 2001&#150;02, the first year of Connexions, the total budget was &#163;320 million. In 2002&#150;03 this rose to &#163;420 million and in the current year to &#163;455 million.
<P>

<a name="30918w30.html_para0">One service offered by Connexions is for career guidance to be available to all 13 to 19-year-olds. The Ofsted report "Connexions Partnerships: the first year 2001&#150;2002" found that the implementation of the Connexions Service had maintained, restored and, in some instances, enhanced the provision of Careers Education and Guidance in schools and colleges.

 The latest information available shows that the number of 16 and 17 year olds eligible for Education Maintenance Allowance (EMA) in Kingston upon Hull LEA at the end of 2000 was around 2,300. This is based on estimates of participation in full time education and the percentage of young people eligible for EMA based on income distribution. In 2002&#150;03 1,960 students received weekly payments of EMA, of which 1,654 students received the maximum allowance.
<P>

<a name="30918w30.html_para1">Local LEAs are responsible for ensuring young people are aware of EMA. In the pilots eligibility is governed by the local authority area in which the young person lives, so any school with a sixth form, sixth form college or FE college at which an EMA student enrols will "qualify" to operate EMA.

 In 2001&#150;02, we commissioned an extensive study by Steer Davis Cleave into transport support for students of 16&#150;19 and in particular, those with disabilities and learning difficulties. In line with the recommendations from this, my Department has revised legislation, via Schedule 19 of the Education Act 2002, and made an additional &#163;39 million of funding available to local education authorities (LEAs) and their partners for the three years from 2003&#150;06. Now LEAs, Learning and Skills Councils (LSCs) and further education colleges are required to work together to produce, publish and deliver local policies to ensure that there are effective transport services and financial support in order that young people can access and complete their further education. These new transport arrangements are currently the subject of independent evaluation.
<P>

<a name="30918w31.html_para5">This is in addition to the learner support fund, which is &#163;36 million in 2003/04.

The LSC also provides additional learning support to institutions to help with the extra costs a learner with special needs may require, e.g. for transport between sites and to other off-site activities for learners with mobility difficulties. And the LSC has provided support to education providers through revenue and capital funding to implement the Disability Discrimination Act.

<i>[holding answer 17 September 2003]:</i> We condemn the supply of arms to militia groups in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and continue to call for an end to all such support. UN Security Council Resolution 1493 (2003) introduced an arms embargo on eastern DRC and on armed groups not party to the main power-sharing agreement (signed in Pretoria in December 2002). The UN Mission in the DRC (MONUC) are mandated by the same resolution to report regularly to the Security Council on information concerning arms supplies.

 The EU (Accessions) Bill provides a power to grant nationals of the Czech Republic, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Hungary, Poland, Slovenia and Slovakia the same rights to work in the UK from 1 May 2004 as are enjoyed by nationals of the states in the European Economic Area. The Accession Treaty automatically grants nationals of Cyprus and Malta these rights.

<a name="30918w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 My right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary both made clear our concerns over the route and likely impact of the "security fence" to Ariel Sharon, the Israeli Prime Minister, when he visited London on 14 July. Foreign Office officials have also made representations through the Israeli embassy.
<P>

<a name="30918w32.html_para1">The fence should not be built within occupied territory. We deplore this seizure of Palestinian land, isolation of Palestinian villages and the creation of a further physical obstacle to the two-State solution.

 The implementation of the Charter on Human and Minority Rights and Fundamental Freedoms in Serbia and Montenegro, including the protection and promotion of national minorities (whether religious, ethnic or otherwise), is closely monitored by the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR). Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) also monitor observance of human rights in Serbia and Montenegro and include Amnesty International, the Helsinki Committee for Human Rights in Serbia (HCHRS) and Human Rights Watch.
<P>

<a name="30918w32.html_para2">Serbia and Montenegro is also subject to a number of the Council of Europe's human rights monitoring mechanisms, including those provided for under the Framework Convention on National Minorities which was ratified by the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (now Serbia and Montenegro) on 11 May 2001.
