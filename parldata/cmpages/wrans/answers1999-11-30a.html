<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he has appointed a representative to serve on the body to draft a European Union Charter of Fundamental Rights, as agreed at the European Council in Tampere; and what guidance he plans to issue to that person.  [99444]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Lord Goldsmith will be my representative on the Charter drafting body. The Government's view is that the charter should make the fundamental rights which already exist, and which are applicable at Union level, more visible to the Union's citizens. It should take the form of a political statement, rather than a legal text to be incorporated into the Treaties.

To ask the Prime Minister what discussions he has had with <i>(a)</i> France and <i>(b)</i> Russia on the operations of KFOR designed to protect the remaining Serb populations in Kosovo.  [99436]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 November 1999]:</i> NATO Allies and Russia discuss all aspects of KFOR operations on a regular basis and Kosovo was discussed at the Ministerial Anglo/French Summit on 25 November.




<P>

<P>

<a name="91130w01.html_para0">Protection of the Kosovo Serbs and other minorities is one of KFOR's top priorities, with around half of KFOR manpower currently involved in minority protection duties. Security for all communities remains our central objective.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_wqn3"><B> Ms Dari Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the review of the information available on the chemical warfare mental incapacitants known as Agent 15.  [100910]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In accordance with the undertakings given by the then Secretary of State for Defence on 9 February 1998 and by my predecessor on 22 April 1998, a review of the research on glycollates (of which Agent 15 is an example) and related compounds carried out at CBD Porton Down has been completed. A copy of the unclassified summary of this review has been placed in the Library of the House. The report explains that Agent 15 has been used in animal studies at Porton Down, but not in any work involving humans. Research on related compounds (glycollates and benzilates) involving human volunteers found that all the observed effects of the compounds were resolved within four days.
<P>

<a name="91130w01.html_para1">A more extensive research programme involving human volunteers was undertaken at the time of the CBD research in the United States. Follow-up studies in 1980 led to the conclusion that subjects exposed to anticholinergic agents (glycollates) reported no differences in their current health status compared to control groups. However, the methods and the group sizes used were such that only large effects were likely to be uncovered.
<P>

<a name="91130w01.html_para2">There is no evidence that UK troops were exposed to Agent 15, nor that Iraq used Agent 15. There are therefore no plans for further research into this agent at this time.

<a name="91130w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Project Capital</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many people are employed on Project Capital.  [100286]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Following roll-out and proving of the Departmental Financial Management System, Project Capital was formally closed in October 1999. Accounting, in-year management and Planning and budgeting--using the Capital systems--are now largely integrated with teams working on cash management systems.

<a name="91130w01.html_sbhd5"><H4><center>Clyde Base</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what changes have been made as a result of the management review of the Clyde Base.  [100287]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Following a scoping study at the Clyde Base in 1997, Ministers decided to retain work in-house through a joint Management/Trades Union proposal to establish Neptune Services Direct, which is successfully delivering hotel and related services increasingly efficiently. In addition, a rationalisation programme was set in hand to optimise the use of resources and skills in the Engineering and Facilities Support departments.




<P>
<P><I>30 Nov 1999 : Column: 83W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91130w01.html_para3">These changes are still being implemented but, in producing a more effective and efficient organisation, some 161 service and 182 MOD civilian posts have been lost. Through a policy of employing casual staff and fixed term appointees, the civilianisation of some service posts, and the fact that a number of posts had been held vacant, the changes are being achieved without redundancies.

<a name="91130w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps he has taken to ensure that his Department's land is not used by the US Government for purposes which breach international treaties signed by that Government.  [99884]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Her Majesty's Government retains legal possession of and control over all sites made available for use by the United States Visiting Forces. The interpretation of an international treaty is a matter for the parties to that treaty.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what tests were applied to clear each target engaged by British forces according to international law during the Kosovo conflict from March to June.  [98563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 UK air operations were conducted in strict compliance with the requirements of international law, including the UK's obligations under international humanitarian law, and targeting decisions took the legal considerations fully into account.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what was the total replacement value of the ordnance expended by British forces during the Kosovo crisis to the end of August.  [98566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The indicative cost of ordnance consumed during the period of offensive operations in Kosovo is some &#163;45 million. This is an estimate, based on a set of average historical prices for the ordnance in question, and does not represent actual expenditure. Final decisions on the replenishment of ordnance consumed during the campaign have yet to be taken.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what date DRA Boscombe Down carried out electron- magnetic interference testing during the airworthiness proving trials on Chinook HC2; and if recommendations were made as a result of that testing.  [100144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 A full electron-magnetic interference assessment of the Chinook Mk2 was completed by Boscombe Down in January 1994. Recommendations were made concerning the introduction and use in flight of UHF on-board transmitters and walk-on equipment, and High Intensity Radio Transmission Avoidance Areas (HIRTA) within the UK.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 No specific guidance has been issued to the MOD police at AWE Aldermaston in respect of overtime. It is force policy to minimise the use of overtime commensurate with meeting the operational requirement. All overtime working is voluntary.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on how many occasions <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> all other NATO countries have exercised a national veto on proposed actions during a NATO operation since 1989.  [99466]
<P>

<P>
<a name="91130w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Decisions at NATO are taken by consensus. During operations and deployments, procedures allow national commanders to satisfy themselves that a proposed course of action complies with the basis on which the operation was approved, consulting national authorities as required. Neither the UK nor NATO maintains records of how many times these procedures have been used since 1989.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will list the principal activities of his Department and its agencies which provide business for <i>(a)</i> Crown post offices and <i>(b)</i> other post offices; if he will assess whether the level of business generated in each case is likely to increase or decrease over the next five years; and which new areas of business for post offices are likely to be developed by his Department and its agencies over the same period.  [99551]<P>

<a name="91130w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 My Department and its agencies have no functions which directly provide business for <i>(a)</i> Crown post offices or <i>(b)</i> other post offices. It is not likely that this situation will change in the future. However, we have significant business with both Royal Mail and Parcelforce, who provide the bulk of our mail collection and delivery services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what projections his Department has made of the number of households with digital television in 2006 <i>(a)</i> with a digital licence fee supplement as proposed by the Independent Review Panel into the future funding of the BBC and <i>(b)</i> without such a supplement.  [100046]<P>

<P>
<a name="91130w02.html_spnew2"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 We do not have these specific figures at present. However, DCMS commissioned an independent report from Nera in 1998, which suggested between 13.8 million and 18.5 million households would have digital capability by 2008. The potential impact of a digital licence supplement on take up of digital television is something we are considering in reaching our conclusions on the independent review panel's recommendations. As part of that process, we will look at all the available evidence on this issue.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 The Arts Council announced on 13 October its plans for giving the subsidised orchestras a fresh start backed by at least &#163;10 million to enable them to move to a more flexible way of working and to enable them to have scope to offer a more imaginative repertoire to audiences. The Council made it clear at the time of the announcement that they would be in immediate discussions with Bournemouth about a new model for their work. Out of those discussions has come the decision by the Bournemouth Orchestra's Board to close the Sinfonietta as a regrettable preliminary to securing the long-term future for orchestral provision in the South and South-West.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what the Legal Aid Board's policy is on seeking possession of vacant properties when an outstanding debt to the Board is secured against the property.  [100123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Legal Aid Board secures debts against property in a number of circumstances.
<P>

<a name="91130w02.html_para3">Where an assisted person wins his or her case but some costs are outstanding, section 16 of the Legal Aid Act 1988 allows the Board to recover them from the property that was in dispute, through the "statutory charge". Where the assisted person's home was in dispute, or the winnings in the case are to be used to purchase a home for the assisted person, enforcement can be postponed and the Board will register a charge against the home. In those circumstances the property in question is not vacant. Should it become vacant, the Board will expect the property to be sold and the statutory charge paid off immediately.
<P>

<a name="91130w02.html_para4">The other circumstances are: where the court has made a costs order in favour of an assisted person, and the Board is seeking costs from the other side; where the assisted person has failed to make the required contributions towards the cost of their legal aid; where a legal aid certificate has been revoked, in which case the full cost of the help given has to be repaid; and where an assisted person has been granted an emergency certificate but has not been given a full certificate. In all these 



<P>

<a name="91130w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The information requested is not readily available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. As at 31 March 1999, the principle value of all debts to the Legal Aid Board that are secured by way of the statutory charge was &#163;206,792,000. The total value of other secured debts to the Board, in respect of liabilities such as unpaid contributions, costs owned under revoked certificates, or costs awards in favour of assisted persons, is not recorded centrally.

[99877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Scope already exists for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) claimants discharged from hospital on a long-term or indefinite basis to have their benefit reinstated on a weekly basis, providing they notify the DLA unit of their discharge, and providing there is no change to their care and mobility needs. Reinstatement cannot however be automatic; much will depend on the circumstances of the individual case. For example, a person who has been discharged from hospital may have greater or lesser care needs than they had before they were admitted and this could alter the rate of benefit to which they are entitled.

<a name="91130w04.html_para3">We shall be developing a further campaign to inform the medical profession about best practice in requesting organ donation.
<P>

<a name="91130w04.html_para4">Additionally, in line with the drive to improve the quality of care for all users of the NHS, we shall seek to ensure that best practice is adopted in all units involved in donation and transplantation. We shall also support best practice in live donation, which has increased significantly over the last few years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what arrangements are in place in each health authority area to provide a specialised service to patients with epilepsy.  [99759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The information is not available in the format requested. Regional specialised commissioning groups are accountable for ensuring that effective arrangements for commissioning specialised services are in place in each region, including those specialised services required for the treatment of complex epilepsy.
<P>

<a name="91130w04.html_para5">Under the present system it is, of course, for health authorities and primary care groups to plan and arrange the services available to people in their care. They are closest to the patients and best placed to respond sensitively to their needs.
<P>

<a name="91130w04.html_para6">The Clinical Standards Advisory Group (Epilepsy Committee) has undertaken a study to investigate standards of clinical care for, and access and availability of services to, patients with epilepsy. The aim of this research is to review the services that are currently available. We have recently received this report and are currently considering its conclusions and recommendations and the implications they have for epilepsy services and for the National Health Service as a whole. We hope to publish the report within the prescribed 90 days, together with the Government's response.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what impact the EU directive on pharmaceutical packaging, which came into force on 1 January, has had on the availability and cost of generic drugs to the NHS.  [99994]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w05.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Although it does not require them to do so, many manufacturers of generic medicines have decided in the light of European Community Directive 92/27, and other considerations, to change their production from bulk supplies to patient packs. It is likely that this change has contributed to recent problems in the availability of generic medicines and their increasing cost to the NHS. It is, however, only one factor and not, in our view, the most significant.

 Earlier this year we announced a &#163;115 million programme to modernise, expand and update accident and emergency departments. At the same time we announced that we were setting up a team to spearhead improvements in services and to set standards of care in accident and emergency departments, including the care provided for people awaiting admission to hospital. The team is led by Mr. Mike Lambert, an experienced accident and emergency consultant, and draws upon the expertise of professionals in all relevant fields. Their report will be presented to Ministers next spring.

However, the table supplies data for North Staffordshire District Health Authority before this time.

 There is no overall community dental service (CDS) budget. The level of investment in the CDS is a matter for individual health authorities to decide in the light of local need and priorities. Funding comes from health authority baseline allocations. Information about spending on CDS, recruitment and vacancies are matters for health authorities and data are not collected centrally. Overall CDS workforce statistics are given in the table.

 Two phone-and-go dental access centres have already opened in Cornwall and Shropshire. A further six will begin to open from the autumn in Wolverhampton, Bromley, Gloucester, Swindon, Worcester, and Manchester. Expressions of interest for further dental access centres are currently being considered and an announcement will be made shortly. Those that are successful will be given financial support to help them work up a full business case.

 The Charity Commission, as the regulator of charities, is responsible for issuing guidance to trustees, including National Health Service trustees. It has issued specific guidance to NHS bodies in the form of a manual, "NHS Charities a Guide" which provides advice on fundraising.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Royal College of Psychiatrists has issued guidance on the use of electro-convulsive therapy. A joint letter from the Chief Medical Officer and the President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists in September 1998 was sent to all consultant psychiatrists, health authorities and NHS trusts indicating that it was expected that clinical governance arrangements would ensure compliance with this guidance in ECT clinics.
<P>

<a name="91130w06.html_para0">ECT is an effective treatment particularly for patients with very severe generally psychotic depression which is life threatening if left untreated. People who are this severely depressed may refuse or be unable to eat and drink, with a consequent high mortality, as well as being at very high risk of suicide. ECT produces a faster onset of therapeutic action in such cases than is the case with drug treatment.
<P>

<a name="91130w06.html_para1">ECT also has a more limited place in the treatment of other disorders such as mania and schizophrenia. Its role in these latter conditions is generally when drug treatments have proved ineffective or for some reason inadvisable.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 1999]:</i> I have been asked to reply as the Minister responsible for the Hearing Aid Council Act 1968, which regulates the supply of hearing aids, whether moulded or non-moulded. The Act requires that the dispensers of hearing aids must be registered as such with the Hearing Aid Council in order to supply hearing aids. The standard of competence for registration of dispensers is contained in the Hearing Aid Council's Code of Practice, copies of which will be placed shortly in the Library of the House.

<a name="91130w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 A contract was signed on 22 November on behalf of Professor Rod Morgan of the University of Bristol, who will lead a team consisting of colleagues in the Faculty of Law at the University of Bristol, researchers from Taylor Nelson Sofres (covering the fieldwork), and CRG Consultants (for the cost-benefit analysis).
<P>

<a name="91130w06.html_para2">The team will undertake research commissioned jointly by the Hone Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department, to assess the relative costs, effectiveness and other benefits or disadvantages of stipendiary and lay magistrates, taking into account all related costs including those of other agencies. It will be used to assess whether the current balance between the use of lay magistrates and stipendiaries is satisfactory; whether each set of magistrates is deployed in the most effective way; and the weight of arguments that are heard for and against the use of lay and stipendiary magistrates in particular circumstances.
<P>

<a name="91130w06.html_para3">The research is due to be completed in September 2000. The report will be published.

<P>
<a name="91130w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Staff in the immigration and nationality directorate (IND)--both at the ports and at headquarters--have faced greatly increased workloads during 1999 as a result of the large increase in the number of asylum applicants. Much has been achieved, but much more remains to be done and staff will face a continuing challenge next year. In addition, staff are now taking on new responsibilities to make asylum procedures operate more effectively.
<P>

<a name="91130w06.html_para7">I have, therefore, authorised a special payment of &#163;150 for all staff, except members of the IND board. This recognises the extra duties and responsibilities of IND staff in this period of change.

 The Metropolitan Police Commissioner tells me that training in the use of CS spray for his officers is based on principles contained in the Association of Chief Police Officers guidelines on police use of incapacitant spray.
<P>

<a name="91130w06.html_para10">Metropolitan Police officers are taught that CS spray is a tactical option when the use of force is justified, but it must be used lawfully. Where any use of force is contemplated, officers are trained to take full account of the circumstances and any likely dangers before deciding which tactical option to use. Their training explains the effects of CS spray on the person being sprayed and on others; they are also trained in aftercare procedures for persons sprayed. Custody officers have specific guidance on how to deal with those arrested following the use of CS spray.

 The Metropolitan Police Commissioner tells me that between 1 November 1998 and 31 October 1999 there were 38 public complaints by members of the public concerning the use of incapacitant sprays. These complaints involved 41 specific allegations. Of these, 16 have been investigated and found to be unsubstantiated. The remaining 25 allegations are still being investigated.

[99604]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w06.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Metropolitan police Commissioner tells me that the date of issue of CS spray varies between divisions because of the lead-in time necessary to train officers. All officers receive four hours initial training before being issued with CS spray; competence in its use is checked at least once a year thereafter. By March 1998, most divisional officers had been issued with CS spray.
<P>

<a name="91130w06.html_para12">The Metropolitan police do not record centrally the number of officers trained in the use of CS spray, nor the number who routinely carry it, but the Commissioner tells me that the majority of operational officers would routinely carry it.
<P>

<a name="91130w06.html_para13">The CS incapacitant spray issued by the Metropolitan police is manufactured by SAE Alsetex in France and supplied in the United Kingdom by Primetake Ltd. This spray contains a 5 per cent. solution of CS in the solvent MIBK (Methyl iso butyl ketone) and the propellant used is nitrogen. Since September 1997, the Metropolitan police has purchased 30,200 canisters at the cost of &#163;196,000.

 Budgets for police forces and fire brigades are set locally by their respective police and fire authorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) for what reason the claim by Mr. R. Knappe of Ferndown, Dorset, for firearms surrender compensation in respect of firearms surrendered over two years ago has not yet been paid;  [99455]
<P>

 The Home Office Firearms Compensation Section (FCS) received 1,428 compensation claims from the Dorset Police area, of which five were ineligible under the terms of the compensation schemes. As at 22 November, 1,403 claims had been completed and 20 remain outstanding, of which 18 are those where payment offers have been made to the claimants in question and are awaiting acceptance.

<a name="91130w08.html_para2">As at 22 November, a total of 994 claims remain outstanding, of which 795 are those where payment offers have been made to the claimants in question and are awaiting acceptance. It is not possible to predict exactly when all claims will be completed as this will depend on a number of factors outside our control, including, for example, the receipt of suitable evidence from claimants as to the value of their surrendered property, the outcome of an independent valuation where this is necessary, and claimants acceptance of the payment offers that have been or will be made to them.
<P>

<a name="91130w08.html_para3">The compensation claim made by Mr. Knappe of Ferndown, Dorset was received in the FCS on 26 August 1997. Payment of the Option A and B elements of the claim was made on 22 January 1998 and the case is recorded as having been completed at this point. The claim will be re-examined by the FCS in order to process the outstanding Option C element of the claim.
<P>

<a name="91130w08.html_para4">It is not possible to say how many claims may have been closed in error. They will come to light only when a claimant inquires about progress on a claim which is recorded as completed. Once identified, any such cases are dealt with promptly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance he gives to magistrates on the criteria for releasing persons on bail charged with a serious assault rather than remanding them in custody; and if he has any plans to review this guidance.  [100347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 November 1999]:</i> Within the statutory framework laid down by Parliament, in the Bail Act 1976, the decision to grant bail is a matter of independent judicial discretion. For this reason, the Government do not issue guidance to magistrates. However, magistrates are trained to adopt a structured approach to decision making, taking into account a range of factors, including the nature and seriousness of the offence, the possible sentence and whether the defendant is likely to surrender to bail or commit offences while on bail.

 An Audit Commission report published in July 1999 reported that the average police fund balance in England and Wales (including earmarked and general reserves) at 31 March 1998 was &#163;7.6 million, which represents 6.2 per cent. of average net operating expenditure. However, the level of reserves varies greatly between authorities.

Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA), showing that at 31 March 1998 police authorities in England and Wales had general reserves totalling &#163;181 million. This represents about 2.6 per cent. of net expenditure.
<P>

<a name="91130w08.html_para6">The Audit Commission noted that general reserves, or balances, ranging from 2 per cent. to 5 per cent. of net operating expenditure are typically seen as reasonable by auditors. CIPFA has issued advice to police authorities recommending that general reserves or balances should be within that range, depending on local circumstances. According to CIPFA figures, 12 police authorities had general reserves below 2 per cent. of net expenditure as at 31 March 1998.

 The EU is funding a Sustainability Impact Assessment by Manchester University of the next trade round currently underway in Seattle. The study is developing a methodology for sustainability impact assessment and will make a broad qualitative assessment of the next round. It will look at impacts for four groups of countries--the EU, developing countries, least developed countries and the world as a whole. The Government fully supports the EU's approach and will be consulting with the EU and the consultants as the work progresses. In addition, the UK is part funding a World Bank programme of research on trade and development, which will include some work on impact assessment.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received representations from a variety of UK based development agencies and NGO organisations over the past few months.

She gave a speech hosted by the Commonwealth Business Council on 3 November to over 100 NGOs entitled "Making the Next Trade Round Work for the World's Poor". I addressed the United Nations Environment and Development Committee conference "Seattle: A Challenge for Sustainable Development" on 18 November, a conference attended by most of the interested parties within the UK.

 The Department for International Development reports annually, in our Departmental Report, on the progress of implementation of the Government's official development assistance strategy. Private or non-governmental development agencies are independent organisations, accountable to their own Boards, and to the public and others who provide their funds. We try to ensure, through regular meetings, consultations and monitoring, that there is synergy between the work undertaken by these organisations and the official development programme. We are also about to embark on Partnership Programme Agreements with major non-governmental development agencies which will set out shared objectives over a fixed time-period.

 The world price of gold has been in decline for many years prior to the recent announcement of UK gold sales. The relatively modest size of UK gold sales is not sufficient to explain the fall in price of gold earlier this year. The price of gold has risen again since the second auction in September, and continues to fluctuate within a broad margin.
<P>

<a name="91130w09.html_para3">Employment in the gold mining sector in South Africa has fallen from around 385,000 in June 1995, to around 210,000 at present. South African mines are comparatively high cost producers--the present industry average in South Africa is about $230 per ounce, compared to about $100 in parts of South America--and their relative contribution to the South African economy has been in decline for decades. Our development co-operation supports South Africa's efforts at economic diversification and employment creation.

 The Government is deeply concerned about the humanitarian consequences of the conflict in the North Caucasus. We are in close touch with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and UN agencies about those displaced as a result of the conflict. We have contributed &#163;0.5 million to the ICRC's appeal for the region. The UK has also contributed through its part of the 1.2 million euro earmarked by the European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO); of this 1 million euro has been disbursed to UNHCR.

 The cyclone that hit Orissa on 29 August has caused widespread damage and suffering. Millions of people have been affected by the cyclone and its aftermath. Alongside the Government of India's own efforts, we have committed over &#163;2.5 million for immediate relief. Much of this has been channelled through five UK-based non-governmental organisations (CARE, Christian Aid, Save the Children, Oxfam and Help Age International), which are working through Indian partner agencies to help the most seriously affected families. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies has received funding to provide food, as have various United Nations agencies such as UNICEF. A team from our Department concluded an on-the-spot assessment to guide our decisions on targeting the most needy areas and supporting the most effective agencies.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) is providing the Government of Sierra Leone with assistance for the implementation of the Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration (DDR) process for ex-combatants (comprising &#163;3 million for logistical support and a &#163;3.5 million contribution to the World Bank managed Multi Donor Trust Fund); over &#163;1 million towards the cost of the Commonwealth Police Development Task Force; support to the Sierra Leone Ministry of Defence for security sector reform projects to help create a civilian structure to manage the armed forces (&#163;1.7 million); the provision of a ferry boat (&#163;0.9 million) and around &#163;2.4 million for a range of non-governmental organisation activities to help the country cope with its humanitarian needs. DFID has also provided &#163;5 million worth of emergency budget support.

 The only significant current project in the Department for International Development (DFID) is the roll-out of Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to provide on-line access to our major offices overseas. Work commenced in July 1999 and is scheduled for completion on time and within budget (&#163;400,000) in early 2001. DFID systems are small scale and low risk. Our technical architectural values ensure appropriate use is made of packaged software and bespoke solutions. Our total annual IT budget is around &#163;5.5 million. All IT projects have been delivered within 10 per cent. of estimates and implementation schedules.

<a name="91130w10.html_para3">DFID has a rolling programme for development of IT infrastructure and Corporate Business Systems. This will include two key corporate systems: a phased development of a Performance Reporting Information System for Management (PRISM), and a resource accounting and budgeting system (CODA). Development work will resume in early 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what contingency plans he has prepared to deal with under-estimated liabilities in the same manner as reserves and assets upon the winding up of the TECs.  [100107]<P>

<P>
<a name="91130w10.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 As private companies, it is ultimately the responsibility of each TEC to ensure it assesses its liabilities accurately and that it has available sufficient funds to meet these. The Secretary of State has no obligation through the contract to meet any liabilities which cannot be met from a TEC's own resources. However, through its contract with the TEC, the Secretary of State has agreed to put in place arrangements to provide funds to meet the costs arising after 25 March 2001 in respect of those persons already participating under Work Based Training for Young People and Work Based Learning for Adults so that they can complete their individual training plans. Similar arrangements also exist for any non-discretionary activity directly funded by the Secretary of State.

<a name="91130w10.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 TEC statutory accounts are required under company law to be audited by the TECs' external auditors. As part of their work, the auditors will have to satisfy themselves that the level of liabilities reported are

valid and that the accounts give a true and fair view of the finances of the TEC. Government Offices are also discussing transition plans with TECs which include a detailed assessment of the assets and liabilities of each TEC.

<P>
<a name="91130w10.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if the moneys each of the TECs is contributing to the legal fund controlled by the TEC National Council is listed as liabilities in their audited statutory accounts 1998-99; and if they are liabilities upon the Secretary of State's funds.  [100108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w10.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The latest available audited statutory accounts are for the year ended 28 March 1999 and as such precede the announcement of the White Paper "Learning to Succeed". They do not include any liabilities for contributions to a legal fund.

<P>
<a name="91130w10.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list expenditure by each TEC <i>(a)</i> since the publication of the White Paper, "Learning to Succeed-a New Framework for Post-16 Learning" in June 1999 and <i>(b)</i> in the 12 months preceding its publication.  [99935]<P>

 The following table shows a list of expenditure in the 12 months preceding the publication which has been taken from the audited statutory accounts for the year ended 28 March 1999. For the period since the publication (July to September 1999) the TECs management accounts, although not directly comparable, show total expenditure of &#163;370 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The Government believe the new arrangements for paying higher education tuition fees, in which students from lower income groups pay no fees, are fair and just. Students from the lower socio-economic groups have not been deterred from applying to enter higher education. Nor is there evidence that student choice, in terms of subject of study and length of course, has been affected.

 Following their introduction in 1991, monitoring of the first 20 mph zones showed a significant reduction in accident casualties, particularly among cyclists and pedestrians. We legislated in the summer to allow local authorities to make 20 mph speed limits and 20 mph zones without the need to obtain the consent of the Secretary of State. It is too early to judge the effect of that on road safety.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 November 1999]:</i> London Transport (LT) have been allocated Government support of &#163;248.7 million for 2000-01. This figure does not include money earmarked for residual expenditure on the Jubilee Line Extension.
<P>

<a name="91130w12.html_para2">Some of this funding will be transferred to the Mayor in July next year, when Transport for London (TFL) assumes responsibility for LT activities other than the Underground.
<P>

<a name="91130w12.html_para3">Levels of Government support for the Underground in 2001-02 and thereafter have not yet been determined.

expenditure of &#163;1,190 million on the Piccadilly line and (b) &#163;900 million on the Victoria line of the London Underground over the next 15 years; and if he will make a statement.  [99638]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The figures quoted were London Underground's indicative estimates of the likely cost of achieving the performance specification to be set out in the PPP contracts. In fact, it will be the responsibility of the Underground's private sector partners to determine the actual level of investment required to deliver the improved performance we want.
<P>

<a name="91130w12.html_para4">Details of the performance targets have yet to be finalised, but they will require improvements in capability, availability, ambience and asset condition. This will enable London Underground to provide passengers with faster, more reliable and more comfortable journeys.

<P>

 I am satisfied that financial assistance under the Bellwin scheme is justified in the case of Worcester City Council given the exceptional nature of the floods and the damage caused. A scheme will, therefore, be established under section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Grant has generally been paid to authorities at a rate of 85 per cent. of their eligible expenditure above a threshold. However, a Bellwin scheme was activated for Worcester as a result of the 1998 Easter floods. Since Worcester have already spent over their threshold for 1998-99 in dealing with that emergency, it seems reasonable that they should not have to do so in dealing with a second incident in the same financial year. I therefore propose to waive the threshold.

<P>

<a name="91130w13.html_para0">The Government welcome the "Aviation Safety" report, which covered a wide-ranging and detailed examination of aviation safety issues by the Committee. We note that the evidence the Committee received showed that the United Kingdom has an excellent safety record, particularly in the commercial aviation sector. The Committee seeks reassurance that all necessary steps are being taken to maintain that record in the face of the challenges presented by a dynamic and growing industry, in which the UK is a world leader. The Government and the CAA agree that the current high standard of aviation safety in the United Kingdom must be maintained and, where possible, improved. We fully recognise that aviation safety requires constant vigilance by regulators and the regulated alike.
<P>

<a name="91130w13.html_para1">The Committee makes 29 recommendations, some to the Government, some to the CAA, and others to both. Both we and the CAA have considered the recommendations fully and carefully and they are dealt with in turn, and in detail, in the Command Paper.

In other cases, licensed telecommunications code system operators are authorised under Part 24 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO) to install masts of up to 15 metres in height. This is subject to a prior approval procedure, under which the local planning authority has the opportunity to say whether it wishes to approve details of the siting and appearance of the installation.
<P>

<a name="91130w13.html_para2">These GPDO provisions were amended earlier this year by SI 1999 No. 1661. We have no current plans to make further changes to the GPDO in respect of telecommunication masts.

<a name="91130w14.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Nigel Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will assess the advantages and disadvantages in terms of rail safety of changing the system of track identification from the current up and down system to numbering each track.  [100060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The convention adopted for identifying railway tracks varies from location to location and is the result of historic custom and practice. While it may seem attractive to impose a rationalised uniform system of identification, the risks involved in the transition could outweigh the benefits of the change. Safe operation of the railway often depends on drivers, signallers and other workers correctly identifying tracks; acquiring the necessary knowledge of the geography and layout of the railway is an important part of ensuring their competence. Change to well-established names could well increase the probability of errors.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what are the Government's carbon dioxide emission targets for <i>(a)</i> 2011, <i>(b)</i> 2012, <i>(c)</i> 2014, <i>(d)</i> 2016, <i>(e)</i> 2018 and <i>(f)</i> 2020.  [100481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Following Kyoto in 1997, the UK has a target to reduce a basket of 6 greenhouse gases, including carbon dioxide, by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2008-12. The Government also have a domestic goal to cut emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 per cent. by 2010. The Kyoto protocol requires international discussions about targets beyond 2012 to begin by 2005 at the latest.
<P>

<a name="91130w14.html_para1">The Government will shortly be publishing a draft UK climate change programme for consultation. The draft programme will recognise that Kyoto is only the start of the process and that greater cuts in emissions will be needed over time. It will therefore set out our policies and measures directed at our current commitments, but also to help prepare the UK for more challenging targets in the future.

 The figures for the latest five counts of gipsy caravans broken down by local authority are routinely placed in the Libraries of both Houses as soon as they become available. They include details of the numbers of gipsy caravans on authorised (public and private) sites and on unauthorised sites in every local authority area.

<P>
<a name="91130w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 London Transport aim to open the Jubilee Line station at Westminster shortly before Christmas. It is, however, a very deep and highly complex station, being constructed on an extremely constricted site. LT cannot therefore guarantee the opening date at present. By early December it should be possible to be more precise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w14.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) note 7 on the Countryside recognises the importance of farm-based diversification in a changing rural economy and gives guidance on development related to agriculture and to farm diversification, including tourism. The guidance takes account of the research report "Planning for Rural Diversification", published in 1995, which was accompanied by a good practice guide.

 The agreements are not intended to be legally binding upon members of trade associations or any other entities which the associations may represent. The agreements are a mechanism by which, if environmental targets are met, a reduction in the climate change levy will be made. It is this incentive which will deliver the necessary environmental outcome in the public interest.

 The Government's Planning Policy Guidance (PPG) note 7 on the countryside gives detailed advice on development affecting agricultural land. Local planning authorities should take account of the quality of any agricultural land that would be lost through development proposals, both when preparing their development plans and when considering planning applications.

 Most small ferry companies are unaffected because they do not operate in waters to which the directive applies the registration system. A compliance cost assessment was prepared while directive 98/41 was being negotiated. The estimated total cost to those British shipping lines and ports affected was around &#163;6 million for the initial capital cost of implementation, with annual revenue of around &#163;2.5 million. These estimates were based on information provided by the shipping industry. Copies of the compliance cost assessment are in the House Library.

<P>

 The technical potential for building integrated PV in the UK is currently estimated at 15 terrawatt hours (TWh), which represents less than 5 per cent. of current electricity consumption. The potential savings in CO2 emissions if all this resource could be utilised, which is unlikely for practical, economic and environmental reasons, would amount to some 7 million tonnes per year.
<P>

<a name="91130w18.html_para0">The average cost of electricity from building integrated PV is currently around six times that of electricity generated from conventional fuels, and is unlikely to decrease sufficiently over the next ten years to make more than a small contribution to the carbon emission reductions necessary by 2012. The current annual generating capacity of installed PV in the UK is some 0.5 gigawatt hours (GWh).
<P>

<a name="91130w18.html_para1">However, in the longer term, PV has the potential to make a significant contribution to carbon savings. The DTI has been supporting a programme of research, development and demonstration of the technology in the UK for several years and, together with support from the European Union, a number of major examples on building intergrated photovoltaics are now operating.

<a name="91130w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Ministers and officials have received many representations about the WTO's TRIPS agreement. Many of these have been supportive of that Agreement and its implementation in view of its importance to encourage investment. Some have questioned whether parts of the Agreement might be detrimental to development interests. We have given assurances that there is much flexibility in the TRIPS agreement to allow for development interests to be taken into account.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations he has received in relation to cause-related marketing techniques; and if he will introduce legislative provisions to prevent the abuse of such techniques.  [99391]<P>

<P>
<a name="91130w19.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I have not received any representations about cause-related marketing and I have no plans to introduce additional regulation in this area, which is already subject to general legal controls on, for example, misleading advertisements, and to the codes of practice overseen by the Advertising Standards Authority and the broadcast regulators.

the amount that is classified as (i) pre-cut-off date and (ii) post-cut-off date, for each of the countries defined by the World Bank as developing countries.  [100020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 From the information available, Annexe A shows the value of outstanding amounts in respect of United Kingdom aid loans and Annexe B the outstanding value of unrecovered claims under guarantees issued through the Export Credits Guarantee Department to Developing Markets. The ECGD data are divided into amounts paid as claims which remain outstanding but which have been officially rescheduled, and claims paid that are not yet subject to a rescheduling agreement. All the amounts that have been rescheduled are in respect of pre-cut-off business, but amounts outstanding which are not subject to rescheduling are likely to include both pre and post cut off amounts. ECGD is not readily able to split these data on a pre and post cut off basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will request a contribution from Argentina towards the cost of clearing landmines in the Falkland Islands. [R] [100016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 In December 1993, the Argentine Government offered to meet the cost of clearing landmines in the Falkland Islands. We welcomed this offer and sought to explore it further.
<P>

<a name="91130w19.html_para1">During President Menem's visit to the UK in October 1998, we agreed as a first step to work with Argentina to evaluate the feasibility and cost of clearing the landmines still present in the Falkland Islands. Work on a Memorandum of Understanding setting out how this feasibility study will be carried out is under way. Both Governments reaffirmed their commitment to co-operate on mine clearance in the Joint Statement of 14 July 1999.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w19.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Crausby: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his estimate is of the number of Argentine landmines remaining in the Falklands Islands. [R] [100015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence estimate that around 16,600 mines remain in the Falkland Islands. The Argentine armed forces laid 127 minefields on the Falklands in 1982. MOD estimate that 18,000 mines of all types were laid, including 14,000 anti-personnel mines. British forces carried out some clearance immediately after the conflict, lifting about 1,400 mines, but stopped after several injuries to those involved. The remaining 101 minefields are marked and fenced, and therefore not an immediate hazard. The garrison conduct a public campaign to warn of the dangers. They make regular patrols and destroy mines which become exposed on the surface of the ground. The Argentines have given us their minefield records.
<P>

<a name="91130w19.html_para2">The Argentine Government offered to assist with their clearance, and during President Menem's visit to the UK in October 1998 we agreed, as a first step, to work with Argentina to evaluate the feasibility and cost of clearing them. Work on a Memorandum of Understanding on how this study will be carried out is under way. Both Governments restated their commitment to co-operate on mine clearance in the Joint Statement of 14 July 1999.
<P>

<a name="91130w19.html_para3">We are fully committed to the Ottawa Convention, which requires us to clear all anti-personnel mines from the Falkland Islands within 10 years of entry, unless we can show good reasons why an extension should be granted. Such reasons may include humanitarian, environmental and technical considerations. Mine clearance in the Falkland Islands is both difficult and dangerous and we shall be keeping these points in mind.

 Significant delays continue to be encountered by traffic, including humanitarian aid convoys, at the major crossing point on the Kosovo/Macedonian border at Blace. The United Nations interim administration in Kosovo has set up a task force to take matters forward and negotiations continue with the Macedonian Government to relieve the bottleneck at the border.

 The Government have set out the position on a number of occasions. This is that cases have arisen (as in Northern Iraq in 1991) when, in the light of all the circumstances, a limited use of force was justifiable in support of purposes laid down by the Security Council, but without the Council's express authorisation, when that was the only means to avert an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe. Such cases would in the nature of things be exceptional and would depend on an objective assessment of the factual circumstances at the time, and on the terms of the relevant decisions of the Security Council bearing on the situation in question.
<P>

<a name="91130w21.html_para0">In the case of Kosovo, NATO took the view in March of this year, given the circumstances at the time, that the use of force was the only route left to avert a humanitarian catastrophe.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent progress has been made in inhibiting the use of diamond sales for funding the war in Angola.  [100671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 UN Security Council resolution 1173 of 12 June 1998 imposed a ban on the direct or indirect import from Angola of all diamonds not controlled through the Certificate of Origin regime of the Government of Unity and National Reconciliation of Angola (GURN). The aim was to cut off diamond revenues to UNITA, and so reduce their ability to fund continued fighting. Following the adoption of the resolution, the Government amended the Open General Import Licence to prohibit the import into the UK of diamonds exported from Angola not accompanied by a GURN Certificate or Origin. The ban is implemented in the Overseas Territories through the Angola (United Nations Sanctions) (Dependent Territories) Order 1998.
<P>

<a name="91130w22.html_para6">This corrects information in a previous written answer to my hon. Friend on how the UK implements its obligations under resolution 1173 with regard to the import of diamonds--3 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 189W. I would like to take this opportunity to apologise to my hon. Friend for that error.
<P>

<a name="91130w22.html_para7">UN Security Council resolution 1237 of 7 May 1999 established a panel of experts to investigate alleged violations of the sanctions against UNITA, in support of the work on the UN Angola Sanctions Committee. Panel members are paying a series of visits to the region, and will report on how sanctions in relation to UNITA diamonds can be implemented and enforced more effectively.
<P>

<a name="91130w22.html_para8">We welcomed the announcement by De Beers on 5 October that they will no longer purchase any Angolan diamonds, and will urge their clients to adopt a similar policy. In this task I want to see full co-operation from trading centres such as New York, Antwerp and Tel Aviv and also from other diamond companies to follow De Beers' lead. This is vital to disabling UNITA's murderous war effort.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w23.html_spnew13"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Government's strategy for tackling tax avoidance is to target legislation at a range of avoidance schemes whose exploitation is reducing tax revenues. Each of the last three Finance Acts has contained important measures to close loopholes and reduce the opportunity for tax avoidance. Further legislation will be introduced in next year's Finance Bill to counter avoidance based on capital gains tax gifts relief. The Government are committed to creating a fairer tax system. Artificial and contrived tax avoidance schemes undermine fairness, at the expense of those who do not indulge in them.

 The Government are working to transform Britain into a society which is inclusive and prosperous. Eliminating unjustified discrimination wherever it exists and making equality of opportunity a reality for all is at the heart of the Government's agenda. Equality of opportunity is not only inherently right, it is also essential for Britain's future economic and social success. Much has been achieved in the last two years. But we are not complacent. A lot remains to be done. We will continue to act to stamp out discrimination, remove 



<P>
<P><I>30 Nov 1999 : Column: 175W</I><P>
barriers and improve the position of groups facing disadvantage and discrimination in employment, public life and public service delivery. We will ensure that the right legislative framework and institutional arrangements are in place and that information, guidance and other support is available to challenge discrimination and deliver fair treatment to allow everyone to develop and contribute to their full potential. That is to the benefit of all--individuals, communities, business--in a healthy, modern, diverse society.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para0">We will avoid unnecessary and burdensome regulation and will promote, encourage and support progress through non-legislative means. However, we will legislate where necessary or desirable when legislative time permits. In doing so, we will be governed by the principles of improving consistency between the protection afforded to different groups by different legislation, modernising enforcement powers, and by the need for the public sector to lead by example.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para1">As explained in our response to the Better Regulation Task Force Review of Anti-discrimination Legislation, we will where practicable harmonise the provisions of the Race Relations Act 1976, the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 and align the equality commissions' powers. This will significantly extend discrimination law coverage and strengthen the powers of the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) and the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) to match those of the Disability Rights Commission (DRC). We will legislate to remove barriers to the equality commissions working together on common issues and to enable them to produce joint guidance.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para2">We are modernising Government. Not only will we continue to tackle discrimination in all institutions, we will champion equality in every sense and at every level. Public bodies must take the lead in promoting equal opportunities and the Government will put this obligation in legislation as soon as Parliamentary time permits. Together with our commitment to implement the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry action plan, this will help ensure public institutions and services are free from discriminatory procedures and practices and should improve the position of disadvantaged groups, both as employees and users of public services. This will not in any way replace or supersede the existing statutory arrangements in Northern Ireland where there is already a duty on the public sector to promote equality of opportunity. We will be looking at, and learning from, the operation of the law in Northern Ireland. We will also build on existing mainstreaming and appraisal guidance to ensure that policies are inclusive, and take full account of the needs and experience of all those likely to be affected by them, and of the impact on particular groups in society.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para3">We will continue to take action to meet our commitment to remove the under-representation of women, members of minority ethnic groups and disabled people on public bodies; and to meet the challenging targets set for representation of these groups in the Civil Service.

<a name="91130w24.html_para4">The Race Relations (Amendment) Bill announced in the Queen's speech, will extend the Race Relations Act to public functions not previously covered, such as law enforcement and immigration. It will implement, and go beyond, one of the Lawrence Inquiry Report

recommendations by making it unlawful for public authorities generally to discriminate in the exercise of their functions. This is an important step in the Government's efforts to ensure that the public sector sets the pace in the drive towards equality; and we will extend it to the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 when legislative time permits.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para5">The gender pay gap is indefensible. We will support further action to address this and to achieve greater choice of career, of working patterns and a better balance between work and home responsibilities that will benefit both businesses and individuals.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para6">We intend to launch a campaign to promote employment policies which help people balance work and life delivered through partnership with employers. Fairness at Work measures are improving parental and maternity leave, and allowing time off for emergencies. The National Childcare Strategy, Working Families Tax Credit, Childcare Tax Credit and the National Minimum Wage are all bringing benefits and removing barriers for women and men. We will consult on changes to Tribunal procedures to speed up and simplify equal pay claims.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para7">The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 lags behind sex and race legislation in the protection it provides for disabled people. The establishment of a Disability Rights Commission, in April 2000, will address one of the Act's major weaknesses but there are other gaps in coverage. The Disability Rights Task Force, which has been looking at securing comprehensive rights for disabled people, will report shortly. The Government will carefully consider its recommendations. But we are committed to improving the rights of disabled people. Where appropriate legislative opportunities arise, we shall use them to pursue this commitment.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para8">Further legislation is not enough in itself. Changing negative attitudes towards disability, and indeed all forms of discrimination, is crucially important. We shall continue with our campaign to address the lack of knowledge of disability issues and raise awareness among service providers' of their duties to improve access for disabled people.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para9">We are certain that a great deal of progress can be made through the provision of information and guidance to ensure awareness of rights and responsibilities. The Government have already produced a Code of Practice on discrimination in employment based on age and proposes, in conjunction with the EOC, preparing a Code of Practice on discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. Evaluation of the effectiveness of this Code and consideration of developments in other areas will inform any future decision on the need for legislation.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para10">The Government are alive to the concerns that have been expressed about the issue of religious discrimination, and to the case for it to be made subject to the law. However, this issue raises many difficult, sensitive and complex questions. We have commissioned research to try to assess the current scale and nature of religious discrimination, and the extent to which it overlaps with racial discrimination, in mainland Britain. The results, due in autumn 2000, will help to inform our thinking about the appropriate response.




<P>
<P><I>30 Nov 1999 : Column: 177W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para11">Clarification of the law and advice will be provided in a number of areas to encourage the adoption of good practice. There will be a code of practice on discrimination against volunteers, guidance on positive action to tackle under-representation of women and ethnic minorities, and guidance on sexual harassment at work. In particular, we are looking at ways of giving small businesses better access to coherent information and advice about equality issues. We are planning to pilot a new joined-up service next year.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para12">Overall, therefore, we intend to combat discrimination across a broad front, using both legislative and non-legislative means as appropriate, and with the public sector taking the lead. To this end, the Government will introduce legislation as soon as Parliamentary time allows, following a targeted consultation exercise in the first half of 2000; and will press ahead with the non-legislative measures outlined above. Our efforts to combat discrimination are already making an impact and will, in conjunction with new actions, continue to yield results making Britain a better place to live and work for all.

<a name="91130w24.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Council Regulation (EC) No 2821/98 prohibited the use of bacitracin zinc and three other antibiotic growth promoters. The reasons underlying the Regulation were set out in full in the recitals and included an explanation that bacitracin zinc is used in human medicine and that it could be used for the treatment of vancomycin resistant enterococci in humans. The prohibition has been introduced as a protective measure taken as a precaution.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para13">The Government's support of the ban was guided by advice from the independent Veterinary Products Committee (VPC) and the Chairman of the Advisory Committee on Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF). Reports from both Committees have been published. The advantage of the ban on bacitracin zinc is that it helps to minimise the risk of the development of resistant strains of bacteria, with the disadvantage that it may add to the costs of poultry production. Three other antibiotic growth promoters are authorised for use in poultry in the EU. Other antibiotics may be used therapeutically under veterinary supervision and their use will depend on the disease condition of a particular flock. There are no figures available on the quantities of therapeutic antibiotics used in farming since the introduction of the ban.

<a name="91130w24.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is his assessment of the suspension of the use of zinc bacitracin in animal feed on the use of therapeutic antibiotics of importance in human medicine in animals.  [98447]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w24.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The suspension of the use of bacitracin as a growth promoter is unlikely to have had a significant effect on the use of antimicrobials of importance in human medicine as other antimicrobial growth promoters are available for use in poultry production.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w24.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what advice the Government have received from the British Veterinary Poultry Association on consequences for public health of the suspension of the use of zinc bacitracin in animal feed.  [98446]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w24.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Veterinary Medicines Directorate has received a number of letters from the Chairman of the Medicines Working Group of the British Veterinary Poultry Association (BVPA) about the ban on four antibiotic growth promoters. The BVPA's Working Group supported moves to reduce reliance on these products, but sought time before the ban took effect to allow access to appropriate, properly evaluated alternative products. The Government successfully argued for a six-month delay in the imposition of a ban. Three substances--flavophospholipol, avilomycin, and salinomycin--are now authorised in the EU for use as growth promoters in poultry.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the effect of the suspension of the use of zinc bacitracin on the use of amoxycillin and penicillin in poultry.  [98443]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w24.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Bacitracin zinc was permitted for use throughout the European Union as a growth promoter in poultry. Its use, and that of three other antibiotic growth promoters, was prohibited from 1 July this year by Council Regulation (EC) No. 2821/98. The Government supported the ban on the basis of advice from their independent scientific advisory committees. Producers 



<P>
<P><I>30 Nov 1999 : Column: 179W</I><P>
were allowed six months between the Council Regulation and the implementation of the ban to adapt their production systems. Four other antimicrobial growth promoters are still authorised for use in the EU.
<P>

<a name="91130w24.html_para14">Amoxycillin and penicillin are not permitted for use as growth promoters but may be used, under veterinary supervision, for the treatment of poultry disease. There are no figures available to quantify whether there has been a change in the use of these therapeutic antimicrobials since the ban.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I have no plans to change the level of spending on sea defences in East Sussex. This Government announced an increase of &#163;23 million in Ministry funding for flood and coastal defence over this and the next two years as part of its Comprehensive Spending Review. Applications from operating authorities for Ministry funding will continue to be considered against established technical, economic and environmental criteria, and within a national priority scoring system.

 <i>[holding answer 24 November 1999]:</i> We are advised that, on the basis of available information, there are no public health grounds for banning French or other meat with regard to human or animal sludge in animal feed. The UK fully supports the Commission actions to see that rules are commonly interpreted and properly enforced.

<a name="91130w25.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We are currently consulting interested parties on guidance aimed at ensuring that country of origin markings on all food labels, including meat products, do not mislead consumers about the true origin of the ingredients that have been used. The guidance relates to UK food labelling requirements, which themselves derive from European rules. We would therefore expect a similar approach to that set out in the guidance to be adopted for the sale of meat products overseas.

<a name="91130w25.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will request that the European Commission allows the country of origin labelling required for British beef sold in Europe to contain a promotional message.  [99747]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w25.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Under Council Regulation 820/97, it is permissible but not obligatory for British beef sold in Europe to be labelled by country or region of origin. Operators are free to label beef with a promotional message (e.g. other indications as regards quality) if they so wish, subject to the provisions of that Regulation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w26.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Government has already taken a number of measures to improve consumer confidence in food safety though greater openness and transparency, putting consumers first and giving them the information to make informed judgments. Following the passage of the Food Standards Act 1999, this work will be carried forward by the Food Standards Agency, when it begins work next Spring.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w26.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Pesticide products may have their approvals revoked for a number of reasons. Since May 1997,929 pesticide products involving 229 active substances have had their approvals completely revoked. The reason for the vast majority of these revocations was as a result of a commercial decision by the approval holder not to continue marketing the products in question.

 My Department currently operates a Business Advice Service for exporters in our sectors, in close liaison with British Trade International.

<a name="91130w26.html_para0">Both operations were recently subjected to separate external reviews of their efficiency and effectiveness. I am happy to say that in both cases over three-quarters of the business users surveyed expressed complete satisfaction with the service, and well over half the users surveyed confirmed that their export performance has already improved as a result.

 1,168 Notices were recorded between 1 October 1997 and 19 November 1999. These notices were served for infringements of the Order and to facilitate the legal transport of unfit animals for treatment or slaughter. It is not possible to split the figure between these two purposes.

 Despite being some 15 per cent. higher than at this time last year, UK market prices for pigs remain below break-even levels. Expected reductions in production in other Member States should help stabilise the market, although prices do not seem likely to improve significantly in the near future.

 The UK has approached the authorities in the six listed countries as part of a concerted campaign to lobby non-EU countries to lift their import bans, where they exist, or to agree the necessary export certification. This follows up, and builds upon, earlier approaches to key potential markets, which included Malta and Slovakia. Malta has said that they are currently maintaining their ban on the import of British beef. The other five countries listed have not so far formally responded to our approaches.

 Forecasts of turkey imports for the Christmas period are not produced. However, imports of fresh and frozen whole turkeys into the United Kingdom totalled between 8,000 and 10,000 tonnes in the fourth quarters of the last three years. In addition, imports of turkey cuts, which are not subject to the same level of seasonality, totalled between 5,000 and 6,000 tonnes in the same quarters.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91130w26.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 In discussions with the European Commission, it was clear that there would be considerable difficulties in devising a scheme to meet the cost of pig offal disposal which complied with state aid rules. Until there is a proposal which could prove acceptable to the European Commission, there is no basis for seeking additional funding.

 The subject of exports to Russia under the food aid programme was raised in the Pigmeat Management Committee meeting on 10 November. The European Commission made clear its aim of opening tendering procedures shortly for the 42,000 tonnes of pigmeat left outstanding from the earlier exercise. Discussions in the Agriculture Council have been on the Russian food aid programme as a whole rather than on specific commodities.

 No such studies have been initiated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The Government's Tourism Strategy, "Tomorrow's Tourism", launched earlier this year, recognises tourism's role in maintaining the viability of farm businesses. The European Council Rural Development Regulation (1257/1999), which applies from 2000, enables member states to support projects to encourage tourist and craft activities, among other things. A decision on the implementation of the Regulation will be made shortly.
