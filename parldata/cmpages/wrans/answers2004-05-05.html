[169406]</p>








<p><a name="40505w01.html_spnew0"><b> Sir Archy Kirkwood: </b>

Defra also provided the Inquiry Liaison Unit with a submission, which was passed to the Anderson Inquiry, which plotted the legislative changes, and gave copies of the legislation and the Department&#039;s working instructions, since the last foot and mouth outbreak in 1967. The submission included a copy of Council Directive 80/217. As I made clear in the Adjournment Debate on 16&nbsp;March 2004, we believe that 80/217 was properly implemented in the UK.

counts and is considered by English Nature in conjunction with available information on the UK population and distribution trends, to assess whether the pSPA is continuing to support the numbers of stone curlews for which it has been selected and make a contribution to the Favourable Conservation Status of the species across Europe.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w02.html_para2">
The conservation objective for Breckland pSPA is to maintain in favourable condition the habitats of the internationally important population of stone curlew. To date, the successful recovery of the stone curlew within the pSPA can be measured by the increase in numbers of breeding pairs since the start of the recovery project in 1985 and that the target of 200 pairs set in the UK Biodiversity Action Plan for the numbers of breeding pairs was achieved two years ahead of schedule and continues to rise.

After several hours of talks, the Irish Presidency concluded that it was not possible to identify a compromise proposal on the welfare of animals during transport that would command the support of a qualified majority of member states, and so the meeting concluded without agreement on that dossier.

<p><a name="40505w03.html_spnew5"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Under the flat-rate system for allocating Single Farm Payment entitlement in England, the mean payment rate within each region will be similar between 2005 and 2013 even though individual payment rates will change during this transition. In Scotland, under the historic approach, both the mean and individual payment rates will change little over time. In both countries, however, some variation may arise from year to year due to movements in the prevailing exchange rate used to convert from euros and different rates of deduction for the national reserve, modulation and financial discipline.

<p><a name="40505w03.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 From 2005 decoupling will break the link between subsidy and production in the UK and cause farmers to reassess their farming operation and production decisions. Decoupling is not affected by the method chosen for allocating entitlement to the Single Farm Payment. The impact of decoupling on production patterns and livestock numbers is very difficult to assess. There are several studies on the Defra website that examine this at the UK level but there are no assessments by county.

These recommendations are presented as the basis for Her Majesty&#039;s Government, the Devolved Administrations, the fishing industry and all other stakeholders to determine future action.

<p><a name="40505w03.html_wqn9"><b> Ms Atherton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) how many UK fishing vessels will be required to use pingers in gillnet fisheries in areas IV and VII under the provisions of the new Regulation agreed at the Fisheries Council on 22 and 23&nbsp;March, on the basis of current fishing effort; [168244]

</p>



<p>(2) what proportion of UK fishing effort will be exempt from the pinger requirement on the basis of the exclusion of vessels smaller than 12 metres under the provisions of the new Regulation agreed at the Fisheries Council on 22 and 23&nbsp;March.  [168246]</p>








<p><a name="40505w03.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The new Council Regulation to address cetacean bycatch will require pinger usage on vessels of 12 metres and over in ICES divisions VIId, e, f, g, h and j when using bottom-set gillnets or entangling nets. In ICES Area IV and division IIIa, the pinger requirement will apply to vessels of 12 metres and over using bottom set gillnets or entangling nets where the combination of net lengths used does not exceed 400 metres or where the mesh size used is greater than or equal to 220mm. The data are not available to isolate definitively the number of vessels falling into the latter categories; it is only possible to identify the total number of vessels of 12 metres and over using bottom set gillnets and entangling nets in the areas concerned. On this basis, and using 2003 fishing data, the number of UK vessels required to use pingers would be 63.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w03.html_para2">
Bearing in mind the same caveats, the proportion of UK fishing effort (i.e. days at sea) using bottom set-nets and entangling nets exempt from the pinger requirement would be approximately 80&nbsp;per cent. It should be noted, however, that this calculation does not take account of the length of net deployed by those covered by the pinger requirements which is a significant factor affecting bycatch rates.

Should local authorities fail to discharge their responsibilities under the 1949 Act, Defra has certain default powers to initiate action, and has oversight of the water companies who undertake control of infestations in sewers and water supplies.

The Government take this matter seriously. Defra, along with the Department of Health, Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, Local Government Association (representing the local authorities), Water UK (representing the water companies), Chartered Institute of Environmental Health and Central Science Laboratory, participate in the National Working Group on Rats in Sewers. The aim of the group is the development of an ongoing co-ordinated rodent control strategy.

<p class "tabletext">The most recently available information is for 2002. In routine statistics, ONS defines suicides as deaths from suicide and deaths from &quot;injury undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted&quot;. In adults it is likely that most of these latter deaths are cases where the harm is self-inflicted but there was insufficient evidence to prove that the deceased deliberately intended to kill themselves so the Coroner returns an open verdict. This may not be the case in children, however, where open verdicts may not relate to self-inflicted injury. Therefore, figures for suicide and injury undetermined whether accidentally or purposely inflicted are given separately in the attached table for the calendar years 1993 to 2002.</p>

 There would be a cost attached to having no lifetime allowance under the proposed simplified pension regime. The size of this cost depends upon behavioural effects and any estimate of cost would inevitably be very broad-brush.

From April 2003, we extended concessionary travel schemes to men aged 60 to 64, bringing them into line with women of the same age. We provided funding to local authorities to cover the additional costs of implementing these initiatives. Local authorities may make more generous provision, including free travel on buses and trains, or for concessionary travel at all times, at their discretion in the light of their own financial priorities and local circumstances.

<p><a name="40505w08.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 I refer the hon. Member to my earlier answer given today (ref 170055). The Department for Transport has issued comprehensive guidance to UK mariners regarding the measures that UK flagged vessels should take to defend against acts of piracy while passing through the Malacca Straits. Additionally, the DfT will be represented at the International Maritime Bureau&#039;s (IMB) Piracy conference being held in Kuala Lumpur at the end of June. We will be highlighting and making a persuasive case for a more robust and co-ordinated international effort to crack down on piracy in the world&#039;s main hotspots such as the Straits of Malacca.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w08.html_para0">
All British flagged ships are required under the new International Ship and Port Facility Security (ISPS) code to appoint a Ship Security Officer (SSO) and submit a Ship Security Plan (SSP) to the DfT. Officials examine these plans and verify them on board prior to issuing the International Ship Security Certificate (ISSC), if appropriate. SSPs and vessels have to meet UK security standards and the plans contain many elements of good security practice, which help SSOs ensure ships are adequately protected.

<p><a name="40505w10.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The nuclear reactor of HMS Vanguard is currently undergoing detailed inspection, revalidation and overhaul as part of the refit, and will be subject to rigorous testing prior to being operated. These measures are taken to ensure the safety of the reactor, and hence the safety of the workforce and members of the public. They are identical to those applied to all nuclear reactor systems towards the end of a refit where the submarine has been refuelled. All aspects of this work are subject to detailed safety justification and Devonport Management Limited (DML), as the nuclear site licensee, requires the prior approval of the UK&#039;s independent regulators, the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate, for all nuclear operations at Devonport Royal Dockyard. In addition, authorisation to operate refuelled nuclear submarines requires the approval of the Ministry of Defence&#039;s internal regulator. In the highly unlikely event of a nuclear incident, Devonport is covered by a site emergency plan, which is jointly prepared by DML and MOD. There is also an off-site emergency plan for which Plymouth City council is responsible.

 To date, around 930,000 individual items of unexploded ordnance have been cleared from the Multi-National Division (South East) Area of Operations. This figure includes around 5,800 items of submunitions, however this category is not broken down further into type of submunition or county of origin.

 UK units report all confirmed fatalities of which they are aware arising from incidents in which they were involved and we have put in place a mechanism for central collation of unit reports.

In other incidents UK forces have been forced to withdraw

<p><a name="40505w10.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 Generally, it is Ministry of Defence policy to grant an exemption from or deferral of call-out for reservists who are in full-time education if such an exemption or deferral is sought. Therefore, the overall number of individuals who have served or who are serving in Iraq and who were in full time education prior to call-out is thought to be very small. Precise figures are not held centrally, as this would require a trawl of computer records and an examination of individual personnel files to establish the information requested. This could be done only at disproportionate cost.

 Merlin helicopter spares are acquired in the same way as those for the majority of other aircraft used by the United Kingdom armed forces. Spares requirements are calculated at regular intervals throughout the year based on activity levels, deployment patterns and mission types.

The title artificer no longer adequately describes the professional role that those personnel undertake in the modern Navy.

<p>
<a name="40505w11.html_para6">
The difference at Major and above is largely because the liability consists only of Army posts. Tri-Service rotational and competition posts and certain international appointments, for example to NATO, are not tied to British Army officers and therefore do not form part of the liability. In practice the Army does not carry a substantial surplus of officers, although there is provision for small margin to cover those in training and on resettlement prior to retirement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w11.html_para7">
The difference at Captain and below is due to a combination of factors. In recent years, the output from the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, which is affected by both input and throughput, has not achieved the target. The number of junior officers is therefore lower than the requirement. The RMAS output target is now being met. Some posts are rank-ranged. In these instances the liability is shown against the lower rank although the incumbent may be of a higher rank. Officers holding temporary acting rank are shown against the strength at the higher paid rank.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answers to the hon. Member for Mid-Sussex (Mr. Soames) of 25&nbsp;March 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 949W, and 14&nbsp;April 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 16W, on warships, for what reasons the refit of HMS Triumph was not programmed to begin on the expiry of the reactor certificate.  [167942]</p>








<p><a name="40505w13.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The submarine refit programme is driven by the need to maintain the required number of submarines available to the fleet, while taking account of the requirement for submarines to refuel periodically. This programme is delivered in the most cost effective manner through a single stream refuelling capability at Devonport for Swiftsure and Trafalgar Class submarines (SSNs), of which HMS Triumph is one. Therefore, on occasion, a submarine may be berthed alongside for a period of time prior to the start of its refit. This is the case with HMS Triumph, whose refit will begin in summer 2005, once the SSN refitting and refuelling dock is vacated by HMS Talent. This programme accords with the Ministry of Defence&#039;s long term plan, which will continue to deliver sufficient submarines at high readiness to maintain defence outputs.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the incentives to work for those in receipt of incapacity care allowance and seeking part-time work with earnings over &#163;4,000 per annum.  [167177]</p>








<p><a name="40505w21.html_spnew4"><b> Maria Eagle </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> Since April 2000, people who participate in work trials and placements approved and arranged through Jobcentres can retain their incapacity benefits. Under the new Permitted Work rules for incapacity benefit, introduced from April 2002, recipients can earn up to &#163;20 a week for an unlimited period, or work for less than 16 hours a week and earn up to &#163;72 a week for 26 weeks. This can be extended for a further 26 weeks if progress is being made towards work of 16 hours a week or more. Those doing supported permitted work can earn up to and including &#163;72 a week for an indefinite period. This earnings limit has been increased to its current level from &#163;48 per week in 1998 to keep pace with increases in the National Minimum Wage.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w21.html_para9">
Recipients of carer&#039;s allowance are not required to be available for, and actively seeking, work as a condition of entitlement to the allowance. However, working age carers living in Jobcentre Plus areas are required to attend, where possible, a work focussed interview, and are encouraged to keep in touch with the labour market.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w21.html_para10">
Incentives to work for carer&#039;s allowance recipients who are seeking part-time work with earnings of over &#163;4,000 per year are provided by the earnings rule which enables them to retain the allowance if their net earnings do not exceed &#163;79 a week after deduction of allowable expenses. These include income tax, national insurance contributions, half of their superannuation contributions and some of the cost of providing care for the disabled person the recipient cares for and/or for the recipient&#039;s children whilst the recipient is at work. The earnings limit is set at the same amount as the lower earnings limit for national insurance contributions and is increased each year.

[167178]</p>








<p><a name="40505w21.html_spnew5"><b> Maria Eagle </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> Incapacity benefits provide a source of income for people of working age with health conditions or disabilities. There are around 2.7&nbsp;million people with such conditions claiming incapacity benefit, severe disability allowance, income support or national insurance credits. More than 37,000 recipients of incapacity benefit and SDA currently do some permitted work whilst receiving the benefit. In addition, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 May 2004 : Column 1560W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the Labour Force Survey suggests around 3&nbsp;per cent. of those receiving these benefits have looked for work within the last four weeks.

<p>
<a name="40505w21.html_para11">
As at 30&nbsp;November 2003, some 32,500 recipients of carer&#039;s allowance were in employment and a further 365,000 working age recipients of the allowance were not employed. Although recipients of the allowance are not required to be available for, and actively seeking, work as a condition of entitlement to it, around 1,000 recipients were also claiming jobseeker&#039;s allowance and, hence, actively seeking work. There may be others who are actively seeking work, but do not use the services of Jobcentre Plus.

<p><a name="40505w22.html_spnew1"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 The first tranche of Pathways to Work pilots were launched in October 2003 and the second tranche in April 2004. An independent evaluation of the pilots has been commissioned and will be carried out by independent research organisations managed by DWP analysts.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 May 2004 : Column 1561W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40505w22.html_spnew2"><b> Maria Eagle: </b> 
 Seven Pathways to Work pilot areas are now operational; they are managed and run by Jobcentre Plus with additional specialist services provided from a number of sources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w22.html_para0">
The New Deal for Disabled People plays a key role in helping people on incapacity benefits into employment with support provided by organisations from the private, voluntary and public sectors. Jobcentre Plus also has contracts with private and voluntary organisations to deliver specialist disability employment programmes such as Work Preparation, Workstep, and Work Based Learning for Adults.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w22.html_para1">
In addition, the Pathways to Work pilots provide condition management programmes in conjunction with NHS Primary Care Trusts to help people with health conditions to better manage their condition and help them successfully return to work. Primary care Trusts can commission services from local providers, from public, private or voluntary sectors, in order to meet specific requirements.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if the Government will require solvent employers to make up any shortfall to the full buy-out value of an employer funded pension scheme that has been promised to members as their pension entitlement when the scheme is wound up, regardless of the date when the wind-up commenced.  [169869]</p>








<p><a name="40505w22.html_spnew3"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The Government have already announced its intentions on &quot;full buy-out&quot; and has introduced Regulations that bring about a significant change to the protection afforded to scheme members.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w22.html_para2">
The Occupational Pension Schemes (Winding Up and Deficiency on Winding Up etc.) (Amendment) Regulations 2004 were introduced to strengthen members&#039; protection when a salary-related occupational pension scheme, subject to section 75 of the Pensions Act 1995, starts to wind up while its sponsoring employer is solvent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w22.html_para3">
The Regulations mean that the debt on the employer is calculated on the basis that the scheme should be able to meet the full costs of winding up and the full benefits that scheme members have accrued and expect to receive. The Regulations will ensure that members are more likely to receive the pensions they expect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w22.html_para4">
The Government expect sponsoring employers of pension schemes to take their obligations seriously and act in the spirit of the Government&#039;s stated intentions. However, the Government will not be requiring employers whose schemes started to wind up before 11&nbsp;June 2003 to make up any shortfall in these schemes to the &quot;full buy-out&quot; level. To do so would mean that the Regulations affected schemes that started to wind up before the employer, trustees or other relevant parties were aware of the new requirements. It is possible that for some employers such a change could place a significant financial imposition on them that they had not budgeted for.

2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Manchester Gorton parliamentary constituency used to be part of Manchester Central Social Fund district and is now part of Manchester Jobcentre Plus district. The latter was formed in January 2003 from Manchester Central, Manchester South and Manchester Trinity Social Fund districts, together with part of Oldham Social Fund district. The data for the Social Fund district are not directly comparable with that for the Jobcentre Plus District.<br>

3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a set of interlocking boundary changes which took place in January 2003, six Social Fund districts were reorganised into the three Jobcentre Plus districts of Manchester, Oldham and Rochdale, and Bolton and Bury. For comparison purposes, data is given for the area covered by these three Jobcentre Plus districts. These data are shown for comparative purposes.<br>

4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure Start maternity grants were introduced on 27&nbsp;March 2000. The very small numbers of cases for 1999&#150;2000 have been excluded for data protection reasons.<br>

<p><a name="40505w23.html_spnew3"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 In February 2000 the Prime Minister announced a review of adoption by the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU). The PIU identified key problems and made recommendations in its report, published in July 2000.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w23.html_para0">
Following this review the Government implemented a raft of measures to help improve the adoption service. The Government have:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">set an adoption target for the year ending March 2005 for an increase of 40&nbsp;per cent. in the number of adoptions of looked after children. The baseline for this target is the 2,700 adoptions arranged during the year ending March 2000. Up to the year ending March 2003 there had been an increase of nearly 30&nbsp;per cent., with 3,500 children being adopted from care;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">published statutory National Adoption Standards setting out clear timescales for adoption agencies to make decisions about children and prospective adopters;</p>
</ul>
<p>





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 May 2004 : Column 1566W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">set up an Adoption and Permanence Task Force to identify problems in service delivery and to strengthen and promote best practice. The task force has worked with many local authorities to develop and improve their adoption services;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">developed an Adopter Recruitment Toolkit and a video for adoption agencies to support their local recruitment of prospective adopters;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">established an Adoption Register for England and Wales to help identify potential links between children needing families and those waiting to adopt, and so widen the pool of potential adopters for children;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">introduced the Adoption and Children Act 2002, which received Royal Assent on 7&nbsp;November 2002. The Act overhauls the outdated 1976 Adoption Act and modernises the whole existing legal framework for domestic and inter-country adoption.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w23.html_para1">
The Government have already implemented the following key provisions of the Adoption and Children Act 2002 (the Act):

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">1&nbsp;June 2003: restrictions on adoptions from overseas;</p>
</ul>
<p>

<p>
<a name="40505w23.html_para2">
The first phase of the independent review mechanism, which will cover prospective adopters whose adoption agency is minded not to approve them, became operational on 30&nbsp;April 2004. We expect the provisions on Independent Reviewing Officers to come into force in September 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w23.html_para3">
A series of consultation documents are being published this year on other provisions in the Act. Copies will be available in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w23.html_para4">
The regulations, court rules and guidance required to implement the core of the Act should be in place by the end of 2004. After a period for preparation and training, we expect the legislation to come into force in September 2005.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate he has made of the number of birth parents who wish to establish contact with children given up for adoption; and how he proposes to help them.  [169043]</p>








<p><a name="40505w23.html_spnew4"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The Adoption and Children Act 2002 (the Act) provides for two new access to information frameworks, which could facilitate contact between an adopted adult and his birth relatives. The Government are now consulting on the draft regulations and guidance to implement the provisions in the Act, and a copy of the consultation document is in the Library. Section 98 of the Act provides for access to information in relation to adoptions made before the commencement of the Act and sections 56 to 65 of the Act provide the framework for access to information in relation to post-commencement adoptions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w23.html_para5">
According to statistics from the Registrar General&#039;s Office, approximately 875,000 people have been adopted since the commencement of the Adoption Act 1926. It is only possible to speculate how many people may choose to exercise their right to apply for information under section 98 of the Act. When the numbers of birth parents and other relatives are 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 May 2004 : Column 1567W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
considered, there could be over two million people who might have an interest in applying or who may be the subject of an application.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w23.html_para6">
The Government anticipate that there will be an initial surge of applications from those who have been waiting for section 98 of the Act to be implemented. Some adoption stakeholders have suggested that this could amount to around 20,000 to 30,000 initial applications. The Government intend the framework for section 98 to be implemented in two stages to help registered adoption support agencies, adoption agencies, the Registrar General and the courts manage the initial demand for services. We are consulting on this specific point as part of the overall consultation for the regulations and guidance on access to information and we will carefully consider the responses.

<p><a name="40505w25.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The Government are playing its part in raising awareness of autism and working in partnership with the voluntary sector and others to improve provision. Some children with autism benefit from mainstream provision, others from specialist provision. The SEN legislative framework and accompanying guidance helps schools and LEAs to support children with autism in the right setting. Children with autistic spectrum disorders, including those with Asperger&#039;s syndrome, are benefiting along with others from the considerable additional resources for education and the increase in spending on special educational needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w25.html_para0">
My Department has issued, jointly with the Department of Health, guidance from the Autism Working Group to help providers plan and make good quality provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders. In February, we published &quot;Removing Barriers to Achievement&#151;the Government&#039;s Strategy for Special Educational Needs.&quot; (www.teachernet.gov.uk/senstrategy). The strategy sets out our long term vision for the education of children with special educational needs and a programme of action which incorporates a range of measures to support improvements in provision for these children and young people. These include an Inclusion Development Programme to support partnership projects involving education, health and social care, voluntary organisations, higher education institutions, special and mainstream schools, and early years settings to develop and pilot effective practice. Autistic spectrum disorders will be one of the key areas the programme will focus on initially. The strategy sets out a clear future role for special schools and recognises the part they play in making specialist provision for children with severe and complex needs, including many with autism and Asperger&#039;s syndrome.

<p><a name="40505w26.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Miliband </b> 
<i>[holding answer 4&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> In November 2001 the DfES jointly with the Department of Health issued the statutory guidance, &quot;Access to Education for children and young people with medical needs&quot;. The guidance sets out national minimum standards of education for children who cannot attend school because of their medical needs, including children in hospital. There are no current plans to update the guidance. However, the Department have been working to ensure that the guidance is implemented.

 The Care for the Family (CFF)&#151;National Couple Support Network application was a partnership bid involving CFF and two other organisations. The objective of this project was to network with registrars and other agencies to access couples preparing for marriage and/or requiring relationship support. Although a strong bid both in presentation and concept, the application was rejected because of an overlap with pilot projects currently being funded by through the Marriage and Relationship Support (MARS) Grant programme.

In December 2002, the Secretary of State launched the Improving Behaviour and Attendance Programme, a coordinated programme with various universal projects including the behaviour and attendance strand of the Key Stage 3 strategy, which provides all secondary schools with audit and training materials and consultancy support (and a primary strategy currently being piloted); new legislation in the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill to reinforce parental responsibility for behaviour and attendance, national truancy sweep campaigns; and the anti-bullying charter. Certain targeted schools, such as those in EiC and high street crime areas, receive more intensive support through the Behaviour Improvement Programme. BIP provides assistance to those most in need, though Learning Mentors; Learning Support Units; multi-agency Behaviour and Education Support Teams; and police in schools.

However, it is open to any parent to apply for a contact or residence order, regardless of whether the parents are (or have been) married to each other. In all questions that come before the court about the upbringing of a child, including issues of residence and contact, the court is required to treat the welfare of the child concerned as its paramount consideration. In considering contact applications, the court will decide on the facts of each individual case what is in the best interests of the child. There is no automatic &quot;right&quot; of contact for either fathers or mothers. The interests of the child come first.

 Truancy is measured as the percentage of half school days missed due to unauthorised absence and stands at 0.70&nbsp;per cent. for 2002/03. This is an improvement on the 2001/02 level of 0.72&nbsp;per cent. and is equivalent to around 1,300 more pupils back in school each day. The 2002/03 level of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 May 2004 : Column 1592W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
school attendance of 93.17&nbsp;per cent. is the highest ever recorded since national records began in 1993/94. These data indicate that the Department&#039;s Behaviour and Attendance Strategy, launched in December 2002, is making a positive impact on truancy. For example, 125 of the secondary schools supported by the targeted Behaviour Improvement Programme reduced truancy by 0.09 percentage points between 2001/02 and 2002/03&#151;almost five times the national average. The programme is being evaluated and the good practice identified will be disseminated more widely. In this school year, we have made behaviour and attendance audit materials and training for staff available to every secondary school and we are piloting materials for primary schools in 25 local education authorities. In addition to providing support and good practice, for schools and their pupils, we are making it clear that we do not tolerate any unjustified absence from school. Since December 2002, national truancy sweeps have stopped over 50,000 pupils out of school, almost 40&nbsp;per cent. of whom were judged to be truanting and, in about half of cases, the truant was with a parent. We have therefore introduced new measures, such as the Fast Track to Prosecution system and parenting contracts and penalty notices, to promote and reinforce parental responsibility for their child&#039;s school attendance.

<p>
<a name="40505w29.html_para2">
In order to help increase the affordability of medicines the EC supports the provisions of the Doha declaration on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). The EC supports a strategy of tiered pricing of essential pharmaceuticals, whereby consumers in developing countries pay only for the basic production costs of patented drugs plus a modest mark-up. During the last two years the tiered pricing concept has become widely accepted within the EU. A major achievement was the adoption in May 2003 by the Council of a Regulation to avoid trade diversion into the EU market of certain key medicines, sold at reduced prices in developing countries.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w29.html_para3">
In terms of increasing investment in research and development of specific global public goods to tackle HIV/AIDS and other diseases affecting the poorest, substantial resources have been allocated from the Research Framework Programmes for HIV/AIDS, malaria and TB research, including the establishment of the new European and Developing Countries Clinical Trials Partnership (EDCTP) initiative.

The EU is committed to increasing the impact of interventions to tackle HIV/AIDS. However, progress has been slow in terms of increased support for health.

The proportion of national budgets devoted to health, and donor support needs to be increased.

Great progress was made in reducing malarial mortality in the 1970s and 1980s, yet many parts of Africa are now seeing an increase in the number of deaths from malaria.

Approximately 3000 people die from malaria each day in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w29.html_para7">
A key cause of the recent rise in malaria deaths is an increase in resistance to antimalarial drugs, and the lack of affordable alternatives. In addition the capacity of health systems in Sub-Saharan Africa is often inadequate to respond effectively to malaria.

Nonetheless, malaria remains a disease that is preventable, treatable and curable. This Department remains strongly committed to meeting the Millennium Development Goal to halt and begin reversing the incidence of malaria by 2015, recognising the importance of malaria, not just in terms of disease burden, but also the potential it has to undermine economic growth and human development.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w30.html_para1">
In addition to specific programmes that have microfinance as the central activity, DFID has supported many programmes within which microcredit has played a small but important role.

 DFID, alongside other donors, has for many years actively supported the development of policies and institutions to extend the outreach of sustainable microcredit and other financial services to the poor. As an active member of the Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP), an international agency of 29 donors promoting best practice globally in the microfinance industry, DFID has been instrumental in linking CGAP with the organisers of the International Year of Microcredit.

<p><a name="40505w30.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID provides financial support according to local needs and circumstances. DFID does not maintain figures to provide detailed comparisons between NGOs. A small NGO, with a few thousand borrowers living within a small locality, might benefit as much from a small DFID development grant as a large microfinance NGO, with hundreds of thousands of borrowers, might from a more significant grant.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w30.html_para7">
In Asia, many local NGOs have benefited from grants provided by DFID and other donors to &quot;apex&quot; organisations such as PKSF in Bangladesh, and the Small Industries Development Bank of India. DFID has also provided significant support directly to large NGOs in Bangladesh such as BRAG and Proshika, and to the Aga Khan Foundation in Pakistan.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w30.html_para8">
In Africa, DFID has supported both UK, international, and local microfinance NGOs. International organisations supported include Opportunity International, CARE International, Oxfam, and World Vision. Local NGO microfinance organisations supported include CETZAM in

Zambia, WEDCO in Kenya, and Concern in Malawi. Others include Sinapi Aba in Ghana, K-REP in Kenya, and CRESCE in Mozambique.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w30.html_para9">
DFID is seeking to build financial systems that work for the poor. NGOs are not the only route to achieve successful financial services. Private banks and other commercial institutions can also provide useful financial services on a sustainable basis, and informal mechanisms, such as rotating savings and credit clubs also have an important role to play, particularly in hard to reach locations. Finally, savings and credit co-operatives, in many developing countries, serve more poor clients than microfinance organisations. It is therefore important for DFID to support many players in the financial sector so as to achieve sufficient outreach to poor people, and to ensure financial sustainability.

[170542]</p>








<p><a name="40505w30.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID agrees that microfinance is a powerful weapon against poverty, and that access to financial services enables poor people to both increase their incomes, and to reduce their vulnerability to external shocks. DFID is committed to ensuring that microfinance is used effectively, both to create sustainable institutions, and to impact on the livelihoods of poor people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w30.html_para10">
DFID has commissioned microfinance impact assessment surveys in many African countries, including Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. Similarly, DFID has supported impact assessment in Bangladesh, India, Russia and other countries in Asia and Europe. DFID has also commissioned substantial international research activities into microfinance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w30.html_para11">
Several UK academic institutions, such as the Institute of Development Studies in Sussex, are continuing this tradition of detailed research into the impact of microfinance. With the assistance of other international partners, such as the Ford Foundation, microfinance impact research more recently has been examining the wider impact of microfinance, in other words its impact on the local and national economy rather than just the impact on households participating in direct microfinance.

[170543]</p>








<p><a name="40505w30.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID has supported microfinance for many years, as a means to allow poor people in developing world to escape poverty. However, microfinance is not a magic solution to the problem of poverty in the developing world. Even where detailed impact assessment has shown that microcredit has assisted a household to, say, increase its income to a level about a national &quot;poverty line&quot;, there are invariably many factors at work simultaneously. The 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 May 2004 : Column 1598W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
status of education and health, whether local markets function well, and the development of skills and competition, will all have a part to play in reducing poverty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w30.html_para12">
DFID does not seek to estimate figures on poverty reduction by type or cause. In its 2003 &quot;State of the Microcredit Summit Campaign Report&quot;, figures collected from some 2,500 microcredit institutions globally indicate that they have reached some 42&nbsp;million clients among the poorest people in their countries. According to this source, of these poorest clients, 79&nbsp;per cent. were women.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w30.html_para13">
On a regional basis, microfinance is reaching many more people in Asia than in Africa. The challenge of expanding the outreach of financial services for poor people in Africa cannot be left to specialist microfinance institutions alone. Non-bank institutions such as post offices, savings and credit cooperatives, and building societies already reach many more people than microfinance organisations. Commercial banks are also expanding their outreach in many cases in Africa. DFID&#039;s objective is to contribute to the widening of the whole financial sector so as to better serve poor people in Africa.

Commissioning is undertaken through national programmes of research such as the health technology assessment (HTA) programme and new and emerging applications of technology (NEAT) programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w36.html_para3">
The HTA programme published &quot;General health status measures for people with cognitive impairment: learning disability and acquired brain injury&quot; in April 2001 as a monograph on the HTA website at www.ncchta.org after a project of a similar name completed at the University of York. The project cost just over &#163;35,000. The NEAT programme has six projects with some bearing on treatment for brain damage; two have just ended. The total cost of the six projects is just over &#163;1&nbsp;million.

<p>
<a name="40505w36.html_para4">
There is no ongoing specific research into the treatment of brain damage caused by immunisations.

<p>
<a name="40505w36.html_para5">
The Medical Research Council (MRC), the main agency through which the government supports medical and clinical research, spent &#163;835,000 in 2001&#150;02 on brain injury research. The MRC also has a large portfolio of research relevant to the workings of the brain in both its normal and damaged state. The MRC supports a large amount of basic underpinning work on how the brain responds to injury of all types (including stroke) and neural regeneration, which will inform research on rehabilitation after traumatic brain injury.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the sale of surplus NHS properties and Inventures to the Miller/Bank of Scotland Partnership.  [169122]</p>








<p><a name="40505w39.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 27&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> Following a decision by the Department not to pursue a real estate partnership with Miller /Halifax Bank of Scotland, an agreement in principle was given to transfer the surplus land to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM). It was considered that a transfer of the property portfolio to ODPM would enable a greater emphasis to be given to addressing Government policy priorities for sustainable communities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;transfer value and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;size by hectare is of each of the surplus NHS properties to be transferred to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister outlined in his news release of 7&nbsp;April.  [169123]</p>








<p><a name="40505w39.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton </b> 
<i>[holding answer 27&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Department have agreed in principle to the transfer of the portfolio but the details of the transaction and the price to be paid have still to be settled. The land is currently being independently valued.

</p>



<p>(2) when the use of Thimerosal as a preservative in vaccines was discontinued in the UK.  [162712]
</p>



<p>Mr. Burns: To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) when the Government gave a commitment to phase out the use of thimerosal in whooping cough vaccine;  [162205]
</p>



<p>(2) for what reason whooping cough vaccine containing thimerosal is still being used in the United Kingdom;  [162206]
</p>



<p>(3) whether his Department has consulted <i>(a)</i> the US, <i>(b)</i> Japan, <i>(c)</i> Sweden, <i>(d)</i> Australia and <i>(e)</i> Spain as to the reasons why they have ceased using whooping cough vaccines containing thimerosal;  [162207]
</p>



<p>(4) when the Government plan to phase out thimerosal in whooping cough vaccine.  [162208]</p>








<p><a name="40505w39.html_spnew3"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson </b> 
<i>[holding answer 18&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has written to manufacturers of vaccines used in the United Kingdom to alert them to the need to phase out the use of thiomersal in vaccines where possible. This follows advice from the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA), endorsed by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), to phase out use of thiomersal, wherever possible, as a precautionary recommendation aimed at limiting avoidable exposure to mercury compounds.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w39.html_para0">
Manufacturers are actively developing research programmes to eliminate, substitute or reduce thiomersal in vaccines, and to develop new thiomersal-free vaccines. This may take time, because manufacturers need to ensure that thiomersal-free vaccines are safe and effective.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w39.html_para1">
The UK currently uses a wholecell containing whooping cough vaccine (which contains thiomersal) because this vaccine offers the best protection against the disease. Whooping cough is a serious disease in young babies that can lead to death. Also, there is strong evidence that thiomersal in vaccines does not cause neurological damage to children and the CSM continues to advise that the balance of benefits and risks of thiomersal-containing vaccines is overwhelmingly positive. The UK will move to thiomersal-free vaccines when an equally effective alternative becomes available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w39.html_para2">
Other countries have moved to acellular whooping cough vaccines because they cause lower levels of adverse reactions, such as a sore arm, in older infants than wholecell vaccines. In the UK, this is not an issue, as babies receive the vaccine when they are young.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w39.html_para3">
 Thiomersal (also known as thimerosal) is present in the following childhood vaccines: the combined diptheria-tetanus-wholecell pertussis and Haemophilus Influenzae vaccine for 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 May 2004 : Column 1627W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
primary immunisation and the combined diptheria/tetanus vaccine used for boosting teenagers. Details of the vaccines used in the childhood immunisation programme can be found in the national health service Factsheet, Thiomersal and vaccines.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w39.html_para4">
Other vaccines that contain thiomersal are: Anthrax vaccine, some hepatitis A vaccines, some hepatitis B vaccines, some influenza vaccines and the diptheria-tetanus-wholecell pertussis vaccine.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w39.html_para5">
The use of thiomersal in vaccines has not been discontinued in the United Kingdom. The European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) recommended in 1999 that vaccine manufacturers phase out use of thiomersal wherever possible. This was a purely precautionary recommendation aimed at limiting avoidable exposure to mercury compounds. EMEA acknowledged that there was no evidence of harm caused by thiomersal in vaccines. The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) endorsed this recommendation in 1999 and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation also supports the EMEA statement. There is strong evidence that thiomersal in vaccines does not cause neurological damage to children and the CSM continues to advise that the balance of benefits and risks of thiomersal-containing vaccines is overwhelmingly positive.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w39.html_para6">
In line with the EMEA recommendation, manufacturers are actively developing research programmes to eliminate, substitute or reduce thiomersal in vaccines. This may take time because manufacturers are required to ensure that the replacement or elimination of thiomersal does not affect the safety or efficacy of the final vaccine.

 Our proposed reforms to the current law on extortionate credit bargains (which we will introduce when parliamentary time permits) will include a new test relating to unfair credit transactions.

Responsible lending is a key part of this, and while the Government do not propose a &#039;one size fits all&#039; regime for all credit providers, lenders will be expected to undertake enquiries that are proportionate in the circumstances.

Figures for the take-up of SMP are not available on a regional basis, but nationally around 300,000 women receive SMP each year.

<p><a name="40505w40.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The Working Time Regulations came into force on 1&nbsp;October 1998. The regulations limit working time to 48 hours per week averaged over a 17-week reference period. For night workers the limit is eight hours per day on average, including overtime where it is part of a night worker&#039;s normal hours of work. There is no opt-out from the night working time limit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w40.html_para2">
Night workers are entitled to 11 hours rest between working days, one day&#039;s rest per week, and a 20-minute in work rest break if the working period is longer than six hours.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w40.html_para3">
All night workers should be offered a free health assessment before they start working night and thereafter at regular intervals for as long as they are working nights. The health assessments should take account of the nature of the work and the restrictions on a worker&#039;s working time under the regulations. Workers who suffer from problems as a result of working at night, should as far as practicable be offered alternative day work.

 All workers resident in Sittingbourne and Sheppey qualify for paid annual leave entitlements; at least four weeks as set out in the Working Time Regulations.

<p><a name="40505w40.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The Working Time Regulations provide workers with the right to refuse to work more than 48 hours on average, if they do not want to.

<p><a name="40505w40.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 Christmas Day is one of eight bank holidays in the UK each year. Employers are not obliged to give their workers time off on Christmas Day in addition to their paid annual leave, but many do so. Those workers not receiving bank holidays in addition to paid annual leave, can use some of their annual leave entitlement to cover bank holiday periods. The Working Time Regulations provide all workers with four weeks paid annual leave pro rata.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w40.html_para6">
However, the Government always tries to encourage employers to give their workers time off to celebrate Christmas Day and is especially keen for major retailers not to open on this day. The Government supports the Christmas Day (Trading) Bill, which would prevent major retailers opening on this day.

<p><a name="40505w41.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The DTI has collected evidence from a number of sources to help in assessing the impact of the new employment laws which came into force in April 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w41.html_para2">
Between December 2002 and April 2003 fieldwork was carried out for two DTI Work-Life Balance studies. Data was collected from employers and employees to provide a baseline for future evaluation of the impact of the new flexible working law. Details of the results can be found at www.dti.gov.uk/er/emar.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w41.html_para3">
In the first six months after implementation, CIPD and Lovells conducted research into flexible working which indicated that over a quarter (28 per cent) of employers had seen an increase in the total number of requests since April 2003. Seven in ten of the employers surveyed said they were willing to consider flexible working requests from all staff&#151;not just those with children under six. 68&nbsp;per cent. of employers believed that the opportunity to work flexibly had a positive effect on employee attitudes and morale. Full results are at www.cipd.co.uk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w41.html_para4">
The Department commissioned questions on flexible working over a number of months in the Office of National Statistics Omnibus survey. The data was collected between September 2003 and February 2004. The results demonstrated that in the last year, around 900,000 parents have asked for a change in their working hours, equating to a quarter of all parents with children under six.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w41.html_para5">
Eight out ten often (77&nbsp;per cent.) of those requests were granted in full, with a further one in ten (nine per cent.) partly accepted, or a compromise reached.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w41.html_para6">
Since April 2003, the proportion of flexible working requests being declined has nearly halved&#151;from 20&nbsp;per cent. before April 2003 to 11&nbsp;per cent. after, which suggests that the regulations have increased employers&#039; willingness to consider requests seriously. The full report is available at www.dti.gov.uk/er/inform.htm.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w41.html_para7">
Data on the impact of the changes to maternity pay and leave, as well as paternity and adoption pay and leave will become available in the summer, extracted from PAYE returns to Inland Revenue due in May.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40505w41.html_para8">
The Department continues to work with key intermediaries, such as Working Families and Maternity Alliance, to gather evidence through member/supporter surveys. It has also organised a series of roundtable events, currently being held around the country, which are engaging with parents and employers directly. The findings from this ongoing work will feed into the evidence base for a review of the impact of the legislation in 2006.

 This information has not been collected on a regular basis. However research commissioned by my Department into product recall (URN 99/125) estimated that in the period 1990 to 1996 there was an average of 42 consumer product recalls per annum. Over the period electrical goods accounted for 47&nbsp;per cent. of recalls, non-electrical toys 17 per cent, childcare articles seven per cent., clothing seven per cent., houseware four per cent., furniture four per cent., gas appliances three per cent., personal care products three per cent. and others nine per cent. The main hazards for which recalls were made were electrical 25per cent, choking 15&nbsp;per cent., fire/overheating 15&nbsp;per cent., loosening or collapse 13&nbsp;per cent., fracture nine per cent., electric shock six per cent., sharp object four per cent. and others 14&nbsp;per cent. There is no corresponding information available about the names of the manufacturers or retailers involved or on the cost of the product.

Customer complaints were the main trigger for 71&nbsp;per cent. of product recalls, while eight per cent. resulted from contacts made by trading standards officers following complaints made to them by consumers.

<p><a name="40505w43.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The effectiveness of a product recall depends on a number of factors including the type of product, its value and the way in which the recall is communicated to consumers. In November 1999 the Department, in conjunction with the Confederation of British Industry and the British Retail Consortium, published a guide (&quot;Consumer Product Recall&#151;A Good Practice Guide&quot; URN 99/1172) aimed at helping businesses take prompt action to recall unsafe products from consumers.

<p><a name="40505w43.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 The Department is in the process of transposing the General Product Safety Directive 2001. This is a difficult process, which we need to get right. It is taking time because of the complexity of some of the new provisions, especially the wording of the last resort power to order product recall. Here we are seeking to ensure that the provision is implemented in a way that is responsive to the needs of consumers while remaining balanced and proportionate to the risk. There have also been delays at the European Commission in providing guidance to support some important practical aspects of the Directive.

<p><a name="40505w43.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 Recalls in the UK are currently undertaken on a voluntary basis, so the decision whether to recall a product is one for the manufacturer or distributor. The legislation that transposes the revised General Product Safety Directive (2001/95/EC) will introduce a mandatory recall power in the UK for the first time. Following transposition producers will continue to be encouraged to act voluntarily where necessary. There are already powers for enforcement authorities to require companies to withdraw unsafe products from sale.

<p><a name="40505w43.html_spnew12"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 There are no historic records available on when and whether the UK has notified other countries of a voluntary recall undertaken by producers here or of recalls undertaken overseas and notified to us. However since January 2004 when the revised GPSD (2001/95) requires notification of both voluntary and compulsory measures the UK has received one notification from Germany about a voluntary recall. This concerned a children&#039;s jigsaw puzzle presenting a choking hazard. The Department has circulated the alert to the local authority trading standards departments.
