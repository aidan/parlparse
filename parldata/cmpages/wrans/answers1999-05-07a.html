<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General if he will recommend guidelines to other Government Departments as to <i>(a)</i> when it is appropriate to instruct Queen's Counsel and <i>(b)</i> how much it is appropriate to pay Queen's Counsel; and if he will make a statement.  [83548]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 In civil cases involving Government Departments, recourse would first be had to the four panels of junior counsel maintained by the Attorney-General to undertake Government civil litigation. In appropriate cases, First Treasury Counsel (Common Law) or First Treasury Counsel (Chancery), both of whom are junior counsel, would be instructed. In considering whether to instruct a Queen's Counsel in a particular case, consideration would be given to the importance and sensitivity of the case, the complexity of the law, the weight and complexity of the evidence, and the degree of experience and expertise required. My approval is required before a Queen's Counsel can be instructed. No need is seen, therefore, for further guidance.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para0">As regards purely advisory work, each Department is responsible for its own policy on when to instruct Queen's Counsel but takes into account the same or similar factors as those set out above. All Departments have access to the four panels maintained by the Attorney-General and to the services of Treasury Counsel.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para1">Fees paid to Queen's Counsel are negotiated on a case-by-case basis either by the Treasury Solicitor or by the Department concerned and counsel or counsel's clerk. The appropriate fee will depend on the particular circumstances of the case and is a budgetary matter for the Department concerned.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para2">As regards prosecution work carried out by the Department of Trade and Industry, Her Majesty's Customs and Excise, the Inland Revenue and the Departments of Health and Social Security, the Attorney-General maintains a list of advocates considered suitable to undertake such work. Three of those Departments have Standing Counsel, all junior counsel, who will undertake the heaviest and most serious of prosecutions. Usually, only where Standing Counsel is not available or where the case calls for a particular specialist knowledge would consideration be given to the instruction of a Queen's Counsel. The factors taken into consideration in deciding whether Queen's Counsel should be instructed are as set out above. All Departments also have access to the panel of Treasury Counsel based at the Central Criminal Court, all of whom are junior counsel.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para3">I would also refer my hon. Friend to the replies given on 26 April 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>1-2</i>, and on 28 April 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>189-90.</i>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on his Department's policy when <i>(a)</i> conducting legal proceedings and <i>(b)</i> seeking legal advice as to the circumstances in which Queen's Counsel should be instructed; and for each of the last three years (i) on how many occasions his Department instructed Queen's Counsel and (ii) what was the total cost of instructing Queen's Counsel.  [81755]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 April 1999]:</i> The Department predominantly uses junior Counsel when it is necessary to instruct Counsel to conduct legal proceedings or to provide legal advice. In many important matters, the Department will instruct First Treasury Counsel (Common Law) to represent or advise the Department without the assistance of a Queen's Counsel. In the great majority of other legal proceedings, and for advice on other matters, Counsel will be instructed from one of the Panels of junior Counsel maintained by the Attorney-General.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para4">In a small minority of cases, the Department will seek the approval of the Attorney-General for the instruction of Queen's Counsel. In seeking this approval, the Department will take into account, among other things, the importance and sensitivity of the case, the complexity of the law, and the degree of experience and expertise required.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para5">The Department has instructed seven Queen's Counsel since 1 May 1997, one of them in two different matters. On the information so far available to the Department, the cost of doing so was &#163;21,749.25. Information on Queen's Counsel instructed before 1 May 1997 is available to the Department only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what estimate he has made of the proportion of deep-mined coal from Wales that is supplied to electricity power stations supplying the National Grid.  [82242]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 This information is commercially confidential, but on the basis of the available information, I would estimate that about a quarter of Welsh deep-mine production was sold to major power producers in 1997.

<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The latest information indicates that, in the Employment Service's North East Wales Unit of Delivery for the New Deal (which includes the Alyn and Deeside parliamentary constituency), nearly 970 people have joined the New Deal for 18-24s. 270 young people have secured employment (195 of these are in unsubsidised jobs), and over 180 more have entered education, training, or work experience.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para6">I am delighted by the positive start made by the New Deal. I am grateful for the enthusiasm and support of the wide range of organisations which are working in partnership to deliver the New Deal. In particular, I welcome the contribution of employers, over 300 of whom have signed up for the New Deal in North East Wales.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how much cash he has made available to Flintshire local education authority to refurbish schools; and if he will make a statement.  [82730]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 By the end of the 1999-2000 financial year, Flintshire will have been allocated over &#163;1.45 million as its share of the Additional Capital Funding for Schools initiative.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para7">This is in addition to its normal capital allocations. Flintshire's non-housing Basic Credit Approval for 1999-2000 is &#163;4.582 million. It is for the authority to decide on the level of resources devoted to schools.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para8">Following the transfer of functions this issue will become a matter for the National Assembly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales when he plans to announce the objective 2 status map for Wales; and if he will make a statement.  [82733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The UK Government are currently undertaking a consultation exercise to discover from local and regional partners their views on possible eligible areas under objective 2. This would include comments on the geographical areas; the NUTS level; and the criteria that might be used to determine eligibility.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para9">The Government will then propose areas to receive objective 2 status. Any decisions by the UK Government are subject to agreement with the European Commission. It is hoped that an objective 2 map for the UK, including Wales, will be settled by the Autumn.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 A detailed recovery plan has yet to be submitted to the Health and Social Services Executive by the Eastern Health and Social Services Board, since the final outturn position of the Board for 1998-99 has still to be confirmed. The recovery strategy proposed by the Board 



<P>
<P><I>7 May 1999 : Column: 468</I><P>
suggests that it should recover its deficit over the two year period of 1999-2000 and 2000-01. The Executive will consider, approve and monitor the implementation of a Financial Recovery Plan once the deficit has been accurately established. Current estimates are that the deficit will represent approximately 1 per cent. of the Board's annual expenditure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Opik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment she has made of the performance of health and social services boards and trusts in Northern Ireland of their statutory duties under the <i>(a)</i> Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986 and the <i>(b)</i> Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995.  [82545]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 It is the duty of the Mental Health Commission for Northern Ireland to keep under review the exercise of the powers and the discharge of the duties conferred on the health and social services by the Mental Health (Northern Ireland) Order 1986. Information on the exercise of the powers is contained in the Commission's annual published report. I have arranged for copies to be placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para10">Last year, the Department of Health and Social Services carried out a survey of Health and Social Services Trusts with regard to the performance of their statutory duties under the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995. This indicated that, in general, trusts were providing personal social services for children in need and their families in accordance with Part IV of the Order. However, there were some deficiencies, notably in the level of a suitable range of residential services. This particular issue is being addressed at present by the Department, in conjunction with the Health and Social Services Boards, within the context of "Children Matter", the Department's Review of Residential Services in Northern Ireland, with the aim of improving the position in both the short term and the long term.
<P>

<a name="90507w01.htm_para11">The Department will continue to monitor the performance of trusts in the delivery of services for children in need and their families on an annual basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the total debt outstanding in relation to health and personal social services in Northern Ireland for each <i>(a)</i> board and <i>(b)</i> trust; and if she will make a statement.  [82551]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 The total debt outstanding in relation to health and personal social services in Northern Ireland for each <i>(a)</i> board and <i>(b)</i> trust as at 31 March 1998 is disclosed in the table. This information was extracted from 1997-98 Accounts of the HSS bodies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make it his policy to provide national insurance credits that count towards the new national insurance contribution condition for incapacity benefit proposed in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill to working members of households in receipt of working families or disabled persons tax credits whose earnings are below the lower earnings limit; and if he will make a statement.  [82705]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90507w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 There are two contribution conditions for Incapacity Benefit. The first condition requires a minimum number of paid contributions and cannot be satisfied by credits. The provisions in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill will change this condition so that the minimum number of contributions will need to have been paid in one of the two tax years before the claim for benefit rather than, as now, in any year.
<P>

<a name="90507w02.htm_para0">The second contribution condition can be satisfied by credits. People on Disability Working Allowance (and, in future, Disabled Persons Tax Credit) who have earnings below the Lower Earnings Limit are given credits which count towards the second contribution condition. Family Credit (and, in future, Working Families Tax Credit) do not provide credits of this kind. The second contribution condition is unaffected by the provisions in the Bill.

 The Government's manifesto pledge is to reduce the size of infant classes to 30 or below. The evidence of Ofsted and others is that class size matters most in the early years when children are learning the basics. As a result of an investment of &#163;67 million there were some 130,000 fewer infants in classes of over 30 in January this year than in January 1998. And we have announced that from September this year we expect a further reduction of 150,000 meaning that the number of infants in classes over thirty will be 200,000 compared to 485,000 in January 1998.

That is why swimming is a statutory element of the primary National Curriculum, giving all young people the opportunity to learn to enjoy it. Sport England has a facilities strategy in place, covering both excellence and recreational swimming; the sport has received &#163;280,000 exchequer funding for 1999-2000; and has been awarded &#163;184 million Lottery funding to date, which is more than for any other single sport. In addition, between January and September of this year, &#163;2 million of Lottery funds have been allocated to top individual British swimmers under the World Class Performance Programme, and &#163;750,000 towards excellence in disabled swimming, which is laying the foundations for future British success.

 <i>[holding answer 20 April 1999]:</i> There is no maximum distance to which it can be guaranteed that bees will travel. But, in general, bee foraging behaviour is well understood and one member of ACRE is an expert on bees and their behaviour. When foraging a crop with high flower density, a bee may fly for some metres, possibly hundreds of metres, to a particular area of the crop. ACRE always take account of pollen dispersal by bees and its likely consequences. Based on the type of GM plant, how it has been modified and the circumstances of the proposed release, it may be judged necessary to minimise the potential for cross-pollination of neighbouring sexually compatible crops or wild relatives by the GM plants. The precautions taken to prevent or reduce cross-pollination may include the removal of flowers or the setting of specific isolation distances between GM and non-GM plants or borders of non-GM plants around the plots of GM plants. Where isolation distances are set, these are not intended to prevent pollen spread but to reduce pollen spread as far as is practically possible.

 <i>[holding answer 5 May 1999]:</i> Substantial progress has been made in the assessment and strengthening programme. The latest figures available to DETR show that, of 41,602 local authority structures, 35,647 have been assessed, with over 30,000 being of adequate standard, and 3,250 local road bridges have been strengthened.

 On 29 April--the same day that the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) imposed a 20 mph speed restriction on trains using the Severn Tunnel--the Rail Regulator called for an urgent report from Railtrack explaining why its maintenance procedures had not been sufficient to avoid the enforcement action taken by the HSE, and the plans it had for putting the matter right. Railtrack submitted that report on 4 May, and the Rail Regulator is currently considering it.

 Today we are announcing a restructuring of the UK's reserve holdings to achieve a better balance in the portfolio by increasing the proportion held in currency. This will involve a programme of auctions of gold from the Exchange Equalisation Account, which holds the UK's official reserves of foreign currency and gold, with the proceeds being invested instead in foreign currency assets and retained in the reserves.

<a name="90507w04.htm_para3">The Treasury intends to sell 125 tonnes of gold, 3 per cent. of the total reserves, during 1999-2000, with the Bank of England conducting five auctions on the Treasury's behalf. Auctions will be held every other month starting in July.

 Immigration advice is largely unregulated and so it is difficult to estimate the number of immigration advisers operating in England and Wales.

 It is intended that all applicants will be required to pay for certificates from the Criminal Records Bureau. It is difficult to estimate what the cost of free certificates would be to the Bureau, as it is not known how many volunteers would be required to apply for certificates, but the cost is potentially enormous. If checks were provided only to new volunteers seeking the higher levels of checks the cost could exceed &#163;10 million a year. If checks were extended to all existing volunteers the cost could be between &#163;40-&#163;200 million. The cost of the fees for certificates from the Bureau will be kept to the minimum necessary to recoup costs.
