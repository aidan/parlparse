 Of the 17 distinct stops on the visitor route, only St. Stephen&#039;s Hall is entirely inaccessible to wheelchair users. Wheelchair users can view the Lords Chamber from alongside the throne and from the Bar of the House, but cannot transit the Chamber due to the narrow space between the benches and the Table of the House.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60109w01.html_spnew1"><b> Nick Harvey: </b> 
 There is no reason to suggest that the erection of the Chamber screen has had any impact on numbers of visitors to the Public Gallery. In the year April 2003 to March 2004 before the temporary security screen was in place there were 107,136 visitors from the public queue and 10,355 from Members&#039; allocated tickets (total 117,491). From April 2004 to March 2005 with the screen in place the corresponding figures were

111,846 from the public queue and 10,329 from Members&#039; allocations (total 122,175). I refer the hon. Member to my answer to the hon.

 To ask the Solicitor-General in which areas primary responsibility for decisions to charge for offences has been passed from the police to the Crown Prosecution Service; and what the clear-up rates for crime in <i>(a)</i> the year before and <i>(b)</i> the year after implementation of the policy were in each case.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60109w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 To date, 30 areas are operating under statutory charging. The remaining 12 areas have been operating shadow charging schemes since 2003, whereby charging is operating on a non-mandatory basis, which mirrors as closely as possible statutory charging arrangements between 9 am and 5 pm Monday to Friday. These remaining areas are scheduled to move onto statutory charging by April 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The expected benefits of the charging scheme are a reduction in the rate of discontinuance, an increase in the guilty plea rate, and a reduction in the rate of attrition.

 For payments under the Entry Level Scheme there is no regulatory deadline by which payments must be made.

A number of steps have been introduced this year to mitigate against the impact of later than planned delivery. Therefore interest on delayed payments is not appropriate. The Single Payment Scheme has a regulatory payment window which runs from 1 December to 30 June each year. Consideration would not be given to paying interest until this period has expired.

In particular, whilst the volume of Stage 1 complaints undoubtedly rose between 2002/3 and 2003/4, this is likely to have been due in part to more rigorous recording of complaints received at the time, and the introduction by the Agency of a three tier complaints process during 2003/04.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_11">The three tier complaints process comprises of; Stage 1 complaints from clients which are dealt with by the Complaints Resolution Team located within each of the Agency&#039;s six business units. Stage 2 complaints which are an escalation to the relevant Area Director when the client is not satisfied with the outcome of stage 1, and stage 3 which is an escalation to the Chief Executive if the client remains dissatisfied.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">Complaints are also received into the Agency from MPs, or via MPs from a member of the public.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">The outcome of whether a complaint to the Agency is upheld is not recorded. However, as described above, clients are signposted to the next level of the process should they remain dissatisfied. The table below shows the volume of cases escalated to stages two and three, for which information is available. Once these internal avenues have been exhausted, the client may wish to contact the Independent Case Examiner (ICE), their MP or, via their MP, to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration.</p>

<sup>(10)</sup>While the agency did receive stage 1 telephone complaints prior to 2002&#150;03, their volumes were not recorded, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(11)</sup>Although 671 stage 1 telephone complaints were recorded between December 2002 and March 2003, their volumes were not recorded throughout the whole year, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(12)</sup>While the agency did receive complaints directly to the chief executive, treat official complaints, and MP complaints to business units prior to 2000&#150;01, their volumes were not recorded, thus preventing meaningful comparison with later years.<br>

<sup>(13)</sup>During 2003&#150;04 complaints sent directly to the chief executive were not recorded separately from those complaints, which were escalated to him as part of the 3 stage process. Therefore, although 7,183 complaints in total were received during 2003&#150;04, it is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the chief executive directly (as opposed to those escalated via the complaints process), thus preventing meaningful comparison with data for earlier years.<br>

<sup>(14)</sup>In April and May of 2004, the chief executive received a total of 1,435 complaints but is not possible to separate out those complaints received by the chief executive directly, as opposed to those escalated to stage 3 of the complaints process). From June 2004-March 2005, after which time such complaints were recorded separately, the chief executive received 4,352 direct complaints and 2,549 complaints escalated upwards from stage 2. Again, these recording issues prevent meaningful comparison of this category with earlier years.<br>

<sup>(15)</sup>Treat official letters are those received by a Minister from a member of the public, and referred for initial consideration to an official of the agency.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Percentages rounded to the nearest whole number.<br>

2.The percentages are calculated by combing information from the CSA administrative system with that from the benefits system to get current benefit status. Information from the latter system does not exist prior to 1997.<br>

3.We cannot provide information for 2003&#150;04. This is due to limitations with the new system (CS2), which mean we do not currently hold information for new scheme cases and old scheme 



cases on CS2 for that period. This is an issue we are working to address and are hopeful that we will be able to provide this information in the near future.<br>

4.The methodology used to produce these statistics is consistent with that used in the measurement of the Department&#039;s Public Service Agreement target in this area. Namely, all those cases with a child maintenance calculation or assessment where the parent with care is on income support or income based job seekers allowance (including those with a nil liability) who are in receipt of maintenance.<br>

<a name="stpa_131">We have already made significant progress. The average time taken by local authorities to process new claims has shortened by two weeks. We have introduced a number of simplification measures to reduce complexity in the housing benefit rules.

Notes:<br>

1.Expenditure figures are for Great Britain.<br>

2.Expenditure has been rounded to the nearest million pounds.<br>

3.Gross domestic product percentages have been rounded to one decimal place. A percentage less than 0.1 per cent. is indicated by the symbol *.<br>

4.Expenditure for the basic state pension, minimum income guarantee and other benefits for pensioners include a small amount of expenditure on child dependency increases which are paid with some of these entitlements.<br>

5.Disability benefits for pensioners include disability living allowance, attendance allowance and severe disablement allowance.<br>

6.For figures up to 2004&#150;05, other benefits for pensioners include additional state pension/SERPS, non-contributory retirement pension, contribution based Christmas bonus, pensions compensation board, over65&#039;s payment, over70&#039;s payment, the over 75 TV licence, widow&#039;s benefit, bereavement benefits and incapacity benefit.<br>

Incapacity benefit is only included until 2000&#150;01 as incapacity benefit was no longer paid to people over pension age after that year, following the 1995 Reforms.<br>

7.For figures from 2010&#150;11, other benefits for pensioners include additional state pension/SERPS, non-contributory retirement pension, contribution based Christmas bonus, non-contributory Christmas bonus and the over 75 TV licence.<br>

8.As per the above notes (6 and 7), the breakdown of expenditure is not on a consistent basis.<br>

Source:<br>

Expenditure and percentage of gross domestic product figures have been taken from data which underlies the 2005 pre-Budget report.<br>

<sup>(16)</sup>Individual estimates have been uprated in line with 2004&#150;05 expenditure and may differ from published values.<br>

<sup>(17)</sup>Figures expressed as percentages (percentage) give the overpayments as a percentage of the benefit paid out in the year.<br>

<sup>(18)</sup>The housing benefit estimates in this table include approximations for the purposes of producing an overall fraud and error figure. The estimates in the table will therefore be different from those published previously as National Statistics.<br>

<sup>(19)</sup>The 2004&#150;05 DLA National Benefit Review identified cases where the change in customer&#039;s needs have been so gradual that it would be unreasonable to expect them to know at which point their entitlement to DLA might have changed. These cases do not result in a recoverable overpayment as we cannot quantify or define when the customer&#039;s change occurred. Because legislation requires the Secretary of State to prove that entitlement to DLA is incorrect, rather than requiring the customer to inform us that their needs have changed, cases in this subcategory are legally correct. The difference between what claimants in these cases are receiving in DLA and related premiums in other benefits and what they would receive if their benefit was reassessed is estimated to be around &#163;0.7 billion (+/- &#163;0.2 billion). This figure is not included in the total above, but a similar figure was included in the global fraud and error figure of &#163;3 billion reported in the resource account for 2003&#150;04.<br>

<sup>(20)</sup>Official error rates have been updated with estimates from the 2003&#150;04 measurement exercise.<br>

<sup>(21)</sup>Overpayments due to knock-on effects between loss of DLA component entitlement and premiums on income-related benefits.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup>The estimated rate of fraud and error on unreviewed benefits, for which we have no reliable review information, has been set at 2.7 per cent. and divided equally among fraud, customer error and official error.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.Fraud and error on CTB has not been measured before and is assumed here to be equal to fraud and error rates on HB.<br>

2.Although quoted to the nearest &#163;0.1 billion, there are considerable uncertainties around the total estimates (95 per cent. confidence intervals of between &#177;&#163;0.2 billion and &#177;&#163;0.3 billion).<br>

3.Individual figures may not add across to total fraud and error figures due to rounding.<br>

Note:<br>

The figures for April 2003-March 2004 and October 2003-September 2004 in the above table have been adjusted for data quality problems found. Previous figures have not been adjusted in this way as there is not enough information available to do so. The tables therefore are not all suitable for making reliable comparisons over time but give a reference of our best estimate of these overpayment figures in each year. Confidence intervals are not provided in these tables although are typically around &#177;20&#150;30 per cent. of the central estimates.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.These figures will not include all overpayments in HB through official error. They were published in the latest National Statistics report for HB fraud and error, and only cover the 85 per cent. of HB expenditure that is within the scope of the HBR sample. In these reports, there was an extra category of error labelled non-residence&quot; error, an unknown amount of which will be due to mistakes made by officials&#151;these overpayments are not included in the figures in this table.<br>

2.The Second National Housing Benefit Accuracy Review, in 1997&#150;98 gave an estimate of &#163;60 million for official error, but was based on a different methodology, so the results are not considered comparable with more recent estimates.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.The sample for long-term benefits is a small one and excludes some types of cases. It provides reassurance that official error on these benefits is a very low proportion of expenditure, but the estimate is only a broad indicator.<br>

2.As a result of the wide margins of error, the changes over time are not statistically significant.<br>

 In the National Strategy for Carers, &#039;Caring About Carers&#039;, published in February 1999, the Government set out its commitment to encourage and enable carers of working age to remain in work and to help those carers who are unable, or do not want, to combine paid work with caring to return to work when their caring responsibilities cease or diminish. Many people providing informal care already do paid work as well.
</p>

<a name="60109w14.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_156">From April 2004, Work Focussed Interviews (WFIs) have been introduced for partners of benefit customers in Jobcentre Plus areas. Although partners who are full-time carers with entitlement to carer&#039;s allowance are exempt from WFIs, they are however entitled to help and support, including through new deal for partners, on a voluntary basis.

<p>
<a name="60109w14.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_157">Carers who are in receipt of carer&#039;s allowance can work and earn up to &#163;82 per week. This amount is calculated net of expenses such as income tax, some national insurance contributions, and half of any contribution towards an occupational or personal pension. Help can also be given with the cost of care of the disabled person when the carer is at work, provided that the substitute carer is not a close relative of either the carer or the disabled person. The amount allowable is 50 per cent. of the net earnings after deduction of the other allowable expenses. Therefore, it is possible for a carer to earn well in excess of &#163;82 and still remain eligible for carer&#039;s allowance.

Notes:<br>

1.The preferred data source for figures supplied by the Department for Work and Pensions is the Work and Pension Longitudinal Study, for which the latest published data is May 2005. The figures provided are those published in the Pension Credit Quarterly Progress Report, which provides an early estimate of caseload, these figures are our latest estimates.<br>

2.Caseloads are rounded to the nearest 100 and expressed in thousands. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

3.Pension Credit (PC) replaced Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) on 6 October 2003. Existing MIG recipients were automatically converted onto Pension Credit on that date (assuming they still met the eligibility criteria).<br>

4.Data from the Generalised Matching Service (GMS) 100 percent scan taken on 16 September 2005. The figures have been rated up to give month-end estimates.<br>

5.These figures are early estimates. Operational processing times mean that a number of claim commencements and terminations are not reflected in the figures. The final figures incorporated within the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) will take account of such cases.<br>

6.Couples may contain a number of partners who are less than the age of 60.<br>

 The National Health Service Act 1977 places a duty on the Secretary of State to provide a range of facilities and services to such extent as she considers necessary to meet reasonable requirements. The Secretary of State discharges her duties through delegation to local primary care trusts who can contract with national health service trusts, NHS foundation trusts and other healthcare providers for those services. Should an NHS organisation wish to make a significant change or variation to a service then they are required to consult with local stakeholders including the overview and scrutiny committee before reaching a final decision. In addition, the core services of NHS foundation trusts are protected when they achieve foundation status and these services can only be changed if the regulator is satisfied that any changes are in the interests of the NHS. As medical knowledge advances and new ways of working are developed it is inevitable over time that there will be changes in the location of particular services in the interests of patients.

 The national service framework for coronary heart disease (NSFCHD) recommends that preventative treatment and lifestyle advice should be offered to patients with established CHD, then to those at a 30 per cent. 10-year risk of developing CHD, with a view to moving on to treating patients at a lower risk once these high-risk groups are treated. One of the key risk factors is high cholesterol and the NSF states that for both groups the target is to use statins and dietary advice to lower serum cholesterol concentrations either to less than 5 millimoles per litre (mmol/litre) or by 30 per cent., whichever is the greater.

 Each primary care trust (PCT) has access to the services of a consultant in dental public health, who provides advice on local oral health and the geographical areas that should be a priority for action. The British Association for the Study of Community Dentistry surveys provide information on the numbers of decayed missing and filled teeth by PCT area.

<p>
<a name="60109w27.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_263">A PCT&#039;s ability to respond to local oral health needs will be substantially strengthened by the introduction of local commissioning of primary care dental services from April 2006. PCTs will hold a local budget for dental services. When a dentist leaves the area or reduces his or her national health service commitment, the resources return to the PCT. It is at their discretion to redeploy these resources locally and to agree where new practices are established. This gives the PCT the ability to reflect the oral health needs of their local population in the distribution of NHS primary care dental services.

Notes:<br>

1.Complete leaver means the dentist had an open GDS or PDS contract in September of the previous year but no GDS or PDS contract in September of the specified year.<br>

2.Percentages are calculated on the number of dentists with an open GDS or PDS contract as at 30 September in the specified year.<br>

3.The dentist numbers include principals, assistants and trainees. Prison contracts are excluded.<br>

4.A dentist may have a contract in more than one Strategic Health Authority area. Therefore, data at Strategic Health Authority area may include duplications of dentists leaving.<br>

England data excludes duplication.<br>

5.The postcode of the Dental Practice was used to allocate dentists to specific geographic areas. Strategic health authority areas have been defined using the Office of National Statistics All Fields Postcode Directory.<br>

6.The numbers of leavers include all notifications, received by the Dental Practice Board, up to 8 November 2005.<br>

<i>[holding answer 15 December 2005]:</i> Patients receiving specialist palliative care are excluded from the system of charging for delays in discharge. In addition, many patients who have rapidly deteriorating conditions or who do not have long to live will continue to be the national health service&#039;s responsibility and as such will not trigger any payment from social services. The NHS is responsible for ensuring the patient is safe to discharge, however, some patients will have a strong preference to return home to die. If they, or their carer, need a care package, including services from social services which is not in place by their discharge date, social services will be potentially liable for a charge.

 We have consulted widely as part of the race equality impact assessment (REIA) on the Mental Health Bill in the past few months. Consultation events were held in Leeds, Birmingham and London in early November. Approximately 180 people attended these events, excluding organisers and speakers, and around a third of these were service users, mostly of a black and minority ethnic background (BME) background. Other attendees included BME carers, mental health professionals and voluntary organisations representing BME service users and carers.

<a name="stpa_309">The process we have followed in undertaking the REIA has had close regard to the Commission for Racial Equality&#039;s (CRE&#039;s) guidance. Officials and CRE staff met early in the process to discuss the guidance. We have also seconded, part-time, a former CRE employee who is familiar with the REIA guidance to work on the REIA, and we have also involved the Home Office race equality unit, which has the lead across Whitehall for REIA work. We will continue to take the CRE guidance into account in any further work on the REIA and we are confident that the REIA which we publish alongside the Bill, when this is introduced, will satisfy the guidance.

 We have made a commitment that all national health service trusts should be in a position to apply for national health service foundation trust (NHSFT) status by 2008. To assist in that process we are rolling out a national programme to assess the readiness of all acute trusts for NHSFT status, in the context of their wider health communities. This whole health community diagnostic project will see trusts developing action plans with their strategic health authorities which set out any challenges or performance issues they need to overcome to become authorised as an NHSFT, as well as an indication of when trusts might be ready to apply for foundation status. The project will be completed by summer 2006.

<i>[holding answer 21 November 2005]:</i> Following the recommendation of the Healthcare Commission, the Secretary of State placed two organisations on special measures (Mid Yorkshire Hospitals National Health Service Trust and North West London Hospitals NHS Trust). The Department works with these trusts, the strategic health authorities (SHAs) and the primary care trusts to improve performance. The recommendations of the Healthcare Commission include both service quality improvements and delivering financial balance.

<a name="60109w36.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_323">It is the responsibility of SHAs to deliver both overall financial balance for their local health communities and to ensure each and every body achieves financial balance. The Department works with SHAs to support them in this task. As part of this support, I have recently announced the formation of finance turnaround teams. These teams will be initially working with 63 NHS organisations. The teams will work with the chief executives of the organisations in delivering the key targets and financial stability.

<i>[holding answer 20 December 2005]:</i> All national health service organisations have minimum standards of quality they must deliver, including meeting the targets for maximum waiting times. These are dramatically better than the standards of the NHS in the past and there can be no trade-off between these quality standards and removing deficits. All areas of the country have seen dramatic improvements in services, and all areas of the country will continue to see improvements as additional investment is made. Progress in a particular hospital or service has to be achieved within what is affordable, otherwise the local NHS would be spending other people&#039;s money to deliver an improved service which would be unfair to the other parts of the country.

 Guidance on the use of restraint is set out in the Mental Health Act Code of Practice, paragraphs 19.6 to 19.15. This states that restraint by physical means should take place only as a last resort and never as a matter of course. In addition the guidance states that any restraint used should be reasonable in the circumstance; apply the minimum force necessary to prevent harm to the patient or others; be used for only as long as is necessary; and be sensitive to gender and race issues. The advice applies in all healthcare settings and to all age ranges. Trusts should regularly audit their physical restraint procedures consistent with the framework of clinical governance and safeguarding children arrangements.

 The Department collects expenditure information on non national health service staff for local NHS organisations including strategic health authorities (SHAs).

 People who wanted to come to the UK to work in the restaurant trade had to acquire an immigration employment document (a form of work permit) under the Sectors Based Scheme (SBS). The SBS allowed workers from outside the European Economic Area (EEA) to take up low skill jobs within certain industry sectors for up to 12 months in the UK. On 31 July 2005, the Home Office announced the closure of the hospitality sector of the scheme, which encompasses the restaurant trade.

As the SBS is for low skill jobs, there is no requirement to employ people with extensive knowledge of a trade.

 Assisting in the resolution of the conflict in Northern Uganda, and addressing its humanitarian impact, are priorities for the Government. During the UK&#039;s presidency of the United Nations (UN) Security Council in December 2005, we invited Jan Egeland, the UN Under Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator, to provide a briefing on humanitarian issues in Africa. This took place on 19 December and included the situation in Northern Uganda. A group of non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have written to my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary advocating a UN Security Council Resolution. This has since been supplemented to date by correspondence from about 1,000 members of the public. We are currently considering their ideas and how we can most effectively continue to address the situation in Northern Uganda.

 The UN released the report of its second mortality survey in Darfur in October 2005. The overall findings, which cover the period from November 2004 to May 2005, are that mortality rates are below crisis levels, but still elevated. The only exception is in South Darfur, where under-five mortality was above crisis levels. When compared to the previous survey in August 2004, it can be concluded that the international humanitarian response has had a significant impact in saving lives. However the situation remains precarious.

 The United Nations Humanitarian Appeal 2006, covers 26 countries and seeks to support some 231 million people worldwide.

<a name="stpa_453">In conjunction with some other donors, DFID is piloting a more flexible way of funding the appeals in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Sudan. We intend to provide significant contributions to both, as unearmarked funding for the United Nations Humanitarian Co-ordinator to deploy on the highest priority unmet needs in the appeal. We have also pledged &#163;40 million to the reformed Central Emergency Response Fund that was launched at the United Nations Millennium Review summit, as a way of promoting faster response and greater equity in humanitarian funding. This will be available for the United Nations Emergency Relief Coordinator to deploy on underfunded appeals, as well as on new crises that arise.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps his Department is taking to ensure that Millennium Development Goal 1 is met in sub-Saharan Africa by 2015.  [39763]</p>








<p><a name="st_465"><a name="60109w53.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID assistance to Africa will be over &#163;1 billion in 2005&#150;06 rising to at least &#163;1.25 billion in 2007&#150;08, targeted on the Millennium Development Goals. The G8 agreed at the Gleneagles summit to double aid to Africa by 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w53.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_454">In addition, boosting economic growth is fundamental to making progress with eradicating extreme poverty and hunger (Millennium Development Goal 1). This requires more private sector investment, better roads to link producers to markets, and increasing the benefit Africa receives from regional and global trade. These are all areas in which DFID is actively engaged. For example, DFID will provide &#163;21 million to the African Union&#151;New Partnership for Africa&#039;s Development (AU-NEPAD) Investment Climate Facility which will help improve the environment for the private sector. DFID also acts to help ensure growth benefits the poorest&#151;such as helping to increase the productivity of agriculture and creating jobs in non-agricultural labour markets.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w53.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_455">DFID is also working to halve the number of people facing hunger in Africa by 2015. This often means providing humanitarian support for the effects of drought. During 2005 for example, DFID provided &#163;64 million humanitarian relief to southern Africa alone.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Jan 2006 : Column 212W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w53.html_para6">
While continuing to respond promptly to crises, we are working to tackle chronic hunger more effectively. Poverty is an important factor. When large numbers of people live below the poverty line, even the smallest of shocks can lead to destitution and hunger. DFID is aiming to help countries that suffer from chronic hunger to establish safety nets to protect the most vulnerable from hunger (such as the elderly or orphans) and stop others falling into destitution as a result of shocks like drought or illness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w53.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_456">For example, in Ethiopia we are giving &#163;70 million over three years to support a programme which aims to provide people with predictable and regular transfers of cash and food. This helps meet food gaps while also allowing households to invest in health, education or increase their farm production. In this way, safety nets can also serve as a springboard for poor households which can otherwise struggle to participate in economic growth. We aim to scale up this approach in Zambia, Kenya, Malawi and Lesotho over 2006.

 Despite the modest progress made at the World Trade Organisation (WTO) talks in Hong Kong, it is not possible at this stage to give any meaningful estimate of the numbers of people that could be lifted out of poverty as a result for two broad reasons. First, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Jan 2006 : Column 215W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the nature of the agreement reached in Hong Kong, and second because the ministerial conference was just a staging post along the way to conclusion of the Doha Round of talks as a whole. For example, although Ministers agreed that developed countries would give duty and quota free access to their markets for the least developed countries (LDC), there is some flexibility to exclude 3 per cent. of tariff lines during a transition period of indeterminate length. The risk is that developed countries will apply them to precisely those products where the poorest countries have the best chance to export.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w54.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_465">On cotton, although agreement was reached on granting duty and quota free access to LDC cotton producers, the bigger problem of tackling US domestic support has not yet been resolved. Although there was agreement on ending agricultural export subsidies and other equivalent measures, this will not be complete until 2013, it is not clear precisely how the phasing out will be achieved, and the more critical issue of agricultural market access for developing countries has also not been resolved, yet despite these uncertainties, the WTO director general, Pascal Lamy, has judged that we are now more than half way to the final deal, and it has set out a potential route-agreement of the final architecture of a deal in agriculture and industrial goods by the end of April 2006; and the substantive conclusion of the round by the end of 2006.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister carries out no functions in relation to Northern Ireland. In relation to Wales, while the vast majority of functions for which ODPM has responsibility have been devolved to the Welsh Assembly Government since devolution, ODPM does retain some residual functions in relation to Wales, specifically in relation to building regulations and local authority pension arrangements. Since these functions are already exercised in relation to England, the additional costs associated with administering these functions for Wales are minimal and therefore have not been measured. In addition, ODPM acts for the whole of the UK in international forums where it has the lead policy responsibility internationally (e.g. on the EC&#039;s environmental impact assessment directive), however, implementation is a matter for the devolved Administrations (where the implementation mechanism is devolved).

The local delivery vehicle has been negotiating a standard charge of over &#163;18,000 per house from private developers in the east and west expansion flanks. This will generate approximately &#163;300 million of funding to complement circa &#163;900 million of funding from public sources in support of infrastructure to facilitate construction of 15,000 houses to 2016.

To be decent, a dwelling will need to be free of serious (category 1&quot;) health and safety hazards, including serious hazards from entry by intruders, as assessed under HHSRS. This means that landlords, including local authorities and other social landlords, will need to take reasonable steps to ensure that their properties are secure against unauthorised entry.

 The following table shows the average percentage increase in formula grant on a like-for-like basis over the period 1997&#150;98 to 2007&#150;08 for shire counties with fire responsibilities in 2006&#150;07 and for shire counties without fire responsibilities in 2006&#150;07. Please note that for the period 1997&#150;98 to 2003&#150;04, the combined shire fire authorities were levying bodies. For this period therefore the formula grant for authorities without fire responsibilities in 2006&#150;07 included an amount for fire.

When setting the level of the floor Ministers take into account a number of factors including the level of inflation expected for the period covered by the grant, the average grant increase for the group, and the scaling factor imposed on authorities above the floor. The measure of inflation used in deciding at what level the floor should be set is the GDP deflator, as this measure is forecast by Treasury, and hence is available for the period covered by the grant.

Total associated gas production from the UK continental shelf peaked in 2002 and has since declined. Production from new fields coming on-stream has not matched the decline in production from existing fields, though there have been significant changes from month to month.

<p><a name="st_667"><a name="60109w72.html_spnew5"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Where the industrial customer has an interruptible contract (either for their gas transportation and/or shipping/supplies) they are compensated for potentially being interrupted a number of days a year by paying a lower bill. Some customers may decide to reduce their gas demand to enable their shippers to sell the gas they would otherwise have consumed back to the market. This is known as demand side response. It is for the customer and the shipper to strike a contract in a way that ensures the appropriate transfer of money from the shipper to the customer. However, where a customer has opted not to buy gas, because they assess it is commercially unviable to do so in respect of their particular industrial process, there is no provision for direct compensation for that reduction in gas usage.

<i>[holding answer 24 November 2005]:</i> The UK remains on course to achieve its Kyoto target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below base year levels by 2008&#150;12. Latest provisional estimates show that UK greenhouse gas emissions in 2004 are estimated to have fallen to about 12.6 per cent. below 1990 levels.

<a name="60109w73.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_621">In order to meet the very challenging domestic goal of a 20 per cent. reduction in CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions by 2010 it is recognised that more needs to be done, as existing policies in the current climate change programme will not on their own achieve the target reduction. Current analysis shows that carbon dioxide emissions increased by around 1.5 per cent. between 2003 and 2004, mainly due to estimated increases in industrial and transport sector emissions. The current review of the Climate Change Programme gives the opportunity to examine a wide range of policies that we might put in place for the future, to put us back on track towards the 2010, and our longer-term carbon dioxide goal. Key contributions to the revised programme will be initial plans for Phase2 of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS); the results of the Energy Efficiency Innovation Review; and the recently announced Renewable Transport Fuels Obligation. Responsibility for the delivery of this goal is held jointly with the Department for the Environment Food and Rural Affairs, and Department for Transport.

<a name="stpa_622">Overall position on energy supplies was covered in the first Annual Report to Parliament (Section 172 Security of Supply report was published July 2005). This covers in detail the short and medium term outlook for the UK supply-demand balance, drawing on National Grid&#039;s preliminary outlook for this winter published by OFGEM. The Government&#039;s market-based approach has delivered benefits over a number of years in terms of low prices and reliable supplies. However, this winter the gas market is likely to be tighter than in recent winters. Under normal weather conditions there are sufficient gas supplies and electricity to meet demand. If the forthcoming winter is much colder than average there will be a need for a response from the demand side of the gas market. DTI and Ofgem have been working with major users to try to encourage this response if necessary. National Grid have made it clear in their winter outlook statement that there will be no problem for domestic gas customers, small businesses and organisations, no matter how severe the winter, barring freak technical disruptions. Looking to the medium term the Government and OFGEM continually monitor developments in the gas and electricity market through the Joint Energy Security of Supply Group (JESS).

<a name="stpa_624">Progress against the Government&#039;s fuel poverty targets is published in an annual report (the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy 3rd Annual Progress report, published July 2005). The number of households in fuel poverty in the UK as a whole has fallen by around 4.5 million since 1996, to a level of around 2 million in 2003. However between 2003 and 2006 the number of households in fuel poverty will have increased as a result of higher prices. This will make reaching the 2010 fuel poverty target more challenging. Departments are working with suppliers and voluntary organisations to look at ways that vulnerable consumers can best take advantage of the current assistance available. The Fuel Poverty Advisory Group in England published its third annual report this year, highlighting the need for consideration to be given to the resources needed to tackle fuel poverty, and the importance of all Government Departments continuing to work together on the issue.

 It is not possible to determine the average Effective Tax Rate (ETR) for each domestic property at this stage until the outcome of the revaluation process, currently being carried out by the Valuation and Lands Agency, is complete. This is due to be finalised sometime in spring 2006. The Department, however, has carried out some analysis based on preliminary data which suggests a rate substantially lower than the 0.79 per cent. indicated by the University of Ulster study over two years ago, which was based on 1999 capital value estimates. The preliminary estimates are insufficiently reliable at this point in time given the current unavailability of valuation data but the Government does intend to provide an estimate of the ETR to coincide with the publication of the new values in 2006 to allow individual ratepayers to gauge their 2007&#150;08 liability following the revaluation.

 The Tamworth Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) has adapted an incremental approach to tackling antisocial behaviour which involves letters, visits, acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs) and ultimately legal enforcement through antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) or injunctions. Serious cases of antisocial behaviour are monitored by a multi agency action group which sits under the Community Safety Partnership.

<p><a name="st_803"><a name="60109w88.html_spnew4"><b> Hazel Blears: </b> 
 Tackling antisocial behaviour is a cross-Departmental issue and many Government Departments contribute to this agenda. A wide range of funding streams across Government have a positive impact on tackling antisocial behaviour. For example Neighbourhood Renewal programmes which focus on the most deprived areas and give practitioners and local communities a real opportunity to turn their neighbourhoods around; the Department for Education and Skills (DFES) through their work on schools and parenting contribute to preventing problems escalating and ensuring families get the support they need; the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) and their work in tackling litter and fly tipping which can often blight neighbourhoods where antisocial behaviour and crime can take hold; and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) who provide the opportunity to divert young people from the destructive and damaging involvement in antisocial behaviour. The Departmental for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) also contributes to ensure a swift and effective criminal justice system for dealing with the perpetrators of anti-social behaviour activity.

<a name="stpa_742">Failed asylum seekers including families of all nationalities who leave the United Kingdom voluntarily can benefit from the package of reintegration assistance available as part of the Voluntary Assisted Returns and Reintegration Programme (VARRP). This is operated and delivered by International Organization for Migration (IOM) on behalf of the Home Office. Participants in this scheme receive help with re-documentation, flights, and a package of reintegration assistance tailored to meet the needs of the returnees.

 The sites in question predate August 2004 and therefore have incurred no set-up costs during the period in question. With regards to running costs the Home Office does not maintain its financial information in the basis you have requested and cannot provide such a breakdown without incurring disproportionate costs. The core websites for the Department have recently been redeveloped in order to begin the rationalisation of the sites held by the Department. It is anticipated that the majority of the websites cited in this question will be integrated into the main Home Office website by the middle of next calendar year. Unique visitor and user sessions for these websites from August 2004 to August 2005 are detailed in the following table.

<a name="stpa_770">The pilot scheme in West London and Leeds magistrates courts is not altering the approach of the courts to sentencing nor introducing any definition of minimal force in relation to the cases within the pilot.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w93.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_771">The pilots of a dedicated drug court (DDC) at these sites provide increased continuity of district judge or magistrates from sentence through any reviews of any community order with a drug rehabilitation requirement that may have been imposed. This increased continuity, combined with improved interagency working, is expected to result in an improvement in adult offenders remaining in treatment and successfully completing their orders. The entry point for the DDC is conviction of an adult offender for a trigger offence i.e. an acquisitive crime. The implication of entering the DDC for sentence is that the offender is eligible for a drug treatment order. However, that does not mean that other sentencing options, such as a custodial sentence, are not available
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109w93.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_772">Those sentencing the adult offenders going through the drug court will adhere to current guidelines issued by the Sentencing Guidelines Council on sentencing and on assessing the seriousness of the offence, on community sentences if appropriate, and will take into account any case law relating to minimal force laid down by the appellate courts.

 The effectiveness of prison is subject to measurement by two public service agreement (PSA) targets. The first target is to maintain the level of escapes from prison and prison escorts to less than 0.17 percent. of the prison population and to ensure no escapes of category A prisoners.The most recent data show a rate of 0.025 percent. of the prison population. There has been no escape of a category A prisoner since 1995.

<a name="stpa_810">The second PSA target is to reduce the re-offending of offenders discharged from prison or starting community sentences by 5 percent., from a 2000 baseline. This is to be achieved by 2006. The most recent data are for adult offenders discharged from prison or starting a community sentence in 2001 and show a reduction of -1.8 percent. against the target.

<p><a name="st_911"><a name="60109100.html_spnew2"><b> Jacqui Smith: </b> 
 Building Schools for the Future (BSF) aims to renew all secondary schools in England in 15 waves of investment starting from this year. Brent has been informed that it may expect to start in the programme in waves seven to nine. Prioritisation in BSF is based on the relative educational and social needs of geographical groups of schools proposed by the authority, which in the case of Brent is for a single project for all its secondary schools. Funding is not allocated until authorities start in the programme, and details of their projects, including a strong educational vision which supports Government priorities, are agreed.

 The Government&#039;s inter-agency guidance Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; states that whenever the social services department encounters or has a case referred to it which constitutes, or may constitute, a criminal offence against a child, it should always inform the police at the earliest opportunity. This will enable both agencies to consider jointly how to proceed in the best interests of the child.

<i>[holding answer 21 November 2005]:</i> More people than ever before with self-declared learning difficulties and/or disabilities are now engaged in LSC funded education and training with 579,000 learners across the post-16 sector in 2003&#150;04 at a total cost of around &#163;1.3 billion. We want to work closely with the LSC to continue to break down the barriers that people with disabilities face in accessing quality training. The Learning and Skills Act 2000 places a statutory duty on the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to promote equality of opportunity between persons of different racial groups, men and women, and between disabled and non-disabled. To support that work, the LSC has introduced Equality and Diversity Impact Measures as a planning tool to promote greater equality of opportunity in both fair access to and outcomes from publicly-funded training.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_383">We are making this additional investment in response to the national review of support for learners with disabilities carried out for us by Peter Little. While the review is still out for consultation and we will need to agree nationally how the LSC&#039;s expenditure on learning is matched by what other agencies pay for by way of social and domestic support, we acknowledge that our own contribution must rise. This is because the overall numbers of learners with disabilities are rising as medical advances continue.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_384">At a time when numbers of young people are falling and 80% of the workforce of 2010 is already in the labour market we regard it as essential that the aspirations and abilities of all learners are supported and developed. Budgets will shortly be allocated to regions and local LSCs, which will then be able to plan support for next year. Coventry and Warwickshire&#039;s local review will be of great help to them in allocating resources appropriately.</p>
</ul>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_385">We want to get the best support for learners with disabilities by making better use of specialist provision across regions.

<i>[holding answer 20 December 2005]:</i> The Department carefully monitors the labour market for graduates, including the earnings premium, using a variety of methods.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109106.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_863">Over recent years we have commissioned a series of projects using independent researchers to investigate the wage benefits to different levels of qualifications. In addition, we have recently published The Class of &#039;99&quot;&#151;a study of the labour market progress of 1999 graduates <sup>1</sup> . The Department also has strong links with relevant members of the academic and wider research community, to ensure awareness of all recent developments in the literature.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109106.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_864">The latest evidence seems to indicate a small fall in the graduate premium in recent years. We don&#039; know if this is a temporary reduction to a specific set of recent graduates&#151;but even if confirmed the average premium would still remain comfortably over &#163;100,000 across the lifetime of a graduate, in today&#039;s valuation, compared with a similar individual with 2+ A levels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109106.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_865">Serious academics agree that the earnings benefit to a degree remains substantial, and OECD data shows that the UK has one of the highest rates of return to higher education investment by international standards. But evidence also shows that we still need more graduates to meet the economy&#039;s future needs: projections suggest that 50 per cent. of the total new jobs required by 2012 are in occupations most likely to demand HE-qualified workers <sup>2</sup> .

 We are clear that we are opposed to academic selection and do not wish to see it extended. Primary legislation already prevents the introduction of any new selection by ability and there will, therefore, be no new grammar schools. However, we believe that it is for local people to determine the future of grammar schools where they already exist and we have no plans to change the existing arrangements.

 The LSC is embarking upon a major transformation programme that will make it a smaller, more dynamic and more customer-focused organisation. This will build upon its existing strengths; further develop its relationships with providers and with its partners, and help push the highest proportion of its funding out through colleges and providers into front line delivery. At local level, the LSC will develop small teams of professional staff who will support the delivery of its priority objectives through strategic relationships with colleges, providers and other key stakeholders and so ensure that the needs of local employers and learners are met. I fully support the changes the LSC is making as I believe it will help bring about an organisation that is fit for purpose.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_398">The overarching purpose of our programme of change is to ensure that we develop a structure which is fit for purpose as we take forward our agenda for change with colleges and other post-16 providers of education and training. Through this process our front-line relationships with colleges will change to become more strategic, focussing more sharply on what we are buying to ensure its relevance to the needs of learners and employers is both enhanced and increased. In examining the organisational structure to deliver this important change agenda, it is clear that we can channel many of the back room&quot; functions of our business away from local offices and carry out these functions more efficiently through a more substantial regional office.

 Many local authorities are working effectively with schools and partnerships of schools to raise standards, increase access to education and life chances for pupils. Schools responsibility for driving up standards is reinforced by the New Relationship with Schools, which builds on the freedoms they have increasingly received and also strengthens the changed role of local authorities, which is to challenge and support schools improvement, and, in particular, to intervene to prevent or overcome failure. The recently published White Paper &#039;Higher Standards, Better Schools For All&#039; continues this direction of travel by building further on and extending school freedoms, and clarifying the new role for local authorities, as commissioner rather than provider. This will be central to the transformation of our school system and to all our reforms across education and children&#039;s services.

 PSA target 5 runs until 2008. As set out in the target&#039;s accompanying technical note, progress on placement stability will be measured through the DfES annual data collection about looked after children, which measures the position at 31 March each year. Progress on the educational achievement of looked after children is measured each autumn, once the public examination results are available for this group of young people. We are in the process of amending the technical note to reflect this.

 PSA 2 has three elements. The first element of the target&#151;to increase the stock of Ofsted registered childcare by 10 per cent.&#151;is measured using Ofsted registration data. This is administrative data resulting from the process of registering and de-registering childcare providers. It is available quarterly and has been used to monitor childcare places since 2003.The second element&#151;increase the take up of formal childcare by lower income working families by 50 per cent.&#151;is measured using Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data which is sourced from the Department for Work and Pension&#039;s Family Resources Survey (FRS). The third element of the target&#151;introduce, by April 2005, a successful light-touch childcare approval scheme&#151;is measured through data provided by the CAS contractor, Nestor. Nestor are managed under contract by the DfES.

<sup>(107)</sup> A new classification of academic subjects was introduced in 2002/03.<br>

<sup>(108)</sup> The format and coverage of the Staff Record was changed in 2003/04, one effect of which was to reduce the number of staff classified as full-time and increase the number of staff who were classified as part-time. As a result, the figures for these two years are not directly comparable with those for previous years.<br>

<p><a name="st_994"><a name="60109111.html_spnew5"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 It is difficult to assess the potential impact of an event such as the WorldSkills Competition as it has benefits to the UK, to the host region, and a number of wider, less tangible, legacy effects. These benefits include enhancing the value which, as a nation, we place on skills, changing our attitudes towards vocational and academic qualifications, raising the aspirations of individuals, providers and employers, and improving permanently the supply of and demand for world class skills in the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109111.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_898">Prior to submitting our Expression of Interest PricewaterhouseCoopers was commissioned to carry out a study looking at the feasibility of a UK bid to host WorldSkills. Their report considered the wider social and economic benefits of a UK bid. The hosting region would benefit directly from increased visitor expenditure, as well as from visitor travel to and from the event. Other benefits, for both the region and the UK as a whole, would include an enhanced commitment to skills development, increased attainment in skills and participation in training, leading to increased productivity and earnings. In addition, because highly trained people tend to have higher lifetime earnings, this would be expected to lead to additional taxation receipts which would benefit the UK as a whole over time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60109111.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_899">The UK bid is adopting a partnership approach as a way of securing direct and indirect legacy effects throughout the UK. At its first meeting on 7 December, the UK wide Steering Group confirmed the value of this approach and stressed the importance of &#039;diversity&#039; and &#039;inclusion&#039; to help build a sustainable skills competitions infrastructure in each region of the UK. This has the support of the Government and Ministers in each of the Devolved Administrations and will help to make the UK bid distinctive and, hopefully successful.
