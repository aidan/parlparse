<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Pollard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what levels of compensation are available to customers of the Royal Mail's Special Delivery service following the termination of the registered post service. [124727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 There are three levels of compensation available with the Special delivery service:
<P>

<a name="00609w01.html_para0">The service comes with an automatic compensation level of up to &#163;250. For an extra fee of &#163;0.45 compensation of up to &#163;1,000 can be purchased. For an extra fee of &#163;1.35 compensation of up to &#163;2,500 can be purchased. Prices for these services are dependent upon the weight of the item and the level of compensation purchased. A full listing is available on Royal Mail's website, www.royalmail.co.uk.
<P>

<a name="00609w01.html_para1">Customers are also able to purchase Consequential Loss on top of the compensation service. This covers any additional financial loss that is separate from the actual market value of the item and is due to delay, loss or damage.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate he has made of the number of plcs likely to register as limited liability partnerships under his proposed new legislation.  [124381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 No such estimate has been made. For a number of reasons we would be surprised if plcs converted to LLPs. There are no shareholders in an LLP, and no provision for the public listing of an LLP. Shareholders in a plc would have to become LLP members, and would be subject to, for example, the potential "clawback" liability of the new section 214A to be contained in regulations applying the Insolvency Act 1986. Treating LLPs as partnerships for tax will mean that each member will be taxed on their proportionate share of the whole of the LLP's income and capital gains. This would make both the LLP's and the members' tax calculations extremely complicated, with the individual members having to pay that tax through self assessment. Further, if an LLP restricted what the members could draw out because it wanted to retain profit for working capital then taxing each member on their proportionate share of the whole of the LLP's profit could mean they paid more tax than they had received. This would give the appearance that they were suffering an effective tax rate of over 100 per cent.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when the consultation on the good faith provisions of the Limited Liability Partnerships Bill will be completed.  [125346]

<a name="00609w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The consultation paper, "Regulatory Default Provisions Governing Relationship Between Members" (URN 00/617) published in February, sought comments on whether it was appropriate to include express statutory provision that members of an LLP owe a duty of good faith to each other. The consultation period closed on 7 April, and the summary of responses (URN 00/865) published in May set out the conclusions reached.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what consultation he had with the Federation of Small Businesses about the opportunities for small businesses to become limited liability partnerships before the Limited Liability Partnerships Bill was introduced. [125345]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 A representative of the Federation of Small Businesses met my officials in October 1999 and has also been in correspondence with them.

<a name="00609w01.html_wqn4"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry in what ways his Department and its executive agencies deliver services to meet the needs of the public as consumers, with particular reference to families.  [124537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 June 2000]:</i> My Department and its agencies are committed to improving family life through the encouragement of enterprise and creation of wealth, and to enabling more choice for working parents to help them balance their work and family commitments while providing benefits for business. In a speech at the New Ways to Work Conference on 9 May, I announced a Government review of the issues surrounding maternity pay and parental leave.
<P>

<a name="00609w01.html_para2">My Department aims to benefit the public as consumers by creating strong and competitive markets and by developing a fair and effective legal and regulatory framework for commercial activity. Last year, we published a White Paper, "Modern Markets: Confident Consumers" (Cm 4410) which set out a comprehensive strategy to help people get a good deal. We also provide financial support for consumer bodies, including the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux, and have set up an award winning consumer gateway (www.consumer.gov.uk) to steer people round the wealth of consumer information on the World Wide Web.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_wqn5"><B> Sir Teddy Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) if he will make a statement on the decision of the European Commission to initiate inquiries into the handling of UK mail by the German Post Office, indicating the powers which the Commission possesses; [124764]
<P>
<UL>(2) what representations Her Majesty's Government have made to the Government of Germany about the handling of mail from the UK; and if he will make a statement;  [124765]
<P>
(3) if he will make a statement on his policy in respect of the decision of the European Court of Justice on the German Post Office's entitlement to make additional 



<P>
</UL><P><I>9 Jun 2000 : Column: 387W</I><P>
<UL>charges for re-mailed letters; and what assessment he has made of the impact of this decision on the Post Office. [124766]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 June 2000]:</i> This issue relates to the lack of clarity about what does and what does not constitute ABA re-mail which has led to a number of legal cases within Europe. ABA re-mail is mail sent from Country A to Country B for delivery to Country A. The problems have arisen because the way historically post offices have paid each other has not allowed them to fully recover the costs of delivering incoming mail.
<P>

<a name="00609w01.html_para3">In this context the British Post Office lodged a complaint with the European Commission in February 1998 into the alleged practice of Deutsche Post AG (DPAG) intercepting some international mail inward into Germany. The European Commission has now announced that it has completed an extensive investigation and in its preliminary assessment has concluded that, subject to any arguments DPAG may put forward in its defence, DPAG's practice abuses its dominant market position and restricts competition. The Commission has issued a Statement of Objections, which is a preliminary procedural document and not a final decision. It opens formal proceedings under EU procedural rules. It lists in detail the allegations against DPAG and includes the Commission's assessment of how DPAG infringes Article 82 of the EC Treaty. DPAG has full rights of defence and when these have been considered the Commission will finally decide whether a prohibition decision is necessary. If, following formal proceedings, the initial view of the Commission is confirmed, DPAG will be ordered to cease this behaviour. DPAG may then appeal the decision of the Commission before the European Courts.
<P>

<a name="00609w01.html_para4">I welcome the Commission's decision to investigate this case. Any infringement of competition rules or abuse of a dominant position is of concern. We were aware of the Post Office's complaint but have not made direct representations to the Germany Government as we were awaiting the Commission's views.
<P>

<a name="00609w01.html_para5">The case is one of a number of cases concerning remail. The recent decision of the European Court of Justice on the German Post Office's entitlement to make additional charges for re-mailed letters (in the case of DPAG <i>v</i>. GZS and Citicorp) allowed DPAG to charge bulk mailers the difference between the low rate it receives from the sending countries' postal authorities and the rate it would have received if that mail had been sent domestically within Germany. It did not address the issue of what kinds of items should be regarded as acceptable for ABA re-mail. It is this issue which the current investigation will address.
<P>

<a name="00609w01.html_para6">Also relevant is the recent rejection of the appeal by DPAG in the International Express Carriers Conference (the IECC) <i>v</i>. Commission against the judgment of the Court of First Instance which annulled the Commission's decision of 6 April 1995 that interceptions of commercial ABA re-mail did not constitute an abuse within the meaning of Article 86 (now 82) of the EC Treaty. The rejection of the appeal does not mean that Deutsche Post, or other European Post Offices, are entitled to intercept commercial physical ABA re-mail. Equally there is no ruling that it may do so. I hope the current investigation will clarify matters.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Byers </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 June 2000]:</i> The recommendations should bring about greater competition in the supply and retailing of new cars. This should mean lower prices, increased sales and increased consumer confidence. Both consumers and the car industry will benefit.

<a name="00609w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I intend to publish a draft of the Order under the Fair Trading Act 1973 on Monday 12 June. Under the provisions of the Fair Trading Act 1973 I will allow a 30 day period for consultation. This will help to ensure that the Order is workable for the industry and effective for consumers.
<P>

<a name="00609w01.html_para7">I note that prices for new cars have come down recently. I welcome this response by manufacturers and dealers. The Order is an important part of this process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Section 5(4) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that, in determining whether and on what terms to grant a project licence, the Secretary of State must weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefit likely to accrue as a result of the programme specified on the application.

 Section 5(3) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 sets out the purposes for which a project licence shall be granted. If a programme of work does not satisfy one or more of those reasons, it will not be authorised.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 We received 60 replies to the consultation exercise. Many respondents did not comment directly on the need for action and just under half (27) specifically stated there was a problem which needed to be tackled. Only four did not feel action should be taken. We therefore conclude we need to take specific action to deal with prostitutes' cards in phone boxes.
<P>

<a name="00609w02.html_para6">However, it remains the case that this is very much a local problem and action needs to be targeted at the specific areas involved.

<a name="00609w02.html_para7">No single straightforward solution emerged from the consultation responses, although there was strong support both for call barring and for a new criminal offence. We accept that action should be taken on both these fronts together.

<P>

<a name="00609w02.html_para9">On the new criminal offence, respondents to the consultation exercise expressed differing views on how an effective new criminal offence could be formulated. They highlighted the need for the new offence to fit coherently into controls and regulatory schemes already in place. I have, therefore, asked my officials to meet local authorities, Oftel, the police, the Crown Prosecution Service and other agencies to draw up final proposals with a view to legislating when parliamentary time allows.
<P>

<a name="00609w02.html_para10">In taking this action, we have looked carefully at whether effective measures against prostitutes' cards could lead to an increase in street prostitution, and whether, if so, the cards should be seen as the lesser affront. We raised this issue specifically as part of the consultation. However, the responses as a whole did not suggest this was a major concern. It was noted that street prostitution had not decreased with the advent of carding. Moreover, the number of prostitutes advertising in this way in London was estimated at between 250-400, but the number of cards produced was 13 million per year. Prostitutes outside London and Brighton do not normally have recourse to this particularly offensive form of advertising, although we are aware of small scale use of this form of advertising in a few other areas. We have, therefore, concluded that action against carding is justified and is very unlikely to be counter-productive.

 During his visit to India in April, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised with the India Foreign Minister, Jaswant Singh, his concerns over incidents of religious intolerance.

 We have been following closely reports of attacks on Christians in India. We have noted with concern an apparent increase in such reports over the past four years. We have raised this issue with Indian authorities on a number of occasions and have urged them to respond to international concern over attacks on Christians. We and our High Commission in New Delhi will continue to monitor this issue.

 The Department receives communications from members of the public from all walks of life representing a wide range of issues. These include some from health care professionals who have shown concerns regarding the funding of taxanes which has led to so called "postcode prescribing".
<P>

<a name="00609w05.html_para0">We share these concerns and this is the reason why we asked the National Institute of Clinical Guidance (NICE) to review the evidence around the effectiveness of two taxane drugs (Taxol and Taxotere). NICE published guidance on the use of taxanes in advanced ovarian cancer on 5 May and will be publishing guidance on the use of taxanes for advanced breast cancer shortly. We have made an additional 8.9 per cent. cash increase available to health authorities on average this year. This includes the additional &#163;660 million announced in the Budget which will, among other things, enable health authorities to fund positive recommendations from NICE.

(4) what steps he is taking to ensure that general practitioners are aware of the extent to which <i>(a)</i> flu antivirals used in other countries and <i>(b)</i> new antivirals being considered by NICE are available, effective and safe;  [121960]

 Recommendations on the use of amantadine (an antiviral drug used in the treatment and prevention of influenza A) are given in the United Kingdom Health Departments' publication 'Immunisation against Infectious Disease'. Recommendations on the use of Relenza (one of a new type of antiviral drugs developed for the treatment of influenza) are given in the guidance from the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued last year. NICE will be reviewing its advice on the use of antiviral drugs later this year, in time to give further advice for next winter's influenza season. The Department will consider the need for further guidance on the treatment of influenza in the light of this advice.

 <i>[holding answer 16 June 2000]:</i> The Secretary of State has approved the proposals in Investing in Excellence for a new hospital and for the reconfiguration of services across the district. The timing of the reconfiguration is a matter for the local trust, with due regard for their responsibility for safety and quality care.
<P>

<a name="00609w05.html_para2">The lead clinicians at Kidderminster Hospital have agreed to the moves of acute inpatient services to either Worcester or Redditch, in the interests of sub-specialisation and better quality care across the whole of Worcestershire. They have recently become increasingly concerned about the clinical fragility of services in Kidderminster, and the risks involved in coping with winter pressures under these circumstances. The trust proposes that acute inpatient beds currently provided at Kidderminster will be re-provided one-for-one in Worcester or Redditch, and have additional facilities to handle extra demand, including an expanded Accident and Emergency Department, a new minor injuries unit, new Medical Assessment Unit and additional ITU and coronary care beds. The Department has been assured that this work will be complete before the inpatient moves take place.

Our policy is that the relatives of a family with a known high risk of contracting this disease should receive regular cardiovascular examinations.

<a name="00609w06.html_para12">Under the first tranche of innovative schemes set up through the New Deal for Disabled People, the greater Portsmouth area fell within the catchment area of the Gateway Partnership. This scheme was funded from October 1998 to January 2000 in order to improve the employability of disabled people within Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. The Gateway Partnership accepted 356 people into the scheme and 49 people started work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The most effective way of combating benefit fraud is to stop it happening in the first place. That is why, for example, we are taking steps to improve the way local authorities deal with new claims for Housing Benefit (the "Verification Framework") which has been allowed to occur and which is to reduce the scope for fraud and error at the outset. It is therefore not possible to quantify the total amount saved by all the anti-fraud initiatives we are taking to drive fraud out of the system.

subsequently detected. A weekly benefit saving is the amount of benefit fraudulently in payment multiplied by 32, the average time in weeks that benefit would have been likely to continue in payment if the fraud had gone undetected. A table providing the information requested expressed in terms of weekly benefit savings has been placed in the Library. The data in the table are for 1998-99, the latest year for which comprehensive information is available.
<P>

<a name="00609w07.html_para7">We have recently announced changes to the weekly benefit savings scheme.

<a name="00609w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Although it is one of the world's poorest countries, over recent years Tanzania has made important progress in introducing structural reforms and stabilising its economy. Despite limited resources, with help from its international partners including Britain, Tanzania, to its credit, has met most of its very substantial external debt obligations. It has now begun to repay domestic debt arrears and is refocusing its budget on poverty reduction. As a result, the Boards of the World bank and the IMF agreed last week to support a comprehensive debt reduction package under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. This will be worth about US$3 billion over 20 years from all creditors and will be used by the Government of Tanzania for additional public expenditures on poverty reduction measures. Pending achievement of a number of conditions, including preparation of a comprehensive Poverty Reduction Strategy taking account of the views of civil society, interim relief from the IMF and the IDA will begin this month.

<P>
<a name="00609w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 June 2000]:</i> We are encouraged by the early findings from the 15 EMA pilot areas, which is why we have decided to extend the pilot to an extra 40 areas from this September. Statistical evidence gathered suggests that participation in the EMA pilot areas has increased by over five percentage points, compared with an increase of three percentage points in the control areas selected, and two percentage points nationally. We do not have information about the actual numbers involved, because the number of young people in each pilot area cohort varies from year to year.
<P>

<a name="00609w09.html_para0">We are undertaking a detailed evaluation exercise which will, in time, give more detailed information about the impact of the EMA on post-16 participation and achievement.

 <i>[pursuant to her reply, 23 May 2000, c. 438W]:</i> A column of figures was omitted. The correct response is as follows: My Department does not collect information in the level of detail requested. Expenditure by each local education authority in England supported by the Government's Standards Fund grant for school security, which is allocated directly to authorities, is shown in Table 1 for 1998-99, the latest year for which outturn information is available, along with the total sums available to authorities for 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="00609w09.html_para3">Specific grants for school security measures have been made available since 1997-98, following a recommendation from the Government's Working Group on School Security. To date, &#163;94 million has been made available to support a variety of security measures in schools in England, to help make a safer environment for pupils and staff. A breakdown, by year, of this total funding is given in Table 2.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. GEST and the Standards Fund grants for school security had grant rates. This means Government provide the set grant rate and local education authorities are required to contribute the remainder in order to take up the grant.<P>

2. In 1997-98 and 1998-99, an additional &#163;2 million per year was made available to schools in the grant-maintained sector via the Funding Agency for Schools.<P>

3. The Standards Fund school security grant is allocated to local education authorities by formula and can be used on a variety of physical measures and on security related training for staff and governors. Local education authorities are required to devolve at least 70 per cent. of their grant allocation to schools, while being allowed to retain a maximum of 30 per cent. of their allocation to co-ordinate a training programme for staff and governors. <P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact of the GM trial sites at Kempley, Gloucestershire and Preston Wynne, Herefordshire on organic farms in Herefordshire within a six mile radius; and if he will make a statement.  [122040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> Of the particular sites mentioned in the question, fodder beet is being grown near to Preston Wynne. The beet will be carefully managed to prevent it flowering, so no pollen will be produced. The oilseed rape, being grown near Kemply, can only cross-pollinate with sexually compatible crops of the same species flowering at the same time. The separation distances reduce the chances of cross-pollination to less than 1 per cent. Also, organic farms do not tend to grow organic oilseed rape.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department has not conducted any such research and has no data on any such research conducted elsewhere. We would not expect it to be possible to recover pollen dispersal from field trials of GM plants.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what statements have been made by the Government about the minimum number of genetically modified crop trials required to fulfil the objectives of the current crop trial programme. [122996]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2000]:</i> In carrying out the Farm Scale Evaluations, the Government are advised by an independent research consortium and Scientific Steering Committee, who oversee the conduct of the trials. The design of the Evaluations is that over a three-year period we should seek a total of 60 to 75 sets of data for each crop.
<P>

<a name="00609w10.html_para0">At present, the Scientific Steering Committee have advised that 20 to 30 fields annually should be sought for beet, in a roughly equal proportion of fodder to sugar beet. 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jun 2000 : Column: 420W</I><P>
This is because the Evaluations would be investigating a potentially broader range of management practices for beet than for the other crops.
<P>

<a name="00609w10.html_para1">The Scientific Steering Committee met on 8 February and set minima of 12 to 15 sites for oilseed rape and maize and around 20 sites for beet, for the programme to begin. They confirmed at their meeting on 10 March that sufficient sites had been identified to ensure that a properly balanced scientific assessment could be made. I announced this year's programme on 17 March and there are currently 49 sites.

<a name="00609w10.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans the Government have to use the provisions of the Biosafety Protocol to restrict imports of crop seeds in order to reduce the risk of contamination with GM seeds. [124152]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00609w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 June 2000]:</i> The import of GM seeds is already covered by EU legislation. The Cartagena Protocol (Biosafety Protocol) to the Convention on Biological Diversity is not yet in force, and to become so, requires ratification by 50 signatories. The UK signed the Protocol at the earliest opportunity at the 5th Conference of the Parties to the Convention, and by the end of the Conference, a total of 67 countries plus the European Commission had signed. Allowing for the time taken for ratification through national parliaments, the Protocol is unlikely to come into force within less than two years.

 The Department is evaluating two pilots of a proposed quality mark scheme for builders and other contractors working in the domestic sector, which have recently started in Birmingham and Somerset. We will use the experience of the pilots to develop a national scheme and to decide how to roll out the scheme nationally.
<P>

<a name="00609w10.html_para3">During the development of the quality mark, representations were made to avoid duplication with Constructionline, which is the Government's list of approved contractors and consultants for public sector as well as professional private sector clients for non-domestic works. This is why Constructionline is also providing the central services for the quality mark pilots. Further rationalisation would need to take into account the different requirements between domestic and non-domestic sectors and the different levels of expertise and requirements of the clients in the two sectors.

 The terms of reference of the Transport Safety Review were announced by my right hon. Friend the Member for Hamilton, North and Bellshill (Dr. Reid) in December 1998. Consultation took place last year, and the work of the review has subsequently been taken forward under the chairmanship of this Department. Following the tragic rail crash at Ladbroke Grove on 5 October the Public Inquiry ordered by the Health and Safety Commission and chaired by Lord Cullen is considering rail safety management, culture and regulation. Because it is important that the Inquiry's work is not pre-empted in any way, we have concluded that it would be wrong to take a view on potentially fundamental changes to the organisation of transport safety before the Inquiry is complete. We will then need to consider the advice on the Inquiry report which will be submitted to us by the Health and Safety Commission.

<a name="00609w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Quotas are allocated to producer organisations and other groups in accordance with rules which are reviewed annually with the fishing industry. Since 1 January 1999 a system of fixed quota allocations, based on catches made during the reference period 1994 to 1996, has operated. The Fisheries Departments in the UK are currently discussing with industry representatives a number of possible modifications to the quota management rules, including arrangements for adjusting the fixed quota allocation units attached to fishing vessel licences to take account of transfers between fishermen. Any proposed changes affecting fixed quota allocations will be subject to further and full consultation with industry.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list the amount of pork and poultry meats imported into the United Kingdom during the last 12 months; and if he will give their country of origin. [124672]<P>

<a name="00609w12.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The table shows the volume of port and poultry meat imported into the United Kingdom, as recorded by the Overseas Trade Statistics. The imports are shown by country of despatch which is not necessarily the country of origin. The data are subject to a degree of statistical error. The overall level of errors is low, but these errors have a much greater proportional effect on countries with small values or volumes of trade. Therefore care is needed when interpreting the data.

 A farmer must claim slaughter premium within two months of an animal leaving the holding, but will normally submit claims forms covering several animals at a time. Claims submitted within 25 days after the end of the two-month period are accepted but receive a reduced rate of premium. It is also a requirement that animals are slaughtered within one month of the end of the retention period.

<a name="00609w13.html_para0">In England, these requirements have not yet been checked because the computer programme to do this will not be finalised and activated until later this month.
