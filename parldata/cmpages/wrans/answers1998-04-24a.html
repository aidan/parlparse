To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to the Green Paper on Welfare Reform, if the Government's definition of universal national benefits would cover disability living allowance <i>(a)</i> subject to taxation and <i>(b)</i> means-tested.  [38867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 April 1998]:</i> The Welfare Reform Green Paper sets the framework for the review of disability living allowance, rather than offer detailed proposals for reform. However it makes it clear that disability living allowance will remain a universal, national benefit and as such will not be subject to a means test.

<P>
<P>

 The Government's inflation target of 2&#189; per cent. was confirmed in the March Budget. It is defined as the 12-month increase in the Retail Prices Index excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX).

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), I have been asked to reply to your parliamentary question on the assessment of the principal factors which underline differences in trends between the retail prices index (RPI) and the harmonised index of consumer prices (HICP).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A recent analysis of these trends was published in an article about the HICP in <i>Economic Trends</i> No. 531, February 1998, a copy of which is available in the House of Commons Library. The analysis showed that, during 1997, the trend in the HICP annual rate of inflation was broadly similar to that for RPI excluding mortgage interest payments (RPIX). During this period, the annual rate of inflation for the HICP was, on average, 0.9 percentage points lower than RPIX of which:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>i. the effect of using the geometric mean in the HICP for the calculation of elementary aggregates of prices at the most basic level, as opposed to arithmetic means in the RPIX, contributed 0.5 percentage points to the difference between the two inflation measures.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ii. coverage differences, such as the exclusion of Council Tax, house depreciation and some health and education expenditure from the HICP, in addition to the inclusion of a series for personal computers in the HICP (excluded from the RPI prior to January 1998) contributed a further 0.4 percentage points to the difference between the two measures of inflation.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w01.html_wqn5"><B> Sir Raymond Powell: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the estimated financial impact of reductions in the number of Inland Revenue staff in 1998-99; what consultation with trades unions took place on this matter; and what assessment he has made of the impact of staff reductions on the Revenue's capacity to deal with self-assessment of taxation. [38068]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue has no plans to reduce staff numbers during 1998-99. Existing staffing plans, drawn up before the Budget, indicate that employee numbers will remain broadly level, at just under 50,000, over the course of the year. This has been discussed with union representatives. Adequate numbers of trained people are in place to deal with Self Assessment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Tax relief is already available for certain payments made for vocational training. Details of the relief are given in the Inland Revenue leaflet IR119 



<P>
<P><I>24 Apr 1998 : Column: 701</I><P>
"Tax relief for vocational training". While we have no plans to introduce an expensive general tax relief for tuition fees, the hon. Gentleman should be aware from our recent consultation paper on the Learning Age (Cm 3790) that we are considering targeted public support to encourage people to open individual learning accounts which might involve tax incentives.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will allow the payment of tuition fees for full-time undergraduates to be set against income for personal taxation purposes.  [39030]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Help is already available to those who need it most. It would not be appropriate to give tax relief to those able to afford the fees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer on what basis he set an inflation target of 2.5 per cent. for the Bank of England Monetary Policy Committee; what plans he has to review that target rate; and what assessment he has made of the effect of that rate on the exchange rate.  [39572]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Chancellor set out the basis of the 2&#189; per cent. inflation target in his remit for the Monetary Policy Committee and the Mansion House speech on 12 June 1997. He noted that the inflation target will be confirmed in each Budget. The UK's inflation rate relative to that in other countries is only one of a range of factors that influence the exchange rate.

 The working group on vulnerable or intimidated witnesses included a representative from Victim Support as well as representatives from the Lord Chancellor's Department and the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers. The working group received about fifty written contributions from a wide range of organisations and individuals, including the Law Society, the Criminal Bar Association and organisations representing victims. Two special conferences were held towards the end of last year to test out some of the ideas being considered by the working group. These were attended by individuals concerned with these important issues including members of the judiciary and the legal profession and non-governmental organisations representing victims. The working group found this to be an extremely valuable exercise which greatly assisted their work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Ensuring that the data on the Register are accurate and up-to-date is a key concern of the police both at national and local level. Police forces have in place local arrangements for validating and auditing the data on a regular basis. This includes checking the whereabouts of convicted paedophiles to ensure that they are correctly registered. A number of national checks of data have also been run to identify any anomalies (such as registrations from those not required to register under the Act) which are then referred back to local forces for action.
<P>

<a name="80424w02.html_para5">Statistics about the accuracy of the Register in general terms are not collected centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The averages exclude rent-free lettings.<P>

2. Rents include water rates and services if included with the rental payment.<P>

3. Like all estimates from sample surveys, these figures are subject to sampling variability. The figures for Greater London are subject to greater sampling variability than those for England as a whole because of the smaller sample size. Individual year-to-year movements shown by the estimates, both for Greater London and for England, are liable to reflect variations in the sample as well as real changes, but the broad indication of long term trends will still be valid.<P>

4. A comparison between the SEH and the FES does not indicate any systematic differences in average private rents due to differences in survey method. <P>

 We are committed to introducing a national licensing system for houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) where the worst housing conditions in the private rented sector tend to be found. We expect to consult on proposals later this year. I cannot say at this stage when we will have the opportunity to legislate. In the shorter term we propose to introduce a Code of Practice under existing powers covering fire safety and other amenity standards in HMOs.

Where plan policies are superseded by new planning policy guidance issued by the Secretary of State, local authorities must have regard to the new guidance when taking planning decisions. They will also take account of the revised guidance when updating their development plans. The Secretary of State will have regard to any more recent guidance in determining called-in planning applications on appeals.

 Local education authorities and schools are responsible for identifying and making appropriate provision for children with special educational needs (SEN), including children with sensory impairment and specific learning difficulties associated with autism. In making appropriate provision, schools and LEAs are required to have regard to the guidance contained in the 'Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of SEN', a copy of which is in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="80424w05.html_para0">The Department is undertaking a comprehensive review of SEN policy, practice and guidance in the light of responses to the recent Green Paper on SEN 'The BEST for Special Education' (Cm 3792). The Green Paper places greater emphasis on earlier identification and more appropriate intervention and highlights the importance of stronger regional planning in the provision of effective SEN support, particularly in relation to children with low incidence disabilities such as sensory impairment and autism.
<P>

<a name="80424w05.html_para1">SEN provision in schools in Wales will benefit from the additional &#163;50 million revenue funding being provided for schools this year, and the additional capital funding being provided for school buildings over the lifetime of this Parliament.

<a name="80424w05.html_para2">The Department also makes some &#163;1.3 million available each year under the Grants for Education Support and Training (GEST) programme to support the effective implementation of the Code of Practice and for SEN teacher training. The training of teachers of pupils with sensory disabilities and autistic children are specific priorities under the GEST programme.
<P>

<a name="80424w05.html_para3">In addition to grant aiding a number of voluntary SEN/disability support organisations, the Department has made &#163;500,000 available to local authorities in Wales for the period 1996-97 to 1997-98 under the Schools Access Initiative. This initiative is designed to improve access to schools and the curriculum for pupils with physical and sensory disabilities.

<a name="80424w05.html_wqn4"><B> Sir Teddy Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of the reductions in total spending at DERA in Shoeburyness in consequence of the transfer of work to Eskmeals; and what will be the additional costs involved in carrying out this work at Eskmeals.  [36388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 March 1998]:</i> There is currently significant overcapacity on the DERA test and evaluation land ranges. The proposals made by DERA to match the capacity of the ranges to the needs of the Ministry of Defence involve concentrating work at the Eskmeals range, thereby using capacity at that site, with the range at Shoeburyness and Pendine operating only as required. The environmental test centre and the demilitarisation facilities at Shoeburyness would remain fully operational. The cost of operating the Eskmeals and Shoeburyness sites in this way is assessed as about &#163;15.8 million per year; were the Eskmeals site to be closed and all of the work concentrated at Shoeburyness, the annual cost would be &#163;16.8 million. Currently, the two sites cost some &#163;23.9 million to operate each year.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the legality and enforcement issues raised by the outcome of the case known as Procurator Fiscal <i>v.</i> Sutherland.  [39661]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w06.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 The Sheriff in Selkirk in the case of the Procurator Fiscal <i>v.</i> Sutherland held that Regulation 3(2) of the Beef Bone Regulations is defective. This judgment, which was based on legal argument and not food safety issues, is not binding on any other UK Courts, including those in Scotland. The Procurator Fiscal was granted leave to appeal and has now done so. The Regulations thus remain in force and the controls on the sale, use and disposal of beef bones, including those in respect of bone-in beef, continue to be valid and will remain so unless the judgment is confirmed on appeal.
<P>

<a name="80424w06.html_para0">The requirements of these Regulations are essential for the protection of public health and the Government expect them to continue to be observed and enforced throughout the country. Advice has been issued to all food law enforcement authorities to make this clear--copies are being placed in the Library of the House.

 The United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) has recently revised its assessment of the total inventory of radioactive material disposed of to the shaft. I understand that this report has not yet been issued to SEPA but it is expected in the near future. With regard to the silo, the regulatory responsibility rests with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). An inventory of the contents of the silo does exist and is currently the subject of refinement by the UKAEA.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement identifying which articles of which international human rights agreements to which the UK is a signatory are breached by countries where adults and children are used as bonded labour.  [39356]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We regard bonded labour as an intolerable form of labour akin to slavery, forced labour and compulsory labour. The international human rights instruments to which the United Kingdom is a party and which specifically prohibit or require the suppression of slavery, forced and compulsory labour are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 8 of the Covenant states that no one shall be held in slavery; that slavery and the slave trade in all their forms shall be prohibited; that no one shall be held in servitude; and that no one shall be forced to perform forced or compulsory labour;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>24 Apr 1998 : Column: 722</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> The United Nations Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery, the Slave Trade, and Institutions and Practices Similar to Slavery. Article 1 of the Convention requires States parties to take all practicable and necessary legislative and other measures to bring about progressively and as soon as possible the complete abolition or abandonment of, among other institutions and practices, debt bondage, serfdom and any institution or practice whereby a child or young person under the age of 18 years is delivered by either or both of his natural parents or by his guardian to another person, whether for reward or not, with a view to the exploitation of the child or young person or of his labour.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> The International Labour Organisation Convention (No 29) Concerning Forced Labour. Article 1 of the Convention requires each State party to suppress the use of forced labour or compulsory labour in all its forms within the shortest possible period;</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(d)</i> The International Labour Organisation Convention (No 105) Concerning the Abolition of Forced Labour. Article 1 of the Convention requires each State party to suppress and not to make use of forced or compulsory labour.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80424w07.html_para2">Any State which ratified these human rights instruments would be in breach of its legally binding obligations if it did not fulfil its undertakings in respect of these Articles.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what is his policy towards the proposed new international convention banning the worst abuses of child labour to be discussed at the International Labour Organisation meeting in June; and if he will make a statement.  [39676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We strongly support the development of a new International Labour Organisation Convention to eradicate the most intolerable forms of child labour. We will be participating very actively in the discussions to draw up the new instrument and we will seek to ensure that when adopted in 1999 it will be effective in terms of the progressive elimination of all extreme forms of child labour.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs which aspects of the Government's human rights policy are his Department's responsibility.  [39678]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 This Department has overall responsibility for the Government's international human rights commitments. It works in partnership with other departments in Whitehall including the Department for International Development, which is responsible for the rights of poor and disadvantaged peoples in poorer countries; DfEE, which has lead responsibility within Whitehall for the UK's policy within the International Labour Organisation; DTI; the Home Office; and the Lord Chancellor's Department.

[39680]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 It is reasonable that the Hong Kong SAR Government should adapt references to the British Crown in Hong Kong's laws. We share the concerns expressed

<P>

<a name="80424w07.html_para3">The question of the Ordinance's compatibility with Article 22 of the Basic Law involves interpretation of Hong Kong law, and would therefore be a matter for the Hong Kong courts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80424w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The advertising campaign for Winter Fuel Payments was approved by Ministers in the normal way. We were determined that pensioners should not be fearful of turning up their heating if a cold spell occurred. We also considered it important that pensioners knew as quickly as possible how much they would receive, as well as how and when it would be paid.
<P>

<a name="80424w08.html_para3">We explored the simplest and most cost-effective ways to let them know that a payment would be made. A publicity strategy was developed, which took account of views expressed by three of the pensioner welfare organisations, on the most effective ways to get the necessary information to as many of the eligible pensioners as possible. We found that a multi-media package, costing an estimated &#163;1.7 million, was likely to reach and inform around 80 per cent. of the ten million eligible pensioners. In approving the package, I considered the cost reasonable, given that this was an unprecedented exercise providing help to over seven million pensioner households, at a total cost of &#163;400 million over two years.
<P>

<a name="80424w08.html_para4">Following the announcement of the detail of the scheme in January, a campaign was swiftly launched in conjunction with Help the Aged, Age Concern and the National Association of Citizen's Advice Bureaux. It included advertisements in the press and on television, leaflets, posters and a dedicated telephone Helpline. 



<P>
<P><I>24 Apr 1998 : Column: 728</I><P>
The publicity ran for three months and enabled pensioners to turn up their heating, confident that a payment would be made. The Helpline is still available.

<P>
<a name="80424w10.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The effects of measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) immunisation have been carefully examined by two groups of independent experts: the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and the Committee on Safety of Medicines. In addition, following the recent publicity about possible adverse reactions to MMR, a group of 37 independent experts was convened by the Medical Research Council (MRC) on 23 March under the chairmanship of Professor Sir John Pattison. The group examined published and unpublished research into a suggested association between MMR vaccine and Crohn's disease and autism. The independent experts concluded:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The available virological and epidemiological evidence does not support a causal role for persistent measles virus infection in Crohn's disease.</FONT></UL>
<P>

I therefore recommend that children should receive MMR vaccine at the appropriate times, and should not be given the separate component vaccines, since there is no evidence that doing this has any benefit and it may even be harmful."</FONT></UL>
