                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. In 2002-03, Brighton Healthcare NHS Trust and Mid Sussex NHS Trust merged to become Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust.
2. Figures relating to years 1998-99 to present have been taken from the published annual publications available on:
http://www.hesonline.nhs.uk
The figures provided relating to 1997-98 were not previously published.
3. It should be noted that these data should not be described as a count of people as the same person may have been admitted on more than one occasion.
4. Activity includes activity in English national health service hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.
5. A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.
<i>Emergency admissions include:</i>
Emergency: via Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) services, including the casualty department of the provider
Emergency: via general practitioner (GP)
Emergency: via Bed Bureau, including the Central Bureau
Emergency: via consultant out-patient clinic
Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another health care provider
6. Hospital providers can also include treatment centres (TC). Normally, if data are tabulated by health care provider, the figure for an NHS trust gives the activity of all the sites as one aggregated figure. However, in the case of those with embedded treatment centres, these data are quoted separately. In these cases, '-X' is appended to the code for the rest of the trust, to remind users that the figures are for all sites of the trust excluding the treatment centres. The quality of TC returns are such that data may not be complete. Some NHS trusts have not registered their TC as a separate site, and it is therefore not possible to identify their activity separately. Data from some independent sector providers, where the onus for arrangement of dataflows is on the commissioner, may be missing. Care must be taken when using this data as the counts may be lower than true figures.
7. Assessing growth through time: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.

 The Department has incurred no such cost for anti-depressants and mindfulness-based therapies to treat prisoners. Pharmaceutical and psychological therapies are provided by primary care trusts (PCTs) and are available for all who require these within a PCTs catchment area, including for prisoner.

Each LSA appoints a practising midwife as the local supervising midwifery officer (LSAMO) who has responsibility for carrying out the LSAs functions.

HMRC are currently consulting with the alcohol industry informally on potential anti-fraud measures. All options remain under consideration, and a decision whether to consult formally on specific measures will be taken in due course.</p>

 Ofcom followed a competitive procurement process under the “restricted procedure” as detailed in the Public Contracts Regulations 2006 (as amended). This involved inviting expressions of interest via a public notice in the Official Journal of the European Union and Ofcom's own website from 21 December 2009 under the reference number ITT/83/09. Invitations to tender (including a draft contract and detailed award criteria) were issued to all expressing an interest on 15 February 2010 which resulted in the submission of three compliant tenders, and the contract being awarded to Equiniti Limited following detailed assessment of the three tenders received.</p>

 UK sales are being made only to lawful, licensed users of channel 69. The contract between Ofcom and Equiniti requires destruction in accordance with environmental regulations, return or modification for lawful use. Further, there is a requirement that any purchaser of surrendered equipment agrees to take the equipment out of use by the time licensed (and therefore lawful) use of channel 69 expires and confirm in writing to Equiniti that they have either modified the equipment to operate on Channel 38 or Channel 70, disposed of the Equipment under the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) regulations or returned it to Equiniti. Ofcom can request purchasers provide documentary evidence of disposal or modification (and to make equipment available for inspection on request in the case of modification).</p>

 Although the Ministry of Defence is reducing its civilian staff headcount and has imposed a freeze on most external recruitment, we still need to recruit for posts that are business critical or provide support to current operational commitments. The majority of the external recruitment carried out since May 2010 has been for Service Children's Education, to provide teachers overseas, and also for medical grades, including doctors, nurses and physiotherapists. We have also had to fill a number of senior civil service posts critical to driving forward our reform agenda. These posts are usually advertised across a range of specialist media, as well as on the civil service jobs website. The amount spent on recruitment advertising since May 2010 is £522,826.59. This does not include any expenditure by the trading funds and Royal Fleet Auxiliary.</p>

 In April 2011 the Department for International Development (DFID) agreed with the Government of Indonesia to focus all future UK aid for Indonesia on issues related to climate change, which we believe is the most effective way we can help to improve the lives of poor people in Indonesia in the long term. This means that all of DFID's current and future programmes in Indonesia will contribute to the sustainable management of natural resources. They will do this by helping to reduce deforestation and promoting more sustainable economic growth and employment opportunities. This will also help Indonesia meet its target for reducing the growth of greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) promotes environmental awareness in Mozambique at provincial and sub-district levels, first, through Budget Support. This will help finance a nationwide campaign launched by the President of Mozambique last year and run by the Ministry for the Environment, which encourages, for example, every school pupil to plant a tree and every community to preserve their forests. It will help increase the number of local ‘environmental educators' from 800 in 2010 to 5,000 in 2014.</p>

               <a name="11102438000069"> Secondly, DFID promotes environmental awareness by mainstreaming environmental issues into the projects we deliver through multiple sectors for example, education, agricultural, livelihoods, water and sanitation and by supporting civil society to advocate on environmental issues. DFID also leads by example, including by cutting the carbon footprint of our office in Mozambique. For example, the office cut its electricity consumption by 34%, comparing the last two months' bills to the same period last year.</p>

 The Home Office does not have an overarching policy on the publication of transactions made on Government Procurement Cards (GPC). Each transaction would need to be assessed on a case by case basis to decide whether the information is sensitive, and therefore needs to be redacted.

 Overbooking is a widespread practice among full-service scheduled airlines. In the comparatively small proportion of cases where an airline denies passengers boarding against their will, EC Regulation 261/2004 requires air carriers to provide prescribed minimum levels of financial compensation, in addition to offering passengers a choice between re-routeing and reimbursement. These rules are enforced by the Civil Aviation Authority.</p>

 As of 13 October 2011, four primary schools in the Dartford constituency have been issued with an academy order: Wentworth primary school, Joydens Wood infant school, Joydens Wood junior school and Wilmington primary school. Milestone school is an all-through school and has also received an academy order. A further 21 primary schools have been issued with academy orders in Kent, 11 of which have already opened as academies. The issuing of an academy order sets an expectation that the school will convert to academy status; however it does not set a specific date for conversion.</p>

               <b>Mr Gibb:</b>
 We do not calculate an average GCSE grade, but we do calculate Average Points Scores (APS) based on the qualifications taken by pupils until the end of key stage 4 (this is typically when the pupil is aged 15 at the start of the academic year). For example a GCSE Grade C is worth 40 points. The qualifications included in the APS are GCSEs and other qualifications considered to be equivalent, such as BTECs—the uncapped point score counts points from all such qualifications taken by pupils.</p>

We have also changed the code to require local authorities and admission authorities to treat a service family as resident in their area as soon as proof of posting has been provided. In addition, we intend to remove the requirement that local authorities manage the processing of in-year applications, which would capture many service families. Instead, these families will be supported through information and paperwork by the local authority to enable them to apply directly to the schools in their area. This should mean a faster outcome for those parents in finding a place for their child than at present.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 20 October 2011]:</i> The Government consider that the most effective support they can provide in relation to the Hawk is by promoting exports of the aircraft from the UK. The Government are actively engaged in promoting exports of the Hawk, and in particular the UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) Defence and Security Organisation is supporting BAE Systems export campaigns in a number of overseas markets. Export customers for high value defence equipment frequently seek a level of local production and technology transfer, but export orders still deliver significant benefit and value for the many UK companies in the supply chain. The Government have not provided support directly towards production of the aircraft in the UK.</p>

 There exists extensive research on the benefits of greater competition and choice. It is on such foundations that my Department's higher education White Paper “Higher Education: Students at the Heart of the System” is based. During the White Paper consultation phase, which ran from June to September of this year, we welcomed evidence from stakeholders to help quantify the possible impact of the policy proposals made. We are currently considering the responses received and will be issuing a formal response in due course. This will also include our response to the accompanying technical consultation “A New, Fit-for-Purpose Regulatory Framework for the Higher Education Sector” which is open until 27 October.

 Any organisation providing higher education is entitled to apply for degree awarding powers. The granting of these powers is subject to meeting specific criteria designed to establish that the applicant is a well-founded, cohesive and self-critical academic community that can demonstrate firm guardianship of its standards. As part of our proposed reforms to higher education we are currently consulting on a range of measures to encourage a greater diversity of higher education provision which is responsive to the needs of students.</p>

Some suppliers have licence conditions that set out ways under which they accept payment including in some cases cash and prepayment methods.</p>

1. Figures are rounded to the nearest hundred.
2. Areas are provided by matching the residential postcode of the parent with care to the Office for National Statistics Postcode Directory.
3. Cases are classed as having maintenance due if an ongoing liability to pay maintenance exists or arrears of maintenance have been requested. This group of cases consists of assessed not charging, compliant, nil compliant, maintenance direct and others with receipts.
4. Cases are counted as having a positive maintenance outcome if they have received a payment via the collection service in the quarter or have a maintenance direct agreement in place. Cases are classed as maintenance direct if this is their status at the end of the quarter.

1. DWP does not have complete coverage of the third sector status of every supplier who has been awarded a contract in this period.
2. We have 15 other contracts in the period where the supplier's third sector status is unknown.
3. DWP awarded 1,129 contracts in total in this period (of which, CIT low level contracts total 598). Third sector suppliers represent 4.1% of the overall total.
4. The data includes DWP and its NDPB's.
5. The data is extracted from the BMO Contracts database using the contract start date as the filter.
6. Some contracts have a nil value because there is no firm contractual commitment to spend.
7. The period covered by this response is 1 May 2010 to 30 September 2011.

1. Figures from February 1993 and February 2002 are taken from 5% sample data. They have been up-rated to be consistent with WPLS data and are rounded to the nearest 100.
2. Figures for February 2011 are taken from WPLS 100% data and are rounded to the nearest 10.
3. Figures show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and exclude people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.
4. Disability living allowance was introduced in April 1992, but published tables by local authority are not available prior to February 1993.

So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming employment and support on the basis of alcoholism would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities assessed by the work capability assessment, or on the effects of any associated mental health problems. It is also important to note that, where someone has more than one diagnosis or disabling condition, only the predominant one is currently recorded.</p>

 The closure of the Central Office of Information is part of a programme to reform Government communications as a whole. This builds on the success of the moratorium on marketing and advertising, which saw external spend through COI fall from £532 million in 2009-10 to £168 million in 2010-11 and central Government Departments cut their communications budgets by half. These reductions in spending mean that COI is no longer viable as a trading fund.</p>

               <b>The Attorney-General:</b>
 His Honour Judge Darlow ruled, on 19 October 2005, that there was no case to answer in relation to the charges of misconduct in public office. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) was, therefore, unable to proceed on these charges.</p>

               <a name="1110254000107"> At the same hearing, the judge also indicated that the type of penalty he would impose on the remaining charges under the Data Protection Act 1998 would not justify a complex criminal trial. This obliged prosecutors to review the decision to proceed. The Code for Crown Prosecutors states that a public interest factor tending against prosecution is if the court is likely to impose a nominal penalty. In the light of this and applying the Code, the prosecution offered no evidence on these charges on 30 March 2006.</p>

               <a name="1110254000108"> The CPS queried the judge's ruling in court and subsequently sought counsel's advice on referring his rulings in this case to the Court of Appeal, through an Attorney-General's reference. The CPS was advised that the case was not suitable for referral to the Court of Appeal because the law required no further clarification.</p>

               <a name="1110254000109"> Section 58 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 now allows appeals of judge's rulings within a trial. This was not available at the time of these proceedings.</p>
