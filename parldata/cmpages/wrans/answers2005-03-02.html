 I have not had any discussions with the governments of tsunami-affected countries specifically about the representations of women on tsunami reconstruction panels and task forces. However, the Department for International Development (DFID) is working to ensure that the international response to the tsunami, which is being led by the affected governments and international organisations such as the UN and the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Mar 2005 : Column 1151W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Asian Development Bank (ADB), focus on helping the poorest people and those often marginalized because of gender, caste, age, ethnicity or religion.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w01.html_para2">
For example, donors and the Government of Sri Lanka have agreed a set of Guiding Principles for post-tsunami relief and recovery. These provide the framework for all Government and donor initiatives and stipulate that the allocation of resources should be strictly guided by identified needs and local priorities, without discrimination on the basis of political, religious, ethnic or gender considerations. The Task Forces will include Government, civil society, private sector and donor representatives and will reflect gender concerns. In India, we are actively engaging with the World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) to ensure that social inclusion and gender issues are central to the reconstruction and livelihoods work that they will be funding.

<p><a name="50302w01.html_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Department for International Development (DFID)&#039;s Country Assistance Plan (CAP) 2003&#150;06 to Bangladesh, emphasises access for the poor to resources and services, and the realisation of their rights. In working to achieve this, approximately 40 per cent. of DFID Bangladesh&#039;s programme is channelled through civil society organisations (CSO)&#151;both through direct grants and indirectly through grants issued by DFID funded organisations, agencies and through large sector programmes. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) also supports some CSOs through their Small Grants Scheme (SGS).

<p><a name="50302w02.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Dhanda: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if he will make a statement on the plan of action arising from the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD); and what steps the UK Government is taking to help achieve the goals of the ICPD programme.  [218665]</p>




<p><a name="50302w02.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The UK Government remain firmly committed to the Cairo Programme of Action (POA) and its key goal of reproductive health for all by 2015. The UK believes that sexual and reproductive health are also fundamental human rights. DFID5s recently published position paper on Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights makes this position clear and we continue to invest strongly in reproductive health, such as recent multi-year increases in funding to the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the International Planned Parenthood Foundation (IPPF).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w02.html_para0">
Progress on the POA has been made since 1994. The recent regional International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD) plus 10 celebratory events in Asia and Latin America strongly demonstrated country ownership and commitment to the Cairo POA and how this has become a platform for real policy change at country level. The UK Government have also advocated vigorously to maintain the ICPD consensus 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Mar 2005 : Column 1153W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
within the UN and elsewhere. Tony Blair was the first Head of State to sign the World Leaders Statement in support of ICPD plus 10. DFID also continues to support country programmes via budgetary support and project funding to NGOs, and agencies such as the Global Fund, active in reproductive health supply security.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w02.html_para1">
The UK believes that sexual and reproductive health and rights are fundamental to attaining the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Progress towards the attainment of the goals is currently being reviewed. The Sachs Millennium Project Review and accompanying Task Force Reports, all emphasise the importance of reproductive health and rights to the attainment of the MDGs. Access to reproductive health, a key feature of the Cairo POA, is identified within the main Sachs report as one of the &quot;quick wins&quot;&#151;solutions to implement now for speeding efforts to reduce poverty. DFID is therefore working with like-minded EU member states to ensure that positive reproductive health and rights messages strongly appear in the Secretary-General&#039;s report which is due in March.

<p><a name="50302w02.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Iraqi Ministry of Health is leading on the rehabilitation of health services in Iraq, working closely with international agencies including the World Health Organisation (WHO). The Ministry of Health reports that more than 75 hospitals and nearly all the primary care clinics which were damaged or looted during and after the 2003 conflict have been rehabilitated. Further work to construct and rehabilitate hospitals in Iraq is under way, and health services are gradually improving. More than $1 billion has been pledged in donor support to the health sector. In 2003, DFID provided &#163;5 million to the WHO to enable it to assist the Iraqis on health issues, including improving the delivery of drugs and medical supplies. DFID is providing further support through its contribution to the United Nations and World Bank 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Mar 2005 : Column 1154W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, and through the provision of an adviser to the Iraqi Ministry of Health on secondment from the UK Department of Health. United States agencies are renovating 19 hospitals and constructing a new Paediatric Hospital in Basra, and the Japanese Government are funding the rehabilitation of 11 general hospitals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w02.html_para2">
The WHO is working to improve primary health care and emergency obstetric provision. The World Bank has agreed an emergency health and rehabilitation project to finance the rehabilitation of emergency services in 12 hospitals. Nevertheless, it will still take several years for Iraq&#039;s health sector to recover fully from the under-investment and poor management which it suffered under Saddam Hussein&#039;s regime, and approach the standards experienced in developed countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w02.html_para3">
Comprehensive figures on the numbers of civic and judicial buildings which have been rehabilitated in Iraq since May 2003 are not readily available. However, considerable progress has been made in rebuilding Iraq&#039;s civic infrastructure. In the first year after the conflict, DFID renovated over 50 public buildings in southern Iraq including hospitals, universities and governorate offices, enabling the resumption of public sector work and the continued provision of services to the Iraqi people. United States agencies carried out similar work in other parts of Iraq, are currently renovating buildings for three Ministries in Baghdad, and are planning the construction of new facilities for the Council of Judges, Court of Cassation and Central Criminal Court .

 Under Part MA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 local authorities are under a statutory duty to inspect their areas to identify contaminated land as defined in the Act, and to secure its remediation in accordance with the detailed provisions of the regime. DETR Circular 02/2000 &quot;Contaminated Land&quot; contains statutory guidance including detailed liability rules as to who is the appropriate person(s) to bear responsibility for 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Mar 2005 : Column 1158W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
remediation. In line with the polluter-pays principle, this is normally the person who caused or knowingly permitted the presence of the substances causing the problem. Where this person cannot be found, for example because the company no longer exits or has gone into liquidation, the landowner may be the appropriate person, subject to the Act and guidance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w03.html_para4">
The Act recognises that, particularly in the case of private individuals owning land, costs of remediation might cause hardship. Section 78P(2) of the Act requires local authorities to have regard to hardship and to statutory guidance when serving remediation notices, or recovering costs, and there is provision for remediation costs to be waived or reduced in certain circumstances. Charging notices may be used in certain cases to recover costs where local authorities carry out remediation on behalf of appropriate persons, which allows recovery to be deferred until land is sold. The regime does not provide compensation to any individuals, unless they are required to grant rights in order that remediation can be carried out.

The Environment Agency (EA) is required by section 106 of the Water Resources Act 1991 to carry out most of its flood defence functions through regional flood defence committees (RFDCs). The committees in particular take decisions about the annual programmes of improvement and maintenance work to be carried out by the Agency and oversee other aspects of the Agency&#039;s work and operations. RFDCs also decide on such matters as the extension of main rivers, the making and operation of land drainage byelaws and various issues affecting any internal drainage boards in their area.

<p><a name="50302w06.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Defra does not hold separately, a list of countries that are recorded as having endemic foot and mouth disease (FMD). The internationally recognised central source for official information on the distribution of animal diseases such as FMD is the Office International des Epizooties (OIE). Also known as the World Organisation for Animal Health, the OIE is the world organisation responsible for the collection and dissemination of information on international animal health&#151;it has a role analogous to the World Health Organisation (WHO):
</p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w06.html_para8">
Rather than listing countries in which FMD is considered to be endemic, the OIE lists countries and regions that are considered to be free of FMD, broken down into those that are free and do not vaccinate; and those that are free and do vaccinate against the disease.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w06.html_para9">
European Community legislation permits the importation of meat from certain countries where FMD is present, but only where the disease is officially recognised as being restricted to specific areas and effective movement controls are in place within the country. Imports are permitted either from parts of the country that are free of disease or under strict conditions that ensure the meat does not come from any animal that may have come in contact with FMD before, during and after slaughter. These provisions are in line with the guidelines established by the OIE.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w06.html_para10">
All meat imported from third countries must be accompanied by veterinary certification. This must confirm that the meat is derived from animals which have been subjected to a veterinary inspection during the 24 hours prior to slaughter and showed no signs of FMD.

If there is an outbreak of disease likely to present a risk to human or animal health, Community legislation allows us to take appropriate safeguard action, which may include a ban on imports of animals and animal products from all, or parts, of that country.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w06.html_para13">
All meat and animals imported into the EU from third countries must enter at designated border inspection posts where they are subject to veterinary inspections. All consignments are subject to documentary and identity checks. At least 20 per cent. of consignments of animal products undergo physical checks, and a number of animals in each consignment are physically checked. These checks ensure import conditions are met.

<p><a name="50302w06.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The decision tree published as part of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) contingency plan on the Defra website sets out the factors that the Government would take into account in deciding disease control strategy including vaccination or different approaches to culling in a future outbreak. The disease control strategy adopted will depend on many factors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w06.html_para15">
The EU directive gives greater prominence to the potential use of emergency vaccination in the event of an outbreak as an adjunct to this basic slaughter policy. Article 14 of the directive places a duty on member states &quot;to prepare all arrangements necessary for emergency vaccination in an area at least the size of the Surveillance Zone&quot; as soon as the first case of FMD is confirmed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w06.html_para16">
The Government will consider emergency vaccination as a disease control option from the start of any outbreak of FMD on the basis of vaccinate to live.

<p><a name="50302w06.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The measures that the Government would take in the event of an outbreak of foot and mouth disease are set out in the Defra FMD Contingency Plan, the latest version of which was laid before Parliament at the end of March 2004. These include the immediate imposition of movement controls on all susceptible livestock, strict biosecurity guidance and enhanced options for controlling disease. Vaccination would be considered from the onset of an outbreak in addition to the culling of all susceptible animals on infected premises and those that have been exposed to infection, as required by EU law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w06.html_para18">
We are engaging with operational partners and with stakeholders to ensure they are aware of their responsibilities and the measures that would be taken in an outbreak. Plans are also in place in the event of an outbreak to enable a rapid increase in resources and for the implementation of contingency contracts, including that for emergency vaccination. We have revised the instructions for staff and are ensuring that they are trained and equipped to deal with an outbreak of disease. A revised version of the contingency plan, 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Mar 2005 : Column 1170W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
incorporating lessons learned form the national Foot and Mouth Disease Exercise held last June, will be issued for public consultation shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w06.html_para19">
The current FMD contingency plan reflects lessons learned from the outbreaks of FMD in 1967 and 2001. The vast majority of the recommendations of the Northumberland Committee after the 1967 outbreak were applied during the 2001 outbreak. Such elements of the response in 2001 as bringing in senior administrators to allow vets to be relieved of non veterinary duties such as carcase disposal and cleansing and disinfection, and calling in the armed forces, resulted from the experiences of the 1967 outbreak and remain in the contingency plan. Lessons learned from 2001 and from the inquiries thereafter have resulted in the contingency plan including revised policies including the immediate imposition of a GB national movement ban on susceptible animals, closure of footpaths only within the 3 km protection zone and a hierarchy of disposal options for carcases headed by incineration and rendering. They have also led to the inclusion in the plan of senior management structures and systems that would be established in an outbreak.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will take steps to include social criteria in the UK&#039;s timber procurement policy.  [216574]</p>




<p><a name="50302w07.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 A key objective of the UK Government&#039;s timber procurement policy is to encourage the protection of forest dependent peoples&#039; rights and enhance their well-being. By requiring its contractors to supply only timber that has been legally harvested and by preferring timber grown in sustainably managed forests, the Government is helping to achieve this outcome in many producing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w07.html_para10">
The EU public procurement directives ensure that public bodies conduct their procurement in a fair and transparent manner, do not discriminate or create barriers to trade and obtain value for money for taxpayers. In line with the above requirements, the criteria for selecting bidders must be limited to their capacity and ability to supply the product or service, and the criteria for specifying requirements must be limited to relevant technical, quality and performance characteristics that can be objectively measured and priced. The criteria can include relevant manufacturing processes and that enables forest management standards that affect the product to be specified. Protecting and conserving a product&#039;s raw material is relevant, measurable and a reasonable demand to make of a contractor. Protecting and conserving the rights and socio-economic well-being of forest dependent people is not something a contractor based in another country could be reasonably expected to undertake. Such social and ethical issues are beyond the capacity of suppliers to control, measure and price. Furthermore, the introduction of non product related issues into contracts would enable contracting authorities to choose their suppliers on the basis of subjective judgements that would jeopardize the fairness and openness that have served the public procurement process so well for many decades.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w07.html_para11">
A public authority can refuse to invite tenders from suppliers who have been convicted of an offence or grave professional misconduct in relation to the conduct of their business and that could include offences relating to the treatment of forest dependent people. Any such refusal would have to be proportionate to the offence.

Notes:<br>

1. Public spending on health per capita in England will always appear higher because many areas of health expenditure are funded centrally and are not factored into local health authority spending. These include medical research, the funding of Special Health Authorities, NDPBs and some central budgets.<br>

2. Expenditure per capita for health authorities and the North East is taken from audited health authority summarisation forms and primary care trust summarisation schedules that are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. Weighted capitation figures are used to determine expenditure per capita&#151;these are population figures that are weighted to reflect differing needs. Figures are given in cash terms.<br>

3. Figures for 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02 have been prepared using gross expenditure figures. Figures for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 have been adjusted to eliminate expenditure that would be double counted where an authority acts as a lead in commissioning healthcare or other services.<br>

To support strong and active communities in which people of all races and backgrounds are valued, in 2003 the Home Office allocated from the Connecting Communities Fund a total of &#163;590,000 to two, three-year projects in the Kirklees area. A Voluntary Action Kirklees project (grant &#163;338,812) is supporting the development of Asian women&#039;s networks to promote greater community involvement from Asian women. Outcomes include partnership work with South Asian Healthy Living to run a confidence project and fitness training programmes. A Kirklees Racial Equality Council project (grant &#163;251,718) is being launched in April 2005 and will see a series of seven faith resource centres, reflecting the major faiths, set up across Kirklees, with books, displays and other information materials.

Kirklees has also benefited from participation in the 18-month Community Cohesion Pathfinder Programme, established and launched in 2002 by the Home Office and the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. Kirklees was one of 14 successful Pathfinders and was granted &#163;285,000 to explore the best ways of building strong, active, and harmonious communities. Key outcomes from the programme included the &#039;Learning Lessons&#039; report, which, by establishing what levels of community cohesion already existed, provided a basis for moving forward; and the &quot;Stories in a suitcase&quot; project, which encouraged people over 50 in the community to create a story board reflecting where they had come from. This project was popular with both white and Asian residents living in Kirklees and helped change local perceptions about the differences between community groups.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished consultant episode is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

3. The main operation is the first recorded operation in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

4. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data.

 At HM Naval Base Clyde, nuclear warhead handling, storage, transportation and fitting of components is carried out using rigidly controlled and approved procedures, and staff undertaking these activities undergo extensive training before they are designated competent to carry out the work. The potential risks arising from an accident and human error are therefore very low.

 The work of the Disabled Facilities Grant (DFG) review group is due to be completed in May. The Government will publish and make available in the Library of the House a consultation document on any proposals for change as soon as possible after this date. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, the Department for Education and Skills and the Department of Health are represented on the review group. The consultation document will include proposals for what, if any, changes should be made to the means test for disabled facilities grant.

Central records of the type of applicants for DFG by age are not kept by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The latest published evaluation of the DFG system was undertaken by PIED A in 1996. This showed that 5 per cent. of DFG approvals related to disabled children under 18 and 70 per cent. where from disabled persons over the age of 60.

Apart from a disregard in relation to the 30 hour element of working tax credit, this credit is counted as income for the purposes of the DFG means test. This follows the procedures for eligibility for housing benefit and council tax benefit on which the DFG means test is based. The review of DFG is considering the DFG

<p><i>Substantive answer from Keith Hill to John Mann:</i>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I promised to write to you in answer to your parliamentary questions regarding the Meden Valley Partnership when my Department had looked closely at the issues you raised.</p>
</ul>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">On the important issue of improving communication with residents affected by proposals, you will be pleased to hear that the Meden Valley Board intend to appoint a Community Participation Officer to assist with the consultation process, and that in the short-term Leicester Housing Association will provide a secondee to the project. The Meden Valley Board has also confirmed that it will seek to hold monthly meetings with you, if agreeable, to address the concerns raised by your constituents, and the Community Participation Officer will be involved with these meetings. I hope that you will be able to work closely with this officer who will service the Residents Implementation Groups, which I understand you have played a role in forming through chairing the well-attended public meetings in Warsop Vale and on the Royal Estate. The Community Participation Officer will also help to develop an effective communication strategy with residents affected by the scheme.</p>
</ul>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I understand that Meden Valley Making Places Ltd are making good progress on the negotiated acquisition of properties, but I can understand the frustration some residents must feel about the length of time to complete the Compulsory Purchase Order process. To mitigate the negative impact of abandonment, Meden Valley Making Places Ltd is prioritising joint working with the Police and Community Safety Officers to help minimise problems for residents who wish to stay.</p>
</ul>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Mar 2005 : Column 1250W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">On the issue of alternative accommodation, I would support the Meden Valley Making Places Ltd&#039;s commitment to assisting homeowners and tenants, affected b redevelopment, to secure alternative accommodation on a like for like basis. I am sure that you would agree with this policy. The various options available to residents can be discussed with either Sarah Streater or Shamus O&#039;Leary (Tel: 01623&#150;847675) at Meden Valley Making Places Ltd.</p>
</ul>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">I hope that you feel we are moving forward in Meden Valley and driving forward the Government commitment to developing sustainable communities.</p>

 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w28.html_para6">
The treaty binds only its signatories, that is, members of the European Union, and not every state geographically in Europe. Although the treaty is said to establish a &quot;Constitution for Europe&quot; it is clear from the very first article that &quot;this Constitution establishes the European Union . . . &quot;. Referring in the question to the &quot;Constitution for the European Union&quot; is likely to be more intelligible to the voter since it reflects more accurately what he or she is being asked to approve.
</p>


<p>

The social impact of the conflict has been very considerable. Maoist violence, especially in the villages and towns outside the district capitals, has caused widespread fear among the locals. It has caused major disruption to key services, including education and health. Many schools have been forced to close and many locals have been forced to flee their homes to avoid being attacked by the Maoists or forcibly recruited into their ranks. Many thousands of people have been displaced, many are homeless and without access to basic amenities. The security forces&#039; failure consistently to respect human rights has compounded

The conflict has also done great damage to the Nepalese national economy, which has become one of the prime Maoist targets. The Maoists regularly extort money from local businesses and industries and prevent businesses from running normally. They enforce frequent strikes (bandhs) and seek to prevent the free movement of goods. Hundreds of companies have been forced to close. The Maoists have also attacked the tourism industry infrastructure, so damaging a key contribution to the Nepalese economy. Unemployment is now a serious problem.

In addition, the Department&#039;s staff can make use of the facilities of an Employee Assistance Provider, who can provide advice and support to individuals who have an illness themselves or who are affected by the illness of a friend or relative. For those who are unlikely to be able to return to work, there is also the opportunity of ill health retirement via the civil service pension scheme.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his written statement of 3 February 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 68WS, on pension credit, if he will place in the Library a copy of the analysis from which the take-up estimates were derived.  [216899]</p>




<p><a name="50302w32.html_spnew6"><b> Malcolm Wicks </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22 February 2005]:</i> National Statistics on take-up of major DWP benefits are published annually by the Department in Income Related Benefits: Estimates of Take-up. These are based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) for the relevant year and take account of both entitled non-recipients and non-entitled recipients. However, they are published significantly in arrears and the 2004&#150;05 statistics will not be available for some time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50302w32.html_para18">
In the interim, indicative take-up figures may be calculated by comparing estimates of entitlement with actual numbers of claimants in the administrative data. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Mar 2005 : Column 1268W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Projections from the Department&#039;s Policy Simulation Model, based on the 2002&#150;03 Family Resources Survey, have yielded estimates of entitlement. This methodology suggests an initial view that in 2004&#150;05 take-up is over 80 per cent. for those on the guarantee element, and could be as high as 90 per cent. for single women pensioners entitled to the guarantee element.
