<a name="90712w02.htm_para0">During negotiations for the period 1993-99, the previous administration agreed to increase the amount of money allocated to the EC's development programmes by 180 per cent. This increase means that the UK now channels 30 per cent. of its international development budget through the EC. Owing to concerns about the effectiveness and impact of the EC's development assistance programmes, the UK successfully sought to hold down the level of growth to 1 per cent. for international development expenditure in the negotiations for 2000-06.

<a name="90712w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The report looked at organic farming and the issue of 'contamination' of organic crops and products by genetically modified (GM) crops. The issues raised by the report are ones not of safety but of consumer choice. No GM crops would be released into the environment if there were any reasons to believe that it would be harmful to human health or the environment. The recently published SCIMAC (Supply Chain Initiative on Modified Agricultural Crops) guidelines set out proposed separation distances between genetically modified and organic crops and SCIMAC has indicted that it is willing to review these in the light of experience.

<a name="90712w03.htm_para0">Proposals for reducing emissions from English and Welsh power stations of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and fine particulate matter were contained in a consultative paper published by the Environment Agency in March 1999. The information relating to Scotland and Northern Ireland is a matter for my right hon. Friends the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for Northern Ireland. The European Commission has recently adopted a Proposal for a National Emission Ceilings Directive, which potentially implies further reductions in sulphur dioxide emissions beyond those already envisaged. The Government are considering their response to the Proposal.

<a name="90712w03.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 July 1999]:</i> The purpose of the current EU and UK legislation is to prevent or minimise any damage to the environment which may arise from the escape or release of genetically modified organisms.
<P>

<a name="90712w03.htm_para2">Each application for the release of genetically modified (GM) plants is supported by a risk assessment, which is evaluated by Government experts and independent scientists on the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE). If there were any reason to believe 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jul 1999 : Column: 10</I><P>
that a release would be harmful to human health or the environment then it would not be allowed. The environmental assessments are available on the public register together with reports of monitoring carried out during and after the trial.
<P>

<a name="90712w03.htm_para3">All GM crops intended for general cultivation must be covered by a valid Part C (marketing) consent issued under Council Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms. Under the Directive a consent will be issued only where the environmental risk assessment demonstrates that the marketing will not cause significant harm to human health or the environment.
<P>

<a name="90712w03.htm_para4">The farmscale evaluations will allow the Government to study the effects on the environment of the larger scale growing of GM crops year by year. If trends are spotted about possible adverse effects, we will have a sound basis for following these observations up and taking precautionary action. The work will be reviewed each year and we will use this to decide how best to proceed with the managed development of GM crops in the UK. This approach ensures that large-scale plantings do not proceed until we have sufficient evidence that the particular GM crop does not harm the environment.
<P>

<a name="90712w03.htm_para5">DETR carries out research on the environmental impact of GM crops. Two important recent reports are "Environmental Risks of Herbicide Tolerant Oilseed Rape" and "The Commercial use of Genetically Modified Crops in the United Kingdom: the Potential Wider Impact on Farmland Wildlife".

<P>

<a name="90712w03.htm_para6">These additional social lettings come from new build, the purchase and rehabilitation of existing property and from empty properties brought into use for temporary social housing.

 The Government have recently announced that a completed list of 340 wildlife sites nominated for special protection (cSACs) under the Habitats Directive has been submitted to the European Commission. The next stage is for the national lists to be discussed at a meeting of member states in the Atlantic biogeographic region in September. It is too early to make a full scientific assessment of how far the identification of these sites has contributed to the conservation of the habitat types and species concerned but they are given the highest priority for conservation action by English Nature. I am confident that this is a further step forward, reaffirming our determination to protect our own natural heritage and our commitment to European and international conservation initiatives.

It is for Essex County Council as the local transport authority, to decide on the detailed implementation of that package and to monitor the results.

<P>
<P><I>12 Jul 1999 : Column: 18</I><P>
completed in May 1999 resulted in the former Guard's Van being replaced by 16 extra seats and a new area created for luggage. This included a dedicated bicycle rack designed to hold five machines. The reason for this decision was that commuters on SWT continue to experience overcrowding on their commuting journeys to London--in 1998 there was a 9.8 per cent. increase in the number of passengers. The Franchising Director's latest figures for Passengers in Excess of Capacity (PIXC), issued on 29 March, show that SWT's PIXC count was 3.9 per cent. against a target figure for the combined peaks of 3 per cent. Consequently SWT were required to agree a remedial plan with OPRAF. The provision of the 16 extra seats and consequently change in the arrangements for the carriage of bicycles was agreed by OPRAF as one of the remedial measures.

 In June 1998, the Department endorsed and distributed throughout the National Health Service, under Health Service Circular 1998/115, three documents of good practice in palliative care produced by the National Council for Hospice and Specialist Palliative Care Services, which were already widely used in the voluntary sector. One of these was "Palliative Care in the Hospital Setting", which describes key aspects of palliative care provision in the hospital setting.
<P>

<a name="90712w08.htm_para6">The other two documents were "Guidelines for Managing Pain in Adults" and "Changing Gear--Guidelines for Managing the Last Days of Life in Adults".

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what was the estimated additional cost to the NHS of the use of branded drugs to generic drugs on the NHS category D list for the periods <i>(a)</i> June 1998 and <i>(b)</i> June 1999, assuming average dispensing levels for such drugs;  [90054]

<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w09.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Generic drugs are included in Category D of Part VIII of the Drug Tariff when community pharmacies are having difficulty obtaining supplies at the Drug Tariff price. Inclusion in Category D means that the price reimbursed to the pharmacy will be either the Drug Tariff price or, if the prescription is appropriately endorsed, the list price of the supplier from whom the drug was purchased. In some cases it may be necessary for the pharmacy to purchase a branded equivalent. For 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jul 1999 : Column: 29</I><P>
many of the drugs concerned there will be a wide range of suppliers--in some cases both branded and generic--and hence prices. This means that calculating the thousands of permutations of price differential between the various branded versions and their many generic equivalents could be done only at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w09.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department works closely with the Toxic Shock Syndrome Information Service (TSSIS) to raise awareness of Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS) among young people. The TSSIS provide a wide range of factual materials to increase awareness of TSS among both the public and the health profession. Earlier this year a joint mailing initiative was undertaken between the Department and the TSSIS to inform all media doctors and agony aunts of TSS. A letter about the work of the TSSIS and an information pack was sent out free of charge to enable them to advise their readers on the condition. Research by TSSIS suggests that awareness of TSS among young people is high.
<P>

<a name="90712w09.htm_para0">In addition, the Absorbent Hygiene Products Manufacturers Association's Voluntary Code of Practice ensures that clear warnings about TSS are printed on the outside of every pack of tampons, and a leaflet inside the pack gives advice about the safe use of tampons and what to do if suspected TSS symptoms are experienced.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will publish the information held by his Department on the incidence of cancers amongst people living in areas surrounding waste incinerators; and what recommendations his Department has made on emissions from incineration.  [90353]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w09.htm_spnew11"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The study of cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators, which was funded by this and five other Government Departments, was published in the British Journal of Cancer in 1996 (Elliott P., Shaddick G., Kleinschmidt I., Jolley D., Walls P., Beresford J. and Grundy C. (1996). Cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators in Great Britain. British Journal of Cancer, volume 73, pp 702-710). This study found no evidence of an excess incidence of most of the cancer types studied among populations living near incinerators, although an excess incidence of liver cancer was reported. Because of particular problems with the accurate diagnosis of liver cancer, the Department has funded a further study to review the diagnosis of the liver cancer cases found in this study. The results of this study will be published in due course.
<P>

<a name="90712w09.htm_para2">The Department does not make specific recommendations on emissions from incineration. However, the Department works closely with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, which has lead policy responsibility for industrial emissions controls, and also with the Environment Agency, which has regulatory responsibility for Integrated Pollution Control.

 The Ministry of Defence has a comprehensive Year 2000 programme, which has been in place since 1996. The focus of the programme is on the maintenance of Defence capability across the millennium period. Around 75 per cent. of MOD critical systems are now compliant, with the remainder due to be made compliant and tested by the end of the year.

<a name="90712w11.htm_para3">There are currently approximately 1,170 full and part-time officials working on Y2K within MOD, with 215 consultants supplementing the in-house staff. All have the skills necessary for the tasks allocated to them.

<a name="90712w11.htm_para4">A programme of audits, using both internal and external specialist assessors, has been established to assure the quality of the work undertaken. A series of exercises is underway to demonstrate the adequacy of technical compliance measures and contingency.

<a name="90712w11.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 A noise survey was undertaken in 1996 at RNAS Culdrose and noise levels caused by the air operations at the station were measured. A noise map was produced from the survey and used to identify those homes that qualified for a grant under the MOD's voluntary noise insulation grant scheme. In addition, MOD has sponsored or reviewed a number of research studies on the effects of noise pollution which, although not specific to RNAS Culdrose, are generally applicable to air operations.

DHE plans to release 34 of these properties back to AHL in December 1999. It will then be for AHL to decide the future of these properties. An estate of 30 properties for use by Service families will remain. Of these seven properties are currently unoccupied, although three will shortly be occupied by Service families.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what actions are taken by his Department to restrict price fluctuations of waste <i>(a)</i> glass, <i>(b)</i> paper and <i>(c)</i> household metal waste.  [90349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w12.htm_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 These wastes constitute potential secondary raw materials and internationally-traded commodities which compete with virgin supplies. Their prices are best set by the operation of the market rather than by Government. However, we are committed to increasing recycling rates and consider the development of new and stable markets for recycled materials as being key to achieving this objective. A range of options for action which might assist in this process have been identified for the DTI by the Recycling Advisory Unit at AEA Technology plc, in a report entitled "Development of Markets for Recycled Materials", and these will be considered in tandem with the recently-published recommendations of DETR's Market Development Group.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer of 28 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>33</i>, concerning public textphones, what factors underlie the difference between the figures provided and those in the answer of 17 November 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>52</i>; what assessment he has made of British Telecom's plans to increase provision by 2000; what were the results of the Oftel consultation; and what plans there are for the further consultation exercise.  [90451]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w12.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The difference between the figures given in 1997 and in my answer of 28 June lies in variations in the needs of establishments which public textphone users frequent, and numbers fluctuate marginally over time. BT's plans in 1997 to increase numbers of public textphones by 2000 have been superseded by Oftel's subsequent consultation on improving telecommunications services for people with disabilities. BT is discussing future needs with disability groups.
<P>

<a name="90712w12.htm_para0">Following the consultation, Oftel has recommended that the Secretary of State introduce new regulatory requirements including requirements for public textphones. The Government are planning to consult later this year on measures to improve access to telecommunications for the disabled.

 <i>[holding answer 1 July 1999]:</i> The duties of the Director General of Fair Trading (DGFT) in relation to the financial services industry under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 will not change under the Financial Services and Markets Bill. When the prohibitions in the Competition Act 1998 come into force on 1 March 2000, agreements between undertakings, decisions by associations of undertakings, and concerted practices which may affect trade in the UK and have as their object and effect the restriction, distortion or prevention of competition will be prohibited subject to certain exclusions. Any conduct on the part of one or more undertakings which amounts to the abuse of a dominant position affecting trade within the UK and which may affect trade in the UK will also be prohibited. These prohibitions will apply to the financial services industry subject to certain exemptions and exclusions. The DGFT will have powers to carry out investigations if he has reasonable grounds for suspecting either of these prohibitions has been infringed, to bring infringements to an end, and to impose penalties. The DGFT will continue to scrutinise the rules of the Financial Services Authority, self regulatory organisations, investment exchanges and clearing houses using his powers in section 122 of the Financial Services Act 1986 and will report to the Treasury on any that appear to him to restrict, distort or prevent competition to a significant extent.

 Photovoltaic (PV) systems which may be incorporated into the fabric of buildings offer the prospect of clean and silent electricity production and are a form of renewable energy which is clearly suited to an urban environment. However there are a number of barriers to the deployment of PV, of which the most significant is the current high cost of the modules. My Department is working with the PV industry to reduce the barriers. In February I announced three new PV initiatives: a call for R&D proposals for components and systems; a field trial of 100 domestic PV systems and the design of a scheme to demonstrate PV on large commercial and industrial buildings. A total of 28 responses to the call for proposals 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jul 1999 : Column: 46</I><P>
have been received, of which 14 are related to building integrated PV. In addition there are two PV roofing product development projects currently underway with support from DTI. The domestic PV field trial scheme is currently under discussion with the industry. I hope to make an announcement regarding the third initiative later in the year.

 Information on the number of ineffective Crown Court trials is kept, but no central reports on adjournments is collected for civil cases. Applications for cases to be adjourned are varied and adjournments in both civil and criminal cases are judicial decisions in which I cannot intervene. However, since 26 April 1999, there are systems in the civil courts, which monitor adjournments of cases listed for trial and the reasons for adjournment. The whole ethos of the Civil Procedure Rules is that defended cases are managed by the court and adjournments are the exception.

 We promised King Abdullah to raise debt relief for Jordan with our G8 partners, and did so ahead of, and at, the recent Summit in Cologne.

<a name="90712w19.htm_para0">This Department operates two data matching services: the Generalised Matching Service, which matches different DSS computer systems against each other and against data acquired from other Government Departments to identify anomalies for investigation; and the Housing Benefit Matching Service which matches data from Local Authority (LA) Housing and Council Tax benefit administration systems against data held by the DSS and other LAs to identify anomalies for the LAs to investigate.

 Following the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, we are piloting in 10 areas the final warning scheme, a range of new community-based court disposals and Youth Offending Teams. We expect to implement these nationally next year. Under this Session's Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill we are proposing referrals to youth offender panels. The youth justice system is also being speeded up, and we have established the Youth Justice Board to provide advice and promote and monitor local good performance.

<P>

<a name="90712w19.htm_para3">At the reception centres each refugee is given a health check and assigned a GP; children of school age are assigned to a local school; and refugees are put in touch with any known relatives and friends.

In order to improve on this it is recruiting an additional 100 staff above the 300 already deployed. The Agency is working extended hours and straightforward renewal applications are being exceptionally extended by passport offices, and from 7 July at main Post Offices.

[90946]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w20.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The impact of separate passports for children and the new Information Technology system were built into the Passport Agency's planning assumptions which underpinned its 1998-99 Business Plan and 1998-2001 Corporate Plan.
<P>

<a name="90712w20.htm_para4">As indicated by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Home Department in the debate on Passport Delays on 29 June 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 140-96, we were aware in late-March that the Agency's turnround times and arrears were higher than expected. An action plan was agreed including the recruitment of 300 extra staff and other measures which the Agency's management believed would deal with the problems.

<a name="90712w20.htm_para5">The surge in intake from April led to a further deterioration, and further measures have been taken to reduce processing delays.
<P>

<a name="90712w20.htm_para6">The Agency has continued to meet more than 99.99 per cent. of travel dates, and expects to continue to do so.

 As of yesterday, the number of applications waiting to be processed was just under 500,000, a reduction of 6 per cent. on the previous week's figure. This figure is equivalent to just under four weeks output.
<P>

<a name="90712w20.htm_para7">However more than half of these applications are for people indicating travel dates for August, September and beyond. The Passport Agency is prioritising work according to travel dates, and in the vast majority of cases--99.99 per cent.--applicants are receiving their passports in time to travel. It is taking steps to improve on this. The Agency have employed 300 additional staff, and are recruiting a further 100. It is working extended hours, streamlining its processes and using exceptional extensions to renew passports both at Passport Offices and main Post Offices. The Agency's intake is now falling, and this together with the special measures it is taking will reduce delays and enable it to hit its target of processing all properly completed applications by the end of September.

 There are no occasions in the past year when a woman prisoner has been told to stop breastfeeding in order to attend educational or other courses inside a prison. The Prison Service supports the good practice of women breastfeeding their babies. A woman prisoner can express milk and leave the milk with nursery nurses to feed her baby or she can leave the class to breastfeed her baby and rejoin when she has finished. The choice is left to the breastfeeding mother.
<P>

<a name="90712w21.htm_para0">The four mother and baby units in the female prison estate actively encourage breastfeeding and pregnant women have access to information and professional advice to enable them to make an informed choice about how to feed their babies.

 The external research project commissioned by the Home Office examined whether there are any additional costs associated with the policing of sparsely populated rural areas. The final report from the researchers was considered by a Home Office-led Working Group, which includes representatives of the police, police authorities and local authorities, on 8 July. The Home Secretary and I will be considering the report shortly, and a copy will be placed in the Library.

<a name="90712w22.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Where children hold passports, a court can require the surrender of a passport and so the endorsement of a court order may not be necessary.
<P>

<a name="90712w22.htm_para1">However, there has not been a decision that summaries of court orders should not be endorsed on children's passports. This issue has been considered by the Parent/ Carer Child Abduction Co-ordinating Group, which is an inter-departmental group of officials, together with Re-unite. The Group will be looking at the effectiveness of introducing endorsements of the passports of children at risk of abduction.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what are the principal functions of the Local Inmates Database System; how many records the system contains; under what fields information is recorded about inmates; what would be the cost of adding an extra field to this system; how many fields would be required to monitor the ethnic composition of the prison population along the lines of the proposed questions for Census 2001; and what arrangements are in place to link information on inmates detained elsewhere in the United Kingdom.  [89907]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w22.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Local Inmates Database System (LIDS) operates at each public prison to support the administration of prisoners' sentences. It covers a wide range of administrative functions including the recording of all movements of prisoners including: reception, transfers to and from courts, adjudications while in prisons; details of prisoners earnings and private cash; related work and activities; and all forms of release. It holds a broad set of information needed to support these processes, much of which is transferred to a separate central system which supports overall management and monitoring of the Prison Service. LIDS records are transferred automatically between prisons in England and Wales when prisoners move location.




<P>
<P><I>12 Jul 1999 : Column: 78</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90712w22.htm_para2">The individual prison LIDS systems hold full details of all current prisoners and those who have recently been released. The total number of records held, therefore, varies according to the size of the overall prison population but is generally some 20,000 to 30,000 above this.
<P>

<a name="90712w22.htm_para3">In addition to standard fields such as name, date of birth, place of birth, the system holds several hundred fields supporting the functionality described. The cost of adding an additional field to the system is heavily dependent on the extent to which the change can be combined with other activity, whether it warrants significant staff training or needs complex programming.
<P>

<a name="90712w22.htm_para4">LIDS already has fields which hold details of ethnic origin, country of birth and place of birth. The coding system used for these fields is not identical to that proposed for the Census in 2001 but could be adapted for that purpose.
<P>

<a name="90712w22.htm_para5">There are no arrangements in place to link LIDS data with similar systems maintained by other jurisdictions.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he has agreed, with the relevant professionals, guidance on the conduct by corporate clients which they should regard as evidence of overseas tax evasion in cases where they are obliged to report suspicion thereof to the NICS.  [89921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w23.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Joint Money Laundering Steering Group, a body of representatives from the financial services industry, chaired by the British Bankers Association, provides guidance to the financial sector on money laundering issues. They have recently consulted the Treasury and Home Office on new guidelines on the proceeds of tax-related crimes, including those committed overseas. Those guidelines have now been published, and are endorsed by the Treasury.
<P>

<a name="90712w23.htm_para2">Under the Criminal Justice Act 1993, financial institutions should report to the National Criminal Intelligence Service all transactions which they suspect involve the proceeds of criminal conduct. This obligation is a central element of our defence against money laundering, and provides valuable intelligence in the fight against crime. The obligation applies equally to the proceeds of overseas offences (including overseas tax offences), where the conduct would have been criminal if it had occurred in the UK. "Evidence" is not required: the obligation applies where there is knowledge or suspicion that the relevant conduct has occurred or is occurring.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what response he will make to the letter addressed to him by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution in relation to the compatibility of maintaining coal burn in electricity generation with the stated aim of the climate change levy.  [88741]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w23.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The climate change levy is expected to save around 1.5 million tonnes of carbon a year by 2010, thereby making a significant contribution to meeting both the legally binding target for reducing greenhouse emissions 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jul 1999 : Column: 83</I><P>
set under Kyoto Protocol, and the Government's domestic goal of a 20 per cent. cut in carbon dioxide emissions by 2020.
<P>

<a name="90712w23.htm_para3">The final rates of the climate change levy will not be set until the Finance Bill 2000. It is proposed to set them on an "energy" basis with one rate applying to all electricity. This is entirely consistent with the Government's Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation, which identified distortions in the generation market as a potential threat to the security and diversity of energy supplies and announced a programme of reform to ensure fair competition between fuels.
<P>

<a name="90712w23.htm_para4">It also reflects the fact that under current electricity trading arrangements it is only possible to determine the carbon content of electricity as a broad average with a downstream tax. Thus, the extent of switching between fuels is likely to be limited with a tax set to reflect the carbon content. Given that the carbon content of electricity is changing all the time, a tax structured on an energy basis also has the advantage of simplicity.
<P>

<a name="90712w23.htm_para5">We are liaising closely with DTI colleagues on how electricity trading arrangements might change in the future. We have also consulted on the specific issue of whether it might be possible to offer tax relief to new forms of renewable sources of electricity like wind power. The consultation document issued by Customs and Excise on Budget day asked for views on whether--and if so, how--this could be done.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w24.htm_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 If all taxpaying pensioners received an extra &#163;1 of (non-dividend) savings income, then 3.1 million of them would pay 20p more tax, 150,000 would pay 25p more tax, 200,000 would pay 30p more tax and 150,000 of them would pay 40p more tax.

<P>
<a name="90712w24.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the outcome is of the Treasury's review of the future status of the Royal Mint.  [91238]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90712w24.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 On 8 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>569</i>, the then Economic Secretary announced the terms of reference of a review of the Royal Mint. The review was wide ranging with the aim of identifying the actions needed to enable the Royal Mint to develop closer partnership with the private sector. The review was conducted by the Treasury working closely with the Royal Mint's management and taking the views of employees and other interested parties.
<P>

<a name="90712w24.htm_para6">After weighing the options, the Government have decided in favour of a new direction for the Royal Mint, which will bring it up to date with best practice in the private sector. A package of measures will put the Royal Mint on a modern, commercial footing updating the way it is run, the business it does, and its relationship with the Treasury, private partners and customers.
<P>

<a name="90712w24.htm_para7">This a bold step forward in the Government's approach to managing their agencies. The new framework will make the Treasury a better shareholder and the Royal Mint a better enterprise to the benefit of all stakeholders. It will ensure the Royal Mint makes the best possible use of the opportunities it faces, including the ability to offer an extended range of goods and services and to make fuller use of its expertise and its capacity.
<P>

<a name="90712w24.htm_para8">The new framework contains a number of elements. First, more rigorous shareholder discipline, delivered through a new Treasury panel of top private sector analysts and managers. The panel will inject greater private sector expertise into the Treasury's oversight of the Royal Mint, as shareholder. The expertise of the panel will be used to improve and sharpen the incentives on the Royal Mint, with the aim of making its decision taking more transparent, and more commercial.
<P>

<a name="90712w24.htm_para9">Building on this new relationship, we will better define the role of the non-executive directors of the Royal Mint, who, like the directors of private companies, will in future have a clear responsibility to enhance the prosperity of the business over time. We will also bring the number of executives and non-executives on the board into more even balance, in line with best-practice corporate governance.
<P>

<a name="90712w24.htm_para10">Consistent with this process of modernisation, the Royal Mint's financial reporting will be more closely aligned with that of private companies, making it more easily understood by customers, potential partners and analysts.
<P>

<a name="90712w24.htm_para11">These changes will complement a relaxation of the controls which currently restrict the Royal Mint's activities. At present it can only make coins and a narrow range of related products. In future it will be free to exploit its technical skills and assets by offering a wider range of products and by expanding into non-coinage business, where commercially viable. It will also be able to participate in a wider range of ventures with the private sector. With these new freedoms, the Royal Mint will be able to reach its full potential, on its own, or in partnership with private sector firms.




<P>
<P><I>12 Jul 1999 : Column: 86</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90712w24.htm_para12">The updated model of corporate governance, and the private sector expertise it will inject, will help develop the Royal Mint as a business. It will also be vital in securing the best possible use of the new commercial freedoms that will be given to the Royal Mint. I believe the Royal Mint has the skills, the aptitudes and the opportunities to expand into wider markets on its own, and in partnership with commercial companies. In future it will be able to exploit them to the full.
<P>

<a name="90712w24.htm_para13">These fundamental changes will put real business expertise at the heart of the management of the Royal Mint, and will help maximise its value as a business and its contribution to the UK economy, to the benefit of all stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="90712w24.htm_para14">The Royal Mint has a successful track record. It has seen its business grow internationally, making it a world leader we can all be proud of. But the coinage business is increasingly competitive across the world, and we cannot stand still if we want to maintain its position at the forefront in the global marketplace. The package outlined above is an important first step in laying the foundations for the Royal Mint's future prosperity.
<P>

<a name="90712w24.htm_para15">We envisage a process of continuing development and improvement of the Royal Mint, its strategic direction, and its operating framework. We will be looking on a continuing basis at how best to expand and improve the business, and to help it adapt and respond to the challenges ahead.
