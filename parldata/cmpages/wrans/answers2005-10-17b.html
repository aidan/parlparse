 As a result of concerns that the Ministry of Defence had about DML&#039;s ability to manage a project as complex as D154, the company was subjected to three pre-contract award evaluations, the first in 1994 and the last in 1996. As reported by the NAO in their 1998 report into the sale of the dockyards, DML were subsequently required to implement a number of changes in order to satisfy the Department that they were adequately resourced and structured. These conditions were met and the changes in structure, processes and systems implemented by DML were instrumental in ensuring that key facilities were ready in time for the start of HMS Vanguard&#039;s overhaul in 2002. This was a major achievement, a fact that was recognised by the NAO in their 2002 report &quot;The construction of nuclear submarine facilities at Devonport&quot;.

Business may receive free and independent support and advice to help them increase their profitability by sending less waste to landfill. Envirowise was set up in 1994 for that purpose.

 We know from our evaluation of various small-scale yellow and other dedicated school bus schemes that well-designed schemes have the potential to reduce car dependency for journeys to school and the traffic congestion that results from this.

<sup>(6)</sup> The figures for 2002/03 onwards are on a different basis from those for earlier years, so are not directly comparable with the figures up to 2001/02. The figures from 2002/03 onwards are more comprehensive as they include some institutions (such as specialist designated institutions) previously excluded from statistical publications, and also take into account changes to funding arrangements made by the LSC since taking over responsibility for FE funding. The impact of these changes is estimated to have increased overall learner numbers by around 250,000 between 2001/02 and 2002/03, but the effect on numbers of LLDD in particular has not been estimated.<br>

 Funding for the further education (FE) sector is not being reduced. We are putting more money than ever into further education. Total funding for the FE sector will increase by over &#163;1 billion in 2005/06 compared to 2002/03&#151;a 25 per cent. increase.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51017w11.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_67">The Department allocates funds for education and training in the post-16 learning and skills sector to the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) through our annual grant letter. Funding allocations for FE providers increased by 16.3 per cent. between 2002/03 and 2003/04, by 9.1 per cent. between 2003/04 and 2004/05, and by 4.4 per cent. between 2004/05 and 2005/06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51017w11.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_68">The particularly large increase in 2003&#150;04 is a result of the consolidation of previously targeted funds, and the extra investment through Success for All. All colleges received increases in core funding rates of 2.5 per cent. above inflation in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06, with some colleges receiving even higher increases. The relatively lower increase in 2005&#150;06 is still significantly higher than inflation and in part reflects actual learner numbers in colleges as compared to plans, and the Government&#039;s intention&#151;as set out in the Skills Strategy and reaffirmed in the Skills White Paper: &quot;Getting on in Business, Getting on in Work&quot;&#151;to rebalance over time the contributions of the state, employers and individuals towards the costs of learning. This was reflected in a 2.5 percentage point increase in the assumed fee contribution to the cost of learning for those learners not in national entitlement groups. Even so, this resulted in seven out of 10 colleges receiving an above inflation increase in budget&#151;almost half of them getting an increase of over 5 per cent.

Includes planned expenditure on the provision for pupils with statements and the provision for non-statemented pupils with SEN, support for inclusion, inter authority recoupment, fees for pupils at independent special schools and abroad, educational psychology service, local authority functions in relation to child protection, therapies and other health related services, parent partnership, guidance and information, the monitoring of SEN provision and inclusion administration, assessment and co-ordination. Also included is the funding delegated to nursery, primary and secondary schools identified as &quot;notional SEN&quot; and the individual schools budget (ISB) for special schools.<br>

2. The ISB for special schools will include some general education costs for pupils with SEN in addition to those costs specifically for SEN while the figures recorded against &quot;notional SEN&quot; are only indicative of the amount that might be spent by schools on SEN and, from 2004&#150;05 onwards, &quot;notional SEN&quot; delegated to nursery schools was reported on section 52 for the first time and this 



accounts for &#163;13,000 and &#163;14,000 of the 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 totals respectively. In 2005&#150;06, Essex also budgeted &#163;13.5 million for SEN transport expenditure but this is not included in the budgeted net expenditure on SEN as figures are not available prior to 2005&#150;06.<br>

3. Figures are as reported by the LEA in cash terms as at 13 October 2005 and are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds and may not sum due to founding.<br>

 Mature students have the same access to financial support for the undergraduate degree in medicine as do younger students. If entering higher education in 2005&#150;06, they could be eligible during the first four years of the course for tuition fee support, the Higher Education Grant, a student maintenance loan and any more specialised grant like the child care grant (which in fact is mainly received by mature students). Currently the only restrictions on funding for eligible students are on tuition fees if a student has previous study and on the maintenance loan if a student is aged over 55 (or 50 if not going into work subsequently). From 2006&#150;07 there will be no age limit applied to the fee loan and the age limit on maintenance loans will be increased to age 60. The Department of Health pay tuition fees and provide bursaries in the fifth and any subsequent year of the course.

<i>[holding answer 13 October 2005]:</i> The Home Office does not estimate the value of the illegal drugs trade at a local level. We do, however, estimate the overall size of the market for illicit drugs on a national basis. In 2001, the Home Office published an estimate of the size of the market for illicit drugs in the UK which amounted to around &#163;6.6 billion in 1998.

The Home Office Active Communities Directorate has created a small implementation team to take forward the Commission&#039;s recommendations. This team will work closely with other Government Departments, the private sector and voluntary sector on a number of activities between now and March 2006, at which point the dedicated implementation body will be launched.

<a name="51017w16.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_85">We are committed to bringing more sexual offenders to justice. The Sexual Offences Act 2003 redefined and increased the penalties for many sexual offences and clarified the law on consent. We are encouraging more victims to report sexual crime and specially trained police officers and prosecutors have been established to deal with rape cases. At court, we have introduced a range of measures to facilitate the giving of evidence by victims.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51017w16.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_87">Following the Bichard enquiry, wide-ranging action has been implemented, including developing consistent standards and working practices between police services, requiring much more effective joined-up working between different agencies and establishing training for head teachers and governors to help them screen out people applying for jobs working with children who may pose a risk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51017w16.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_88">We have developed the way that the police, probation service and others work together to ensure that decisions about managing known sex offenders are based on the best information available. In addition, there are also tighter requirements for known sex offenders to notify their whereabouts to the police and any plans they have to travel abroad. Based on evidence about what really works in reducing offending, intensive programmes are being run both in prison and the community (for sex offenders).

 Sport based activities are one of the key interventions delivered through the Youth Inclusion Programmes and Positive Activities for Young People and are part of the Government&#039;s wide package of measures to target and steer young people most at risk of crime and reduce their re-offending. Sport is also an important part of the Youth Justice Board&#039;s Intensive Supervision and Surveillance Programme.

Using this service removes the need to use post, and (because of the in-built checks) has a very high probability of returns being correct first time.

Notes:<br>

1. Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia reporting became a mandatory requirement from 1 April 2002.<br>

2. Staphylococcus aureus patient episodes&#039; are defined as the total number of patients from whom blood culture set(s) collected during the quarter grew Staphylococcus aureus. If repeat specimens were collected from a single patient, and the patient was considered to have had two episodes of bacteraemia, then they should be counted as two patients. As an arbitrary measure, if positive blood culture sets are collected more than 14 days apart, they should be considered as reflecting different episodes.<br>

In response, boards have agreed to operate within the Local Authority Road Safety Officers Association (LARSOA) guidelines. These guidelines provide an objective, risk-based framework for assessing the need for crossing patrols, taking into account factors such as the volume of traffic, road width, availability of footpaths and provision of other crossing aids such as footbridges or pelican crossings.

If the patrol point does not meet the criteria a board will not replace the retiring patrolperson.

 The decision to produce the handbook was based on various sources of feedback from MPs and their researchers. This included surveys conducted by NFP Synergy on the attitude of MPs towards various non-departmental public bodies. The research indicated that MPs wished to have more contact with HSE, and that health and safety issues were a common theme in constituency correspondence that they deal with. As a result, the handbook was produced to provide an easy source of reference for answers to a typical range of questions about health and safety, and to provide helpful contact details for more information. The total cost of producing the handbook (including HSE staff time) was &#163;12,000. A number of MPs have thanked HSE for the handbook.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished consultant episode is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of correct data.<br>

 A range of initiatives are in place to improve the recruitment and retention of midwives working in the national health service in England.

 As vasa praevia is a very rare condition and technically difficult to detect, even for a highly skilled ultrasonographer with the appropriate specialist equipment (a colour Doppler scanner), routine screening of all pregnant women for vasa praevia is not currently advocated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. Neither the national screening committee nor the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) have made any assessments into screening for this condition.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="51017w38.html_spnew7"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The Government take the recent increases in energy prices very seriously, and particularly their impact on the competitiveness of UK industry. In January this year my Department set up the Gas Prices Working Group with the Energy Intensive Users&#039; Group and Ofgem, with the remit of examining the workings of the gas market and developing ideas for improving its operation. The group has now agreed a list of action points for the short to medium term, such as maximising gas supplies, encouraging demand side response and pursuing energy market liberalisation in the EU.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51017w38.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Gas is a substantial component of the UK fuel mix in electricity generation, so the movement in the gas price is probably the largest factor behind electricity price increases. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) is also having an impact on electricity prices. We recognise that some business stakeholders have argued for greater simplicity and streamlining of instruments aimed at the business sector in the wake of the EU ETS. This will be an important consideration in the Government&#039;s deliberations during the current review of the climate change programme.

 The cost to developers of section 106 agreements may vary significantly depending on the type and size of development, its location and local planning policies. The most recent assessment of the value of planning obligations across England was undertaken by Sheffield University in 1999. The study indicated that the average contribution through a planning obligation for a development in the North was &#163;148,000 and in the South was &#163;754,000.

Final development proposals and planning applications will determine the mix of housing types, sale prices and community facilities for each site.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51017w44.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_39">English Partnerships carried out base valuations of the sites before the start of the competition, which included an estimate of projected sales prices for the mix of homes on each site. The final sales prices will be determined by the developers according to local market circumstances. The nine competition sites are as far apart as Leeds and Hastings. Average sales prices will therefore vary between sites according to local market conditions.

 Third parties do not have a right of appeal in the way that applicants do because it is the responsibility of local planning authorities to act in the general public interest when determining planning applications.

They must take account of the views of local people on planning matters before taking decisions and elected members must justify their decisions subsequently to their electorate.
