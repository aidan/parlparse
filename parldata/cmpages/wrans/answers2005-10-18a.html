<a name="51018w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Chess</h3>


<p><a name="qn_0"><a name="51018w01.html_wqn0"><b> Susan Kramer: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on official recognition of chess as a sport.  [15892]</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="51018w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Chess is not currently recognised as a sport. The unanimous support of all four national Sports Councils and UK Sport is required in order for a sport or its governing body to receive official recognition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">The criteria that the Sports Councils use to decide whether an activity should be recognised as a sport are derived from their Royal Charters, and ultimately from the Physical Training and Recreation Act 1937. Legal advice has stated that chess does not fall within the meaning of the word &quot;sport&quot; for the purposes of the Royal Charter, or the meaning of &quot;physical training and recreation&quot; in the Act. Recognition of chess would therefore require amendments to the Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51018w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">Sport is now a devolved matter, so a change in the current position would require the unanimous support of both the Devolved Administrations (DAs) and the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Oct 2005 : Column 822W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Sports Councils, before any progress could be made. It would be necessary to put a case to the DAs and the Sports Councils for legislative change that would include chess, and if necessary other &quot;mind games&quot;, within the criteria for recognition as a sport. The case put forward must be able to convince them that chess provides the same benefits to the public, such as improved health and fitness, as recognised sports, in order to merit equal status and the financial support that comes with it.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="51018w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is responsible on behalf of the Cabinet for the arrangements for the annual Remembrance day ceremony at the Cenotaph. As, Minister for Culture I am working with Paul Goggins, Minister for Race Equality in the Home Office, to explore the most appropriate role for the Government in the bicentenary celebrations to mark the abolition of slave trade in 2007.

<a name="stpa_3">Culture Online (COL) is an innovative initiative to increase access to, and participation in, arts and culture. It brings together cultural organisations with cutting-edge technical providers to create projects that delight adults and children of all ages and backgrounds. Eighteen projects have been commissioned so far. As the programme has developed, COL has attracted an increasing amount of public recognition, awards and nominations. The projects have won three BAFTA Interactives, one Webby, three Newspaper Society awards and an Association of Online Publishers award; 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Oct 2005 : Column 827W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
two projects have been nominated for British Interactive Media Association awards. COL was also cited as a best practice case study in the NAO&#039;s &quot;Managing Risks to Improve Public Services&quot; report, published last year.

The actual amounts will vary between soil types and land management practices, and recent evidence suggests that carbon is increasing in some soils.

At the start of the Scheme the participants committed to deliver 3.96 million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub>  equivalent (tCO <sub>2</sub> e) in emissions reductions by the end of the Scheme (2006). To date, DPs have exceeded targets, and the Scheme has delivered additional emissions reductions of 5.9 million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub> e.

The representation indicated the Government&#039;s view that a case has not been made for this departure from national policy and a regionally specific policy was therefore not justified in the RSS.
