<p><a name="stpa_693"><a name="81125w0002.htm_para2"><a name="081125100000016">With regard to the implications of sea ice melt for the Greenland ice sheet, a MOHC study has examined the impacts of long-term deglaciation of the Greenland ice sheet using a greenhouse gas concentration scenario where the Arctic becomes free of sea ice during the summer. This experiment incorporated a model of sea ice so that interactions between sea ice and Greenland land ice melt were included.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_694"><a name="81125w0002.htm_para3"><a name="081125100000017">The results showed a maximum contribution from the melting Greenland ice sheet to sea level rise of 5 mm per year, which is within the uncertainty range already considered in projections of sea level rise around the UK coastline. However processes involving rapid movement of ice within the ice sheets are not included in this, or other current ice sheet models, as the dynamics are still poorly understood. Further work is needed to improve these models and thus estimates of sea level rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_695"><a name="81125w0002.htm_para4"><a name="081125100000018">The UK also monitors changes in the Greenland ice sheet directly. Observational measurements of the rate of change of its volume have been carried out by UK research groups over the last 15 years, using satellite radar remote sensing. Recently scientists at the British Antarctic Survey (BAS), part of the Natural Environment Research Council, have developed a new, more accurate technique for determining ice cap changes, using satellite laser technology. Significant research on the fundamental physics of glaciers and ice sheets is being carried out by BAS and other UK research groups, often in Antarctica.</p>

 There is currently significant spare capacity on High Speed 1. Much of this will be utilised when domestic high-speed services commence in December 2009.

 UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) forces on the ground are best placed to deal with the current situation: I fully support their efforts to do so, and commend them for the work they have done.

The Council issued conclusions which reiterated its support for MONUC in these difficult circumstances and asked that everything be done to allow it to fulfil its role completely.

The employee should feel able to involve the local staff association, and no staff association representative will be penalised in any way for becoming involved. If the employee is unsatisfied with the outcome of this process or of any appeal, then they may have recourse to the local courts (subject to the possible application of local Iraqi laws, including Coalition Provisional Authority Orders in this regard).</p>

Only national health service trusts reporting relevant income have been included in the table.  2. Some of these trusts provide services other than mental health care and the Department is unable to separate income for mental health care from other income, therefore some of the figures in the table may include income from private patients that are not mental health patients.  3. The data are from national health service trust audited summarisation schedules. Data on foundation trusts are not included as the Department does not collect information from foundation trusts. Where an NHS Trust gains foundation trust status during any financial year, the audited summarisation schedules report information only for the part of the year the organisation operated as an NHS trust.<br>

<i> [holding answer 24 November 2008]:</i> Many factors influence trends in the use of animals under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, including the economic climate, global trends in scientific endeavour and strategic decisions by funding bodies. The increase in the use of genetically altered strains seen over recent years has also had an impact as advances in genetics open up new and promising avenues of medical research.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_851"><a name="81125w0015.htm_para5"><a name="08112618000087">The licensing system under the 1986 Act is demand-led and we have no control over the number of project licence applications we receive. The Act limits such animal use to where there is a clear benefit to people, animals or the environment when there is no means of obtaining these benefits without animal use, or at a lesser animal welfare cost. All scientists and researchers undertaking animal research in the UK are required to take into account the &#145;3Rs&#146; (measures to replace, reduce, and refine animal use) when devising their programmes of research proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_852"><a name="81125w0015.htm_para6"><a name="08112618000088">In 2004, the Government established the National Centre for the 3Rs to provide a focal point and resources for such activities. The NC3Rs drives advances in the 3Rs by taking a robust scientific approach, and bringing together expertise from a diverse range of areas, including academia, industry, Government and regulatory bodies.</p>

 I have been asked to reply. The following table shows the number of recommendations for deportation orders issued by judges in the Crown Court in England and Wales in each of the last three financial years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_888"><a name="81125w0018.htm_para13"><a name="08112618000551">Figures are broken down according to the county in which the relevant Crown Court centre is located. This may differ from the county of residence of the defendant and other key parties involved in the court case. Some counties do not have a Crown Court centre located within their boundaries; these are not shown in the table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_889"><a name="81125w0018.htm_para14"><a name="08112618000552">During this period there were 28 occasions where a defendant was the subject of a recommendation for a deportation order having already been the subject of a previous such recommendation at some point since April 2000 (the earliest point at which data are available). There were six such occurrences in 2005-06, seven in 2006-07 and 15 in 2007-08. However, these data are not broken down to county level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_890"><a name="81125w0018.htm_para15"><a name="08112618000553">These figures only show judicial recommendations for deportation made during criminal proceedings in the Crown Court. More general immigration statistics can be found on the Home Office website;</p>

 The number and proportion of recorded crimes detected in which a DNA match was available is shown in table 1. Data on the number of crimes detected with a DNA match are not collected on a monthly basis; and the figures are therefore presented by year. The figures provided are for the years 2002-03 to 2007-08, as the recorded crime figures before and after 2002-03 are not directly comparable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_893"><a name="81125w0019.htm_para2"><a name="08112618000748">The figures for the number of crimes detected in which a DNA match was available only include crimes detected in which a DNA match was reported by the National DNA Database (NDNAD). They do not include DNA matches which arise through case work in serious crime, which usually involve comparing DNA profiles in a forensic laboratory; this data is not collected centrally. It is also important to note that the detections are achieved through integrated criminal investigation, not through DNA alone.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_894"><a name="81125w0019.htm_para3"><a name="08112618000749">The presentation of crimes detected with DNA as a proportion of total recorded crime undervalues the relative contribution of DNA to the crime detection rate. It should be noted that the majority of recorded crimes do not have a crime scene (for example, minor assault, drugs offences, theft, fraud etc.) and do not have a crime scene examination. In 2007-08, just over 854,000 crimes had a crime scene examination (17 per cent. of recorded crimes). In those crimes which have a crime scene examination, some do not yield any forensic material (DNA or fingerprints). In 2007-08, potential DNA material was collected at 102,400 crimes; and of these, 41,800 crimes yielded DNA crime scene samples of sufficient quantity and quality for profiling and loading to the NDNAD. Of the 41,800 crimes in which a crime scene sample profile was loaded, a match was generated in 37,375 crimes (this represents 89 per cent. of crimes where DNA material was loaded to the NDNAD).</p>

 Information held on the national DNA database (NDNAD) is recorded on the basis of the police force which took the DNA sample. Thus figures for any particular police force include residents from outside the force area arrested and sampled by the police force, and exclude residents in the force area who were arrested and sampled by police forces elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_898"><a name="81125w0019.htm_para7"><a name="08112618000844">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because a number of subject profiles on the NDNAD are replicates, that is a profile for a person has been loaded to the NDNAD on more than one occasion. This may arise for a number of reasons, such as a person giving a different name on different occasions they are arrested, or because of upgrading of profiles. It is estimated that 13.3 per cent. of the subject profiles held on the entire NDNAD are replicates. However, this rate may vary between police forces, so figures for the number of individuals are not given for particular police forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_899"><a name="81125w0019.htm_para8"><a name="08112618000845">Ethnicity is recorded on the basis of the judgment of the police officer taking the sample as to which of six broad ethnic appearance categories the person belongs to. &#145;Unknown&#146; means that no ethnic appearance information was recorded by the officer taking the sample.</p>

We have also launched a &#163;3 million three-year publicity campaign designed by young people focusing on the risks and consequences of knife carrying.

There was no survey in 1997 and therefore figures are interpolated from within the overall time series, but this can be provided only for the social rented sector as a whole.

 I believe the hon. Member may be referring to section 54A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, which was repealed and replaced by section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. This requires determinations under the planning Acts to be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The effect of proposed development on a listed building, conservation area or other heritage asset could constitute a material consideration. The provision ensures that heritage assets are given due consideration when planning applications are being determined.</p>

 Formula Grant is made up from Revenue Support Grant, redistributed Business Rates and principal formula Police Grant and distributed to local authorities in England. The distribution of Formula Grant takes into account the relative need to provide services in an area and the relative ability of an area to raise council tax locally, relative to all other authorities providing the same service.

Except for highways maintenance and capital finance, the resident population (measured by the Office for National Statistics&#146;s sub-national population projections) are the main driver of the formula.

 The UK Government have made significant progress in the past year, to ensure that key enablers (transport, accommodation, communications, and close protection) are in place in Afghanistan and Iraq.</p>

There are now sufficient vehicles in theatre (or on order) to meet the requirement. The construction of permanent office and personal accommodation for civilian teams in Sangin, Musa Qala, Gereshk and Garmsir has enabled the UK Government to dramatically improve their engagement with communities to deliver the UK strategy in Helmand.</p>

 The Stabilisation Unit primarily delivers through the civilian experts it deploys. It is taking a number of steps to improve its ability to provide high quality experts on as sustainable basis, to Afghanistan, Iraq and other theatres. There are two principal initiatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1096"><a name="81125w0036.htm_para10"><a name="08112643001042">First, in August it started a nine month process to improve the quality of its database of civilian experts by turning it from a list of 900 people where most experts have only been subject to a basic paper sift to one where all experts will have been assessed face-to-face against professional and behavioural requirements. This greater understanding will enable the Unit to improve its ability to respond to demands for experts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1097"><a name="81125w0036.htm_para11"><a name="08112643001043">Second, civilian experts need to be properly prepared to work and live in what can be professionally challenging and austere conditions.

By December the unit will complete the design of a more extensive structured, tailored development programme for deploying experts to Afghanistan with implementation on a pilot basis starting in January 2009.</p>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income data.<br>
2. The reference period for household below average income figures is single financial years. Distributions by equivalised income decile are based on a three-year average to help take account of small sample sizes in certain deciles and statistical variation across the years. Decile boundaries are presented in 2006-07 prices.<br>
3. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#147;Households Below Average Income&#148; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#145;equivalised&#146;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
4. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
5. Figures have been presented on both a before housing cost and after housing cost basis. For before housing cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing cost they are.<br>
6. This response includes incomes for the lowest deciles of the population. These figures are not National Statistics and caution must be applied because those people stating the lowest incomes in the FRS may not actually have the lowest living standards.<br>
7. Weekly incomes have been rounded to the nearest whole pound.<br>
8. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>

The final cost of the event will depend on a number of factors, including the number of attendees.

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Uncleared applications have been defined as those applications that have not yet reached a clearance point. A current scheme clearance is defined as: a maintenance calculation has been carried out and a payment arrangement between the parent with care and the non-resident parent is in place; a parent with care has been identified as claiming Good Cause or is subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision; the application is identified as being a change of circumstances on an existing case; or the application has been closed.<br>
2. Age of uncleared applications is calculated as the time from first contact with non-resident parent or parent with care until the last day of the month shown.<br>
3. Cases have been allocated to parliamentary constituency or region through matching the postcode for a residential address for the parent with care against the Office for National Statistics postcode directory.<br>
4. A proportion of applications can not be allocated to a parliamentary constituency or region. Such examples are where the parent with care's residential postcode is not recorded. In some of these cases, the Agency holds a residential address without a postcode; a "contact" address; or a business address. Many applications have not yet reached the stage in the process where the postcode information has been confirmed. Therefore it is not possible to associate them to a parliamentary constituency or region. Around 12 per cent. of applications can not be allocated to a region or parliamentary constituency as at June 2008.<br>
5. Figures for Eastern region have been rounded to the nearest 100 and those for North West Cambridgeshire to the nearest 10.<br>

<i>  [holding answer 27 October 2008]:</i> The Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission's most recent annual funding estimates, which will include the one-off costs of implementing the child maintenance reforms, are found in the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission Business Plan 2008-09. This is available at the following email address:</p>

Once a liability order is being actively considered by the Court, the non-resident parent can make representations for the Court to dismiss the liability order. The Courts currently dismiss less than one per cent of applications. The Agency believes that this is a good indication of the robustness of the checking regime currently in place. Finally, once a liability order has been awarded, the non-resident parent can again bring forward additional information, or indeed settle their arrears and the Agency may again consider whether it is appropriate to proceed with the application.</p>

No vulnerable customer is told to come back the next day.</p>

 Pension credit helps millions of older people. It ensures no pensioner aged 60 or over should have to live on less than &#163;124.05 per week for a single person and &#163;189.35 for a couple in 2008-09. Pension credit also rewards those aged 65 or over who have made modest provision for their retirement, up to &#163;19.71 for a single person and &#163;26.13 for a couple.

3. Since 30 July 2007 new entrants have been joining the nuvos section of the PCSPS. This is not a final salary scheme. In pensions terminology this would normally be referred to as a Career Average or CARE scheme. Benefits are linked to salary throughout someone's career rather than their final earnings.<br>
4. The increase in employer contributions between 2002-03 and 2003-04 reflects the increase in staffing needed to handle pension credit take-up.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the average income of pensioners in each household income <i> (a)</i> quintile and <i> (b)</i> decile was in (i) 2004-05 and (ii) 2005-06. [198782]</p>

 Specific information regarding low income for the United Kingdom is available in "Households Below Average Income 1994-95 to 2006-07". This annual report, which is a National Statistics publication, includes the numbers and proportions of pensioners with incomes below 50 per cent, 60 per cent and 70 per cent of median income and by quintile of the income distribution.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1207"><a name="81125w0050.htm_para10"><a name="08112653000507">Information on the median equivalised income of pensioners in each household income quintile and decile over the period 2004-05 to 2006-07 is shown in the tables below. Median equivalised incomes are given rather than mean equivalised incomes as these are less influenced by extreme values. The Households Below Average Income publication also uses median rather than mean equivalised incomes. Distributions by equivalised income decile are based on a three year average to help take account of small sample sizes in certain deciles and statistical variation across the years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1208"><a name="81125w0050.htm_para11"><a name="08112653000508">These figures are based on sampling and estimates. Movements in data over short periods may be due to sampling error but over a longer period trends are useful. Incomes in 1996-99 are therefore included for reference. Particular caution is required when looking at the incomes of the lowest deciles as those households stating the lowest incomes to the Family Resources Survey may not actually have the lowest living standards. Many people who report very low incomes appear to have high spending.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1209"><a name="81125w0050.htm_para12"><a name="08112653000509">Median equivalised income of pensioners in the bottom quintile increased by 36 per cent. between 1996-99 and 2004-07. Measures introduced by the Government since 1997 to help those on the lowest incomes include the introduction of the Minimum Income Guarantee and its successor Pension Credit and Winter Fuel Payments for those aged 60 and over. For 2009, we will raise the standard minimum guarantee to &#163;130.00&#151;an above indexation increase of &#163;5.95. We will be making an additional payment for winter 2008-09 of &#163;50 for households with someone aged 60-79 and &#163;100 for those with someone aged 80 or over. And in addition to this the Government will make a payment in the new year of &#163;60 for each pensioner, equivalent to bringing forward uprating of the basic State Pension from April to January.</p>

At the same time, it maintains at a roughly constant level the same proportion of adult life spent in retirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1211"><a name="81125w0051.htm_para1"><a name="08112653000566">It would not be feasible to increase state pension age to 70 by 2020 without giving those affected sufficient notice, particularly those within 10 years of the equalised state pension age of 65. The number of people affected would depend on how and when the increase was to be implemented and the cohorts of future pensioners it was to apply to.</p>

 The estimates of numbers Not in Education, Employment or Training (NEET) and NEET rates for 16-24 year olds presented in the following tables are taken from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) for Quarter 4 1997 and Quarter 4 2007 as in the previous reply. In order to ensure that the estimates are reasonably robust the tables shown here are for all England given the nature of the breakdowns requested. Despite the condensed nature of the groups shown in the tables some of the estimates are based on small samples and should be treated with caution.</p>

Consequently such a breakdown is not well suited to young people as it will merely reflect their own most recent occupation rather than their family background. Nevertheless information on two broad groupings of NS-SEC are shown below for Quarter 4 2007. Comparable information by NS-SEC is not available for 1997.</p>

Data published by the Department as SFR 23/2008: Children looked after in England (including adoption and care leavers) year ending 31 March 2008, show 47,600 children aged between five and 19 as being looked after as at 31 March 2008. The school census does not cover all looked after children; information is not collected for pupils in alternative provision, including pupil referral units, FE colleges, voluntary provision and those not in education or training. These differences in coverage will explain the different counts to an extent, but it is possible that the school census undercounts the number of looked after children in primary, secondary and special schools.</p>

 Eligibility for the education maintenance allowance (EMA) is based on household income. The Department for Children, Schools and Families does not hold information on household income for every eligible 16 to 18-year-old who participates in a course that meets the EMA valid provision criteria. Therefore it is not possible to calculate the number of students who are entitled to EMA.

They are not comparable with those for the years 1997-98 to 2005-06 because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1320"><a name="81125w0059.htm_para6"><a name="08112657000755">The 1997-98 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. The DSG is based largely on an authority's previous spending. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families what mechanisms there are by which London boroughs will receive additional capital allocations for primary schools in the next three years if new figures show an increase in demand for primary school places; and if he will make a statement.

 The Department relies on the accuracy of local authority forecasts when allocating basic need capital funding for additional pupil places. Accordingly, and to ensure that local authorities can plan strategically, the &#163;1.2 billion budget for basic need funding was allocated to London and other authorities at the beginning of the spending review period covering the years 2008-09 to 2010-11 . This can be used, at local authorities' discretion, to expand primary or secondary schools. In addition, the Department is allocating some &#163;1.9 billion to London and other authorities through its primary capital programme during this period, subject to local authorities agreeing their primary capital programmes for change with the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1332"><a name="81125w0061.htm_para0"><a name="08112657001208">The Department does not hold back funds for later distribution on the basis that primary school pupil forecasts may be inaccurate. Accordingly, where new figures show that original forecasts were too low, local authorities have the flexibility to use their modernisation allocations to fund primary school expansion. They may also have access to other local resources.</p>

 Our Every Child a Reader programme provides a &#145;layered&#146; approach to early literacy intervention based on providing Reading Recovery teaching to the very lowest attaining children; supporting other adults to provide less intensive interventions for children whose difficulties are not so severe; and working with colleagues to support improved everyday class teaching of literacy. The less intensive interventions include Better Reading Partnership which trains, among others, volunteers to read 1-to-1 with children using techniques from Reading Recovery. These layers will apply equally to children who do not require Reading Recovery or those who have previously been through Reading Recovery and require some follow up support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1335"><a name="81125w0061.htm_para3"><a name="08112657001230">In 2007, Greg Brooks, of Sheffield university, produced an updated version &#147;What Works for Children with Literacy Difficulties? The Effectiveness of Intervention Schemes&#148;. The review synthesised evidence on partnership approaches to improving reading: partners included older pupils, teachers, and adult volunteers. Brooks concluded that</p>
<a name="81125w0061.htm_brev7"><a name="08112657002546"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;where resources are limited, and partners are available and can be given appropriate training and ongoing support, reading partnership approaches deserve close consideration&#148; (p29).</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_1336"><a name="81125w0061.htm_para4"><a name="08112657001231">The interventions reviewed by Brooks which specifically used adult volunteers were Better Reading Partnerships, ENABLE One-To- One and Time for Reading. There was some evidence that these interventions had a positive effect on pupil outcomes, although in some cases the findings were more mixed, and it is important to remember that the interventions often involved components other than the adult volunteers, which makes it hard to identify the specific effect of the volunteers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1337"><a name="81125w0061.htm_para5"><a name="08112657001232">Separate to this Torgerson, King and Sowden (2002) conducted a systematic review of randomised controlled trials of adult volunteer reading schemes. Overall, volunteering appeared to have a small positive effect on pupil outcomes, but the evidence base was not sufficient to draw firm conclusions.</p>

For most this will mean good systematic phonics through the early years and beginning of primary school. For others, extra provision will be necessary&#151;primarily through school based interventions and our Every Child a Reader programme. We continue to fund local authorities and schools to strike the appropriate balance between specific intervention programmes with trained teachers for those children that need it; and other less expensive approaches using other members of the workforce and volunteers in other circumstances when they are known to work.</p>

 Current policy on collective worship is set out in Circular 1/94. All maintained schools must provide a daily act of collective worship, for all registered pupils. In schools without a religious character, this must be wholly or mainly of a broadly Christian nature; while in schools with a religious character, collective worship may be in accordance with the tenets and practices of the religious designation of the school. This requirement was established in the Education Act 1944 and has been re-enacted in subsequent educational legislation. It is the duty of the head teacher to secure a daily act of collective worship.

 All new school buildings must comply with the acoustic standards in Building Bulletin 93, &#147;Acoustic Design of Schools&#148;, 2003, which are quoted in Approved Document Part E in support of the Building Regulations. Building Control Bodies ensure that these standards are met. Section 6 of BB93 &#147;Acoustic design and equipment for pupils with special hearing requirements&#148; gives further guidance for children with hearing impairments. The Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requires local authorities and governing bodies to make reasonable adjustments to schools to cater for the special needs of particular children. Therefore, for any new school, the local authority or governing body must assess the expected level of special needs of the children who will be attending the school and determine if any adjustments to the BB93 standards are required. This may require consultation with educational audiologists and acousticians. In particular, a lower reverberation time may be needed in rooms where the hearing impaired are taught. There is a special needs appeal process and if the designs are not adequate for any particular children who will be attending the school then acoustic treatment may be required post construction.</p>

As a result of concerns about competition in the market for domestic bulk LPG, the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) made a market investigation reference to the Competition Commission (CC) in July 2004. In June 2006 the CC published a report which stated that difficulties in switching supplier have inhibited competition. The CC has arrived at a package of remedies which is intended to make it easier to switch supplier, and will provide greater transparency of pricing, providing information on which consumers will be able to take this decision. It is expected that the increased ability of consumers to switch supplier will increase competition in the market and put downward pressure on prices.</p>
