 The responsibility for funding Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) rests with Natural England and Defra would not interfere in the decisions Natural England takes in setting the budget of any AONB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="81110w0001.htm_para2"><a name="08111011000034">The funding for AONBs consists of three elements: core funding for staff and essential administrative costs; projects; and the Sustainable Development Fund. In 2008-09 Natural England has been able to add 2 per cent. to AONB core grants. Core funding is based on a formula which, among other factors, takes into account the area of each AONB. However, funding for projects has had to be prioritised to those of highest importance and those which AONB partnerships are locked into, such as Heritage Lottery Fund schemes. As for the Sustainable Development Fund, each AONB can bid for up to &#163;61,666 from Natural England. There is, therefore, no strict correlation between the area of any one AONB and the amount of total funding it receives and it is inappropriate to relate the total funding of any AONB to its area.</p>

DEFRA has contributed to the industry campaign by giving prominence to bluetongue messages in its existing communications channels, e.g. website, advertising in farming press and campaigns such as Livestock Market Roadshows and the website-based &#145;Give Disease the Boot&#146; campaign. In addition, DEFRA has worked with the Animal Health Agency to alert local veterinary surgeons and others to the availability of vaccine as it has been rolled out across England.</p>

 The UK Government's Forest Governance and Trade Programme aims to tackle illegal logging and trade associated with it. It works to promote governance reforms in developing countries where illegal logging is a problem, and to improve the functioning of markets for wood products. Efforts focus on negotiating and implementing bilateral Voluntary Partnership Agreements (VPAs) between timber-producing countries and the EU, as part of the Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan.</p>

 There have been four confirmed cases of the Warrior chain gun firing un-demanded since 2000. A total of 17 cases were recorded during this period, but after investigation by the MOD&#146;s serious equipment failure investigation team, 13 of these were found to be negligent discharges (human error) or undemanded operation (usually identified during pre-firing checks or maintenance procedures) where the gun operated, but no rounds were fired.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_78"><a name="81110w0002.htm_para3"><a name="08111022000040">To prevent un-demanded firings MOD is improving a number of vehicle sub-systems. This includes upgrading the chain gun control unit, which controls the firing of the gun, replacing the existing foot firing switch with a hand firing switch to operate the gun, and enhancements to turret electronics to prevent the possibility of short circuits. The modification programme is significantly improving the reliability of the chain gun across both Challenger and Warrior vehicle fleets. I am looking closely at the issue to see if there is more that can be done.</p>

 There are no plans to phase out the recruitment of under 18s into the armed forces. If the armed forces were required to raise the minimum age of entry, it would create serious manning problems, since 28 per cent. of all recruits in FY2007-08 were aged under 18. The services, in particular the Army, would be unable to man current structures and maintain current capabilities. It is probable that should the minimum entry age be raised, good quality school leavers would settle into other careers and thus be lost to the services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_79"><a name="81110w0002.htm_para4"><a name="08111022000046">All service personnel under 18 years of age who have completed 28 days service have a right of discharge within the first six months of service by giving not less than 14 days notice in writing to the commanding officer if they decide that the armed forces are not a career for them. In addition, service personnel under 18 years three months who have passed their statutory six month period for &#147;discharge as of right&#148;, and have registered, before reaching their 18th birthday, clear &#145;unhappiness&#146; at their choice of career, can request permission to leave the armed forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_80"><a name="81110w0002.htm_para5"><a name="08111022000047">No young person under the age of 18 years may join the UK armed forces unless their application is accompanied by the formal written consent of his or her parents or guardian. This has then to be witnessed by someone of standing in the community, before the applicant can enter service. There is already a robust system in place ensuring that all potential recruits are given full details of all the advantages and risks involved in service life. Throughout the recruit selection process, the staffs at the Armed Forces Careers Offices (AFCO) provide comprehensive written and verbal guidance to all potential recruits, in particular those of less than 18 years of age, and their parents or guardians. This guidance covers the potential recruit&#146;s terms and conditions of service, the commitments that they would be undertaking, and their rights to discharge.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_81"><a name="81110w0002.htm_para6"><a name="08111022000048">It is defence policy that service personnel under the age of 18 are not deployed on operations outside of the UK, except where the operation does not involve personnel becoming engaged in, or exposed to, hostilities. In addition, in line with UN policy, service personnel under 18 are not deployed on UN peacekeeping operations.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many individuals within the Greater Manchester Police Authority aged <i> (a)</i> under 13, <i> (b)</i> between 13 and 15, <i> (c)</i> between 16 and 18 and <i> (d)</i> between 19 and 21 years old have a sample on the national DNA database.

 Information held on the National DNA Database (NDNAD) is recorded on the basis of the police force which took the DNA sample. The address of the person sampled is not recorded. Thus, the figures for the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) Authority area include people from outside the GMP Authority area who were arrested and sampled by GMP; and exclude people from the GMP area who were arrested and sampled by police forces elsewhere.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_137"><a name="81110w0008.htm_para0"><a name="08111028001064">The table gives the number of subject profiles held on the NDNAD taken by GMP for the age ranges requested, as at 30 October 2008. The figures given are for current ages, not the age on the date the sample was taken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="81110w0008.htm_para1"><a name="08111028001065">The number of profiles is not the same as the number of individuals. This is because a number of subject profiles on the NDNAD are replicates, that is, a profile for a person has been loaded to the NDNAD on more than one occasion. This may arise for a number of reasons, such as a person giving a different name on different occasions they are arrested, or because of upgrading of profiles from the SGM to the SGM Plus profiling system. It is estimated that 13.3 per cent. of the subject profiles held on the entire NDNAD are replicates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="81110w0008.htm_para2"><a name="08111028001066">However, this rate may vary between police forces, so figures for the number of individuals are not given for particular forces.</p>

Data Quality Workforce statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

This was followed in 2008 by a stakeholder workshop organised by the Carbon Trust, at which the international experts in the algae community were well represented, and attendance by Carbon Trust employees at a number of international scientific conferences. The detailed design of the Algae Biofuels Challenge was then carried out in consultation with a leading US-based expert, who has detailed knowledge of the companies in the US and elsewhere that have received significant investment for algae biofuels technology.</p>

Once borrowers&#146; actual positions are established&#151;on a one-to-one confidential basis&#151;action is agreed accordingly, e.g. to re-establish scheduled instalment repayment amounts, to negotiate lower repayment amounts or, for those earning under the repayment threshold, to facilitate deferment of repayments.</p>

 In May, the Government announced a plan to take advantage of market opportunities to bring private sector developer stock into the affordable housing sector by providing &#163;200 million of funding through the Housing Corporation's national affordable housing programme (AHP) for the purchase of homes from house builders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="81110w0020.htm_para9"><a name="08111028002594">To help facilitate this, the Housing Corporation set up the National Clearing House to streamline initial assessment of national packages of at least 250 units from private sector house builders. Housing Corporation investment partners, mainly registered social landlords, wishing to buy smaller numbers of units from developers could bid for funding directly to the Corporation in the normal way. There are currently no plans to open up the Housing Corporation's AHP to individual home owners.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="81110w0020.htm_para10"><a name="08111028002595">The average grant and total scheme cost per unit of all developer stock that has been purchased with funding through the AHP since May is set out in the following table. This includes both those schemes that were assessed through the National Clearing House and the smaller schemes that were assessed through the Housing Corporation.</p>

It is intended specifically to support only those debtors who encounter unforeseen short-term difficulties from which they are likely to recover in a relatively short period.

 Under existing legislation, rolling registration exists alongside the household registration system in Great Britain as a means of allowing individuals to register to vote. The current law requires Electoral Registration Officers (EROs) to conduct an annual canvass and publish a revised register by 1 December each year. The Government have no plans to issue guidance on the use of rolling registration to update registers. Responsibility for issuing guidance to EROs on electoral registration matters lies with the Electoral Commission.</p>

The Government's approach to electoral registration is clear: we want to protect the rights of every eligible person to participate in the United Kingdom's democratic process by ensuring complete, accurate and secure electoral registration.</p>

 A charging order, under the Charging Orders Act 1979, is a means of securing a judgment debt by placing a charge onto the debtor's immovable property, particularly a house or land, although it can also be used against shares. A charging order also allows a judgment creditor to apply subsequently to the court for an order for sale. Charging orders therefore provide a means by which a judgment creditor can gain access to any equity a debtor holds in property.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_292"><a name="81110w0021.htm_para12"><a name="08111028003304">Research indicates that charging orders are used most often as a form of long-term security for a judgment debt. In the overwhelming majority of instances, once the security of a charging order has been obtained, creditors are more likely to accept long-term "time to pay" agreements to clear the judgment debt, knowing that their position is secure.</p>

These changes will allow a judgment creditor to apply for a charging order even where a debtor is up to date with an instalment arrangement. The Act will also introduce new minimum thresholds below which it will not be possible to apply for a charging order or an order for sale.</p>

 The UN Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) has not been reinforced externally. The mission has re-deployed existing resources within the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to tackle the current crisis in North Kivu. These include the redeployment of an additional battalion and two additional attack helicopters. MONUC has increased its overall troop strength in Goma from 850 to 1,500. The United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations and MONUC are examining further potential reinforcements from other areas of operations within the DRC. The UK supports this reorganisation of MONUC&#146;s resources and we will work through the UN Security Council to ensure the mission&#146;s resources are deployed as effectively as possible.</p>

Should additional resources be approved, it will be the responsibility of the UN Department of Peacekeeping Operations to ensure they are quickly identified and deployed. The length of time that would be needed for this would be subject to the availability of peacekeeping resources, and the willingness of troop and police-contributing countries to make commitments to the mission.</p>

 We received reports that, on 16 October, Iran&#146;s Deputy Prosecutor-General for Judicial Affairs announced that a directive had been issued to all judicial officials stating that people convicted of crimes which took place when they were under the age of 18 would not be executed and would instead be given alternative sentences, regardless of their offence. However, on 18 October he clarified that this only applied to non-sharia crimes, and that sharia crimes such as murder were not included.</p>

Additionally, similar non-binding directives or declared moratoria by the Iranian judiciary have had limited impact and have not subsequently been adopted into law.

This year alone we, and the EU, have raised this subject and made representations in individual cases of juveniles facing execution at least twenty-two times in meetings with the Iranian authorities and through public statements. Senior Foreign Office officials did so most recently during the visit of Iran&#146;s Deputy Foreign Minister in September.</p>

 The head teacher vacancy rate remains low and stable. The Department does not collect the numbers of deputy head teachers that move into headship.

The College has been making significant progress in identifying ambitious teachers and helping them become heads and latest NCSL figures show that more than 1,034<sup>(1)</sup> head teachers took up their first headship post in England over the past 12 months.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families what estimate he has made of the increase in <i> (a)</i> pupil numbers and <i> (b)</i> school estates over the next 10 years as a result of the change in post-16 year old education provision; and at what cost. [232337]</p>

 There are two fundamental changes expected in post 16 provisions over the next 10 years. Firstly by 2015, subject to the successful passage of the current Education and Skills Bill, all young people will be required to be in some form of education or training until at least 18. Secondly, in the future, all publicly funded qualifications will fall within one of four routes&#151;Apprenticeships, Diplomas, the Foundation Learning Tier or General Qualifications (GCSEs and A Levels). The growth in numbers of Apprenticeships toward one in five young people, alongside the delivery of 17 Diploma lines, will both enable full participation of young people and mean that the growth of pupil numbers is not predominantly schools based.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="81110w0028.htm_para0"><a name="08111110000775">In 2007/08, there were 447,500 16 to 17-year-olds and 23,800 18-year-olds participating in schools out of a total of 1,119,400 16 to 17-year-olds and 375,800 18-year-olds participating in Education and Work Based Learning. Mid-year population estimates for 2015 suggest that, with full participation, there will be around 1,197,300 16 to 17-year-olds participating in Education and WBL. The trajectory, and costs attributed to achieving these levels of participation, including the relative contribution of schools, colleges and other providers will be agreed as part of the next spending review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="81110w0028.htm_para1"><a name="08111110000776">The changes in provision will mean changing requirements as to what schools, colleges and learning providers offer, with some implications for school estates. The 16-19 capital fund was established to meet the cost of new post-16 places in schools and colleges. The value of this fund is &#163;630 million in the three years to 2010-11. In addition, there will be a further &#163;30 million in 2010-11 in recognition of the additional post-16 costs associated with raising the participation age. Further monies will need to be agreed as part of the next spending review.</p>

However my Department does not collect data on how many specialist language schools teach languages on a compulsory basis until the age of 16 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="81110w0028.htm_para2"><a name="08111110000792">Languages are already a compulsory part of the national curriculum at key stage 3. In response to Lord Dearing&#146;s recommendations on how to increase the number of pupils doing languages post-14 we will provide better and more coherent support for teachers, introduce a more flexible curriculum and make languages compulsory at key stage 2 from September 2011.</p>

From November 2007 we have also introduced the facility to allow payments to be made directly into the bank account of the funeral director where the bill had not been paid.

<i> [holding answer 20 October 2008]:</i> Under the proposals in the Green Paper carers who move from income support to a modified jobseeker&#146;s allowance would continue to receive the same level of benefit as they currently receive on income support. On current rates they would qualify for &#163;60.50 basic rate jobseeker&#146;s allowance (if single and over age 25&#151;different rates apply to couples and those under 25) and &#163;27.75 carer premium.

Bringing producers into fairtrade certification involves informing producers about the standards required, including that a democratically-run group must exist that decides how to invest for social purposes the &#145;fairtrade premium&#146; they will receive. Our funding helps support specific work such as the FLO &#145;Strategic Review&#146; currently under way, that considers progress against the objectives of providing market access on good terms for poorer producers in developing countries, to identify and share what is working and what remains a challenge.</p>
