 The Executive Committee of the Multilateral Fund for the Implementation of the Montreal Protocol had its 23rd meeting on 12-14 November. The meeting, chaired by the UK, allocated US$109 million to projects assisting developing countries in phasing out ozone-depleting substances. In total, 259 phase-out activities were approved in 45 developing countries.
<P>

<a name="71222w01.html_para0">Most significantly, the Committee approved a US$62 million project to phase out 99 per cent. of halon production and consumption in China by 2006, four years in advance of Protocol requirements. The remaining one per cent. will be phased out by 2010. As halons are the most potent of all ozone-depleting substances, this represents a major step to protect the stratospheric ozone layer.
<P>

<a name="71222w01.html_para1">The Multilateral Fund totals US$1 billion in commitments to the end of 1999. The UK is the fifth largest donor and committed almost US$50 million in the period 1991-97.

 Ministers held further discussions on the future of EC trade and development relations with the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) States. The Council agreed one Resolution, on the use of micro-finance programmes as a development tool. The Council also adopted a set of procedural Conclusions, on the Information Society and Development, which set out further work the Commission proposes to do in the area to ensure that within developing countries the benefits from new technologies are shared by all. The Council also discussed and agreed in principle to the extension of the current Food Aid Convention for one year, until 30 June 1999, in order that a new revised Convention can be drawn up. There were exchanges of views on two subjects; the first on the follow-up to the Gender Resolution of 1995, the second covered follow-up to the Conclusions on Linking Relief, Rehabilitation and Development.

<a name="71222w01.html_para2">Eight items were raised under any other business. As they were AOB points, there were no formal conclusions. However, there was a useful discussion on the 1996 DAC Report on EC development assistance. The humanitarian situation in the Great Lakes Region in Africa and the coming Friends of Congo meeting were also discussed.

<P>
<a name="71222w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 The latest number of records released under the Open Government Initiative now stands at over 85,000 and relates to releases up to the end of September 1997. This represents an increase of about 9 per cent. over the previous total of over 77,500, which was announced by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Office of Public Service in the adjournment debate on Freedom of Information on 9 July 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 902-10, and related the total figure as at the end of March 1997.

 I am advised that the oldest records held by the Public Record Office which have not been released are 27 volumes of boxes of Enrolled Deposited Leases, and associated documents, of the Office of Land Revenue Records and Enrolments, dating partly or wholly from before 1900. For information on the oldest public records retained in Government Departments I refer my hon. Friend to answers given in response to a question by the hon. Member for Lewes (Mr. Baker), <i>Official Report</i>, 8 July 1997, columns <i>391, 393, 394, 421, 425, 428, 436, 449</i> and <i>463</i>; 9 July 1997, columns <i>471-2</i> and <i>485</i>; 10 July 1997, columns <i>555, 573</i> and <i>614</i>; 17 July 1997, column <i>275</i>.

<a name="71222w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will take steps to provide financial assistance to women formerly employed in the Civil Service who lost their pension entitlement as a result of being paid lump-sum gratuities from their accumulated pension contributions at their time of leaving; and if he will make a statement. [22106]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 I have no plans to change the rules that applied to women who resigned their established appointments before 1 June 1972 on marriage and received a gratuity.
<P>

<a name="71222w01.html_para5">Until civil service pension arrangements were changed in 1972, the general rule was that anybody who resigned from an established, that is, a pensionable post, before reaching age 50 automatically lost all eligibility for superannuation benefits in respect of their pre-resignation service. That eligibility could not be restored even if the person concerned subsequently returned to the service and became established and pensionable again.
<P>

<a name="71222w01.html_para6">The arrangements for marriage gratuities for women who married while serving in an established post were an exception to this general rule. A women who received a marriage gratuity and who later returned to pensionable service in the civil service had opportunity, subject to the time limits which applied, to refund the gratuity and count her earlier service for the purpose of any superannuation award for which she subsequently became eligible.
<P>

<a name="71222w01.html_para7">Any change in these arrangements would on fairness grounds also have to extend to former civil servants who resigned for other reasons from their established appointments before 1972 and who did not qualify for pension benefits. It is rarely, if ever, possible to make retrospective changes in pension arrangements.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 Since 2 May, the total number of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) has fallen by nine. The Government are committed to keeping the number of NDPBs to a minimum and Ministers are currently examining the NDPBs they sponsor with a view to identifying further candidates for abolition.
<P>

I am advised that arrangements are now in place for an alternative machine to apply the House of Commons frank under these circumstances.

<a name="71222w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what national arrangements exist for the public registration of an individual's <i>(a)</i> will, prior to death, <i>(b)</i> enduring power of attorney and <i>(c)</i> advance directive. [20969]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I can confirm that no national arrangements exist for the public registration of an individual's will prior to death. However, my hon. Friend may be interested to know that The Council of Europe Convention on the Establishment of a Scheme of Registration of Wills was signed by the United Kingdom on 16 May 1972. Each contracting state was required to set up a scheme whereby a limited category of wills must be registered in that state, and may be registered in any other contracting state. Sections 23-28 of the Administration of Justice Act 1982 were introduced to enable the UK to ratify the Convention. However, the relevant sections of the Act have not been brought into force.
<P>

<a name="71222w02.html_para1">Section 4(1) of the Enduring Power of Attorney Act 1985 imposes upon the Attorney a duty to apply to register the Power with the Court of Protection when he or she has reason to believe that the Donor is or is becoming mentally incapable. The Court maintains a register of such cases.
<P>

<a name="71222w02.html_para2">On payment of a fee any person is entitled to request the Court to search the register and say whether an Enduring Power of Attorney has been registered. The Court may supply any person with an office copy of the Power if it is satisfied that he has a good reason for requesting a copy and cannot reasonably obtain one from the Attorney.
<P>

<a name="71222w02.html_para3">While the Donor remains capable there is no obligation for the Attorney to apply for registration. There is no central register held in respect of these Powers.
<P>

<a name="71222w02.html_para4">There is no national arrangement in existence for the public registration of an individual's advance directive. Those making advance directives should let people close to them know of their decisions.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The libel case brought by Jonathan Aitken was heard for 13 days by a High Court Judge. The daily cost of hearing a High Court case is &#163;982.58, which includes the cost of the judge, administrative assistance and courtroom accommodation. The cost of a 13 day trial is therefore &#163;12,773.54. However, Jonathan Aitken paid &#163;150 in court fees and therefore the total cost to public funds of this case is &#163;12,623.54.

 The New Millennium Experience Company's overall cash budget of &#163;758 million, which was approved by the Government during the June review and by the Millennium Commission as the basis for its grant, includes a cost contingency of &#163;88 million. This contingency is managed centrally within the Company to ensure tight control over its allocation and use. Both cost and time issues are the subject of comprehensive and regular review at Executive and Board level. I am satisfied that the NMEC's management and control systems are thorough and comprehensive and enable early identification and correction of potential cost or time overruns. The project is currently to time and to budget.

<a name="71222w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The New Millennium Experience Company is not aware of any requirement to consult the Advisory Committee.

Saatchi and <i>(c)</i> Kock Hightec by the disclosure of commercial in confidence information; and what competitions for similar contracts to those conducted by <i>(a)</i> to <i>(c)</i> are currently being assessed by his Department. [17293]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The nature of the possible damage is covered by Exemptions 7 and 13 of the Code of Practice on Open Government, which exempt the release of information which would harm the proper and efficient conduct of the operations of a public body and would damage the competitive position of a third party. Requiring the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) to release the details of fees agreed with their current contractors might be harmful to the competitive position of these third parties in relation to any deals they may wish to strike with other companies in the future. NMEC would not be able to conduct their business efficiently or secure good value for money on the contracts they negotiate if the NMEC, required to reveal the details of their deals, were in the process making the information available to their contractors' competitors. NMEC are currently progressing a number of works and services contracts. The Department of Culture, Media and Sport, which provides advice to me in my role as shareholder of the NMEC, has an ongoing responsibility for ensuring that the Company complies with the requirement of its financial memorandum, which sets out the rules governing the letting of contracts by NDPBs.

As such they are required to produce audited accounts for the period between February 1997 and March 1998 by September 1998, and these will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament at that time. Expenditure for the period before the Company became an NDPB is accounted for in the Millennium Commission's Annual Report which was placed in the libraries of both Houses in October 1997.
<P>

<P>

<a name="71222w02.html_para8">To require NMEC to produce audited interim accounts would take time and place a more onerous regime on them than on other NDPBs.
<P>

<a name="71222w02.html_para9">The Code of Practice on Access to Government Information only relates to requests to disclose information that currently exists. As the Company does not produce Interim Accounts, the Code of Practice is not relevant in relation to this request.

<a name="71222w03.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="71222w03.html_para0">Like other full-time undergraduate students, medical and dental students will pay &#163;1,000 a year towards tuition fees only if they come from higher-income families. Dependent students from lower-income families will pay no fees at all, while those from middle-income families will contribute less than &#163;1,000 a year.
<P>

<a name="71222w03.html_para1">It would be unfair to exempt all medical and dental students, including those who came from better-off families, from contributing towards their tuition fees during the first four years of their study when other students on four-year first degree courses would be required to contribute. Medical and dental students will, however, have fees for their fifth and subsequent years of study paid for them in recognition of the State's particular interest in securing a continued supply of qualified health-care professionals.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will make a statement on the Government's policy in respect of the upkeep and maintenance of London's royal parks. [20933]

<P>
<a name="71222w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Tom Clarke: </B> 
 The upkeep and maintenance of the royal parks is the responsibility of the Royal Parks Agency under its Chief Executive, David Welch, which was established as an Executive Agency of my Department on 1 April 1993.
<P>

<a name="71222w04.html_para4">The Agency's main aims are set out in its Framework Document, copies of which have been placed in the Library. They are to manage and police the Royal Parks so that they offer peaceful enjoyment, recreation and entertainment to those who use them; they are enhanced, protected and preserved for the benefit of this and future generations; and they are managed with efficiency and effectiveness and in accordance with the principles of public service as set out in the Citizens Charter.
<P>

<a name="71222w04.html_para5">The objectives of the Agency include sustaining high standards of horticulture and design; attracting an increased range of visitors through publications, publicity, talks and local events; ensuring visitor safety; protecting the parks from every kind of encroachment contrary to their purpose; procuring, organising and monitoring all services in ways which ensure value for money; conserving buildings in the Parks that are of special architectural or historic interest, and meeting financial and other performance targets.

<a name="71222w06.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will make a statement on the charging policy at each of the national museums and galleries. [19516]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 It is for the Trustees of each museum to decide what measures should be adopted to promote access to their museum within available resources. For some that will be free admission; others will choose to promote access in other ways. We wish institutions to do all they can to balance the books while maximising access.
<P>

<a name="71222w06.html_para0">A review of access to the national museums and galleries began in May. This has examined the effect of charges and identified other barriers to access. Our policy was outlined in an interim statement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 8 December. A consultation paper was also published inviting views on a code of good practice on access.
<P>

<a name="71222w06.html_para1">Further consideration will be given to all aspects of access policy for museums and galleries in the context of the Departmental Spending Review. The review is taking a fundamental look at spending priorities across the whole range of the Department's responsibilities and will be completed next summer.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w06.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what methods are used to calculate visitor numbers at free admission museums; and if his Department requires these figures to be independently audited before awarding grant-in-aid. [19510]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 Methods of counting visitors vary from institution to institution. Manual counting by security staff or warders at the entrance is used by the British Museum, the National Portrait Gallery, the Tate Gallery, the National Gallery, the Wallace Collection and the Geffrye Museum. At Sir John Soane's Museum all visitors must sign the visitors book before admission. Electronic methods of counting are being trialled at some free museums.
<P>

<a name="71222w06.html_para2">The manual counting methods in use are prone to error and are likely to over-estimate the true number of visitors.
<P>

<a name="71222w06.html_para3">It is not a requirement of grant-in-aid that the counts should be independently audited.

To ask the Secretary of State for culture, Media and Sport (1) what was the average time taken by the Broadcasting Standards Commission to investigate and respond to complaints over the first six months of <i>(a)</i> 1996 and <i>(b)</i> 1997; [20825]

<P>
(4) if he will list all the programmes about which two or more complaints have been made to the Broadcasting Standards Commission in the first six months of 1997. [20824]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Fisher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 December 1997]:</i> The Broadcasting Standards Commission became operational on 1 April, 1997 following a merger, provided for under the Broadcasting Act 1996, of the Broadcasting Complaints Commission and Broadcasting Standards Council. Prior to 1 April 1997 the Broadcasting Complaints Commission had responsibility for complaints about unfair representation and breach of privacy from those portrayed in broadcasts (which usually require a formal hearing attended by Commissioners, complainant and broadcaster), whilst the Broadcasting Standards Council had responsibility for complaints from viewers and listeners about the "taste and decency" standards of programme content. The new commission has responsibility for both these categories of complaints.
<P>

<a name="71222w06.html_para4">Between 1 January and 30 June 1996, 53 fairness complaints and 1,702 standards complaints were investigated, and between 1 January and 30 June 1997, 81 fairness complaints and 1,533 standards complaints were investigated. The average time taken to consider fairness complaints was 259 days in the first six months of 1996 and 184 days in the first six months of 1997. The average 



<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 415</I><P>
time taken to consider standards complaints was 74 working days in the first six months of 1996 and 68 working days in the first six months of 1997. I have today placed this information in the Libraries of the House together with the lists requested by the hon. Member of programmes against which multiple complaints were made and programmes against which complaints were upheld.

<a name="71222w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 In considering the allocation of resources between the portfolios for which my Department is responsible we have regard to a range of factors. In respect of the arts we are assisted by advice from the Arts Council, whose responsibility it is, with the ten Regional Arts Boards, to take detailed decisions on the allocation of grant-in-aid between artforms, and to arts organisations and activities. A range of arrangements cover the Department's monitoring of spending by the Arts Council; the Financial Memorandum, the annual Funding Agreement, the corporate and business plans. The council reports each year on spending in its annual report.

 Many community programmes have an impact on tourism, or tourism has a role to play in them even though it is not their primary purpose. No figures are therefore available which show the total spending which might have relevance to tourism. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport submitted an Explanatory Memorandum to Parliament on 31 July on European Community Document (COM(97)) 332 Final (also numbered 9712/97): Community Measures Affecting Tourism in 1995-96. The Document highlights some of the main areas of Community activity from which tourism benefits.

<P>

<P>
<a name="71222w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 The national lottery was established to help support five good causes: sports, arts, heritage, charities and to celebrate the millennium. So far &#163;4.6 billion has been awarded to over 38,000 projects nationwide. While no national lottery funding has therefore been specifically allocated to tourism, many of the funded projects attract tourists to their areas.

 I am delighted to announce that today in Bonn, along with my Germany, Italian and Spanish opposite numbers, I signed the Memoranda of Understanding enabling us to proceed to the production and in-service support phases of the Eurofighter programme.
<P>

<a name="71222w07.html_para0">The Government have remained resolutely committed to the Eurofighter programme and today's development represents a significant step forward. We need Eurofighter to replace our Tornado F3 and Jaguar. The first aircraft is scheduled to be delivered to the RAF in June 2002. Eurofighter is an aircraft for the future and will provide the key component of the RAF's fighting capability.
<P>

<a name="71222w07.html_para1">This development will be enthusiastically greeted by industry. Tens of thousands of highly skilled jobs will be sustained in the UK and in Germany, Italy and Spain during the production phase. The four nations have declared a requirement for a total of 620 aircraft, 232 of which will be for the RAF. Eurofighter is the largest defence collaborative equipment programme in Europe and is an important contribution to European defence co-operation.

<P>

<a name="71222w07.html_para2">For all new MOD equipment procurement contracts, all suppliers are contractually bound to ensure that their goods are millennium-compliant.

<a name="71222w07.html_para3">MOD has in excess of 10,000 individual suppliers covering a wide range of goods and services, some operationally critical, some not. Whether to not the MOD continues to deal with organisations and suppliers will depend on the nature of the requirement and the supplier's ability to continue to meet agreed delivery dates. When assessing a tender which requires the supply of goods and services through and beyond the end of the century, MOD takes full account of the risks involved and will place contracts with only those suppliers who can provide the necessary assurances that the commitment can be met.

 Total defence expenditure cannot be broken down by region. However, "Defence Statistics 1997", a copy of which is in the Library, contains information on the deployment of service personnel and Ministry of Defence civilian staff in the regions. It also provides a breakdown of equipment expenditure by region and estimates of employment dependent on such expenditure. In 1995-96, per capita spending on defence by the United Kingdom was estimated at &#163;367.

 I agreed on 3 June 1997 that consultation with the Trades Unions and briefing of interested firms should take place on two PFI pilot schemes in Northern Ireland. Prior to this date the Head of the MOD Private Finance Unit had authorised the placing of a contract with Coopers and Lybrand to advise on PFI in Northern Ireland. I am withholding details of individual contract values under exemption 7 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. In addition the General Officer Commanding Northern Ireland authorised the setting up of the nucleus of a PFI team within his Headquarters to undertake the necessary preparatory work. Expenditure of approximately &#163;20,700 on salaries and related costs and approximately &#163;1,350 on travel and subsistence costs was incurred prior to 3 June 1997 by members of the team. Other individuals within Headquarters Northern Ireland and the Private Finance Unit were involved in work on PFI in Northern Ireland as part of their normal responsibilities. Their costs cannot be separately identified.

<P>
<a name="71222w08.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The scope of the first Northern Ireland PFI pilot scheme covers first, construction and facilities management services for 370 new families quarters within the towns of Lisburn, Antrim and Ballymena and the facilities management services for an existing 21 families' quarters in Ballymena; and, secondly, provision of facilities management services for 566 families' quarters in Lisburn. This may involve transfer of the families' 



<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 422</I><P>
quarters to the service provider on a permanent or semi-permanent basis. In all cases the service period would be for approximately 25 years. The scope of the second pilot scheme is still being refined but is likely to cover a full range of services for Thiepval Barracks for a period of approximately 25 years. The general requirement, in addition to capital works, is expected to include estate management, serviced accommodation, stores management, motor transport support and maintenance, energy management, office support services, community and support services and leisure facilities management.

<P>
<P>
<P>

 There have been no specific studies recently on this topic in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<a name="71222w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 We are aware that diluted DDT was sprayed from the air by British forces on Christmas Island, though the records are very limited. The only recorded quantities are for January, February and April 1959 when nearly 209,000 gallons of diluted spray were used. Typical dilutions were one part DDT per 1,000 parts water.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Christmas Island provides a rich environment for a variety of insects. In the late 1950s and early 1960s when British troops were stationed there, DDT spraying was used for insect control, as was common practice elsewhere in the world at the time. So far as can be established from available records, my Department has made no particular assessments concerning the use of DDT on Christmas Island. Independent studies covering British Nuclear Test Veterans including Service Personnel who served on Christmas Island by the National Radiological Protection Board have shown, however, that
"participation in the test programme has not had a detectable effect on participants' expectation of life nor on their risk of developing cancer".
We are maintaining a database on the incidence of cancer and cause of death in the test veteran group.

<a name="71222w09.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The policy of successive Governments in setting night restrictions has been to strike a balance between the interests of local people and those of the aviation industry, users and the wider economy. When the current regime of night flying restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted was introduced it was envisaged that it would run until October 1998. The Department has received representations from both sides of the debate in recent months. I intend to publish a consultation paper on the subject early in the New Year.

 Within the area covered by Craven District Council, 330 householders have applied to have a measurement under the Government's radon measurement programme and of those 29 have been found to be above the recommended "Action Level".

<a name="71222w09.html_para3">There is no obligation on householders to inform the Government when they have carried out radon remedial works. My Department does not, therefore, hold statistics concerning the number of owners of existing dwellings who have taken radon remedial action in any given area. However, research indicates that between 11 and 18 per cent. of householders in England as a whole, who have homes above the radon Action Level have so far taken some remedial action.

<a name="71222w09.html_para4">Building Regulations are used to address potential radon problems in new dwellings. New guidance has been drafted to take into account areas newly identified in May 1996 as being affected by elevated radon levels. The draft guidance sets out both the areas where protective measures to prevent radon entering should apply and what those measures should be. It was subject to a public consultation, which ended in May 1997. The guidance will be issued shortly. Although there are currently no formal requirements to apply radon protective measures to new dwellings Craven, we are aware that they are being adopted on a voluntary basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to amend planning guidance to encourage a higher proportion of higher density new housing. [21820] 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Current guidance on housing densities is contained in Planning Policy Guidance Notes 3 and 13. Copies of these documents are held in the House of Commons Library. The Government are currently considering all the responses to the last Administration's Green Paper "Household Growth: Where Shall We Live?", some of which raised issues of density, in helping us to decide on the way forward on household growth generally.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w10.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Tom King: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures he proposes to encourage people to <i>(a)</i> restore, <i>(b)</i> enlarge and <i>(c)</i> sub-divide existing homes; and what representations he has received on this issue. [21775]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 We will continue to encourage local authorities to act as strategic enablers in ensuring better use of existing homes in all sectors, tackling under-occupation and bringing empty properties back into use.
<P>

<a name="71222w10.html_para1">Public funding is provided to local authorities and Registered Social Landlords for rehabilitation and conversion of properties. We have taken early action to increase investment in housing through our Capital Receipts Initiative. Nearly &#163;800 million is available to local authorities in England in 1997-98 and 1998-99 under the Initiative, and we expect much of this additional money to be directed towards renovation and improvement of the existing stock.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what increase is forecast in the number of formerly married men and women living alone as owner occupiers in the period 1991 to 2011; and what assumptions are made about their housing requirements and changes in their housing arrangements for the purposes of regional planning guidance for new housing. [21770]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The 1992-based household projections show that the total number of formerly married men and women living alone is projected to rise by 1.3 million in the period 1991 to 2011. Of these men and women, 1 million are estimated to be divorced or separated, and 0.3 million widowed. The household projections did not distinguish household tenure.




<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 429</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71222w10.html_para2">The household projections, which include estimates for a range of different household types, are just one of the factors that must be taken into account by the regional conferences of local authorities in their preparation of Regional Planning Guidance on housing requirements for the Secretary of State. Local planning authorities are required to ensure a reasonable mix and balance of house types and sizes to cater for a range of housing needs.

<a name="71222w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reasons his Department's control total for housing for 1997-98 has fallen. [21899]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Spending plans for housing and construction for 1996-97 and 1997-98 are net of receipts of &#163;500 million and &#163;652 million respectively from the sale of the Housing Corporation's loans portfolio. Within the Department's overall spending ceiling, however, no significant adjustments have been made to planned spending on housing and construction in 1997-98.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w10.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the effect the fall in his Department's control total for housing will have on public housing expenditure in 1997-98. [21898]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The underlying pattern of spending on housing and construction is slightly distorted because the figures for 1996-97 and 1997-98 are net of receipts from the sale of the Housing Corporation's loans portfolio (&#163;500 million in 1996-97 and a further &#163;652 million in 1997-98). However, it was the recognition of pressing housing need and the impact of sustained cuts in housing resources that prompted this Government's Capital Receipts Initiative. This initiative, the resources for which lie outside the Department's control total, will release an additional &#163;800 million in England in 1997-98 and 1998-99 to support capital spending on housing and housing associated regeneration.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the representativeness of councils chosen to pilot best value. [21641]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Over 150 bids to pilot best value were assessed by an Evaluation Panel comprising representatives of local and central government, the Government Offices of the Regions, Trade Unions, the private sector, and the Audit Commission, supported by a research team from the Warwick Business School. The aim of that assessment was to ensure that the pilot programme tested the provisional Best Value framework under a wide variety of different circumstances.

<a name="71222w10.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B>

Dissemination will include a series of good practice papers on different aspects of the process, as well as a self diagnosis framework and a web site. A series of regular events will also be arranged to bring together the pilots and other authorities so as to enable them to share experience.

 Valuations for council tax purposes are currently based on their open market value on 1 April 1991. As part of the review of the local government finance system announced on 25 July 1997, we are considering how we might improve the fairness of the distribution of the council tax burden. This includes the question of whether properties should be revalued and whether any changes should be made to the current structure of the valuation bands. I expect a consultation document to be issued in the New Year before a White Paper is published early next summer.

 Under the Railways Act 1993 the regulation of fares is a matter for the Franchising Director. Under the present franchise agreements, there is at least one regulated fare between any two points, which must be offered. For medium to long distance journeys this is the Saver ticket, which is regulated by the Franchising Director and must continue to be offered for sale at a price that does not increase above the rate of inflation. From 1999 the cap on these fares will be RPI-minus 1 per cent. However, it is in the operators' commercial interests to offer other discounted tickets to attract additional business when they have capacity available and to make use of that capacity. We are currently conducting a review of the railway industry, which includes the regulation of fares.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has for the regulation of contaminated land, pursuant to the recommendations made by the Environment Committee in its Second Report of Session 1996-97 (HC22) on contaminated land and the responses received by his Department to consultation on draft statutory guidance and regulations to be issued under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.

 We have now reviewed the primary legislation in Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (inserted by section 57 of the Environment Act 1995), and the package of draft statutory guidance and regulations published for consultation in September and November 1996. This review has been greatly assisted by the detailed recommendations of the Environment Committee in their Second Report, Session 1996-97, as well as by the more than 400 responses received to the consultation exercises.
<P>

<a name="71222w13.html_para0">We have concluded that this package of primary legislation and guidance sets out, in principle, broadly the right framework for the protection of human health and the environment, without imposing unnecessary burdens on homeowners, landowners, developers or industry. However, it is clear that implementation of the legislation would create significant financial burdens for local authorities and for the Environment Agency. These potential burdens are being considered as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review process, and the decision on when to bring the regime into force will not be made until that process has been completed. In the meantime other relevant legislation, in particular that dealing with statutory nuisances in Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and works to deal with water pollution in Part VII of the Water Resources Act 1991, will remain in force.

<a name="71222w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 The Government have today published the fundamental review of the functions of the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work (CCETSW). I and my hon. Friends will be considering in detail the conclusions and recommendations in the report. The report paves the way for the creation of regulatory machinery which would combine regulation of the workforce with the regulation of social work education and training. I have thought carefully about whether it would be appropriate for this machinery to have a UK-wide remit or whether it should be separate and specific to Scotland. I have concluded that, in view of the differences in legislation, the scope of social work services which includes criminal justice social work, existing devolved structures for higher education and vocational training and the considerable support expressed by Scottish respondents to the CCETSW review for separate arrangements, the weight of the argument points towards a separate Scottish body. However, it will be essential, and in the pubic interest, that the regulatory arrangements should be aligned across the UK. I would not want to create a situation where there are significant disparities in standards or practice in relation to registration. Officials across UK departments will work together to ensure harmonious regulatory arrangements across the UK.
<P>

<a name="71222w16.html_para1">This will, of course, require legislation and I intend that legislative proposals should be published in a separate Scottish White Paper in the spring after discussion of the detailed issues within Government and with all the key stakeholders.
<P>

<a name="71222w16.html_para2">I have thought it right to clarify these issues in order to minimise uncertainty and allow sensible planning and preparation for the establishment of a new body. The Scottish Committee of CCETSW and its staff in Scotland will continue to make an important contribution in achieving an appropriately qualified and trained workforce and, alongside other stakeholders, will be able to contribute to discussions leading to the setting up of a new regulatory body. I have asked the Chief Inspector of Social Work Services to commence direct discussions with key stakeholders in the New Year.

<a name="71222w16.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Ernie Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what plans he has to ensure that local authorities have greater involvement in the transfer of Scottish Homes stock. [22472]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 On 16 June, the Government announced new arrangements for Scottish Homes stock transfers to ensure that councils are much more directly involved in the transfer process in future. These included proposals to ensure that landlords intending to acquire Scottish Homes stock must be prepared to accept a local authority nominee on to its management committee if that is what the local authority wishes. This arrangements was brought into immediate effect and has been working well.
<P>

<a name="71222w16.html_para3">At the same time, COSLA and Scottish Homes were asked to get together to work arrangements to strengthen the role of local authorities in the assessment of future stock transfer proposals. These bodies have now produced joint guidance which has been issued today to all local authorities. The guidance sets out in detail how councils can be involved in the appraisal process and, depending on the stage which transfers have reached in the process, involves the council in the development local strategies and the appraisal of transfer proposals. These new arrangements will also give councils the opportunity to make their views known before a final decision on any particular transfer is sought.
<P>

<a name="71222w16.html_para4">I welcome and endorse the joint guidance which will allow for constructive liaison and discussion between Scottish Homes, councils and other parties to achieve proposals which have the backing of all concerned. It will also enable councils to satisfy themselves that transfer proposals are aimed at meeting the needs and aspirations of the tenants involved. Tenants' interests are paramount and I would emphasise that the final decision on any particular transfer will lie with the tenants themselves.

<P>
<a name="71222w16.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Ernie Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what proposals he has for the regulation of contaminated land, pursuant to the recommendations made in the Environment Committee's Second Report of Session 1996-97 on contaminated land (HC 22) and the responses received by his Department to consultation on draft statutory guidance and regulations to be issued under Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.[22475]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 We have now reviewed the primary legislation in Part IIA of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (inserted by section 57 of the Environment Act 1995), and the package of draft statutory guidance and regulations published for consultation in September and November 1996. This review has been greatly assisted by the detailed recommendations of the Environment Committee in their Second Report, Session 1996-97, as well as by the more than 400 responses received to the consultation exercises.
<P>

<a name="71222w16.html_para5">We have concluded that this package of primary legislation and guidance sets out, in principle, broadly the right framework for the protection of human health and the environment, without imposing unnecessary burdens on homeowners, landowners, developers or industry. However, it is clear that implementation of the legislation 



<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 458</I><P>
would create significant financial burdens for local authorities and for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. These potential burdens are being considered as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review process, and the decision on when to bring the regime into force cannot be made until that process has been completed. In the meantime, other relevant legislation, in particular that dealing with statutory nuisances in Part III of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and works to deal with water pollution in Part II of the Control of Pollution Act 1974, will remain in force.
<P>

<a name="71222w16.html_para6">My Department, together with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Welsh Office, will continue to develop the package of draft guidance and regulations, in the light of the Environment Committee's recommendations and the consultation responses. We have identified a number of areas where there would be a need for changes to the detail of the existing drafts, and my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment has today written to the Chairman of the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee explaining the more significant of these, as well as responding more generally to the Committee's report. A list of those individuals and organisations which responded to the consultation exercises last year has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="71222w16.html_para7">As well as taking forward work on the development of the main regime for contaminated land, I will also be publishing shortly a consultation paper setting out proposals for a parallel regime dealing with radioactively- contaminated land.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will make a statement on her proposals to reform disability benefit. [21006]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are committed to modernising the Social Security system so that it helps people to work as far as they are able; provides appropriate support to those who cannot work; and makes the most effective use of the resources available. We want to encourage people who are disabled, or who have long-term health problems, to play a full part in society and to help them to help themselves wherever that is possible. This means being positive about people's abilities and their capacity, rather than negative about their disabilities and incapacity. And it means getting the right mix of cash and services to people who cannot work, but who need to be enabled to live independently and with dignity.
<P>

<a name="71222w16.html_para8">As part of this process up to &#163;195 million has been made available from the Windfall Tax to test a range of options to help people with long-term health problems or disabilities to move into, or remain in, work. In tandem with this developmental work we are reviewing, as part of our Comprehensive Spending Review, benefits paid to sick and disabled people in order to consider whether the current system meets our objectives and, if not, what changes might be made.

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In line with the Government's commitment to modernise service delivery, the Agency has recently conducted a major review of its business to enable it to deliver a service which is more customer focused and more cost effective. Although we are still working on a detailed analysis, it is clear that the size of our field network will significantly reduce over the next three to four years.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The staff who continue to work outside the Agency's Centres will be there to offer a much improved face to face service with our customers where necessary. This will not only support the Agency's business but will allow the Agency to operate improved customer service initiatives within our six Centres. The review has also shown that the Agency needs to improve its interface with and be more accessible to customers.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency is currently reviewing the precise nature of jobs in our field network to ensure that staff who remain there are used in the most cost effective way. This review will also consider the location of field offices. Business Unit Mangers will be consulting and negotiating with staff on an on-going basis to resolve these issues. As yet no decisions have been taken on the future of the three sites mentioned in your question.

<P>
<a name="71222w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The regular payment of child maintenance is a key part of our strategy for helping lone mothers move off income support and into work. However, there will inevitably be some cases where it proves impossible for the Child Support Agency to collect the arrears of maintenance which are due, particularly where the debt arose through the imposition of punitive interim maintenance assessments designed to secure the absent parent's co-operation. However, a decision not to pursue the debt in an individual case will be made only after all reasonable steps to enforce payment have been taken and after full consideration of all the circumstances of the absent parent, the parent with care and the welfare of the children involved.
<P>

<a name="71222w18.html_para3">Where the parent with care is entitled to income support or family credit her benefit will be assessed on the basis of maintenance in payment, not maintenance due to be paid.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 1997]:</i> The estimate of between 300,000 and 500,000 people with PEP and TESSA investments in excess of &#163;50,000 by April 1999 is based on an interpretation of survey data and information supplied by some major PEP providers.

<a name="71222w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 Discussions with major mortgage providers suggest that by April 1999 the vast majority of PEPs used for mortgage purposes would be worth less than &#163;20,000. One major provider of PEP mortgages has stated that &#163;50,000 of equity-linked savings within an ISA over a 25 year period should be sufficient to fund a mortgage of some &#163;125,000. Couples will therefore be able to benefit from an ISA each to cover repayment of a mortgage of up to &#163;250,000. Any effect on the housing market is expected to be negligible.

<a name="71222w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 It is hoped that six million people may open new individual savings accounts. This represents the expected number of accounts which could be opened within about three years of their introduction by those who currently do not have a PEP or TESSA. This estimate takes account of an analysis of people with interest from bank and building society accounts which is subject to income tax (i.e. interest on savings held outside of TESSAs) from the Inland Revenue Survey of Personal Incomes.

 This information is not available.

 Marketing by individual savings account (ISA) providers will clearly be important in encouraging take-up of ISAs, as it is at present with PEPs and TESSAs.

 <i>[holding answer 17 December 1997]:</i> Under present proposals gilt-edged securities could qualify for inclusion in an individual savings account (ISA) as part of the investments of a UK authorised unit or investment trust or open ended investment company (OEIC). If direct holdings of gilts were eligible they would fall most naturally into the cash component of the ISA.

However, the Government will develop with the banking sector a "seal of approval" so that firms and individuals can recognise those banks which offer reliable information and which allow customers to bank in euro at low cost.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the loan from the European Investment Bank to Railtrack for infrastructure improvement will count in the investment taken into account when calculating the percentage of gross national product deficits relating to Economic and Monetary Union convergence requirements; on what criteria this decision is based; and what rate of interest the Exchequer requires for comparable public investment.[21686]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 A loan made by the European Investment Bank to Railtrack would not affect General Government Financial Deficit (GGFD), Gross National Product (GNP) or Gross Domestic Product (GDP).
<P>

<a name="71222w21.html_para2">The calculation of GGFD and GDP when providing data for the assessment or progress against the convergence criteria for Economic and Monetary Union is made in accordance with the European System of Accounts.
<P>

<a name="71222w21.html_para3">For comparable public investment, a return on assets of 8 per cent. in real terms is normally expected on commercial activities by public sector trading bodies.

<a name="71222w22.html_spnew1"><B>  Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 December 1997]:</i> The financial crisis in East Asia to date is not expected to have a major impact on the growth of the UK economy. However, the situation is still evolving, and the risk of further deterioration and significant global effects mean that developments need to be kept under close review.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what effect the Government's commitment to provide up to 1.25 billion dollars in financial support to Korea will have on the previously published figures for the public spending reserve for other contingencies which might arise in 1997-98 and 1998-99; and if he will make a statement on the adequacy of the provision he has made for the reserve. [21707]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Darling </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 December 1997]:</i> The UK, together with a number of other countries, has agreed to consider providing further financial support to Korea, of up to $1.25 billion. As the Chancellor announced on 3 December this will be made available only if unanticipated circumstances create the need to supplement resources provided by the International Financial Institutions, while Korea remains in compliance with IMF arrangements. This does not affect the previously published figures for the public spending reserves. Public spending would only be involved if the loan was drawn down by Korea and the Treasury guarantee given to the Bank of England was called in the event of Korean default on repayments.

 The advice which SEAC gave me was based on experimental findings of infectivity in the dorsal root ganglion, the spinal cord, the brain, the trigeminal ganglion, the distal ileum and the bone marrow of animals at various stages in the development of BSE after experimental infection. In these experiments infectivity has not so far been detected in a wide range of other tissues including the stellate ganglion, nodose ganglion, sciatic nerve, facial nerve and the phrenic nerve. Other nervous tissues have not been tested in this experiment. The experiment is, however, continuing and SEAC will review the evidence and its guidance in the light of any new results.

<a name="71222w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (the IWC's parent convention) a contracting party may issue special permits allowing its nationals to kill whales for purposes of scientific research. The IWC has no power to regulate the issue of special permits. However, in a resolution adopted in 1995, the IWC recommended that scientific research involving the killing of cetaceans should be permitted only in exceptional circumstances where the questions address critically important issues which cannot be answered by the analysis of existing data and/or use of non-lethal research techniques. At its meeting in Monaco in October this year, the IWC adopted a further resolution affirming that in its view current Japanese special permit whaling does not address critically important research needs. This criticism was supported by the UK.

 Only Japan currently issues special permits for scientific whaling. In 1997 the Japanese Government authorised the killing for research purposes of 440 minke whales in the Southern Ocean and 100 in the North Pacific; it reported to the IWC that 440 were actually killed in the Southern Ocean and 77 in the North Pacific.

 The Department has a number of mechanisms for reviewing policy in this area. We seek a wide range of views through informal meetings with consumer, environmental and industry groups, well-publicised public consultations and discussions and workshops attended by invited scientific experts. We also obtain expert advice from our own independent scientific

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what was the outcome of the Fisheries Council held in Brussels on 18 and 19 December; and if he will make a statement. [22179]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at the meeting of the Fisheries Council in Brussels on 18-19 December, together with my noble Friend the Under-Secretary of State for Scotland.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para0">The Council agreed by qualified majority, with Ireland voting against, the total allowable catches and quotas to apply in 1998 in Community waters.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para1">Throughout the negotiations, I stressed the need to be guided by the advice of the scientists and to be cautious in our management of fish stocks while at the same time taking account of the practical realities and economic needs of fishermen. I believe that the final package struck that balance.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para2">In order to conserve stocks, TACs were reduced where necessary. In other cases, where the state of stocks justified it, TACs were increased. At the end of the negotiations, the total UK quotas agreed for the stocks of most importance to our fishermen were some 26,000 tonnes higher in cod equivalent terms than the quotas being discussed at the start of the negotiations. This increase is worth approximately &#163;11 million to the industry and means our total quotas in cod equivalent terms for these stocks are five per cent. above the 1997 level. Higher quotas for some stocks combined with the fleet reductions which have been taking place should increase the profitability of our fishermen.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para3">I invoked the Hague Preference on all stocks where it was necessary to do so.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para4">I am very pleased to say that the agreement included a new TAC for sandeels and new allocations for five other North Sea stocks. These new controls will limit uptake in some sensitive fisheries and their establishment represents a significant advance in conservation. Moreover, I secured changes which greatly improved the UK's share of the TACs for North Sea sprat and herring by-catches.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para5">As well as for the first time introducing a catch limit on sandeels in the North Sea, the Council agreed further restrictions on industrial fisheries by reducing the TAC set for herring by-catches in industrial fisheries.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para6">The Council did not agree the new North Sea TACs proposed for anglerfish, megrim, turbot, mixed flatfish, and skates and rays. It did, however, make a commitment to 



<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 494</I><P>
reach agreement on these TACs by 30 March 1998 and, in order to avoid irresponsible fishing, the Council and Commission agreed our suggestion that no fish caught after 1 January 1998 will count towards track records under the new TACs.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para7">Within the package, there was agreement to the allocation of the Western waters horse mackerel TAC in which I secured an increase in the UK's share from 8.28 per cent. to 9.81 per cent.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para8">I also succeeded in securing an increase to 22.9 per cent. as the United Kingdom's share of the TAC for Atlanto-Scandian herring. This will replace the 19.85 per cent. share imposed on the UK at the April Fisheries Council.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para9">The Council agreed unanimously to access and quota arrangements for 1998 with neighbouring non-Member States. Declines in the stocks managed by Norway mean that Community and UK fishing opportunities have been reduced at North Norway. We have, however, retained our quotas in Faroese, Greenland and Iceland waters at the same levels as in 1997.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para10">The Council also agreed unanimously to the allocation of the Community's 1998 quotas in the waters covered by the North-West Atlantic Fisheries Organisation, together with technical conservation and control measures applicable to those waters, and to the allocation of the Community's redfish quota in the waters covered by the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission, together with management measures for those waters.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para11">In order to implement commitments made in the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas, the Council agreed unanimously to the introduction of TACs for bluefin tuna and swordfish.
<P>

<a name="71222w26.html_para12">The Commission presented a paper reviewing the marketing of fisheries products which will be discussed during the UK Presidency next year.

 Since the announcement by the then Secretary of State for Health and the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in this House on 20 March 1996, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 375-96 of the probable link with a new variant of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, there have been many calls for a public inquiry into Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy. These calls come from consumer opinion and from the scientifc community, as well as from the families of nvCJD patients, for whom the Government have the deepest sympathy. Comparisons have been drawn with the full investigations which follow transport accidents and major commercial failures affecting the public, whose human and economic implications are often much less.
<P>

<P>

<a name="71222w27.html_para1">In carrying out the inquiry, Lord Justice Phillips will be supported by a scientific assessor and by an assessor experienced in public administration.
<P>

<a name="71222w27.html_para2">This will be a non-statutory inquiry, whose main purpose is to establish facts and the respective roles of a range of commercial players and public authorities, not to lay blame at the feet of individuals. The Government urge all concerned to co-operate fully with the inquiry; and will of course expect serving and retired public officials to do so.
<P>

<a name="71222w27.html_para3">The inquiry will begin its work early in January. Parties wishing to make representations to the inquiry can write to them at 3 Whitehall Place, London, SW1A 2HH.

<a name="71222w27.html_para5">A history of seasonal work does not, of itself, indicate a need for intensive help such as training. The Government's Welfare to Work programmes, on the other hand, are particularly intended to help those who face most disadvantage in returning to work.
<P>

<a name="71222w27.html_para6">There are, however, many other sources of help on which seasonally unemployed people, who do not qualify for Welfare to Work programmes can draw. All unemployed people have access to the help and advice of the Employment Service from day one of unemployment, including the job broking service and advice on seeking employment. After three months, unemployed people are given help to broaden their job search through, for example, interviews with employment advisers and job search plus courses. Help with travelling to interviews can also be given at this stage.
<P>

<a name="71222w27.html_para7">In addition, many flexible learning opportunities exist for people who are subject to seasonal or irregular employment, for example through part-time opportunities in further education colleges.

 Access Courses are courses of further education which prepare students for entry to higher education.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what progress has been made on the plans to merge Magnox Electric with British Nuclear Fuels; and if she will make a statement. [22363]

<P>
<a name="71222w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I am pleased to report that, subject to Parliamentary clearance of certain proposed financial arrangements, we expect to effect the first stage of the merger--namely the transfer of the Government's shareholding in Magnox Electric to BNFL--early in the New Year. Full integration of the combined businesses of the two companies is expected to be completed about 



<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 514</I><P>
12 months after the share transfer, subject to the companies meeting the requirements of the relevant regulators.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para1">Safety will continue to be the companies' overriding concern. The merger will not change that.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para2">Before full integration can take place, BNFL will need to have obtained new nuclear site licences, new radioactive discharge authorisations and a revised electricity generation licence to replace those currently held by Magnox Electric. The independent nuclear safety, environmental and electricity regulating authorities have been consulted about the proposed integration arrangements and have indicated that they are prepared to consider applications on the basis of those arrangements.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para3">The merger will create an enlarged, integrated and strong BNFL able, for the first time, to manage all aspects of the magnox business as a whole.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para4">Under existing arrangements, a substantial part of Magnox Electric's costs relate to fuel, reprocessing and waste management services provided by BNFL. A principal aim of the merger is to bring together the financial and management responsibilities for these processes to create better incentives for securing cost reductions.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para5">Bringing together magnox generation and the supporting fuel cycle services under one management will also mean the business can be managed as a whole and with greater efficiency. The merger should therefore accelerate the cost reduction and business improvement programmes which each of the companies has been separately pursuing. It will remove the barriers which exist between Magnox as customer and BNFL as supplier bringing greater transparency to the underlying economics of the business and providing opportunities to combine the technical and commercial skills which currently exist within the two companies.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para6">I have taken steps, and know that many people are concerned, to ensure that the full costs of the companies' nuclear liabilities will be met. I am pleased to announce that the combined group will establish an internal dedicated Liabilities Fund consisting of cash and realisable assets which will ensure that the full costs of all future liabilities of Magnox and BNFL can be met as they fall due. I am sure that this development coupled with the greater transparency that this will entail will be widely welcomed.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para7">In examining how to effect the merger, a great deal of attention was paid to the financial arrangements. When the nuclear generating industry was re-organised at the end of March 1996, Magnox Electric received an undertaking in exchange for, and equivalent in value to, the net book value of assets transferred out of the company and the liabilities it took on from Scottish Nuclear. The undertaking provides for the Government to make payments to enable Magnox to meet its future financial obligations. The principal value of that undertaking at March 1996 was &#163;3.7 billion. That value is increased annually by 4.5 per cent in real terms and is projected to have a value of &#163;4.3 billion in March 1998. We have carried out with Magnox Electric and BNFL a thorough review of the arrangements to apply to the combined organisation. In particular, we needed to get an up to date assessment of the forecast cost of discharging 



<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 515</I><P>
liabilities and then determine what level of Government undertaking would be appropriate to the combined organisation. The conclusion is that the principal sum of a new undertaking (to replace the existing undertaking to Magnox Electric) should be set at &#163;3.7 billion as at 31 March 1998, but that it would be appropriate to apply the same escalation terms as in the existing undertaking to Magnox Electric. This represents an immediate reduction of some &#163;600 million in the Government's current liability.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para8">The new arrangements will also bring to an end assurances given by the Government in 1990 and reaffirmed each year since then which give Magnox Electric added comfort that the Government will, if necessary, help them to meet the costs of their long term nuclear liabilities. Magnox Electric has successfully reduced the large deficit for nuclear liabilities in its balance sheet and projects that without the benefits of integration the gap would have reduced to &#163;0.5 billion by the end of the current financial year. Taking into account the benefits which are expected to flow from the merger with BNFL, all three parties have agreed that there is no need for the Government assurances to continue beyond share transfer.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para9">Given the length of time which these arrangements are to cover, there is provision for the value of the proposed new undertaking to be subject to limited review every five years or earlier if Government and BNFL agree.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para10">We expect the combined group to reduce substantially the costs of discharging magnox liabilities through efficiency savings. In recognition of this, a formal mechanism will be put in place under which Government and the combined business will share the benefit of the first &#163;1.6 billion (at 31 March 1998 prices) of reductions in the company's magnox-related nuclear provisions. This will allow the undertaking to be adjusted downwards by up to &#163;0.8 billion (at the same base price). The majority of these benefits are expected to accrue within the first ten years after the merger.
<P>

<a name="71222w30.html_para11">In summary, the merger will result in a robust and viable group, better placed and better incentivised to manage the magnox business as a whole and to secure savings for the taxpayer. At the same time it will bring the establishment of a dedicated, internal fund to meet the companies' nuclear liabilities; there will be an immediate reduction of some &#163;1.1 billion in the Government's current liability, and incentives will be introduced for the combined business to make further substantial savings which the Government will share. The merger has the full support of the Boards of both Magnox and BNFL.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 27 October 1997]:</i> We have assumed that the hon.

FPSOs are large ships which are built for the purpose or are converted from oil tankers. Typically these ships displace over 100,000 tonnes.

Since the publication of that report the UK has built up a strong capability in the building, conversion and equipping of FPSOs. The main centres of activity are Newcastle, Belfast, Glasgow and Inverness.

From these figures one can conclude that old coal fired plant operating at a 90 per cent. load factor would generate electricity at a cost of &#163;15 per megawatt hour while new peak lopping Open Cycle Gas Fired Plant operating at a 10 per cent. load factor would generate electricity at a cost of &#163;69 per megawatt hour.

[22275]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The cost of providing concessionary fuel and cash in lieu of fuel to all ex-employees of British Coal and their dependants, for which liability transferred to the Secretary of State on March 1995, was &#163;85 million in 1995-96, and &#163;87 million in 1996-97. The projected cost in 1997-98 is &#163;85 million. These figures are affected by 



<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 522</I><P>
variations in the applicable rate of VAT, differential rates in the switching from fuel to cash in lieu from year to year, and the severity of the winters which affected the uptake of fuel. The cost in 1998-99 is expected to be in the range &#163;73-77 million depending on the extent of further switching away from fuel to cash in lieu, and allowing for the lower rate of VAT on fuel. The saving in public funds from the new arrangements derives from the competitive prices secured on a range of smokeless fuel.
<P>

<a name="71222w32.html_para2">Beneficiaries who receive coal are unaffected by the new arrangements. Any adjustments in respect of anthracite are likely to be marginal. The entitlements of certain manufactured smokeless fuels will be reduced as a result of re-balancing but other entitlements will increase, and in virtually all cases where entitlements are reduced beneficiaries will have the option of switching to an alternative fuel which carries a higher entitlement. Thus, the vast majority of beneficiaries need be no worse off in terms of the quantity of fuel available to them, and many could be better off.

1. Figures are not available before 1982 and for individual health authorities from 1982 to 1986.<P>

2. Figures for 1982 to 1989 are for "primary healthcare" nursing and midwifery staff, including: health visitors, district nurses, school nurses, community midwives and a small number of other "primary healthcare" nursing and midwifery staff. The figures for 1990 to 1994 cover the same staff groups as for 1982 to 1989, but include community psychiatric nurses and community learning difficulties nurses, and exclude community midwives. The figures for 1995 to 1996 are based on new occupation codes and are not, therefore, directly comparable with figures for earlier years although they cover similar groups to those used in 1990 to 1994.<P>

Figures are rounded to the nearest ten.<P>

 From 1 September 1996, the registration period for both adult continuing care and child capitation was harmonised to provide patients with a period of continuing dental care for 15 months following each course of treatment. The most recent estimate is that registration numbers may gradually fall by about 4 million as a result of this change. However, the actual effect on the number of patients registered with a dentist will depend on the response to the incentive for many patients to attend the dentist on a more regular basis.

 Advice on appropriate measures to protect health when travelling aborad, including advice on immunisation and malaria prophylaxis, is available under the National Health Service. Currently some vaccines against infectious disease are provided free for travellers as a matter of public health policy, others are not. Broadly speaking, those vaccines provided free offer protection against diseases which might be spread on return to the United Kingdom. Immunisation in these cases benefits not only the recipient but also the community at large, since each individual immunisation contributes to the general control of disease. We recognise that inconsistencies and ambiguities have arisen over the years in the arrangements for travel vaccines and the way they are interpreted. We are seeking to resolve these anomalies as part of an ongoing internal review.

 It is not possible to say how many people were immunised for the purpose of travel abroad each year. Records are not kept of the number of people immunised and data on prescription items dispensed do not differentiate between primary courses (usually consisting of several doses of vaccine) and booster doses. The number of prescription items dispensed in England and the net ingredient costs for vaccines which may be given for the purposes of travel are given in the table. The data include some of the vaccines which will have been prescribed for reasons other than travel. The costs do not include dispensing costs. It is not possible to separately identify the cost of vaccinating patients in general practice.

<a name="71222w34.html_para1">Data on vacant posts are difficult to interpret and do not necessarily imply a shortage. The census is a snap of 30 September each year. Some vacancies will be wholly or partly filled by locums. For others National Health Service trusts may find alternative ways to provide the service rather than re-advertising. The numbers give no indication of how long the post has been empty; some of these will be in the process of being filled.

<P>
<a name="71222w35.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We are today publishing the report of the review on behalf of the United Kingdom Ministers responsible for sponsoring the Central Council for Education and Training in Social Work (CCETSW). Copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="71222w35.html_para1">I and my hon. Friends will be considering in detail the conclusions and recommendations in the report which is the result of an extensive consultation exercise and we intend to act on the recommendations in the report designed to secure efficiency and good value for money in the way the functions are carried out.
<P>

<a name="71222w35.html_para2">I announced in the House on 3 July 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>231-32</i>, our intention to establish a General Social Services Council. This was one of the matters to which the review of CCETSW was to have regard. I and my hon. Friends will be giving further thought to how best to build effective UK links on the regulation of the workforce consistent with the Government's plans for devolution. The report of the review paves the way for the establishment of a General Social Care Council (GSCC), as we now intend to call it, and makes clear the vital importance of drawing a close relationship between the regulation of training and of the workforce.
<P>

<a name="71222w35.html_para3">The Government have not decided that it is unnecessary to issue a further consultation document on its proposals to establish the GSCC. We intend to publish our legislative proposals in a White Paper in the spring after further discussion of the detailed issues within the Government and will all the key stakeholders. These will include service users, employers in all sectors, staff interests and professional bodies. In preparation, for and to the benefit of, the GSCC we will carry out a formal stage two of the review based on appropriate recommendations in the report to examine issues of effectiveness and value for money.
<P>

<a name="71222w35.html_para4">CCETSW continues to play its vital role in ensuring an appropriately qualified and trained workforce. Achieving that objective remains central to our approach, but we do not see the need for a separate body for the regulation of training in the aftermath of the establishment of the GSCC.

 The Government allocate substantial resources to the National Health Service for the treatment of people with HIV/AIDS. For 1997-98, the budget amounts to &#163;199.3 million and includes an extra &#163;14 million in response to the cost pressures following the introduction of combination antiretroviral drug therapies for people with HIV and AIDS. The budget is broadly allocated in line with where people are treated.
<P>

<a name="71222w35.html_para5">In 1998-99, a further &#163;23 million has been provided in recognition of the continued cost pressures of these new therapies which are proving effective so far in delaying the progression of HIV and AIDS, &#163;20 million of the additional funds have been distributed according to where people with HIV/AIDS live. From 1 April 1998, health authorities will therefore take responsibility for their residents who present for HIV/AIDS treatment for the first time. The remaining &#163;3 million has been allocated to districts with the highest caseload in recognition of the extra pressures they face with regard to combination therapies.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of the current prison population were convicted of a drugs-related offence.[20173]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w36.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Provisional information for 31 October 1997 shows that there were 368 convicted unsentenced and 7,377 sentenced prisoners held in prisons in England and Wales for drug offences. This represents 14.3 per cent. of the convicted prison population.

<P>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the proportion of acquisitive crime which is linked to the use of illegal drugs. [20187]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w36.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We hope to publish early in the new year important research which indicates that there is indeed a very strong relationship between the misuse of drugs and acquisitive crime.

<P>
<a name="71222w36.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Betty Williams: </B>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w36.html_spnew7"><B> Mr George Howarth: </B> 
 A new treatment and testing order, included as one of the measures in the Crime and Disorder Bill, will give courts the power to require drug misusing offenders to undergo treatment. The new order will be rigorously enforced and include the use of drug testing to enable the courts to monitor the progress of offenders at review hearings.
<P>

<a name="71222w36.html_para4">In addition, a Home Office Drugs Prevention Initiative study is testing the impact of drug treatment interventions in the criminal justice system--from arrest through to sentence and beyond--to refer people with drug problems to drug treatment programmes.




<P>

<P>

<a name="71222w36.html_para5">Further measures are likely to be recommended by the new United Kingdom Anti-Drugs Co-ordinator as part of his comprehensive review of Government action against drugs, while the Home Office's research programme will continue to shed light on the nature of the links between drugs and crime and to inform action against both.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the extra work which increased use of community sentencing and electronic tagging will place on the police force. [20177]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w37.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 There has been no specific research to assess the impact of the increased use of community sentences. However, there is likely to be an increase in the number of warrants served by the police on offenders who have failed to comply with the conditions of an order and who have not answered a summons to appear at court in connection with breach proceedings.
<P>

<a name="71222w37.html_para0">Offenders who have breached the terms of their electronic tag are returned to the court by the monitoring contractors. However, if an offender then fails to appear in court, a warrant for arrest is issued. Too few such cases have arisen during the current trials of electronic monitoring to enable a meaningful estimate of police costs to be made.
<P>

<a name="71222w37.html_para1">Under the new Home Detention Curfew, suitable prisoners will be subjected to electronic tagging. Prisoners who breach their curfew can be returned to custody. It is too soon to know what the possible impact on the police of this will be.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w37.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government place high priority on developing and strengthening a partnership between Government and the voluntary sector. The main vehicle for this will be a Compact between government and the voluntary sector on which we are currently collaborating with the sector and which will set out the principles which should govern the relationship.

<P>
28. <a name="71222w37.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Edwards: </B>

<P>
<a name="71222w37.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Since 1 May, when responsibility for the voluntary sector and for volunteering was returned to the Home Office, there have been well over 100 meetings with members of voluntary organisations involving myself or my right hon. Friend. We have also assisted Ministers in other Departments, notably the Department for Education and Employment, with wide ranging consultation on policies which have a direct impact on the work of voluntary organisations.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w37.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government's plans for reducing youth crime are set out in the White Paper "No More Excuses" which was published on 27 November. These include proposals to speed up the youth offender proceedings, replace repeat cautions with a new reprimand and Final Warning scheme, introduce new community based sentences and established a Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, and local Youth Offending Teams. A new statutory aim for the youth justice system will place a clear emphasis on preventing re-offending. These proposals are contained in the Crime and Disorder Bill currently before Parliament.

<P>
23. <a name="71222w37.html_wqn5"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what percentage of the latest annual police budgets in England and Wales is allocated to meeting the cost of pensions; what was the comparable figure five years ago; and what is his estimated figure for five years ahead. [20181]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w37.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 In their returns to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy, police authorities in England and Wales estimated that net policy pension costs will be 11.9 per cent. of total net expenditure in 1997-98. The comparable figure for 1992-93 is 8.2 per cent. There are no estimates for five years ahead.

<P>
32. <a name="71222w37.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to reform the police pension scheme. [20191]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w37.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 An inter-Department review of police pensions has been considering whether new recruits should belong to a reformed police pension scheme and whether changes are necessary to the current medical retirement procedures. We hope to issue a consultation paper in the new year and we will invite all interested parties to contribute to the debate.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w37.html_wqn7"><B> Sir Brian Mawhinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list, by police force, the cost <i>(a)</i> in cash and <i>(b)</i> as a percentage of budget, of pension provision for each of the past five financial years, and in each case the budgets for (i) 1997-98, (ii) 1998-99 and (iii) 1999-2000. [21932]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w37.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The information requested in respect of years 1992-93 to 1997-98 is set out in the table. Police authority budgets are set in the beginning of each year following the revenue settlement announced by the Government. Budget information for 1998-99 and 1999-2000 is therefore not available. The cost of pension provision for 1998-1999 and 1999-2000 is also not available. The costs will in part be influenced by retirements in each preceding year.

<P>

 The Independent Commission on the Voting System will begin its work early in the new year and has been asked to report within 12 months.

<a name="71222w38.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 In total, &#163;9 million will be spent on CCTV in 1998-99 financial year. Plans and priorities for spending thereafter are being examined in the Comprehensive Spending Review of all public expenditure, with a view to ensuring that taxpayers' money is being spent effectively in order to meet the Government's manifesto commitments.

<P>

<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We believe that the simple list system that the European Parliamentary Elections Bill provides for is the most appropriate electoral system for elections to the European Parliament. However, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has said that he is prepared to consider the arguments for introducing a system in which voters can vote either for a party list or for an individual candidate on the list.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Under legislation passed by the previous Government in 1994, it is for the Chief Constable of Surrey to determine the number of police officers in the force on the basis of the resources available to him. Ministers have no direct control over police numbers. I understand there were 1,608 police officers in Surrey at the end of September, 98 fewer than in March 1992.

<a name="71222w38.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government are committed to tackling all forms of corruption, including the bribery of hon. Members. My right hon. Friend expects to make a statement on the reform of the law in this area early next year, taking account of the results of the consultation exercise which he launched in June and of proposals which the Law Commission are preparing and which are awaited. He will also take account of any further recommendations which the Committee on Standards in Public Life might make and of the views of the Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 On 13 June, we announced an urgent, wide ranging review of the way in which vulnerable and intimidated witnesses, including those with communication or learning difficulties, are treated by the criminal justice system, with the aim of assisting them to give their best evidence in court. The Interdepartmental Working Group, which is taking forward the review, will report to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary shortly and its report will be considered by Ministers as soon as possible in the New Year.

33. <a name="71222w38.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Khabra: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to implement the incorporation of the European convention on human rights. [20192]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Human Rights Bill [<i>Lords</i>] is currently being considered in another place. Before it can be implemented (if enacted), we shall need to ensure that courts and tribunals receive adequate training to enable them to deal confidently with Convention points in the cases that come before them.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_wqn7"><B> Sir Brian Mawhinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will indicate which clauses in the Human Rights Bill [<i>Lords</i>] require the court to produce a decision on the morality of the conduct in any case in addition to its compliance with the bare letter of the law. [21926]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Whether morality becomes involved may be a moot point, depending on the definition of morality. It is arguable that morality has a role in non-convention judgments in our courts.
<P>

<a name="71222w38.html_para0">Clause 2 of the Bill requires courts to take Convention jurisprudence into account when determining a question which has arisen in connection with a Convention right. 



<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 547</I><P>
Clause 3 requires legislation to be interpreted as far as possible in a way which is compatible with the Convention rights. Clause 6 makes it unlawful for a court, as a public authority, to act in a way which is incompatible with the Convention rights. Taken together, these provisions will require the courts to consider whether, for example, conduct which interferes with a Convention right is necessary in a democratic society for one of the reasons specified in the relevant Article of the Convention.

<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_wqn8"><B> Sir Brian Mawhinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he plans to issue guidance to assist the courts in reaching judgments on the morality of conduct in any case when interpreting the Human Rights Bill [<i>Lords</i>] should it become law. [21925]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Judicial training in the provisions of the Bill, relating among other things to the interpretation of Convention jurisprudence, is a matter for the Judicial Studies Board.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_wqn9"><B> Sir Brian Mawhinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the bodies which the Government deem to be public authorities in the Human Rights Bill [<i>Lords</i>]. [21927]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Clause 6 of the Human Rights Bill makes it unlawful for a public authority to act in a way which is incompatible with the convention rights. It provides that a public authority includes a court or tribunal, and any person certain of whose functions are functions of a public nature. My right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor explained during Committee stage in another place why we had adopted this approach rather than having a list of public authorities.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_wqn10"><B> Sir Brian Mawhinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on what considerations he bases his policy that the absence of written guarantees of freedom acts as a serious threat to liberty. [21924]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w38.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We believe that the absence of written guarantees of freedom is a more serious threat to liberty than their presence. The freedom of an individual to do anything which is not prohibited by law provides inadequate protection against the misuse of power by the State. It has failed to protect a number of people in cases in which the European Court of Human Rights has found a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights by the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="71222w38.html_para1">Our policy is to make it possible for laws and practices in the United Kingdom to be tested in our own courts for compatibility with the rights and freedoms guaranteed under the European Convention on Human Rights. We have set out the considerations which have led us to this view in the White Paper "Rights Brought Home" (Cm 3782).

Of these, four were murders; three were attempted murders; 161 were attacks involving explosives/arson and 396 were serious assaults. In 1995-96, of the 12,222 racial incidents recorded by the police, 440 were in respect of serious crime.

<P>
<a name="71222w39.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government regard anti-social behaviour and the harassment or intimidation of neighbours as completely unacceptable. The Crime and Disorder Bill contains provisions to enable the police or a local authority to apply for an Anti-Social Behaviour Order prohibiting an individual from behaving in this way. Breach of the order will be a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="71222w39.html_para0">The Bill also contains provisions for police and local authorities together to identify and tackle local problems of crime and disorder.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the operation of section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 in respect of provision for the attendance of witnesses to be dispensed with in certain cases and for evidence to be given by way of a television link; and what plans he has to extend its provisions to cover other classes or proceedings. [21512]

<P>
<a name="71222w39.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 An independent evaluation of the provisions for the use of television links for child witnesses was conducted on behalf of the Home Office in 1991 by Professor Graham Davies and Elizabeth Noon of Leicester University who concluded that the live link had a positive and facilitating effect on the courtroom testimony of children. Section 32 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988, which allowed children under 14 years of age to give evidence by way of live television links, was extended by the Criminal Justice Act 1991 to include children under 17 years of age in cases involving sexual assault. The possible further extension of its use is one of the issues being considered by the inter-departmental working group on vulnerable or intimidated witnesses which was announced by my right hon. Friend on 13 June.

 Decisions about whether to issue body armour, and the selection of body armour, are operational matters for chief officers. The role of the Home Office is to ensure that, in making such decisions, they have before them the best available expert advice, and this is provided by the Home Office's Police Scientific Development Branch which also provides expert advice to the self-defence committee of the Association of Chief Police Officers.
<P>

<a name="71222w39.html_para1">Both my right hon. Friend and I take an interest in such matters when we meet chief constables and other police officers. In particular, the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis has informed my right hon. Friend about the position in the Metropolitan Police during discussions with my right hon. Friend in his capacity as police authority for the Metropolitan Police. The Police Scientific Development Branch has, in collaboration with the Association of Chief Police Officers, issued a manual to all chief police officers containing guidance on how to select body armour, and expert evaluations of a wide range of body armour. The manual is updated to keep abreast of the latest technical developments and to assist individual chief officers in their decision making.

 The Home Office Research and Statistics Directorate is undertaking a study into the processing of rape cases after they have been reported to the police. This study updates a previous Home Office study of rape cases reported to the police in 1985, the results of which were published in 1992. A copy of the interim report on this study has already been placed in the Library and this shows that the withdrawal of the allegation by the victim is one of the significant reasons for rape cases failing to be prosecuted. The final stages of the research will explore the reasons for withdrawal or other failure to proceed with a case.
<P>

<a name="71222w39.html_para3">The Research and Statistics Directorate has also recently conducted a literature review to support the work of the inter-departmental working group which is looking at ways of assisting vulnerable witnesses, including victims of serious sexual offences. This review will be published in 1998 as part of the working group's report.
<P>

<a name="71222w39.html_para4">The British Crime Survey has always included measurement of sexual victimisation among women and whether incidents were reported to the police or not. However, a new self-completion approach was tried in the 1994 sweep, to overcome obvious measurement problems. The findings of this study were published in the international journal "Studies on Crime and Crime Prevention" (Volume 6 No. 2 1997). The sexual victimisation self-completion component will be repeated in the 1998 British Crime Survey. This time, both men and women will be asked about their experiences of sexual crimes.

<a name="71222w39.html_para5">It must be acknowledged that research in this area is difficult to conduct because:

 The information requested is not collected centrally. The Government's manifesto included a commitment to provide greater protection for victims in rape and serious sexual offence trials. On 13 June, my right hon. Friend announced the establishment of an inter-departmental review to improve the way in which such persons are treated within the criminal justice system and this includes the consideration of ways of preventing unrepresented defendants from personally cross-examining the victim.

 The imposition of exclusion orders under the Licensed Premises (Exclusion of Persons) Act 1980 is at the discretion of the courts when an offender is convicted of an offence committed in licensed premises and the court is satisfied that in committing that offence he resorted, or offered or threatened to resort, to violence. The imposition of such an order is not dependent upon an application by another person.

<P>
<a name="71222w40.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 It is not practical for the Home Office to collate recorded crime statistics in this way. The statistics which are collected centrally are supplied by individual police forces for the whole of their own force area. Many forces break down statistics for their own purposes into

<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 555</I><P>
smaller areas such as the division or sub-division, but these do not necessarily equate to parliamentary constituency boundaries. In some cases, it may be possible for such local information to be used as "building blocks" for a constituency profile. Some forces do use geographical software to "map" incidents and offences within their area for a variety of purposes. In the future, such analysis of data will become increasingly important in informing the local crime and disorder audit work of police and local authorities in preparation for their joint responsibilities as proposed in the Crime and Disorder Bill.

 It is not the purpose of the national key objectives for the police to provide a list of all the essential services and tasks of the Police Service and currently I have no plans to make traffic policing the subject of a key objective. When my right hon. Friend wrote to chief constables on 3 November to announce the key objectives for 1998-99, he stressed that traffic policing is a central part of the police's responsibilities and is expected to play a full part in achieving the overall objectives for the police service, particularly in relation to community safety and crime reduction and in achieving a safer environment on the roads.

 There is no general statutory power to disclose personal data. Where the police consider that it is in the interests of the prevention or detection of crime that personal data should be disclosed, they may do so under common law powers. General guidance to the police service on the disclosure of such data is given in the Code of Practice for Data Protection produced by the Association of Chief Police Officers.
<P>

 The Director General of the Security Service is under a statutory duty to ensure that no information is obtained by the Service except so far as necessary for the proper discharge of its functions. The functions of the Service are to protect national security; to safeguard the economic well-being of the United Kingdom against threats posed by the actions or intentions of persons outside the British Islands and to act in support of the activities of police forces and other law enforcement agencies in the prevention and detection of serious crime. It follows that the Service may hold personal data which it has obtained in pursuit of any of these functions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many persons have been <i>(a)</i> killed and <i>(b)</i> injured by (i) legally owned handguns and (ii) handguns illegally owned or used in each police force area in England and Wales in each year since 1992; and for how many deaths and injuries it has not been determined whether the handgun used was legally or illegally held. [21838]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 December 1997]:</i> In the past, information as to whether or not firearms used in offences were held legally has not been collected centrally as a matter of routine in England and Wales. A special exercise was conducted last year to find out whether the guns used in homicide were licensed or not. This covered the years 1992 to 1994, and out of a total of 90 homicides involving the use of a handgun, information was available in 62 cases to show that four were held legally and 58 held illegally by the suspect. The latter figure would, of course, include any handguns used in homicide which had been stolen from a legal owner.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many handguns were illegally taken from <i>(a)</i> firearms dealers, <i>(b)</i> police, <i>(c)</i> the armed forces, <i>(d)</i> members of the public, <i>(e)</i> a common carrier while in transit and <i>(f)</i> firearms clubs, for each year from 1992 to the latest available date and for each police force area; what was the largest number taken at any one time; and what were the descriptions of the firearms taken as recorded by the police. [21839]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 December 1997]:</i> The information requested is not available centrally in the form requested. The information that is collected and published shows the number of notifiable offences of burglary and theft recorded by the police in which firearms were reported to have been stolen by type of principal weapon and location. (This is in table 3.12 of Chapter 3, "Criminal Statistics, England and Wales"--copies of which are in the Library).
<P>

<a name="71222w42.html_para0">From 1996, the basis of the figures was changed to show the number of weapons misappropriated (defined as stolen, obtained by fraud or forgery etc., or handled dishonestly). Such figures by individual police force area could be made available only at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many handguns taken from their legal owners in each year since 1992 in each police force area were subsequently recovered by the police; how many in each such area in each year are known to have been used in the commission of armed crime; and 



<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 562</I><P>
what percentage these figures represent of total thefts of handguns and of total crime in which handguns are known or believed to be used. [21836]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 December 1997]:</i> The information requested is not available centrally. However, research published by the Home Office in 1994, based on investigations into 643 offences in which firearms were misappropriated in 1992, showed that about one in six of those stolen was recovered by the police. The limited evidence provided by this study suggested that 9 per cent. of the recovered firearms were known to have been used in crime (although others may have been). Virtually all the guns were licensed. Details are provided in "The theft of firearms", Home Office Research and Planning Unit Paper No. 84, a copy of which is in the Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Moore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what is the timetable for claims under each of the options under the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 to be <i>(a)</i> approved and <i>(b)</i> paid out; and what consideration will be given to claims submitted late;[22087]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many claims for compensation he received under the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 under claim options A, B and C in the month the legislation took effect and in each subsequent month until the deadline occurred; how many claims in each category were received late; how many claims for compensation under each of the options have been <i>(a)</i> approved and <i>(b)</i> paid out in each of the months since the Act took effect; and for each figure what percentage of the total this represents. [22086]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 It has always been recognised that the pressure of claims received over the short hand-in period was bound to involve time in processing, and claimants were advised that they may have to wait several weeks before receiving any payment.
<P>

<a name="71222w42.html_para1">Most claims under Options A and B will have been dealt with before the end of March; regular payments on Option C claims will have begun by then. Some dealers who have claimed under Option C have already received at least one interim payment. Under the terms of the Scheme the deadline for the surrender of handguns to the appropriate police force was 30 September 1997, although claims continue to be received in the Home Office Firearms Compensation Section in respect of items surrendered by that date. These will be considered in the normal way. No claims can be accepted in respect of items surrendered after 30 September 1997.
<P>

<a name="71222w42.html_para2">As at 12 December 1997, 39,896 claims have been received and 23,183 payments made, as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to establish the whereabouts of asylum seekers in the United Kingdom whose addresses are not known to the authorities. [21844]

 <i>[holding answer 19 December 1997]:</i> The onus is on the individual applicant to maintain proper contact with the Home Office: a failure to do so could result in the application being refused for non-compliance with the procedures. If it appears that an individual is likely to abscond, consideration will be given to the use of detention. Those granted temporary admission to the United Kingdom will usually be subject to restrictions requiring them to reside at a fixed address and to report as necessary to a police station or immigration office. Where individuals do abscond, their details are circulated widely and immigration officers are tasked with tracing them.

<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many racially motivated crimes in the Greater London area have been reported during 1997; and if he will make a statement. [21888]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Racial incidents figures are submitted by each police force to Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary at the end of each financial year. The incidents are recorded under the Association of Chief Police Officers' definition of a racial incident:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"any incident in which it appears to the reporting or investigating officer that the complaint involves an element of racial motivation, or any incident which includes an allegation of racial motivation made by any person".</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="71222w42.html_para3">Precise figures for the Greater London area are not available because that area is not exactly coterminous with police force areas. However, the number of racial incidents recorded by the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police during 1996-97 is 5,631. This is higher than the 1995-96 figure (5,013), which reflects a general increase in the number of racial incidents recorded by the police in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="71222w42.html_para4">It is difficult to be precise about the extent to which rising figures may be partly due to increasing willingness among ethnic minority communities to report these incidents and an increasing confidence that the police service take these matters seriously. Police forces are also taking steps to increase the reporting rate of racial incidents to derive a better picture of the type of incidents taking place, and to discover when and where they are taking place and on whom. Such developments are also likely to be influencing both public confidence and the number of offences reported.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will ensure that persons whose applications for British citizenship are being refused are given the reasons for such decisions. [22439]

<P>
<a name="71222w42.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Yes. This Government believe in greater openness in public administration, as we showed last week when we published the White Paper on the Freedom of Information Bill. This openness is especially necessary where our decisions affect the rights of individuals. I have long been unhappy with the practice not to give reasons when refusing some applications for British citizenship, and relying upon section 44(2) of the British Nationality Act 1981 as the authority for not doing so. Since taking office in May, I have considered this matter in considerable detail. I am required to give reasons in a wide range of immigration cases and I can see no persuasive argument why my decisions involving the refusal of British citizenship should not similarly be open to public scrutiny. I have therefore decided as a matter of principle that henceforth reasons should be given in such cases.
<P>

<a name="71222w42.html_para5">One immediate consequence of this decision concerns the appeal to the House or Lords from the Court of Appeal in the cases of R <i>v</i> Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Mohamed Abdel Moneim Fayed and ex parte Ali Fayed regarding the application of section 44(2). I have today instructed the Treasury Solicitor that these appeals should be withdrawn. The effect of this is that the judgment of the Court of Appeal quashing the decisions made in 1995 to refuse these two applications now stands.
<P>

<a name="71222w42.html_para6">It will now fall to me to decide the applications on Mohamed and Ali Fayed, on their merits, and I cannot comment upon them further at this stage. I should also make clear that, in reaching the decision on principle that reasons should be given in citizenship cases, I have not considered any of the original papers in the Fayeds' application.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council agreed as "A" points, among other things, a resolution on marriages of convenience, the organisation of future work on revising the Brussels and Lugano Conventions on recognition and enforcement of judgments in matrimonial, civil and commercial matters, and a joint action on a mechanism for evaluation of the fight against organised crime. Several regulations relating to Europol were also agreed, dealing with its computer system, its budget for 1998 and its relationship with third countries and international organisations.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The scope of the draft Convention on mutual legal assistance in criminal matters was discussed. This Convention covers the giving and receiving of assistance and evidence during criminal investigations and prosecutions. The Council agreed that the Convention would not contain provisions on cross-border investigation techniques, which could be the subject of a separate Protocol, along with provisions on search and seizure. Initial negotiations on the terms of the Protocol could begin under the United Kingdom Presidency, before the Convention itself was finalised.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Discussion on the draft convention on enforcement of driving disqualifications revealed that a number of member states had unresolved problems which required further work. Progress on the Action Plan on Organised Crime was noted. Two elements in particular were touched on: finalisation of the Naples II Convention on mutual assistance and co-operation between customs administrations, which is due to be signed before the end of the year, and ratification by all member states of the Europol Convention, which is on course for early 1998.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council took stock of the position reached on the draft joint action to establish a European judicial network, which seeks to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of current arrangements for requesting and granting mutual legal assistance through a network of contact points. It was agreed that member states would notify the Council informally of the contact points which they intended to nominate, pending a decision at the next meeting of the Justice and Home Affairs Council in March 1998.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Some progress was made on the draft joint action on making it a criminal offence to participate in a criminal organisation. A number of difficulties still remain, particularly concerning the definition of the conduct to be criminalised. The joint action was remitted to the Committee of Permanent Representatives for further work.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council agreed a draft joint action establishing a funding programme for training, visits and exchanges in the fight against organised crime (the FALCONE programme). The Council also approved a report on organised crime in the European Union in 1996, for submission to the European Council.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council took stock of the position reached on a draft resolution on a strategic action plan for customs co-operation in the Third Pillar. In the absence of agreement on the territorial application of the resolution, the Council instructed the Committee of Permanent Representatives to find a solution.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council approved a report on the internal and external threat from terrorism, for submission to the European Council; took note of a draft report to the European council on drugs; and approved a report for the European Council on implementation of the joint action of December 1996 on approximation of laws and practices to combat drugs.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council agreed in principle to amend the definition in the Europol Convention of "trafficking in human beings" so as to include trafficking in the child pornography. This was necessary to enable the Europol Drugs Unit to collect and analyse data on the subject. At the request of one member state, the K4 Committee was instructed to ensure that Europol's remit was extended to cover terrorism as soon as possible, and at latest within two years of Europol beginning its work.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council agreed that a further action plan should be drawn up making specific proposals for countering a recent increase in illegal immigration from Iraq.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>outstanding questions concerning the storage and erasure of data under the Convention. The working group will now begin drawing up the technical specifications for the system.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council also discussed a draft joint action establishing a programme for training, exchanges and co-operation in the fields of immigration, asylum and the crossing of external frontiers (the Odysseus programme). In the absence of agreement on the provisions concerning crossing of external frontiers, the Council remitted the issue to the Committee of Permanent Representatives for further consideration.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Council held meetings, as part of the Structured Dialogue, with Ministers of the associated Central and Eastern European countries (CEEs) and, separately, with Cyprus. Discussion with the CEEs centred on mutual legal assistance, particularly in the areas of extradition, money laundering and the Lugano Convention on jurisdiction and enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters. The question of illegal immigration from Iraq was also raised, as well as asylum matters. In the meeting with Cyprus, Ministers from Cyprus set out the measures that it had taken to combat money laundering and described the position in Cyprus with regard to illegal immigration and Iraqi refugees.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At the Council, the Luxembourg Presidency hosted an informal joint lunch of Justice and Health Ministers to exchange views on drugs matters. The discussion highlighted the range of measures currently taken within member states to combat drugs abuse and the value to be obtained from the exchange of information and ideas.</FONT></UL>

 Guidelines were issued to local authorities in 1992 on the application of the Children and Young Person (Protection from Tobacco) Act 1991 and we have no plans to change that guidance. It is for the retailer to ensure that the person to whom cigarettes are sold is not under the age of 16, but if they are in any doubt about their responsibilities they can contact their local Trading Standards Officer who has responsibility for enforcing the 1991 Act. The retailer will have a defence to any possible prosecution if he can show that he took all reasonable precautions and exercised all due diligence to avoid committing the offence. The Government are encouraging the use of voluntary "proof of age" cards produced by the Portman Group in respect of licensed premises and would be interested in any comparable proposals by the industry in the context of young people wishing to purchase tobacco.

<P>
<a name="71222w44.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Measures to help protect witnesses who are likely to suffer from intimidation are currently being considered by the inter-departmental review of vulnerable or intimidated witnesses which was announced by my right hon. Friend on 13 June 1997. I understand that the Association of Chief Police Officers is also looking at this issue with a view to developing national guidelines.




<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 568</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71222w44.html_para0">Until now, information on the protection of <i>(a)</i> witnesses to crime and <i>(b)</i> victims of crime has not been collected centrally. The allocation of resources, including the provision of accommodation, is a matter for chief officers of police and local housing authorities. There is no national scheme for the protection of witnesses in this country so whether to offer protection in any particular instance is a decision for the chief officer of the force concerned.
<P>

<a name="71222w44.html_para1">In the 1994 British Crime Survey (BCS), victims and witnesses of crime were asked whether they had suffered any harassment or intimidation as a result, and whether they had reported this to the police. Although we cannot tell how many people were offered assistance or protection as a result, the figures give a maximum estimate for the number of crime incidents in which victims may require protection. The 1994 BCS estimated that a minimum of 6 per cent. of all crime incidents in 1993 led to intimidation of the victim (about one million incidents). The victim reported this intimidation to the police in 23 per cent. of such incidents. Therefore, a rough estimate of the number of such incidents reported to the police in 1993 was 250,000. However, only a small proportion of intimidated witnesses and victims would be suitable and willing for high level protection schemes which are expensive and require major life changes such as moving home and severing connections with the past.
<P>

<a name="71222w44.html_para2">Of respondents to the 1994 BCS, 27 per cent. had witnessed at least one of four crimes (vandalism, burglary, car crime or assault) in the last five years. Intimidation of witnesses was rare. Of those who witnessed any of the four crimes, only 4 per cent. experienced intimidation. Witnesses reported intimidation to the police in 39 per cent. of cases. It is not possible to derive a number of incidents.

<P>
<a name="71222w44.html_wqn2"><B> Sir Brian Mawhinney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he plans to introduce provisions in the Crime and Disorder Bill for financial penalties on statutory agencies for failure to meet time limits in individual cases. [21931]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w44.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 No. However, the courts will be able to enforce statutory time limits by making use of their existing power to impose 'wasted costs orders', which are applicable to both prosecution and defence. The Government's recent consultation paper "Tackling Delays in the Youth Justice System" set out the possible advantages and disadvantages of using financial penalties on statutory agencies to enforce time limits in individual cases and asked for views on this point. Over 85 per cent. 



<P>
<P><I>22 Dec 1997 : Column: 569</I><P>
of those who expressed a view on the merits of such penalties opposed their introduction or expressed significant concerns. Respondents pointed out in particular that contested penalties might lead to further delays and damage the inter-agency co-operation which is critical to tackling delays. In the light of the response to the consultation paper, we have decided not to introduce any provision in the Crime and Disorder Bill for financial penalties on statutory agencies for failure to meet time limits in individual cases.
<P>

<a name="71222w44.html_para3">We are also looking very closely at other means of promoting efficiency within the youth justice system. In particular, as set out in the White Paper "No More Excuses" (Cmnd 3809) we will be introducing performance targets, which will operate in parallel with statutory time limits but will be more exacting. We will judge performance across the youth justice system in relation to these targets. The Youth Justice Board, which is to be established under the Crime and Disorder Bill, will also be able to publish information about performance across the youth justice system, and we believe that this will be an effective means of promoting accountability and give a strong incentive to better performance.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71222w44.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 It is the Government's intention positively to encourage magistrates to question defendants about the reasons for their behaviour as part of our plans to make offenders accountable for their actions and to make them participants rather than passive observers in court proceedings which affect them. The White Paper "No More Excuses: A New Approach to Tackling Youth Crime in England and Wales" (Cmnd 3809) set out the Government's intention to remove any obstacles in the Magistrates' Courts Rules which may prevent or discourage magistrates from questioning defendants in the Youth Court about the reasons for their behaviour, before reaching a final decision on sentencing. Specifically, the Government intend to review the Rules to determine <i>(a)</i> whether there are any such obstacles on the face of the Rules; <i>(b)</i> whether in practice any of the Rules are regarded as inhibiting dialogue with the defendant; and <i>(c)</i> whether the existing Rules should be clarified or extended to encourage magistrates to question defendants about the reasons for their behaviour in order that this can inform decisions about sentencing. Until this review is completed, it is not possible to list the provisions of the Rules which may prevent or discourage magistrates from questioning defendants about the reasons for their behaviour before reaching a final decision on sentencing.
