The scheme has been running for the past five years and offers students from Southwark an opportunity to spend one day per week for one school year in a work area of their choice. The scheme is being further developed so that the students who come to the House&#151;around 10 per year&#151;will spend two years here rather than one and will complete the first level of a modern apprenticeship, commencing in July this year.</p>

<i> [holding answer 30 March 2009]:</i> The Entertainment and Leisure Software Publishers Association (ELSPA) set up a working group to look at industry's codes for advertising in autumn 2008. Following that, a compliance survey carried out by the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) showed that video games advertisements had a 99 per cent. compliance rate with the regulations. The existing guidelines were therefore found to be sufficient.</p>

This proposes a restriction to prevent adverts for age-restricted computer and console games appearing around TV programmes likely to appeal to children. Once this consultation is complete and new codes are in place, ELSPA will reassess industry guidelines to ensure they are still fit for purpose.</p>

 Government does not hold a record of rape crisis centres (members of Rape Crisis England and Wales, or its predecessor bodies) in existence over this period of time.

There are also organisations which use the phrase 'rape crisis' in their organisational name, but which are not members of Rape Crisis England and Wales. This means it is difficult to be exact in identifying rape crisis centres separately from those sexual violence voluntary sector organisations which have received central Government funding.

 Negotiations to agree the final legal text of the EU REACH Regulation (no. 1907/2006) covered a three year period, from October 2003 to December 2006. DEFRA led for the UK during the negotiations, working alongside other Government Departments and taking account of industry and NGO views. The aim throughout was to secure a robust and workable regulation that balanced the interests of industry with a high level of protection for human health and the environment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_576"><a name="90401w0016.htm_para1"><a name="09040180001099">Between July and December 2005 the UK held the presidency of the European Union, and during this time developed the text which secured political agreement as the Council&#146;s Common Position following the first reading in the European Parliament. A significant initiative put forward jointly by the UK, known as &#145;One Substance, One Registration&#146; (OSOR) was incorporated into the Common Position. This was assessed at the time as potentially providing savings in registration costs for UK industry of up to &#8364;128 million over the 10-year registration period, compared with the original Commission estimates.</p>

The Environment Agency has not made any assessment of the vulnerability of specific MOD sites to flooding. However, MOD uses data published by the Environment Agency to assess the general level of flood risk to its sites, but does not collate this centrally. We are augmenting this data by developing the means to assess the significance of impacts that a changing climate or an extreme climate event, including flooding, could have on MOD sites. Results of these assessments will then influence site planning and development, location and design of buildings, and will inform site plans to enable risks to be managed effectively.</p>

 The Government are focused on reducing the amount of food being wasted by producers, retailers and consumers; and by encouraging better management through environmentally friendly treatment of food waste where prevention is not possible, to minimise the amount that reaches landfill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_588"><a name="90401w0016.htm_para13"><a name="09040180001159">The Government are helping reduce the amount of food being wasted through their ongoing work with the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) to cut significantly the amount of food wasted in the supply chain and in the home. This requires a twin-track approach&#151;working closely with retailers and manufacturers, and also directly with households. The two main programmes contributing to this work are the &#145;Courtauld Commitment&#146; and the &#145;Love Food Hate Waste&#146; campaign.</p>

AD offers a considerable climate change benefit through avoided landfill methane emissions, with the energy generated also offsetting fossil fuel power generation, and counting towards our renewable energy targets. There are currently 37 local authorities that have separate food waste collections. These collections are expected to become more widespread in the future.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 March 2009]:</i> There are six categories of British national: British citizens, British overseas territories citizens, British Overseas citizens, British National (Overseas), British subject and British protected person. British citizenship and British overseas territories citizenship derive from a personal or ancestral connection with the United Kingdom or one of the remaining British overseas territories. The other statuses derive, in the main, from similar connections with a former British colony, or a foreign territory which was formerly under British jurisdiction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_606"><a name="90401w0018.htm_para7"><a name="09040180001294">Only British citizens and certain British subjects have the right of abode in the United Kingdom. The others are subject to UK immigration control, although British overseas territories citizens who derive that status from a Gibraltar connection enjoy certain rights of free movement and establishment under the EC Treaty. As regards entry to the United Kingdom, other types of British national are not treated any differently to those of any other nationality when it comes to settlement. They have to qualify under the immigration rules in the same way as any other applicant.</p>

The six key factors used to determine job weight are: knowledge, skills and experience; complexity and mental challenge; judgment and decision-making; use of resources; communications; and working conditions. The results of job evaluation for all other rank trades are applied on a whole trade basis against the evaluation of a range of jobs selected as being representative of the main types of employment carried out across a particular trade, but with each rank being judged on its own merits.</p>

Appropriate medical treatment is provided by the NHS. Financial support is available to eligible Gulf veterans and dependants through MOD war pensions and armed forces occupational pension schemes. The UK has undertaken a substantial amount of research into the possible causes of Gulf veterans&#146; illnesses costing some &#163;9 million from 1997 onwards. The focus of our research effort is now on rehabilitative therapies for those veterans with persistent symptoms as recommended by the Medical Research Council.
