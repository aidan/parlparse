 I am pleased to announce that the Defence Procurement Agency has now signed a contract with Shorts Missile Systems for additional High Velocity Missiles for the Army. The contract is valued at around &#163;200 million and will sustain around 550 jobs at Shorts Missile Systems, with a further 170 jobs also sustained across their sub-contractors in the United Kingdom.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what account he will take of allegations about unfair subsidies to South Korean shipyards using IMF loans when determining the outcome of the MOD competition for roll-on, roll-off ferries; and if he will make a statement. [100573]

<a name="91209w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Bids from four consortia to provide a strategic Sealift service are currently being assessed. The ships will be commercial standard roll-on, roll-off ferries, owned by the service provider. We have specifically asked bidders proposing overseas build to demonstrate that UK build would not be competitive on similar terms. If there is evidence of subsidies, this will be fully taken into account in our evaluation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he has made a re-assessment of the United Kingdom's anti-submarine requirements since the publication of the Strategic Defence Review.  [101669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91209w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The United Kingdom's anti-submarine warfare capabilities are kept under constant review in order to ensure that we maintain appropriate and balanced maritime forces. Since its publication, there has been no reason to revise the conclusion of the Strategic Defence Review, which confirmed a continuing decline in the likelihood of an open-ocean anti-submarine threat on the scale previously envisaged.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what are the conditions under which the United Kingdom stands ready to provide destroyers and frigates for peacekeeping operations, as agreed in the Memorandum of Understanding signed with the United Nations; and if he will make a statement.  [101672]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91209w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The decision to commit any of the forces declared to the UN in the Memorandum of Understanding remains a national one taken on a case-by-case basis. Factors that will be taken into consideration when deciding whether to contribute to a specific UN peacekeeping operation include the aim of the operation, a clear exit strategy, the safety of UK personnel, and the level of other commitments.

<P>
<a name="91209w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Low flying remains an important military tactic. While the circumstances in Kosovo were such that there was no requirement for fast jets to fly at low level, that might not be the case in future operations elsewhere. Regularly carrying out practice sorties within the UK Low Flying System remains the most effective way to ensure aircrew have the high levels of readiness necessary to take part in operations at low level, should the need arise.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what studies he is undertaking of theatre ballistic missile defence against land mobile missiles; and what is his target date for putting a theatre ballistic missile defence system into service.  [102139]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91209w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Strategic Defence Review concluded that the technologies related to ballistic missile defence are changing rapidly and it would be premature to decide on acquiring such a capability. This remains our policy. We continue, however, to monitor developments in the risks posed by ballistic missiles and in the technology to counter them, and we are contributing to NATO preparations for studies into the feasibility of theatre ballistic missile defence. The terms of reference for our national programme of studies were announced by my predecessor, now Lord Robertson, on 27 July 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 203W. These studies include issues concerned with defending against land-based, mobile, theatre ballistic missiles, as will the studies to be undertaken by NATO.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91209w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his oral answer to the hon. Member for Havant (Mr. Willetts) on 29 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 13, by how much below 3.5 million he expects the number of pensioners on means-tested benefits will be reduced by 2050 as a result of the proposals in the Green Paper on the stakeholder pension and the second state pension.  [102064]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91209w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 By 2050, it is estimated that there will be around 15.8 million pensioners. Without a change to current policies it is estimated that approximately one in three pensioner units (which could be either a single person or a couple) would retire onto the means-tested minimum income guarantee. This would include some people who had worked or cared for someone throughout their working life.
<P>

<a name="91209w02.html_para3">The proposals in the Government's Green Paper "Partnership in Pensions" are designed to ensure that someone with a full working life, or years covered by credits, will receive a pension on retirement above the minimum income guarantee.
<P>

<a name="91209w02.html_para4">The impact of the proposals will depend on a variety of factors, including employment records and additional voluntary savings. Our proposals seek to promote behavioural changes through the spread of low cost funded second pensions, improved pensions education, and the greater reward in retirement from helping people under pension age move from benefits to work.
<P>

<a name="91209w02.html_para5">For instance, with additional voluntary savings of 5 per cent., the figure of one in three pensioner units retiring onto the minimum income guarantee would fall to approximately one in five in 2050.

 We are currently reviewing the Commission's recent Communication and related study. We are also working, through the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to examine a range of market based options to limit or reduce emissions from aviation. It would be premature to focus on the effects of specific rates of tax on numbers of passengers at the London airports: no such proposals have been made.

<a name="91209w04.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Fallon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will consult police and local authorities about amending paragraph 10 of the Removal and Disposal of Vehicles Regulations 1986 (SI 1986/183) so as to reduce the period before which notice must be affixed to vehicles about to be removed for destruction from seven to three days.  [101719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91209w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 We have no plans to consult the police or local authorities on changing the period of notice they must give before removing abandoned vehicles. The existing regulations are intended to provide owners with safeguards against a local authority prematurely assuming a vehicle is abandoned and having it towed away for scrap. They also ensure that local authorities do not have to go to the unnecessary expense of removing and storing vehicles that may not, in the event, have been abandoned.
<P>

<a name="91209w04.html_para0">We believe that the current legislation provides a good balance between the powers of the police and local authorities to deal with abandoned vehicles and the rights of vehicle owners.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions in which years between 1979 and 1999 the Government's revenue support grant for Shropshire County Council increased by double the rate of inflation or more.  [102137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91209w04.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Revenue Support Grant (RSG) was introduced in 1990. Between 1990-91 and 1992-93, Shropshire County Council received no RSG directly; the grant was paid into the collection funds operated by billing authorities, and thus supported expenditure by all tiers of authorities.
<P>

<a name="91209w04.html_para1">Only in 1994-95 was the increase in RSG of 11.06 per cent. more than twice the rate of inflation of 1.43 per cent., as measured by the GDP deflator. The increase in 1999-2000 in RSG and the county's share of national non-domestic rates of 6.01 per cent. was also more than twice the rate of inflation of 2.25 per cent. The change in RSG was affected in 1995-96 by the transfer of the RSG for police service to West Mercia Police Authority and in 1998-99 by the creation of Telford and the Wrekin as a separate unitary authority, thus precluding meaningful comparisons for those years.

for powers to improve and extend the Thameslink network. The Secretary of State has received a total of about 1,000 objections to both applications. In view of the range and nature of the objections he has decided that it would be appropriate to hold a public inquiry into this scheme. This will probably start in the spring of 2000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91209w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 My Department has issued foreign airlines with their normal operating permits for providing services to and from the UK. These permits are granted to airlines only if they comply with international safety standards. In view of the Y2K problem, my Department has taken the exceptional step of asking airlines to provide information confirming that flights would be free from any Y2K safety related risk. The airlines have been advised that, in the event of such information not being provided, the Department reserves the right to suspend their permits over the critical period.




<P>

<P>

<a name="91209w04.html_para2">Two airlines have yet to provide confirmation that their flights will be free from any Y2K safety related risk. These are Gulf Air; and Southern Aviation (Zambia). These airlines have therefore been advised that, unless such confirmation is received, their permits to operate to the UK over the Millennium period will be suspended.

 The amount of non-domestic rates in England for 2000-01 to be redistributed to Local Authorities will be &#163;15,400 million, although estimated payments into the pool in 2000-01 will be &#163;14,342 million. The non-domestic rate poundage (multiplier) will be 41.6 pence. The Distributable Amount includes an allowance of &#163;415 million for an Exchequer payment to the non-domestic rates pool, to compensate for the shortfall which would otherwise occur as a result of the regulations under section 58 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and the transitional relief scheme, announced on 25 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 770.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

The amounts shown are those recorded in the post end-year (NNDR3) returns. For 1999-2000 the amounts shown are the estimated outturn for the year based mainly upon authorities' provisional contributions to the non-domestic rating pool.<P>

1. Item 1: The gross calculated rate yield represents the total value of non-domestic hereditaments on local rating lists times the multiplier.<P>

2. Item 1(i)(a): The Transitional decrease adjustment includes the estimated amount of rates that will not be recouped from local list ratepayers under the transitional arrangements made by regulations under section 58 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and the transitional relief scheme, announced by written PQ on 25 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 770W.<P>

3. Item 1(i)(b): The empty property relief adjustments include voids and partially occupied hereditaments. The 2000-01 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rates yield.<P>

4. Item 1(i)(c): Charitable rate relief. The 2000-01 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rates yield.<P>

5. Item 1(i)(d): Rural Shops and Post Office relief. Figures for 1998-99 onwards include mandatory relief for village shops and post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997. The 2000-01 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rates yield.<P>

6. Item 1(i)(e): Discretionary relief granted to charities, non-profit making organisations and for other reasons including, for 1998-99 onwards, discretionary relief for village shops and post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997.

8. Item 1(ii)(c): City Offset--the amount which the City of London will not be required to pay into the non-domestic rating pool. It is the amount which will be retained by the City to meet its own expenditure.<P>

9. Item 1(iii): net adjustment in respect of appeals and other amendments to the rating list affecting liability for previous years rates settled in that year.<P>

10. Item 2: the rateable value of non-domestic hereditaments on the central rating list times the multiplier, less the net effect of transitional arrangements, and adjusted for appeals and other changes in respect of previous years.<P>

11. Item 3: the 2000-01 figure for Crown properties includes an allowance for the effect of transitional arrangements.<P>

12. Item 4: the contribution from central government to offset the amount of the Secretary of State's estimate of income forgone as a result of transitional arrangements established by regulations under section 58 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and the transitional relief scheme, announced by written PQ on 25 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 770W.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list by local education authority the number and percentage of 18-year-olds with five GCSE passes or equivalent in <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1998 and <i>(c)</i> 1999.  [101519]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 8 December 1999]:</i> The numbers of 18-year-olds with five GCSE passes or equivalent in 1997 and 1998 for local education authorities in England are shown in the following table. Figures for 1999, other than those released last month in performance tables, are not yet available. It is not possible to provide percentages as these may be misleading--population estimates for local education authorities are based on the resident population, and the GCSE data are institution based. Percentages for individual local education authorities would therefore be distorted by students who are resident in one authority but who took their GCSEs in another.

expanded to a commitment of over &#163;100 million over the period 1999-2000 to 2001-02 and its scope enlarged so that now even more small businesses will benefit from cash support for technology development and acquisition. The new Enterprise Fund will provide regional and high-tech venture capital funds for start-ups and small companies with growth potential. Also, my Department's funding for the TCS scheme is being doubled and we are creating a national network of Faraday Partnerships designed to support knowledge transfer to small businesses in particular.

 None. The Government attach considerable importance to clusters and recently announced new mechanisms for taking forward the development of their clusters policy. These include a new Clusters Policy Steering Group to be chaired by my noble Friend Lord Sainsbury, the Minister for Science; a full mapping study of cluster activity in the UK and the identification and promotion of emerging clusters in the RDA's regional economic strategies. The Government believe that clusters are market driven. As such, the Governments's key role is to create the conditions, in all parts of the UK, which encourage the formation and sustainable growth of clusters and enable and nurture progress.

 The Department monitors the implementation of EU Single Directives in other member states through the European Commission's publication "The Single Market Scoreboard" and through contacts with UK industry and the Commission . The Scoreboard is published twice a year and is a very useful monitoring mechanism on the health of the Single Market. The Scoreboard, which is available in the House of Commons Library, includes a section covering rates of transposition of Directives in all EU states. The Scoreboard is regularly discussed at the Internal Market Council. We also, through our action Single Market unit, pursue individual complaints from UK industry with the member state in question and with the Commission.

 With increased globalisation, the international market in postal services is forecast to grow much faster than domestic markets. Success in these areas will depend on ability to develop and sustain high quality, competitively priced products and services in response to changing and fast-moving customer demand, developments in new technology and ever-increasing competition. That is why this Government have made it a priority to give the Post Office the greater commercial freedom it needs to be a world-class service provider in the twenty first century.

<a name="91209w07.html_para0">The Commission made two presentations on the Internal electricity market. The first concerned progress on implementation of the electricity directive and the second harmonisation measures in electricity which look at cross border trading issues in respect of transmission pricing and congestion. As regards the implementation 



<P>
<P><I>9 Dec 1999 : Column: 614W</I><P>
report, I expressed disappointment that the Directive had not been implemented in all member states and stressed the importance of a level playing field which ensured fairness for everyone. I also congratulated the Commission on taking prompt action against those which had not implemented the directive. I said that fully open energy markets in Europe was a high priority for the UK because this would increase the competitiveness of European companies and reduce prices for consumers. I also called for progress far beyond the market opening levels set out in the Directive. On the harmonisation of cross border trading mechanisms the Council agreed conclusions which note the work of the transmission system operators to develop transmission pricing mechanisms and procedures for managing congestion; encourage them to come forward with early proposals for a resolution of outstanding issues and invite the Commission to monitor progress and to come forward with its own proposals if the system operators are unable to reach a final agreement. I announced that the UK and the Netherlands are working on competition indicators to show how well competition is developing and where barriers persist. The results of this work will be shared with the Commission and other member states.
<P>

<a name="91209w07.html_para1">In the absence of a proposal from the Commission on the access for renewables to the internal electricity market, the Council was unable to have a full exchange of views. I expressed disappointment at the continued delay and urged the Commission to come forward with a proposal as soon as possible. I said such a proposal should minimise distortions, ensure transparency, provide flexibility to distinguish between different kinds of renewables and promote cost-effectiveness and price competitiveness and that we supported the Commission in its objectives of promoting renewables as part of the response to Kyoto and the progressive inclusion of renewables in the internal electricity market. I was among a number of ministers who counselled against the inclusion of binding targets for renewables in the directive, this being a matter best left to member states, thereby respecting the principle of subsidiary.
<P>

<a name="91209w07.html_para2">The Council agreed a report to the Helsinki European Council on integration of environmental and sustainable development into energy policy which focused on priority areas for action, which include the development of the internal energy market and the promotion of renewables and energy efficiency measures.
<P>

<a name="91209w07.html_para3">In addition, the Energy Council held an orientation debate on a proposal for a directive on energy efficiency requirements of ballasts for fluorescent lighting aimed at raising product standards in Europe. Council conclusions were approved on strengthening the northern dimension of European energy policy with a view to improving co-ordination of actions between countries bordering the Baltic Sea and on the North West Region of Russia and to help provide greater focus for EU support mechanisms.
<P>

<a name="91209w07.html_para4">The Council also note reports on gas harmonisation, gas security of supply, a progress report on the energy Charter Treaty including a negotiating directive for a transit protocol and information from the Commission on the millennium bug and a Community energy efficiency action plan.

 The Graduate Liaison Office of Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary makes strenuous efforts to attract applications to the Accelerated Promotion Scheme for Graduates (APS(G)) from high calibre graduates, irrespective of background. However, there is still some way to go to improve the numbers and quality of ethnic minority candidates and their subsequent success at the various stages of the selection process.
<P>

<a name="91209w09.html_para0">The ethnic balance of the APS(G) was examined in the context of an ongoing review of the Scheme. A number of recommendations are under consideration including the way in which the Scheme is marketed, the possible appointment of a Graduate Liaison Officer with a specific responsibility for ethnic minority candidates, and the setting of targets for ethnic minority recruitment.

 The Government welcome the publication of these reports, which discuss important aspects of managing the response to mentally disordered people who come into contact with the criminal justice system. Effective local inter-agency arrangements around the country are essential if their needs are to be addressed properly. The Home Office and Department of Health are working together to encourage local agencies and services to develop the most suitable arrangements in the light of local circumstances. I understand that police officers in both the Metropolitan Police and other forces in England and Wales receive formal training on mental illness as part of their probationer training.

<P>
<a name="91209w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 On 21 September 1998, we launched the &#163;375 million three-year Quality Protects Programme which is designed to improve the management and delivery of children's social services. There is a particular emphasis on improving the life chances of children looked after by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="91209w10.html_para2">Chief executives have an important responsibility for ensuring that their council acts as corporate parents to the children in their care and that all council departments play their part in the implementation of Quality Protects. Chief executives are required to approve the Quality Protects Management action plan and to ensure that it is not seen solely as a Social Services document.
<P>

<a name="91209w10.html_para3">As part of the Quality Protects programme the Department for Education and Employment and the Department of Health have jointly drafted guidance on the education of children looked after by local authorities. This is specifically aimed at assisting local authorities in their role of corporate parent to promote and support the education of their looked-after children.
<P>

<a name="91209w10.html_para4">Elected councillors have a vital role to play in ensuring that Quality Protects has the corporate commitment needed to deliver good life chances for vulnerable children. The Government in partnership with the Local Government Association have recently sent a Guide on Quality Protects to all councillors reminding them of their corporate parent responsibilities and giving guidance on their role in implementing Quality Protects.
<P>

<a name="91209w10.html_para5">We believe that local authorities' responsibilities towards young people in and leaving care should correspond more closely to those of responsible parents. That means providing more support and assistance for children beyond the age of 16. The Children (Leaving Care) Bill, which had its Second Reading in the House of Lords on 7 December, will change the system to give young people the support they need and deserve in

<P>
<P>
<a name="91209w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We are providing &#163;2 million funding through a sub-programme in the training support programme (TSP) in 1999-2000 for training foster carers, with emphasis being put on the attainment of level 3 of the National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Award "Caring for Children and Young People". This award contains a unit of competence entitled "Promote and Maximise Educational Opportunities and Achievements for Individual Children and Young People", which describes best practice in supporting children and young people to sustain and/or access educational or learning opportunities, or return to education. It is intended to continue this sub-programme for the next two years at the same rate.
<P>

<a name="91209w10.html_para6">The TSP also includes a &#163;2.5 million sub-programme for residential child care staff to attain their level 3 NVQ in the "Caring for Children and Young People" award.

 We are committed to ensuring that children should have as stable an experience as possible while looked after by local authorities. Stability of carer is essential for a child to have a successful outcome from care. The three-year Quality Protects programme, launched in September 1998, has as one of its key objectives to increase the choice of adoption, foster and residential placements for looked-after children because, without a good choice, inappropriate placements are made, which result in placement breakdown. Placement choice is a priority area for expenditure of the children's social services special grant in 1999-2000 and remains a priority for 2000-01. A significant target which we set out in the National Priorities Guidance is for local authorities to ensure that the number of children looked after who have three or more placements does not exceed 16 per cent. by 2001.

 One of the projects within the Quality Protects programme is working with local authorities to determine their basic information requirements for managing and planning children's services.

<a name="91209w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The information requested is not available centrally. The Department is aware, however, that Kent county council is reporting difficulties with the availability of sufficient foster placements, and one possible factor is the number of looked-after children being placed in Kent by London boroughs. The social services inspectorate is currently discussing this issue with directors of social services in London.
<P>

<a name="91209w11.html_para0">The Department has introduced a range of initiatives to improve the recruitment and retention of foster carers nationally. Through the Quality Protects programme a key objective is to increase the choice of adoption, foster and residential placements for children in care. Significant additional moneys have been made available to local authorities to increase the level of training for foster carers, and we have also recently announced the development of a national advertising campaign to recruit more foster carers.

 Validation of the data for the first two years of systematic collection--February 1997 to January 1999--has taken longer than expected and is still ongoing. The numbers involved in this study are very small for statistical purposes. A preliminary review of the data has indicated that adding a third year's data--February 1999 to January 2000--will increase the strength of the data considerably and increase the possibility that general conclusions may be drawn from the overall study. The Mental Health Act Commission aims to publish a report on the deaths of detained patients by May 2000.

 The CFSP Working Group on Conventional Arms Exports met on 25 November and discussed a range of issues relating to arms transfers, including possible controls on trafficking and brokering. There was widespread recognition of the need for EU member states to give serious attention to the problem of trafficking and brokering. Member states also acknowledged, however, the potential difficulties of uniform EU-wide action, given their different national approaches to regulation of the arms trade and to the question of extraterritorial legislation, as well as the need to consider the inter-pillar implications of any new controls. The Working Group agreed to exchange further views on how to take forward discussion of this issue under the Portuguese Presidency. The UK will continue to play a constructive role.
