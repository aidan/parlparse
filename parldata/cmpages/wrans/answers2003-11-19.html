 Admiralty House contains residential accommodation for Ministers and the occupying Departments are responsible for relevant costs associated with each of the residential flats. No Cabinet Office Ministers are currently accommodated in Admiralty House. The Cabinet Office is responsible for costs associated with the common parts, as well as for maintaining the fabric of the entire building.

One flat is occupied by an official working at the Emergency Planning College on detached duty. The other occupant pays a market rent for the property, which was established by a valuation conducted within the past 18 months by independent valuers appointed by the Office of Government Commerce. Records are not held separately of the maintenance, renovation and running costs associated with these properties in particular and these costs could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The council tax for 2002&#150;03 associated with the property occupied by the individual on detached duty was approximately &#163;175. For 1997&#150;98, the council tax associated with properties occupied by college employees was approximately &#163;190, for 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 no college employees resided in college properties, for 2000&#150;01 the approximate council tax was &#163;50, and for 2001&#150;02 the council tax was approximately &#163;150.

<a name="31119w01.html_para13">From 1997 to May 2002, some officials were accommodated in civil service college properties on the college's Sunningdale estate. The individual occupants of the properties were responsible for paying the rents that had been established by independent valuers. From June 1999 to March 2000, a number of general repairs were made, to some of the residential dwellings occupied by college staff, amounting to &#163;20,827. In October 2000, &#163;365 was spent on repairs. In January 2002, &#163;3,160 was spent on repairs. There may have been other costs incurred under a maintenance contract let to cover the whole of the Sunningdale Park estate, however, it is not possible to disaggregate costs to a level of individual building. The individual occupants were responsible for their own council tax and running costs (such as utility bills).

 As the competent authority under the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000, the Environment Agency is responsible for assessing the impact of emissions from cement kilns that burn tyres. The Environment Agency's assessment methodology shows that tyre burning trials have consistently demonstrated that emissions of the principal pollutant from cement kilns&#151;oxides of nitrogen&#151;are reduced when conventional fuels such as coal and pet coke are substituted by scrap tyres, in some cases significantly. Whilst there might be an increase or decrease in other, less environmentally significant, emissions, the use of scrap tyres has been repeatedly demonstrated to result in a net environmental benefit.

 Defra has been working closely with the Department of Health, the Department for Education and Skills and the Food Standards Agency in relation to cross-Government initiatives such as the Food and Health Action Plan, Food in Schools, the National School Fruit Scheme and the Five a Day Programme. These are aimed at educating and encouraging both children and the wider population to adopt a healthier diet and lifestyle, including tackling the growing problem of obesity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government's policy on aquaculture is to encourage the development of viable, competitive and sustainable enterprises (including cod farming) provided that this can be done within a framework which safeguards public health and also protects the health and welfare of farmed and wild stocks.
<P>

<a name="31119w02.html_para9">At present there are six farming enterprises on growing cod on seven sites in Scotland. In general, the English coastline is unsuitable for marine cages, and the alternative (enclosed water re-circulation systems) is capital-intensive.
<P>

<a name="31119w02.html_para10">While cod-farming on this relatively modest scale may well meet a niche market demand, and there is potentially a vast market for farmed cod, it is not clear that significant expansion in cod is economically viable, given the cost of inputs and the price obtainable for final output.
<P>

<a name="31119w02.html_para11">The Food Standards Agency advises that there are health benefits to consumers in eating at least two portions of fish a week as part of a healthy diet, at least one of which should be oily. We have no reason to believe that farmed cod should not contribute to a healthy diet as does cod from the wild.

 A new EU directive on measures to control foot and mouth disease was adopted in Agriculture Council on 29 September 2003 and is due to be transposed into domestic legislation by 30 June 2004.
<P>

<a name="31119w03.html_para0">Under the terms of this directive, the slaughter of infected animals and known "dangerous contacts" remains the principal tool in tackling an FMD outbreak.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government's Market Transformation Programme estimates that the 61.5 million televisions in the UK consume approximately 38 million KWh of electricity per day. Of this approximately 3.3 million Kwh (8.5 per cent.) per day is consumed by these televisions while they are in stand-by mode.
<P>

<a name="31119w03.html_para3">The Government is aware of the potential for many types of appliance to consume significant amounts of energy while left in stand-by mode. It is therefore already working via the Market Transformation Programme (www.mtprog.com) to encourage manufacturers to reduce both the "on" and "stand-by" power consumption of household appliances, including televisions, through the adoption of design improvements, voluntary codes of conduct, and the establishment of best practice guidelines and targets. To date this approach has been fairly successful and we expect that the majority of new televisions sold in the UK should soon consume around 1 watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the 3&#150;8 watts consumed by older models.
<P>

<a name="31119w03.html_para4">In addition, the Government's recently announced commitment to purchase goods and services that meet higher environmental standards ("Quick Wins") requires any government department which purchases televisions to specify a stand-by power requirement of no more that 1 watt.

<P>
<a name="31119w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 At a national level, the UK has published a strategy for the reduction of small cetacean by-catch, which includes a number of recommendations for action. As part of this strategy, trials to reduce cetacean by-catch have been carried out in the offshore bass fishery. These trials have demonstrated that separator grids are a viable means of minimising dolphin by-catch in this fishery and the Scottish fishermen involved in this fishery have already indicated that they will continue to use the grid on a voluntary basis. I am determined to move forward from trialling the separator grid to deploying the gear in the fishery. However, given that the UK is not the main prosecutor of this fishery, it must be understood that whatever action we might consider by way of requiring the use of separator grids or other mitigation measures, or even closing the fisheries, would need to be implemented at the EU level in order to have significant effect.
<P>

<a name="31119w04.html_para2">The importance of reducing cetacean by-catch has been raised by the UK at ministerial level with the Fisheries Commissioner on a number of occasions and bilaterally with France.

 Food safety regulations are the responsibility of the Food Standards Agency.

SVS instructions were amended in light of the fraud cases referred to, with the aim of preventing further such incidents. They improved audit procedures and highlighted the need to liaise more closely with enforcement agencies where there are possible breaches of food hygiene or other legislation. To improve communication and co-operation between the relevant bodies, Defra has also provided joint training on the new Animal By-Products Regulation for all the relevant enforcement bodies.

 The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) is the statutory advisory committee established under Section 124 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. ACRE advise Government and the devolved administrations on all aspects of releases of GMOs into the environment, including the release of GM crops for the purposes of marketing or research. ACRE'S full terms of reference are included in their most recent annual report, which is available on the internet at http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/acre/annrep9/index.htm.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government recognises that the growing of GM crops could affect the economic position of organic and conventional farmers growing equivalent crops. This was highlighted in the Strategy Unit report entitled 'Field Work: weighing up the costs and benefits of GM crops', published last July. The issue is also being discussed amongst member states of the European union. The Agriculture and Environment Biotechnology Commission has been analysing the co-existence of GM and non-GM crops and associated liability issues and was due to publish a report last month. When the report is published we will consider it very carefully, taking into account the possible effects on the organic sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what information she has received about whether the planting of GM crops would lead to a change in the use of <i>(a)</i> pesticides and <i>(b)</i> chemical weed killers.  [138813]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w04.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Almost all of the GM crops that have been grown under trial in the EU in recent years, or are under consideration for commercial growing, are associated with changes in the use of herbicides and/or insecticides. Each GM crop is assessed on its own merits and any application to release must be accompanied by a dossier that includes detailed information on any potential changes in pesticide use and the effects this would have on the environment. The GM crop farm-scale evaluations, conducted in the UK, made a detailed assessment of the impact of herbicide use associated with three types of GM crop. A copy of the results, which were published last month, is in the Library.

 There has been considerable research investigating hybridisation between GM and non-GM crops, including the crops studied in the Farm Scale Evaluations, and between GM crops and wild relatives. This includes studies commissioned by my Department (e.g. "Monitoring large scale releases of genetically modified crops, incorporating report on project EPG 1/5/30: monitoring releases of genetically modified crop plants" (December 2002)), studies carried out in parallel with the Farm Scale Evaluations (e.g. "Gene Flow Monitoring from the GM Crop FSE Sites: Monitoring Gene Flow from the GM Crop to Non-GM Equivalent Crops in the Vicinity. Part 1: Forage Maize" (October 2003)) and other research published in scientific journals (e.g. Wilkinson et al. (2003) Science online www.scienceexpress.org (9 October 2003)). The issues of gene flow and hybridisation between GM and non-GM crops are addressed in Chapter 7 of the GM Science Review published in July 2003 (http://www. gmsciencedebate.org.uk/).

If authorisation is granted, any subsequent marketing of the GM product in question will be subject to conditions of consent, including details of how the GM product must be monitored. These monitoring conditions may or may not include a requirement to monitor the impact of GM animal feed on animal health depending on the details of each specific case.

 The following is a list of sites at which intermediate-level radioactive waste (ILW) is stored. The figures have been taken from the 2001 waste inventory published by Defra and Nirex in October 2002. The figures for each site are the volume of conditioned waste, in cubic metres, and, where appropriate, include the ILW estimated to arise from continued operation and decommissioning.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the total cost was of <i>(a)</i> setting, <i>(b)</i> monitoring and <i>(c)</i> measuring the performance targets for her Department in 2002&#150;03; and how many and what grades of civil servants monitor these targets.

 The monitoring of progress towards PSA targets is part of the mainstream work of the department and involves a wide variety of staff at all levels of the organisation. Progress towards achieving targets is also monitored by staff in HM Treasury.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will carry out the appraisal of the progress of the voluntary initiative on pesticides at the end of 2003, as recommended by the Environmental Audit Committee in its First Report of Session 2002&#150;03.  [139530]<P>

 In its response to this Environmental Audit Committee report, the Government said that it would continue to make regular assessments of progress and would be looking for real steps forward during 2003. In particular, the Government said it would be important for the initiative to demonstrate growing farmer uptake and progress on outcomes, particularly in respect of the water catchment project.

<P>
<a name="31119w06.html_wqn4"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what progress is being made with measures to support British pig farmers; and if she will make a statement.  [137249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 This Government has done and will continue to do what it can to help the pig sector. Since December 2000 over &#163;63 million of taxpayers money, comprising &#163;21.8 million for ongoers and &#163;15.6 million for outgoers under the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme and some &#163;26 million in relation to Classical Swine Fever, has gone or will go direct to pig farmers as well as &#163;200 million of indirect support in areas such as private storage aid schemes, export refunds, development grants and market promotion.
<P>

<a name="31119w06.html_para1">We meet frequently with representatives of the pig industry to discuss the challenges they face and have pledged to continue to encourage all parts of the pigmeat supply chain to work together, with ourselves and with Sir Don Curry's Implementation Group, in order to build a sustainable future for all sections of the industry. The Department helped to sponsor the first World Pork Congress in June and assisted industry in getting the approval of the Pigmeat Management Committee to use a new method of carcase grading&#151;Autofom&#151;in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="31119w06.html_para2">In addition the Red Meat Industry Forum has made a successful start in providing information designed to help improve competitiveness for all the players in the red meat supply chain. In particular, this includes benchmarking for pig producers.
<P>

<a name="31119w06.html_para3">We will also be publishing a 10 year Animal Health and Welfare Strategy next spring, after a comprehensive consultation process. The aim of the Strategy is to improve the health and welfare of animals kept by man, and protect public health from animal disease. One major initiative of the Strategy, will be the publication of dedicated sector based sub-strategies, based on a partnership approach between Government and industry. We have been working closely with the pig sector over the past 12 months to help develop such a sub-strategy, which I believe will be launched later this year.
<P>

<a name="31119w06.html_para4">On illegal imports, we have made much progress in implementing our Action Plan in the past two years. Successes include the transfer of anti-smuggling responsibilities to HM Customs, new risk assessments are being carried out by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, looking at the risk of illegally imported meat.

We are aware of the pig industry's concerns about biosecurity and will consult the industry on the scheme's biosecurity conditions before issuing. The Directors who will sit on the Board of the Company that will run the scheme have now been selected by industry interests and formally appointed and we hope that the scheme will be up and running early in the new year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what data her Department holds on plankton <i>(a)</i> density and type <i>(b)</i> around the British Isles; and whether areas of cold water plankton have been replaced by warm water types.  [134010]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department does not hold data on plankton density and type, but does fund the international marine environmental charity 'Sir Alister Hardy Foundation for Ocean Science' (SAHFOS) which is based in Plymouth, UK. SAHFOS currently operates the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey, which has been in operation since 1931 and provides one of the longest and largest marine biological data sets in the world. More than 70 years of information on the density of over 450 plankton types is contained in the database. Plankton samples have been collected from all over the north Atlantic but predominantly from waters around the British Isles.
<P>

<a name="31119w06.html_para8">Plankton are at the bottom of the marine food-web and because of this they are an essential food-source to virtually all marine life from fish to marine mammals and sea birds. The results of monitoring plankton communities can be used to monitor the state of the marine environment and have been employed to assess the ecological health of the waters around the British Isles.
<P>

<a name="31119w06.html_para9">Recent research using data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder survey has shown significant changes to the North sea ecosystem. Cold-water species of plankton that are an important food-source for cod and salmon have been displaced northwards, particularly over the last decade, and appear to be being replaced by more southerly warmer-water species.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The most recent estimate of the Norway rat population in England was a minimum of 5,240,000 individuals. This figure was established by a review that assessed the population and conservation status of all British mammals, published in 1995. The only recent objective national survey of rat presence is within the English House Condition Survey. The latest report available is for the 1996 survey which revealed that 0.23 per cent. of properties had rats indoors and 1.6 per cent. had rats present outside.
<P>

<a name="31119w07.html_para2">With regard to local authorities, section 2(2) of the Prevention of Damage by Pests Act 1949 required every local authority to maintain records of activities undertaken to destroy rats and mice. However, this section was repealed in 1980 since when no information on rat presence within individual local authority areas has been collected by central Government.

 Water companies have duties under section 94 of the Water Industry Act 1991 to provide and maintain sewers to ensure that they are effectively drained, and the sewer contents are effectively dealt with by treatment works or otherwise.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) Impose restrictions so that ships cannot be dismantled, decommissioned, cut or broken at the Able facility.
<P>
<BR>
(b) Require the installation of floating booms across the dock entrance and around waste vessels that are berthed in the dock. The booms must be inspected daily, and should oil be identified within the boomed area, it must be removed within two hours.
<P>
<BR>
(c) Require that no removal of bilge or ballast water from waste ships shall take place except in accordance with a method statement submitted to and approved in writing by the Agency.
<P>
<BR>
(d) While waste ships are in the dock, sampling of the dock water and estuary water upstream and downstream of the dock must take place weekly. Results must be submitted to Agency within four weeks. In the event that any results exceed specified trigger levels, the Agency must be notified within 24 hours.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31119w08.html_para1">In addition to these conditions imposed on Able UK, the Agency will carry out its own unannounced site inspections&#151;initially at a weekly frequency.

<P>
<a name="31119w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 17 November 2003]:</i> It is the Waste Management Licence holder's responsibility to comply with the conditions of a Waste Management Licence at their expense. The modification to the conditions of Able UK's Waste Management Licence now requires them, in effect, not to undertake any dismantling of the ships or other works, save for pollution control measures.
<P>

<P>
<a name="31119w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 17 November 2003]:</i> The immediate return of the ships is impractical primarily due to the prevailing weather conditions in the Atlantic over the winter. In the interests of safeguarding human health and the environment, it has been agreed that the ships should be stored temporarily at Hartlepool, pending a decision on their future.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w08.html_wqn5"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on her recent discussions with the US Transportation Secretary on the fleet of ships en route from the USA to Hartlepool.  [139212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My Department issued a statement on 15 November following discussions between US and UK authorities, the text of which is reproduced below.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Following exploration of alternative options, the Government has agreed with the US authorities that the third and fourth US ships currently on their way to the UK, should continue their passage to Hartlepool, where they will be securely stored pending a decision on their future. As with the first two ships, the Environment Agency will place requirements on them to ensure the environment is fully protected and the ships remain ready for return to the United States.
<P>
<BR>
 We explained last week that we were working closely with the United States authorities to examine the practicability of the return of the third and fourth ships to the United States. We have now reached a shared view that it would be imprudent for these ships to attempt a return crossing at this time of year; and that there is no other suitable storage site available. Hartlepool therefore best meets our objectives of safety and environmental protection.
<P>
<BR>
 The US authorities accept that the four ships will have to return to the United States next Spring, unless environmentally suitable and legally acceptable methods for their disposal have by then been identified."

(b) In September the Environment Agency undertook an assessment of whether the proposed modification to the waste management licence would be likely to have a significant effect on Teesmouth and Cleveland Coast Special Protected Area (SPA) and Ramsar site alone, or in combination with other plans or projects. The assessment was based on the construction of a bund or dry-dock.

 At present just over 12 per cent. of England's municipal waste is recycled or composted, about 9 per cent. of municipal waste is incinerated and the rest is landfilled.
<P>

<a name="31119w09.html_para0">There are 16 Municipal Solid Waste Incinerators in the whole of the UK (14 in England and Wales, two in Scotland) with a total capacity of about 2.7 million tonnes of municipal solid waste per year.

 No detailed assessments have been made of the practice in other EU countries. In the UK and England, any wastes that are recycled are included in the relevant statistics for recycling.
<P>

<a name="31119w09.html_para2">However, for the purposes of local authority Best Value Performance Standards in England, rubble and incineration bottom ash, among some other wastes, are excluded from the recycling figures. They are not included in the Standards because the Government want to encourage the recycling and composting of dry recyclables and compostable materials separated from mixed household wastes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what capacity there is in the United Kingdom for the <i>(a)</i> treatment, <i>(b)</i> recovery and <i>(c)</i> recycling of (i) end of life vehicles and (ii) electrical and electronic equipment.  [139460]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A recent study, undertaken by the Industry Council for Electronics Recycling (ICER), estimated the UK's current capacity to treat waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) to be between 130 and 180 facilities UK wide. At present, there are between 70 and 120 specialist treatment facilities that only treat and process electrical waste, mainly IT waste. There are also 19 fridge recyclers in the UK, and ICER suggest that these facilities may turn to treatment of other WEEE in the future. In addition to the specialist treatment facilities, there are around 40 plants UK wide that shred and granulate WEEE in preparation for recycling, and these types of plants treat most types of WEEE, alongside other waste streams, like end-of-life vehicles (ELVs).
<P>

<a name="31119w09.html_para3">Similarly, it is estimated that there are presently around 950 businesses with waste management licences, and a further 1,750 registered exempt businesses, treating end-of-life vehicles. A recent study, carried out for the Department by TRL Ltd., calculated that approximately 77 per cent. of the weight of ELVs scrapped in 2000 was reused, recovered and recycled.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Section 51(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 places a duty on waste disposal authorities to provide reasonably accessible places (civic amenity sites) for persons resident in their area to deposit their household waste. Section 51(3) of the 1990 Act enables waste disposal authorities to include in those sites arrangements for the deposit of other controlled waste (commercial and industrial waste) by other persons on such terms as to payment (if any) as the waste disposal authority determines.

<a name="31119w10.html_para2">The contract for the games area was awarded to Draught Associates on 13 February 2001 and cost &#163;13,125 ex vat. The purpose was to design and develop a series of interactive games as a fun and relevant vehicle for communicating important road safety messages to 7&#150;11 year olds. The contract has finished and five interactive games were delivered. This included versions of the games for under 7s, and for 8&#150;11s. The contract cost covered design, production, testing and research.

<P>
<a name="31119w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 In 2001 the Government issued advice on deep vein thrombosis and air travel.

All UK airlines operating long-haul flights have based the information they give to passengers on this advice.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what research he has commissioned on methods of maintaining levels of nitrogen dioxide around Heathrow Airport within EU limits;  [138839]

<UL>(2) whether a third runway at Heathrow Airport would remain an acceptable option in the forthcoming Aviation White Paper in the event that relevant pollutants could not be contained within EU limits;  [138841]

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Government has reviewed a wide range of evidence, including information contained within the BAA pic Air Quality Strategy and Action Plan, in considering the future development of Heathrow. The Government remains of the view that a new runway at Heathrow could not be considered unless it could be confident that levels of all relevant pollutants could be consistently contained within EU limits. Final decisions will be announced in the forthcoming air transport White Paper.

 The Agency is tackling the problem of missiles thrown from bridges and trunk roads in several different ways.
<P>

<a name="31119w12.html_para0">These include education initiatives, visits to schools by Police and local Road Safety officers, to make younger children more aware of the consequences of this type of activity. The Agency is also looking to support the Police in implementing additional enforcement measures, including increased CCTV coverage and warning notices on the approaches to problem sites. The Agency has also incorporated guidance on measures to prevent missile throwing within the latest version of its standard for the design of footbridges.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many new train carriages will be ready for use by December but cannot be used due to insufficient power supply.  [133039]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Over 2,000 new carriages are being introduced to replace all the slam-door trains&#151;most of which are over 30 years old&#151;across the three south-of-the-Thames franchises. Railtrack failed to plan for the associated upgrade of the power supply. The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) now has a grip on the project and expects to complete it early in 2005. Meanwhile, many of the new carriages are already in service and none is in store because of power shortages. As deliveries continue, around a 100 out of over 2,000 new carriages may be stored by December, but the SRA is leading work on ways in which they might be introduced into service using existing power supplies.

<P>

<a name="31119w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Work is currently underway to modernise the West Coast Main Line which will substantially reduce the current journey time of two hours 41 minutes. The Strategic Rail Authority's West Coast Main Line Strategy, published in June 2003, projects a reduction in minimum journey times between London and Manchester of around 40 minutes by 2007.

 The Nationwide's Cats' Eyes for Kids campaign promotes reflective clothing, and provides reflectors for children to wear. It is not possible to quantify exactly how much the wearing of such materials impacts on casualties. But together with other good practice, it undoubtedly makes our children more visible when walking in the dark and thus safer on the roads. The Nationwide initiative is an excellent example of how the private sector can help us to meet national casualty reduction targets.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what representations he has received on permitting civilians to direct vehicles on public highways; and if he will make a statement.  [139945]<P>

<P>
<a name="31119w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There are limited circumstances in which civilians can direct vehicles on public highways. I refer the hon. Member to the answer I have given today (ref. 139944). In developing its role as a network operator, as announced by the Secretary of State for Transport in his statement to the House on 20 June 2003, the need was identified for civilian traffic officers working on the trunk road network, around the clock to keep traffic flowing. This followed a review undertaken by the Agency, in partnership with the Association of Chief Police Officers, of both organisations roles and responsibilities for traffic management. This concluded that responsibility for a number of tasks associated with traffic management should transfer from the police to the Highways Agency. In order to develop its role the Highways Agency needs new, limited, traffic management powers and is preparing the necessary legislation.
<P>

<a name="31119w13.html_para1">The Highways Agency continues to work in partnership with the police and has held discussions with representatives of primary stakeholders, including constabularies, road contractors, County Surveyors Society, AA and RAC.

 The West Coast Route Modernisation project was originally developed by Railtrack in the late 1990s, which claimed that it would be completed by 2005 at a cost of around &#163;2.2 billion. A number of contracts were let with project managers and suppliers for its delivery. However, under Railtrack's management the projected costs eventually escalated to over &#163;13 billion, and it became clear the committed outputs were undeliverable. The Strategic Rail Authority and Network Rail have now established a robust framework for delivering the project, based on the SRA's June 2003 'West Coast Main Line Strategy', which indicated that the costs would be kept within a cap of &#163;9.9 billion. Further work is under way to explore the scope for reducing the costs further. The outputs are currently on course to be delivered by 2007&#150;08.

<a name="31119w16.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much funding is given by the Government to the Palestinian Negotiation Support Unit; and what conditions are attached to the use of the funding.  [139388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w16.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID has committed a total of &#163;9.2 million to support the Palestinian Negotiation Support Unit (NSU). This funding covers the period 1999 to 2006. To date &#163;5.25 million has been disbursed.
<P>

<a name="31119w16.html_para4">The purpose of this project is to provide professional legal, technical, policy and communications advice to the Palestinian authorities in preparation for, and during, permanent status negotiations with Israel. Following the collapse of formal negotiations the NSU has broadened its role by seeking to encourage the resumption of permanent status negotiations by contributing to a variety of diplomatic peace initiatives. The project supports those in the Palestinian Authority who are committed to peace.
<P>

<a name="31119w16.html_para5">The project is managed on behalf of the Palestinian authorities by the Adam Smith Institute. There are no specific conditions attached, but it is subject to DFID's usual checks and balances to ensure funds are disbursed in accordance with the agreed objectives. In addition four other governments, Norway, Sweden, Netherlands and Denmark provide complementary funding. We are currently establishing with these partners, and with the NSU, a framework for the overall management of the project.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what proportion of United Kingdom aid to Afghanistan since 2001 has been used to combat the production of opium.  [138728]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w16.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Tackling opium production in Afghanistan requires action in many areas: to improve the ability of the government to enforce the law and implement a coherent counter-narcotics strategy and to improve the conditions for legal private sector economic growth to offer people involved in poppy cultivation the chance of a licit alternative livelihood.
<P>

<a name="31119w16.html_para6">DFID's assistance to Afghanistan contributes to all of these areas. Since October 2001, DFID has disbursed &#163;157 million of aid to Afghanistan. This has included humanitarian support which prevents people from sliding into the marginalised criminal economy, &#163;35 million of financial assistance to the Afghan Government, and over &#163;5 million in assistance to develop the capacity of the Afghan Government.
<P>

<a name="31119w16.html_para7">DFID has already provided &#163;2.5 million for specific sustainable livelihoods programmes and has projects being implemented worth nearly &#163;10 million. DFID has recently doubled its budget for sustainable livelihoods programme to &#163;20 million over three years. This represents over 10 per cent. of total DFID assistance over the next three years and over 20 per cent. of the budget for programmes excluding financial assistance.
<P>

<a name="31119w16.html_para8">The Government have allocated &#163;70 million over three years specifically to combat the production of opium in Afghanistan. This includes a &#163;5.4 million contribution from DFID's &#163;20 million livelihoods budget. In total, this represents some 30 per cent. of planned UK assistance to Afghanistan over the next three years.

<a name="31119w18.html_para0">Life expectancy in developing countries is therefore improving steadily, but not dramatically. However, the HIV/AIDS epidemic is dramatically reducing life expectancy in the worst affected countries. By 2010, life expectancy in many African countries will fall to around 30 years of age, levels not seen since the end of the nineteenth century. The demographic impact outside Africa will be less severe but still significant.

 Maternal mortality is difficult to measure. As a result, WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA have developed an approach to estimating maternal mortality that generates estimates for countries with no data and corrects available data for underreporting and misclassification. They estimate that there were 527,000 maternal deaths in the year 2000 in developing countries, where 99.6 per cent. of all maternal deaths occur. The latest country estimates for the year 2000 have been placed in the Libraries of the House under the title "Maternal Mortality Estimates in 2000". The number of maternal deaths is listed in the fourth column.
<P>

<a name="31119w18.html_para1">Measuring and classifying the numbers of women who suffer injury or disability as a result of pregnancy and childbirth is even more challenging. Estimates from WHO, UNICEF and UNFPA for 1995 suggest that 300 million women worldwide (including 25 per cent. of the developing world's adult women) suffer from ill health and disability as a result of complications of pregnancy. WHO is currently conducting a review of published and unpublished studies in an attempt to provide a comprehensive tabulation of available data on the prevalence and incidence of global maternal morbidity.

 Recent reports indicate that Tanzania has the potential to meet the millennium development goals on poverty, HIV/AIDS, and environmental resources. Progress has been disappointing on the maternal and child health goals. There is insufficient data to indicate progress on access to safe water, but there are encouraging signs of progress.

 The most recent Education For All Global Monitoring Report, published by UNESCO in November this year, estimated that 104 million children of primary school age were not enrolled in school in 2000, 96 per cent. in developing countries. Most of the out-of-school children are concentrated in the countries of sub-Saharan Africa and south and west Asia.
<P>

<a name="31119w18.html_para7">I have placed in the Library lists of the primary net enrolment ratio and the corresponding percentage of primary school-age children not enrolled in school in 2000. The list is called "Education Enrolment in Developing Countries, 2000", and has figures for each country where comparable data are available.

 Due to the difficulties of collecting reliable and comparable data consistently across the whole of sub-Saharan Africa there are not internationally agreed figures for primary school enrolment for each of the last 10 years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w20.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The total expenditure for the Board of Visitors/Visiting Committee in Northern Ireland for the financial year 2002&#150;03 was &#163;51,751.00. Of this, &#163;39,000 was for travel and subsistence. Members are volunteers and do not receive remuneration.

<a name="31119w20.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Concerns regarding both general matters of prison administration and concerns regarding individual prisoners can be raised with staff informally, or formally with the Governor at the monthly meeting. If possible, the Governor responds at the meeting, or the query is recorded and the response provided at the next monthly meeting, or before then if urgent. All queries are formally recorded in the minutes of the meeting.
<P>

<a name="31119w20.html_para3">If members are not satisfied with the response they receive, or the action taken by the Governor, they can raise the matter with Prison Service Headquarters or ultimately the Secretary of State.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the impact on wild salmon stocks of salmon fish farms in Northern Ireland.  [135445]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w20.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The occurrence of escaped farmed salmon in Northern Ireland's commercial salmon catches is examined annually. The largest occurrence was in 2001, when 9.1 per cent. of the commercial catch was farmed fish. The 10-year average, excluding the year 2001, is 1.4 per cent.
<P>

<a name="31119w20.html_para5">Occurrences of escaped farmed salmon in freshwater are also monitored at the trap on the River Bush, where the 10-year average of farmed salmon as a total of trapped fish is 0.7 per cent.
<P>

<a name="31119w20.html_para6">The only detailed information available on the genetic impact of farmed salmon on wild salmon stocks has been undertaken in two surveys of the Glenarm River in 1990&#150;91 and in 1997. The surveys showed that the genetic status of the wild population was significantly changed indicating that cross breeding with farmed salmon had taken place.
<P>

<a name="31119w20.html_para7">Further scientific studies have commenced on the River Bush catchment on the potential consequences of genetic change in the wild population caused by interbreeding with farmed salmon in terms of long-term productivity. No results are yet available and such studies are likely to be case specific.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the progress to date of the Strategic Investment Body (SIB) in improving the profile and performance of the capital expenditure programme across the Northern Ireland Civil Service; and what assessment he has made of whether the departments are working effectively with the SIB on <i>(a)</i> an individual and <i>(b)</i> a collaborative basis.  [133009]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Since its inception in April 2003, the SIB has made considerable progress in improving the profile and performance of Northern Ireland's capital expenditure programme. By April 2004, SIB expects to have two to three times the value of PPP projects out to market than had been signed in the previous eleven years in Northern Ireland. An early priority project, a new Invest NI Headquarters, is expected to be signed by June 2004, following a fast procurement period at the top end of HM Treasury performance averages. With the assistance of SIB, the Department of Finance and Personnel has created a new and strong incentive scheme designed to encourage departments to be more active in managing their asset bases. In its first six months of operation, therefore, the SIB has already developed effective working relationships with a number of departments and I am sure that its impact will continue to grow as we work to improve Northern Ireland's infrastructure.

Performance management is an integral part of the day to day running of the Department, and covers a wide range of data for internal management purposes in addition to that required for PSA monitoring. Monitoring and measuring performance is therefore undertaken by a wide variety of staff at all levels of the organisation, and it is not possible to separate out discrete costs. The Department's top level performance management system, including reports against PSA targets, is co-ordinated by a dedicated section of five civilian and military personnel within the Directorate of Performance and Analysis in the Ministry of Defence Head Office.

 None. It is recognised that compared with overhead lines, there are potential benefits of underground transmission. However, benefits must always be weighed against cost, which at 400,000 volts in particular, is significantly higher per kilometre than an overhead line.

 The October 2003 Update to the National Grid Company (NGC) Seven Year Statement projects a plant margin of 19.3 per cent. for England and Wales for the winter 2003&#150;04. By way of comparison, the projected plant margin for the winter of 2002&#150;03 in NGC's October 2002 Update was 17.4 per cent. NGC project that peak demand under average cold spell (ACS) conditions this winter would be 55,900 MW and that the registered capacity of generating stations, including interconnectors with France and Scotland, would be 66,697 MW. The figures do not include additional reserves that NGC has recently contracted for and nor do they allow for any further return of mothballed plant.

 The Trade in Goods (Control) Order prohibits trade in specified military equipment between countries outside the UK unless the Secretary of State grants a licence. In the case of long-range missiles, specially designed components and equipment used in torture, the controls will apply to any trading activities done in the UK and also to the activities of UK persons anywhere in the world. For trade in any other equipment on the UK Military List to non-embargoed destinations, the controls will apply where any part of the trading activity takes place in the UK. The maximum penalty under this Order, for trading without a licence, is a fine for any amount or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.

Trade activities carried out in the UK or by a UK person anywhere in the world are prohibited without a licence. The relevant embargoed destinations will be those subject to non-binding United Nations Sanctions, and European Union, Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and UK national, embargoes. The maximum penalty under these Orders, for promoting the supply or delivery of any relevant goods to the embargoed destination without a licence, will be a fine for any amount or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years, or both.

This would include trade to a third country where he or she knew or had reason to suppose that the goods were ultimately destined for an embargoed destination.

<P>

<a name="31119w28.html_para3">Statistical surveys to businesses and local authorities conducted by the Department and its agencies are monitored centrally to facilitate control of compliance costs to business and departmental expenditure on survey activity. It is not possible, however, to determine with any degree of accuracy which surveys fall into the categories of market and opinion research, or which contain an element of these. The answer would incur disproportionate cost because of the need to ask all Directorates in DTI to attempt to provide details of each survey and piece of research commissioned.

 It is not possible to give a reliable estimate of the number of new masts that will be needed to fulfil the obligations of the 3G licensees, whether in total or by area. The number of masts required in an area will be affected by the level of consumer demand for 3G services, by commercial decisions related to the design of the networks, by the physical topography and by the requirements of planning authorities.

<a name="31119w28.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 My Department has made an assessment of the potential impact of the draft Constitution on the Department's powers to regulate recovery of hydrocarbons from the UK Continental Shelf. This assessment notes that Article III-157 of the draft EU Constitutional Treaty would give the EU competence in energy matters, including natural resources, with voting by qualified majority. Also that Article III-130(2)(c) provides for unanimity on "measures significantly affecting a Member State's choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply". Under the Treaty establishing the European Community, there is already Union activity in energy matters and we believe there is a strong case for making the legal base for policy in this area more transparent. However, the UK Government would not agree to any proposal that was inconsistent with UK energy interests.

<P>

<a name="31119w29.html_para10">For the FE sector, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) only publish success, retention and achievement rates for those learners funded by the council in further education colleges and external institutions in England. However, the majority of learners from countries outside of the European Union are not funded by the LSC&#151;so figures are not available. Furthermore, the LSC do not publish further education institution success, retention and achievement rates based on less than 500 learners as they can be misleading. In 2001/02, less than 15 further education institutions in England had more than 500 LSC funded non-European Union students.

 There are currently two main bidding rounds through which local education authorities (LEAs) are able to apply for capital funding for their school estates, Building Schools for the Future (BSF) and Targeted Capital Fund (TCF).
<P>

<a name="31119w30.html_para0">The guidelines for the BSF programme were set out in guidance sent to all LEAs on 17 July 2003. The TCF guidance was issued to LEAs on 21 July. Both sets of guidance have been deposited in the House of Commons Library.
<P>

<a name="31119w30.html_para1">In both cases authorities were invited to prepare proposals based on the guidance, and to submit their proposals by 31 October 2003. We hope to announce successful projects for the first phase of BSF (due to start in 2005&#150;06) in early January 2004, and successful TCF projects (due to start in 2004&#150;05) will be announced at the end of January.
<P>

<a name="31119w30.html_para2">Expressions of interest for later years BSF funding are due to be submitted by LEAs by 19 December 2003. A further phase of successful BSF projects will subsequently be announced at the end of March.

<a name="31119w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 "Travelling to School: an action plan" describes how we are encouraging every school to draw up a School Travel Plan in consultation with parents, pupils, local authorities and other partners. School Travel Plans will help schools, local education and transport authorities identify what needs to be done to make it safe and practical for more children to walk, cycle and take the bus to school. The School Travel Planning process includes regular checks on the way pupils travel from home to school, indicating how many children are taking regular exercise which will improve their health and reduce the risk of obesity.

<P>
<a name="31119w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Although we are unfamiliar with the term education village, we understand that this expression has been used at some local meetings in Somerset when discussing the local education authority's (LEA) proposal for Building Schools for the Future (BSF).
<P>

<a name="31119w30.html_para3">My written statements of 26 February and 26 June 2003 explain the aims of BSF, which is a programme of rebuilding and renewal to ensure that secondary education in every part of England has facilities of 21st century standard within 10 to 15 years (subject to future spending decisions), from 2005&#150;06, when over &#163;2 billion will be made available for investment.
<P>

<a name="31119w30.html_para4">We asked LEAs to consult widely on their proposals for BSF, as set out in guidance for LEAs, a copy of which I have placed in the House of Commons Library. The closing date for submission of proposals for the first wave was 31 October.
<P>

<a name="31119w30.html_para5">The Department does not make capital bids publicly available, because the bidding processes involve an exchange of information which is given in confidence. Whilst we are not aware of a bidding programme specifically aimed at education improvements, all capital investment is designed to raise educational standards in schools.
<P>

<a name="31119w30.html_para6">Although Somerset is the only LEA to be using the term education village in this context, we have received 53 BSF proposals (including the one for Somerset) for consideration for the first wave of investment. Three of these are from the South West.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Aimhigher (previously called Excellence Challenge) provides grants mainly to schools and colleges to raise the aspirations and attainment levels of young people. The Higher Education Funding Council for England's (HEFCE) Partnerships for Progression provides funds to universities for outreach. The White Paper <i>The future of higher education</i> announced that these two initiatives would be merged to form a new Aimhigher programme. Between 1998 and 2003, HEFCE established regionally based widening participation projects. Expenditure on these schemes and initiatives to 2005&#150;06 are given in the following tables.

In addition, HEFCE uses part of its teaching grant to provide a widening participation premium to universities to assist them with the additional costs of recruiting and retaining students from non-traditional backgrounds. The amount for this is &#163;255 million in 2003&#150;04, which includes &#163;10 million from the Department's Aimhigher/Excellence challenge budget. HEFCE's disability allocation (&#163;10 million in 2003&#150;04) provides additional funding to universities to support recruitment and retention of disabled students.

<BR>
As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question relating to research commissioned on average household incomes by <i>(a)</i> parliamentary constituency and <i>(b)</i> local education authority in (i) England and Wales, (ii) Scotland and (iii) Northern Ireland.
<BR>
The Office for National Statistics (ONS) has not commissioned any research on average household incomes by parliamentary constituencies or by local education authorities. However, estimates of average household income and household disposable income are available at regional, sub-regional and local area levels (NUTS levels 1, 2 and 3 respectively), and were published in a news release on 26 March 2002, available on the National Statistics website at: http://www.statistics.gov.uk/pdfdir/reg0302.pdf.
<BR>
In most cases, NUTS level 3 areas are groups of administrative areas that are also local education authorities, but this is not the case throughout the UK.

ONS has also conducted work to develop estimates of average incomes at the ward level, and the results should be published within the next three months. However, these estimates cannot simply be aggregated to parliamentary constituencies or local education authorities. These results will be the best estimates at the ward level, and to produce the best estimates for parliamentary constituencies or local education authorities, different methodologies are likely to be more appropriate.
<BR>
I understand that there is work carried out by the devolved administrations in Scotland and Northern Ireland on household incomes at various geographic levels.

 We have no plans to introduce licensed qualifications for either bricklayers or hairdressers. While a statutory approach, such as a licence to practice or operate, may suit some industries, we believe that collaborative voluntary action will be the appropriate route for most sectors.
<P>

<a name="31119w32.html_para0">We have an excellent example of such an employer led initiative in the Construction Skills Certification Scheme (CSCS). Major contractors have made a commitment to improve performance by requiring members of their workforce to hold an industry record card&#151;normally the CSCS.

 Indicative allocations of targeted transitional grant for 2004&#150;05 were published on 29 October: these totalled &#163;120 million. Allocations for 2004&#150;05 will be confirmed later this month. I expect to make around half the 2004&#150;05 level of grant available nationally in 2005&#150;06: details will be confirmed in due course. The transitional grant is additional to the funding for local education authorities which was announced following the Spending Review 2002.

Friend the Secretary of State will be prepared to consider bringing forward grant payments from my department, so that the LEA will have funds available in 2004&#150;05 for this purpose, with the expectation of a consequential reduction to what they will receive in future years. The maximum amount that might be made available to each LEA in this way would be 300,000 per authority, or 0.2 per cent. of the authority's total education resources in 2004&#150;05, if that is higher.

<P>

<a name="31119w34.html_para4">Much importance is already attached to alternatives research, both by Government (including public service research funding bodies) and the scientific research community. The latter has considerable incentive to develop replacements for the use of animals, and has an impressive track record in doing so. Responsibility for further progress continues to rest primarily with the researchers themselves, as they try to overcome the technical limitations of those systems and methodologies still dependent upon animal use. The Government will continue their efforts to support that, with the added focus and impetus provided by the various related recommendations of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures, the Government response to which has been well reported.

 <i>[holding answer 22 October 2003]:</i> The Government have not commissioned any research into the levels of financial support other EU member states have given to alternatives to animal research and has no current plans to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w34.html_spnew8"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The use of alternatives is widely encouraged and the use of animals in regulated procedures is prohibited by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 in cases where a scientifically valid non-animal alternative is available. Every year the Home Office makes available to the Animal Procedures Committee (APC) a budget aimed at developing or promoting the use of alternatives which replace animal use, reduce the number of animals used, or refine the procedures involved to minimise suffering (the 3Rs). Work aimed at improving the environmental conditions in which laboratory animals are kept and transported has also been sponsored. The amount made available to the Committee for 2003&#150;04 for this specific purpose is &#163;280,000.
<P>

<a name="31119w34.html_para5">This is not the only money spent by the Government on alternatives, other Departments also fund such work.

 Section 12&#150;16 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 (CJPA) came into force on 1 September 2001. The provisions in the Act allow local authorities to designate areas to restrict public drinking where there is evidence that nuisance is alcohol related. In such designated areas the police may use their discretionary powers to confiscate all alcohol where they reasonably believe that continued drinking in that place will lead to further disorder or nuisance. The CJPA provides the police with a more consistent set of powers including the power of arrest, which was not available in the previous bye-laws. Any relevant local authority drinking bye-law will lapse after five years commencing on 1 September 2001.
<P>

<a name="31119w35.html_para0">The powers contained in the CJPA were never intended to be used to introduce a blanket restriction on public drinking. The powers were intended to be used to stop the immediate problems caused by anti-social drinking in designated areas and to allow the police to confiscate alcohol in those areas. Section 13 of the CJPA could permit the designation of an entire local authority area should that area be experiencing problems with nuisance that is alcohol related.
<P>

<a name="31119w35.html_para1">The time it takes for a local authority to introduce an order will vary from the size of the area to be designated and also with regard to the time it takes to carry out the procedures required under the Local Authorities (Alcohol Consumption in Designated Places) Regulations 2001.
<P>

<a name="31119w35.html_para2">The objective of the CJPA powers is to tackle anti-social street drinking, rather than begging. Begging is an offence under Section 3 of the Vagrancy Act 1824. It will be made a recordable offence from 1 December 2003.

<a name="31119w38.html_para0">Enforced migration deriving from human rights abuse and inequality starts with discrimination and marginalisation. Both the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) and the Department for International Development (DFID) address these root causes in their work to promote human rights abroad. This year the FCO will fund over &#163;12 million worth of grass roots human rights projects in more than 60 countries. Full details of the FCO's work to promote human rights can be found in the Annual Report on Human Rights, a copy of which was sent to all Members of the House. An electronic version is available at: www.fco.gov.uk/humanrightsreport2003DFID is dedicated to the elimination of poverty through realisation of the human rights of the poorest people of the world. In 2002&#150;03, spending related to human rights and empowerment totalled &#163;112 million. DFID seeks to ensure that poor people are consulted on policies and decisions that affect them and are aware of their rights. This approach aims to promote social justice, including tackling human rights abuse. In October 2000, DFID published its strategy for achieving this goal, entitled "Realising Human Rights for Poor People". A copy was placed in the Library of the House.

 The great majority of schools are orderly places and serious violence is rare. However, we are determined to raise standards of behaviour and security further. We are therefore investing an average of &#163;156 million annually over the next three years in a wide-ranging programme to improve behaviour and attendance in schools. This includes better training for school staff in managing pupil behaviour; support for pupils at risk of becoming involved in crime; and closer working between police and schools, with some officers based in schools in over 50 local education authority areas. We are currently running conferences to help schools combat bullying. We are also making schools more secure; we have legislated against offensive weapons and trespass and published a legal toolkit for dealing with aggressive intruders; we have supported security measures through the Standards Fund and Capital Modernisation Fund, and we are giving school security priority in credit approvals for local authority capital investment.

 As lead nation for counter narcotics activity in Afghanistan, the UK supports the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy which was adopted by President Karzai in May 2003. The strategy proposes activities in four key areas: improved drugs law enforcement; alternative livelihoods for poppy farmers; capacity building for Afghan drugs institutions; and public awareness campaigns/treatment programmes to help reduce demand.

 We did not consider the resolution put to the Security Council on Israel's construction of a fence or wall in the West Bank reflected accurately the situation on the ground.

By 2005 there will be a dedicated FCO S & T officer in 34 of our overseas posts in 22 countries. Several other posts have also joined the network and make use of S & T to further bilateral relations. The network reports to a wide customer base and works with a number of UK organisations with an interest in S & T overseas. These include Government Departments, parliamentary and devolved institutions, public sector bodies, universities, research and trade organisations and industry.
<P>

<a name="31119w45.html_para1">The FCO works in close partnership on international S & T issues, with the Office of Science and Technology (OST), the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) (especially its team of International Technology Promoters), UK Trade & Investment, the British Council and the Research Councils (RCUK). The FCO's S & T network adds value to the UK by addressing the following objectives:

 We welcome Turkey's progress in the protection of human rights and the constitutional and legislative changes that it has made since October 2001. The recent 6th and 7th EU-related reform packages were particularly far reaching. Consistent and effective implementation of these is now crucial, so we are encouraged by the Turkish Government's increasing emphasis on the practical application of new laws, and its creation of a committee, under Foreign Minister Abdullah Gul, to monitor progress.

We maintain a strong network of contacts in both our missions in Ankara and Istanbul, and in London. We regularly meet local and multinational NGOs, European and International bodies which monitor Turkey's human rights performance and members of the government. We also attend human rights trials wherever possible and liaise with EU partners to maintain an EU presence at key events throughout the country. We conduct an

: The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) website (www.fco.gov.uk) is kept under constant review. The site was significantly re-designed and re-structured when it was re-launched in May 2002. A leading web design agency developed the new site, after consulting widely with FCO stakeholders. Usability testing on the new site was conducted in August 2002 by a specialist company using members of the public. The recommendations of their report were implemented and the findings informed a further re-design of the homepage which went live in January 2003. In July, a specialist IT consultancy, assessed the website as part of an overall review of FCO electronic information. Their recommendations are in the process of being implemented. Customer feedback is constantly monitored and assessed.

 In their legislative review published in April 2003 The Disability Rights Commission (DRC) reiterated our proposals in "Towards Inclusion" to extend the definition of disability to cover more people with HIV and cancer and recommended a further change that would benefit more people with multiple sclerosis. Since then officials have been involved in a number of discussions with the DRC about the proposals.

<a name="31119w47.html_para5">Officials have received a range of other representations regarding the definition of disability from disabled people, civil rights groups and organisations that represent disabled people, urging change and supportive of the proposals in "Towards Inclusion". The majority of these have come from people concerned about HIV infection. This included a letter campaign earlier this year supporting the case for extending the DDA to cover HIV from point of diagnosis.

 The Local Housing Allowance (LHA) was launched in Blackpool on 17 November. Blackpool is the first of nine local authority Pathfinders that will operate the Local Housing Allowance over the next two years; the remaining eight authorities will go live between December and February.
<P>

<a name="31119w48.html_para0">For de-regulated private rented sector tenants in Pathfinder areas, benefit will no longer depend on individual rents but will be based on a standard amount for the area and size of household. This will allow tenants to trade between the quality and price of their accommodation.
<P>

<a name="31119w48.html_para1">The LHA will also provide a more transparent, efficient and fairer system. Most tenants will take responsibility for receiving their benefit and paying an appropriate amount of it as rent to their landlord. No claimant will be worse off when the LHA is introduced, and we estimate that in Blackpool around one in three Housing Benefit claimants in the de-regulated private rented sector will benefit financially.
<P>

<a name="31119w48.html_para2">Pathfinder authorities have been encouraged to work closely with landlords and they have all held meetings with local landlords to explain how the LHA will work and the safeguards that have been put in place; however, we have not issued any specific guidance on consultation.

 Performance targets for the department were agreed as part of Spending Review 2002. The monitoring and measurement of PSA targets forms part of departmental performance management. Performance management is an integral part of the day to day running of the department, and as such it is not possible to separate the specific costs out.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w50.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Decisions on council tax levels are for local authorities to take after consulting with their local electorates and taxpayers. The Government does make projections of the council tax yield in future years for the purposes of managing the public finances. These projections are based on a number of assumptions about changes in council tax levels, the tax base, the collection rate and council tax benefit payments. The level is assumed to rise in line with past trend, and does not represent a value judgment about what local authorities may choose to do in the future. These figures are not a Government view as to what constitutes an acceptable rise in council tax, and simply represent an assumption for public expenditure planning purposes. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also makes a technical assumption in relation to the assumed national council tax which is used for the purposes of the formula which we use to make the annual grant distribution to all local authorities.

 The Government are determined to tackle all forms of homelessness including amongst older people and wants to prevent it occurring wherever possible.

<P>

<a name="31119w52.html_para0">Under current legislation vulnerability due to old age is a priority need category. This ensures that vulnerable older people who become unintentionally homeless, or threatened with homelessness, must be provided with suitable accommodation by the local authority.
<P>

<a name="31119w52.html_para1">In addition, the Homelessness Act 2002 required each local authority in England to undertake a review of homelessness in their area and put a strategy in place by the end of July 2003 to ensure that accommodation and support is available within their districts for homeless people and those at risk of homelessness. The Homelessness Directorate within the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has also issued good practice guidance to assist local authorities in the development of their strategies including information on addressing the needs of older people who are homeless or vulnerable to homelessness.

 Under this Government, total housing investment has more than trebled, rising from &#163;1.4 billion in 1997&#150;98 to &#163;4.9 billion in 2004&#150;05. Amongst other positive developments, this investment has served to improve nearly one million social homes to the decent homes standard already, and we expect to bring another 500,000 social homes up to the standard by spring of next year. Meanwhile, we are investing &#163;5 billion in more affordable housing over the next three years&#151;that is double the level of investment we inherited in 1997.

 It is up to landlords to decide whether they wish to repurchase homes that they have previously sold, having regard to local housing needs. But we know that some people who have bought council homes, particularly flats, have subsequently found themselves in financial difficulties. So since April 1999 we have helped authorities to buy back such homes, by covering 35 per cent of the costs they incur if they spend &#163;50,000 per year or more. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are ensuring that similar provisions continue to operate under the new local government capital finance system that starts on 1 April 2004.

 Both the North Staffordshire and the Birmingham and Sandwell Market Renewal Pathfinders are situated in the West Midlands region. Both have currently received funding of &#163;6.66 million. This money is being used to prepare the Pathfinder's scheme and to fund some early interventions. The two Pathfinders are now currently in the process of preparing their strategic schemes to bid for resources from the Housing Market Renewal fund.

 Performance targets for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister were agreed as part of Spending Review 2002. The monitoring and measurement of PSA targets forms part of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's performance management systems. Performance management is an integral part of the day to day running of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and as such it is not possible to separate the specific costs out. The monitoring of progress towards and performance against the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's PSA targets is undertaken by a wide variety of staff at all levels of the organisation.

<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what <i>(a)</i> guidance and <i>(b)</i> advice his Department published for tenants of registered social landlords, concerning (i) their rights in respect of consultation over demolition programmes and (ii) major policy changes;  [139889]
<P>
<UL>(2) what <i>(a)</i> guidance and <i>(b)</i> advice his Department has published for registered social landlords concerning their responsibilities towards tenants, with particular reference to their responsibilities to inform tenants of their rights when properties become earmarked for demolition;  [139890]

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_spnew4"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not published guidance and advice to registered social landlords (RSLs) or their tenants in respect of consultation about demolition programmes and major policy changes. Section 105 of the Housing Act 1985 requires landlords to "maintain such arrangements" as they consider appropriate for informing secure tenants about any proposals for changes in housing management which will affect them "substantially". These "matters" should include maintenance, improvement and demolition. The Housing Corporation is regulator of RSLs and its regulatory code and guidance (published in "The Way Forward: Our approach to regulation" in January 2002) include requirements that RSLs must seek and be responsive to residents' views and priorities. RSLs are required, amongst other things, to enable residents to be involved in decision making and to provide information about its activities to residents. The regulatory code and guidance apply to all types of legal occupier, including occupants with assured and secure tenancies.
<P>

<a name="31119w53.html_para5">RSLs do not require consent to demolish property. However, they do require the consent of the Housing Corporation under section 9 of the Housing Act 1996 if property is to be demolished and the land is to be disposed of. RSLs are required to consult the field offices of the Housing Corporation about the need for any grant payment or re-payment in these circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_spnew5"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Housing Corporation has allocated &#163;38.9 million in 2003&#150;04 for works to Registered Social Landlords stock. This includes major repairs. The corporation, with the National Housing Federation, has issued guidance to associations covering all aspects of asset management, including how to deal with stock in need of major repair. They have also supported a number of seminars and other training events on this topic. Corporation regulators work with associations at risk of failing to meet the Decent Homes Standard on any of the criteria, including structural soundness, to ensure that all homes will meet the standard by 2010.

<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the optimum size is of housing stock for stock transfers of local authority housing to a single trust or association.  [139893]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_spnew6"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Housing Transfer Manual 2003 makes clear that decisions on the number of dwellings transferring from a local authority to a new landlord will depend on local circumstances. A material consideration in deciding the number of dwellings transferring to a single landlord would be the number of dwellings remaining after any proposed demolitions. This supersedes the 12,000 dwelling guideline that existed previously.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what his policy is regarding housing trusts or associations created as a result of stock transfer ballots by tenants, in cases where they propose demolishing occupied properties without the consent of tenants.  [139895]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_spnew7"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Tenants should be fully involved in all the stages of deciding how to deliver the decent home objective. This includes the option appraisal process, and, where transfer is the preferred option, the detailed development of the transfer proposal including the likely need for demolitions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what his policy is regarding housing trusts or associations created as a result of stock transfer ballots, in cases where tenants demonstrate a desire to establish a new or alternative body to <i>(a)</i> manage, <i>(b)</i> own and <i>(c)</i> manage and own part of the trust's or association's housing stock.  [139896]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_spnew8"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Increasing tenant participation is a priority for all housing transfers. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister would expect any new landlord to be willing to consider any approach from its tenants to manage, own or own and manage their stock. However, in considering any request we would expect the landlord to consider the impact on other tenants, delivery of the transfer promises and the effect on the business plan.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the exception site planning principle for the provision of housing in villages.  [140280]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_spnew9"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 Current policy on providing for rural exception housing is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: <i>Housing</i>, Annex B. The policy allows local planning authorities to consider including a "rural exception policy" in their plans where there remains a lack of affordable housing to meet local needs. An exception policy enables a local planning authority to grant planning permission for small sites for affordable housing to meet local needs in perpetuity, within or adjoining existing villages, which may be subject to policies of restraint. The current policy advises that it is inappropriate for local planning authorities to allocate particular sites for affordable housing.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w53.html_spnew10"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's consultation document "Influencing the size, type and affordability of housing" proposes that the current policy on providing for rural exception housing set out in Annex B of Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: "Housing" is replaced by a policy that enables local planning authorities to identify sites solely for affordable housing, on land within or adjoining existing villages, which would not otherwise be released for housing.
<P>

<a name="31119w53.html_para7">The proposal seeks to address concerns that the securing of affordable housing through the current rural exception policy takes too long. The proposed policy will provide affordable housing in a more considered way through the plan-making process. It is anticipated that it will deliver affordable housing where it is needed more effectively and more quickly than the current policy.

 The Treasury estimates that 3 million jobs in the UK are linked, directly and indirectly, to the export of goods and services to the European Union. This figure is based on the assumption that the share of total UK employment associated with UK exports to the EU is equal to the share of total UK value added (GVA) generated by UK exports to the EU.

 The Government have introduced a number of personal tax and benefit measures since 1997 that have benefited households.

Full details of these measures and their effect on Exchequer revenues are set out in the relevant Financial Statement and Budget reports, copies of which are available in the Library of the House. These measures include cutting the basic rate of income tax to 22 per cent. the lowest rate for 70 years, introducing the 10p starting rate of income tax, over-indexing age-related personal allowances and introducing the working and child tax credits to support families and tackle child poverty.

 Dental appliances are manufactured to the prescription of a registered dentist, mostly in privately owned laboratories, which have to be registered with the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulation Agency (MHRA) under the Medical Devices Regulations 2002. We are working with the General Dental Council and the profession to provide for the registration of dental technicians including clinical dental technician (CDTs). As a result, members of both professions will need to be appropriately trained and qualified. The registration of CDTs will enable suitably qualified members of the profession to both supply and fit dental appliances thereby legalising the practice of denturism.

<a name="31119w58.html_para12">No prosecutions have been undertaken against dental laboratories which have failed to register under the Medical Devices Regulations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what the national misdiagnosis rates for epilepsy were in <i>(a)</i> adults and <i>(b)</i> children in the last year for which figures are available;  [139786]

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w59.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 We do not collect information on the misdiagnosis rates for epilepsy. However, recent reports from the Clinical Standards Advisory Group, "Services for patients with epilepsy (2000)", and the Chief Medical Officer, "On the State of the Public Health (2001)", showed that around 20 per cent. of people referred to epilepsy clinics may be misdiagnosed and receive inappropriate and unnecessary treatment. In May 2002, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) made its report of the National Clinical Audit of Epilepsy Related Death available to local national health service clinicians and organisations to help them establish or review policies for the management of epilepsy and epilepsy-related death. NICE is also developing a clinical guideline for the diagnosis,

management and treatment of epilepsy, which is currently due to be published in June 2004 and which will help address any shortfalls in current practice.
<P>

<a name="31119w59.html_para1">The new general medical services contract includes clinical quality standards for the management of epilepsy in primary care. Under the quality and outcomes framework being introduced from 1 April 2004 as part of the contract general practitioner practices will be rewarded for monitoring and managing people with epilepsy. This will include recording the percentage of patients aged 16 and over receiving drug treatment for epilepsy who have been seizure free for the last 12 months. The Joint Epilepsy Council's "National Statement of Good Practice" shows that around 70 per cent. of people with epilepsy have the potential to become seizure free.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w59.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Although no official cost effectiveness assessment has been carried out, general practitioner practices usually ask their primary care trust to write to patients on their behalf. It is thought that this approach is quicker, more cost effective than individual practices writing out and preserves patient confidentiality.

<P>
<a name="31119w59.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 In 1999, the Department commissioned the University of York to carry out an up to date expert scientific review of fluoride and health. "A Systematic Review of Water Fluoridation" published in September 2000, reported that fluoridating water reduces the number of children with tooth decay by 15 per cent. The review identified 3,246 research studies from 30 different countries, but was critical of the quality of the research available. Accordingly, the Department asked the Medical Research Council (MRC) how the evidence base could be strengthened and the Chief Medical Officer and Chief Dental Officer are advising Ministers on the implementation of the MRCs recommendations. We have already commissioned a study on the absorption of fluoride, which has now been completed and is subject to peer review.

<P>
<a name="31119w59.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Government is concerned about the levels of childhood obesity and is taking and considering a number of actions to tackle the problem. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has recently published a discussion paper on possible options for action on the promotion and advertising of foods that could improve children's diets and health, and is expected to advise Ministers of its analysis of these options early next year. It would not be appropriate to discuss specific options before receiving the FSA's advice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w59.html_spnew8"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 There is no legislative requirement for guideline daily amounts of nutrients to be included on food labels. However, the Food Standards Agency recommends that this information should be given and a number of food manufacturers already include such information on their products. In the next few months, the European Commission is expected to make a proposal to amend the current nutrition labelling directive. The Government are pressing for mandatory nutrition labelling on all foods, and for the labelling to indicate whether the product is high, medium or low in key nutrients, that is fat, sugar and salt.

[136626]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w59.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Article 5 of the Food Supplements Directive lays out a framework for the future setting of maximum permitted levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements. The United Kingdom continues to press for European Union maximum permitted limits to be set on a safety basis, and in doing so, is using its influence in both scientific and political forums. I intend to raise this issue with Ministers in other Member States as and when appropriate. I am also seeking to arrange a meeting with Commissioner David Byrne at the earliest practicable opportunity.

 Anglo Canadian was announced as preferred bidder for the proposed treatment centre at King George's Hospital, Redbridge on 12 September. Their appointment is subject to final contract negotiation and agreement. Because of the commercial in confidence status of the procurement, it is not possible to list the other companies that expressed an interest in this scheme.
<P>

<a name="31119w61.html_para2">The selection of the preferred bidders followed detailed evaluation of the submitted tenders. The evaluation criteria included clinical quality, building proposals, human resources, speed of mobilisation and delivery, affordability, value for money, bidders corporate structure and price. There was a structured scoring mechanism against each of these criteria and total scores assessed between bidders.
<P>

<a name="31119w61.html_para3">It is expected that the treatment centre based at King George's Hospital will complete 11,800 procedures on average per year of the contract in ophthalmology, general surgery and trauma and orthopaedics. These are indicative activity levels and are subject to the possibility that it may make sense for the national health service and the preferred bidder to shift activity between different centres.

<P>
<a name="31119w61.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what representations <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> his ministerial colleagues has received from (i) the Royal College of Ophthalmology, (ii) the AMD Alliance and (iii) the RNIB on the implementation of NICE guidance for wet age-related macular degeneration; and if he will make a statement.  [138049]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w61.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 We have recently received representations from the Royal National Institute for the Blind and the Macular Disease Society raising concerns about the extended implementation period from three to nine months. They were concerned that primary care trusts would delay paying for photodynamic therapy (PDT) until the latest possible time. Specialised commissioning groups are leading the implementation of PDT and at a meeting held on 



<P>
<P><I>19 Nov 2003 : Column 1119W</I><P>
4 November, departmental officials made clear that funding should not delay implementation of the guidance. The Department is also working closely with the Royal College of Ophthalmologists on the implementation of the guidance.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w61.html_wqn6"><B> Nick Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether reading centres assessing patients with wet age-related macular degeneration for treatment with photodynamic therapy will be required to make a diagnosis before patients are treated; and if he will make a statement.  [138050]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w61.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Reading centres assessing patients with wet age-related macular degeneration for treatment with photodynamic therapy (PDT) will not be required to make a diagnosis before patients are treated. For the moment, reporting on the same day, in real time, by the reading centres service is not feasible. Consequently to avoid delay, PDT will be offered on the basis of the initial judgement of the clinician at the PDT centre, with confirmation of the diagnosis by the reading centres service being made after the first PDT treatment has occurred.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w61.html_wqn7"><B> Nick Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the annual cost to the NHS of providing photodynamic therapy for wet age-related macular degeneration <i>(a)</i> by primary care trusts, <i>(b)</i> by hospital trusts and <i>(c)</i> in total; and if he will make a statement.  [138051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w61.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The National Institiute for Clinical Excellence has estimated that the cost of providing photodynamic therapy (PDT) to 1000 patients per year would be in the region of &#163;4 million in the first year, rising to &#163;8.3 million by the third year and remaining constant thereafter. PDT is a specialised service and we would expect up to 50 centres to be supported. Therefore, every primary care trust (PCT) or hospital trust is not expected to provide this service. Initially, specialised commissioners will fund the service and PCTs will need to consider longer term funding arrangements.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w61.html_wqn8"><B> Nick Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the number of patients with classic no occult wet age-related macular degeneration who are unable to receive photodynamic therapy on the NHS; and if he will make a statement.  [138052]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w61.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 On the basis of limited epidemiological data, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) estimated that each year in England and Wales there may be 5000 to 7500 new cases of predominantly classic subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) associated with wet age-related macular degeneration. However, they noted there is a high degree of uncertainty about this estimate. We have asked the National Health Service to ensure that patients with suspected CNV are treated wherever capacity exists to do so. By July 2004, the NICE guidance will have been implemented fully across the country and capacity will build between now and then.

<P>
<a name="31119w61.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 There are approximately 30 centres providing photodynamic therapy. Some are well established, others are coming on stream. We expect that up to 50 centres will be set up to deliver the National Institute for Clinical Excellence's recommendations. As a specialised service, we expect commissioners to plan for centres to serve a population of not less than a million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will set up an inquiry into the lessons to be learnt from the prosecutions relating to meat fraud <i>(a)</i> at Denby Poultry Products and <i>(b)</i> in Rotherham.  [137587]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w61.html_spnew10"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Following the prosecutions for fraudulent diversion of unfit meat in the Rotherham case, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) set up the independent Waste Food Task Force. The Task Force, which was made up of experts from enforcement, industry and consumer backgrounds, advised the FSA on additional action that could be taken to prevent the illegal diversion of unfit meat into the food chain. The Task Force also included enforcers involved in the Denby Poultry Products prosecutions. The board of the FSA, at its September meeting, adopted an action plan to implement the recommendations of the Task Force. In addition to this, the FSA has called a seminar on 26 November to discuss the lessons to be learned from the Denby prosecutions. The seminar will involve those who were involved both in the Denby prosecutions and in other similar cases, including local authority enforcers, the Meat Hygiene Service, the police and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, as well as industry and consumer representatives.

<i>Notes:</i>
 <sup>1</sup>  From April 2002 a new trust called West Sussex Health and Social Care Trust came into existence, in the main this trust treats mental health patients in the West Sussex area. This was formed by the merger of three other trusts, or parts of them, namely Worthing Priority Healthcare, Sussex Weald and Downs NHS Trust (previously Chichester Priority Care Services) and Mid Sussex NHS Trust.
 <sup>2</sup>  The figures shown are the numbers of admissions under mental health specialities and learning disabilities in these three trusts, over the years 1996&#150;2002. This does not, however, guarantee that the patients being admitted are from the west Sussex area.
 <sup>3</sup>  Admissions are defined as the first period of patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, if he will provide financial assistance to the setting up <i>(a)</i> in England and <i>(b)</i> in Brent of Data Link schemes for paramedics to obtain details of a person's medical history.  [136640]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w65.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Access by paramedics to patients' medical history (subject to appropriate security and confidentiality safeguards) will be included in the core functionality of the integrated care records service (ICRS) that will be implemented across the National Health Service, beginning in 2004 as part of the national programme for information technology in the NHS. Local service providers are being appointed to work with local health communities to deliver solutions tailored to specific local needs.
<P>

<a name="31119w65.html_para0">Central funding for the National Programme for IT in the NHS, of which the ICRS is one component, is to be made available as follows&#151;&#163;370 million in 2003&#150;04, &#163;730 million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;1.2 billion in 2005&#150;06.
<P>

<a name="31119w65.html_para1">There is also some &#163;850 million per annum provided in local baseline allocations that must be used to support investment in IT infrastructure or particular local priorities. If there is specific functionality required in Brent or elsewhere, and local circumstances or priorities dictate that it will be required sooner than ICRS will be rolling it out nationally, then local funds should be used to procure and provide that application, system or service.
<P>

<a name="31119w65.html_para2">Funding for local initiatives is a matter for the relevant strategic health authority and primary care trusts.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, how many patients have been referred by each <i>(a)</i> Strategic Health Authority and <i>(b)</i> NHS Trust in London in each of the last five years for which figures are available; and if he will make a statement.  [135154]<P>

<P>
<a name="31119w65.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 It has not been possible to respond to the specific question raised. Strategic health authorities do not refer patients. However, if the hon. Member requires specific waiting time information by commissioner and provider, he can visit the following website, www.doh.gov.uk/waitingtimes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans the Food Standards Agency has to provide guidance to those involved in the meat trade to <i>(a)</i> improve self-regulation and <i>(b)</i> assist the trade in identifying criminal activity in the distribution of poultry waste.  [137585]<P>

 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has assisted meat trade organisations in preparing and publicising the Industry Code of Practice on the Production, Handling and Processing of Animal By-Products. The FSA will also in December be discussing with other food trade organisations what further action can be taken to identify and prevent fraudulent diversion of unfit meat into the food chain. In addition, the FSA is commissioning a study into the possible use of a marker in low risk animal by-products, which will enable both industry and enforcers to detect meat which is unfit or not intended for human consumption, but does not prevent the legitimate use of such material, for example, in pet food.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action is planned to ensure effective policing of the segregation of high and low risk waste at poultry slaughterhouses and its distribution from slaughterhouses; and what plans he has to provide extra resources to the Meat Hygiene Service for this purpose.  [137586]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w66.html_spnew1"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has revised its instructions to the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) on the enforcement of animal by-products legislation, and the FSA is auditing the MHS's performance against those instructions. In addition, as part of the FSA's action plan to implement the recommendations of the Waste Food Task Force, the Agency is working with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the MHS to produce a new, joint, risk-based regime for enforcement of animal by-products legislation in licensed premises. This will make best use of existing enforcement expenditure. In addition to this, the FSA is currently considering the case for extra expenditure for animal by-products enforcement in licensed premises as part of its review of MHS functions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what progress the Government has made in reducing the incidence of prostate cancer in the last five years;  [133863]
<P>
<UL>(2) what his Department's strategy is for tackling prostate cancer.  [133882]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w66.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Good progress has been made since the National Health Service Prostate Cancer Programme was launched on 6 September 2000, setting out the Government's approach to improving prostate cancer services in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="31119w66.html_para0">As part of the Prostate Cancer Risk Management Programme (PCRMP), evidence-based primary care resource packs were sent to all general practitioners in England from 23 September 2002 to aid them in counselling men who are worried about prostate cancer, ensuring the men make an informed choice about whether or not to have a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.
<P>

<a name="31119w66.html_para1">Other elements of the PCRMP include ensuring that a systematic and standardised follow up pathway is available for individuals whose test result is above the PSA threshold and action to improve the quality of laboratory testing of PSA samples. Primary care and laboratories were informed of the related recommendations from the scientific reference group, which supports the PCRMP, in September 2002.
<P>

<a name="31119w66.html_para2">In 2003&#150;04 the Department will be directly funding &#163;4.2 million of research a year on prostate cancer. This compares with just &#163;98,000 in 1996&#150;97. Two National Cancer Research Institute prostate cancer research collaboratives have been established in Newcastle and London. Funded research includes studies on various treatments for prostate cancer, improving the PSA test and ethnic differences in prostate cancer incidence. The National Cancer Research Institute considered prostate cancer as part of its strategic analysis in 2002, but made no specific recommendations.
<P>

<a name="31119w66.html_para3">The Department has funded the following regarding public awareness:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Section 64 grant to the Prostate Cancer Charity to increase further information about prostate cancer.
<P>
<BR>
Section 64 grant to the Prostate Cancer Charity to improve awareness of the risks and symptoms of prostate cancer in African and Afro-Caribbean men in Britain.
<P>
<BR>
The database of individual patient experiences in prostate cancer. 97.5 per cent. of patients with suspected urological cancers (including prostate) were seen for their first out-patient appointment within two weeks of their general practitioner deciding they should be urgently referred, and the hospital receiving the referral within 24 hours, between April and July 2003.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31119w66.html_para4">The cancer services collaborative is modernising cancer care, including prostate cancer, by reducing unnecessary delays in the system for patients throughout the cancer journey.
<P>

<a name="31119w66.html_para5">There has been an increase in the number of consultant urologists from 427 in 2001 to 466 to 2002, and is set to grow to 504 in 2005.




<P>
<P><I>19 Nov 2003 : Column 1138W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31119w66.html_para6">The incidence of prostate cancer has risen over the last five years. Much of this increase is thought to be due to an increased use of the PSA test and a lengthening of life expectancy.
<P>

<a name="31119w66.html_para7">Much has been achieved on prostate cancer since the Prostate Cancer Programme was launched, but we recognise that there is still much to be done. That is why we welcomed the launch of the Prostate Cancer Charter for Action on 29 January 2003, and set up the Prostate Cancer Advisory Group (PCAG) to ensure better collaboration and communication between the charter members and Government. PCAG is already taking forward work on information for prostate cancer patients, public awareness and a national prostate cancer resource website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to the answer of 10 November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 64W, on school sport, what assessment has been made of the percentage of school children who <i>(a)</i> were offered and <i>(b)</i> took up two hours per week of high quality physical education and school sport in the last year for which figures are available.  [139031]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31119w66.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="31119w66.html_para8">The Government is investing more than &#163;1 billion in England to transform physical education, school sport and club links. The funding will help deliver an ambitious Public Service Agreement target, shared by the Departments for Education and Skills and for Culture, Media and Sport, to increase the percentage of 5 to 16-year-olds who spend a minimum of two hours each week on high quality PE and school sport within and beyond the curriculum to 75 per cent. by 2006. Data collected during the autumn term 2002 suggested that about a third of schools provided this entitlement at Key Stage 1, two fifths at Key Stage 2 and a third at Key Stages 3 and 4. Data are now being collected for the first time&#151;for publication in April 2004&#151;on the number of pupils who choose to take up this entitlement.

1. Admissions&#151;admissions are defined as the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<P>

2. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)&#151;the primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<P>

3. Grossing&#151;figures have not (yet) been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<P>

4. Since data is residency based, figures between one and six do not need to be suppressed as authorised by the Security and Confidentiality Group (SCAG).<P>

5. Prior to 1996&#150;97 there were differences in organisational formation and/or how diagnosis data was collected meaning that data would not be comparable with those years given.<P>

<sup>(44)</sup> These costs make assumptions, based on expert opinion and judgments from the literature, about typical income received from: disability living allowance, carer's allowance, vision rehabilitation services, income support, job seeker's allowance, tax allowances; the provision of community based healthcare and the numbers of blind and partially sighted people unemployed.<P>

<P>

<sup>(45)</sup> The major costs are for those of working age which may be overstated since the report makes assumptions about the lost productivity to the economy related to unemployment among the blind and visually impaired and assumes that this can be represented by average earnings. If there are flexible labour markets and non-negligible unemployment then some portion of this "lost" productivity will be recovered through other workers.<P>

<P>

<sup>(46)</sup> Costs could be overestimates since it is not clear from the research whether these are the costs incurred by an average blind or partially sighted person, or the costs that are directly attributable to their blindness or partial sight, for example, some of those who are unemployed and blind or partially sighted would have been unemployed if they were not blind or partially sighted.<P>

 We do not collect the information requested centrally. However, stroke is one of the condition specific standards (Standard 5) incorporated into the national service framework for older people. The target is that by April 2004, 100 per cent. of all general hospitals which care for people with stroke will have a specialised stroke service as described in the stroke service model, and that all people who are thought to have had a stroke will have access to diagnostic services and access to specialist stroke services as appropriate.
