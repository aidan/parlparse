 The characteristic of best practice that the best practice tariff is intended to incentivise is a higher day case rate. The best practice tariff does not discriminate between Transurethral Resection of the Prostate and Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate treatments for prostate conditions, other than whether these procedures are undertaken as day cases.</p>

A revised target of 30% was therefore agreed, and the draft 2011-12 tariff prices were increased accordingly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_268"><a name="110217w0001.htm_para42"><a name="11021766000351">The 2011-12 tariff prices were published for 'road test' on 22 December, since when it has been brought to the Department's attention that the published best practice tariff price for resection of prostate by laser contained a typographical error. The October 2010 'sense check' prices for this procedure had been inadvertently included, rather than the revised prices that were agreed for 'road test'.</p>

The level of fee, which will be set on the basis of full cost recovery, has yet to be determined. However, the fee is likely to be lower than current cremation certification fees, which it will replace.

 We have not commissioned a specific study to assess the effects of songbird population declines. Ecosystems and their constituent species provide human societies with 'ecosystem services', such as the regulation of pollution, provision of clean water, food, recreation and general well-being. Species interactions within ecosystems are complex and so declines in songbird populations may affect the services delivered. The UK's National Ecosystem Assessment is an independent assessment of the ecosystem services we get from nature, how they have changed over the last 50 years and how the choices we make may affect them in the future. The assessment is due to report in spring 2011 and will inform the development of the Natural Environment White Paper.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_305"><a name="110217w0002.htm_para8"><a name="11021766000840">The reasons for the long-term declines in songbirds vary from species to species but in farmland habitats are relatively well understood and relate largely to the intensification of agriculture, such as the loss of spring-sown crops, weedy stubbles and hedges and the increased use of pesticides and fertilizers. These changes have reduced the availability of nest sites and food resources such as insects and seeds.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_306"><a name="110217w0002.htm_para9"><a name="11021766000841">Declines in other habitats are less well understood and we are funding ongoing research on woodland birds.

A response from British Waterways to the issues raised in the objections was sought, and this was sent by DEFRA on 20 January 2011 to the bodies who had objected, with a request for them to confirm whether they would be content to withdraw their objections or to make any further comments.

 The Government's policy on noise is set out in the Noise Policy Statement for England (NPSE) which was published in March 2010. It contains the high level vision of promoting good health and good quality of life (well being) through the effective management of noise. It is supported by three aims and together they provide the necessary clarity and direction to enable decisions to be made in any particular situation, both nationally and locally, regarding what is an acceptable noise burden to place on society.</p>

In 2009 (which is the last year for which we have confirmed results), the UK's assistance to the Common Humanitarian Fund provided emergency shelter and essential household items for two million people, sustained a water supply to 725,000 people, delivered antenatal care for 100,000 pregnant women in Darfur, and rehabilitated eight primary health care centres serving more than 500,000 people.

 The UK Government remain committed to supporting the further strengthening of the international humanitarian system. The Department for International Development (DFID) has commissioned two major reviews which will help establish the UK's future approach when responding to natural disasters. The Multilateral Aid Review (MAR) is assessing value for money of UK contributions to multilateral organisations, including UN agencies and others covering humanitarian and disaster risk reduction issues, while the Humanitarian Emergency Response Review (HERR), an independent review assessing the UK's own humanitarian emergency response capability, will offer some reflections on our partnership with UN agencies during emergency responses. The conclusions of the MAR will be announced in the coming weeks and those of the HERR by the end of March.</p>

Tarian has reported that between 2005-06 and 2008-09, its Regional Task Force carried out over 100 operations/seizures, disrupted or dismantled over 70 organised crime groups and seized over 20 kg of heroin/cocaine.

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income.<br>
2. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years.<br>
3. Data from 1994/95 is sourced from the Family Resources Survey, with earlier data sourced from the Family Expenditure Survey.<br>
4. FES figures are for the United Kingdom, FRS figures are for Great Britain up to 2001/02, and for the United Kingdom from 2002/03. The reference period for FRS figures is single financial years. FES figures are two combined calendar years from 1990/91-1992/93 and two financial years combined for 1993/95.<br>
 5. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
6. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living, equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development equivalisation factors.<br>
7. Median incomes have been provided rather than mean incomes because the income distribution is skewed with some outliers with high incomes.<br>
8. Weekly incomes have been rounded to the nearest pound sterling, while percentage changes have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br>
9. Figures have been presented on a Before Housing Cost and an After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Costs, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Costs they are.<br>

<i> [holding answer 11 February 2011]:</i> The Royal Bank of Scotland is required to execute the sale of a retail banking business with a 5% market share in the small and medium enterprise (SME) market as a condition of EU state aid approval for the aid they have received. The terms of this approval committed that the buyer of the divestment must, in combination with the divestment business, have a SME market share of no more than 14% in the UK. This condition on the maximum size of potential purchasers was set based on evidence from the UK competition authorities as to the size of banks that behave as challengers to the large incumbent banks. Santander UK currently have a small SME market share in the UK and in combination with the RBS divestment will have less than a 14% share of that market. As such, the sale will serve to increase competition in the UK banking sector as a whole, and especially in the SME market.</p>

1. We interpreted the question to mean wealth held in private pensions. Private pensions are all pensions that are not state basic retirement or state earnings related. There are nine categories included in the estimates of private pension wealth: defined benefit (DB) pensions, defined contribution (DC) pensions and personal pensions to which the individual was contributing at the time of survey, additional voluntary contributions (AVCs) made to current pensions, retained rights in DB and DC schemes, pension funds from which the individual was drawing an income through income drawdown, pensions in payment and pensions expected in the future based on the contributions of a former spouse. The estimates quoted include those individuals with zero pension wealth. The private pension wealth figures provided here were not immediately available from the Wealth and Assets Survey report, and were obtained by carrying out in-house analysis of the data.<br>
2. The Wealth and Assets Survey (WAS) is a large scale nationally representative longitudinal survey of over 30,000 private households in Great Britain that provides comprehensive information on people's assets and net wealth. The first wave was conducted from July 2006 to June 2008. It collected detailed information on financial and non-financial assets, and wealth components such as savings, pensions, property, mortgages and debt as well as people's attitudes and savings behaviour over time.<br>

2. We provide figures for both mean and median private pension wealth. The median may provide a better measure compared to the mean since the distribution of private pension wealth can be skewed by a small number of very large amounts of wealth at the top of the distribution.<br>

3. To qualify for incapacity benefit (IB), claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work called a capability assessment. Under the employment and support allowance regime, new claimants have to undergo the work capability assessment. From April 2011 incapacity benefit recipients will begin also to undertake this assessment. The medical condition recorded on the claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefit or employment and support allowance. So, for example, a decision on entitlement for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on the basis of "other hearing loss" would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities related to physical and mental function, assessed by the personal/work capability assessment.<br>
4. Incapacity benefit was replaced by employment and support allowance (ESA) from October 2008.<br>

1. DLA figures are from 5% sample data uprated to 100% proportions. Case load figures are rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>
2. Caution: The preferred statistics on benefits are now derived from 100% data sources. However, the 5% sample data still provides some detail not yet available from the 100% data sources, in particular, more complete information on the disabling condition of DLA claimants. DWP recommends that, where the detail is only available on the 5% sample data, or disabling condition (DLA) is required, the proportions derived should be scaled up to the overall 100% total for the benefit. These figures have been scaled up to the overall total by the application of a single rating factor therefore subtotals based on uprated 5% data may differ from 100% data because of sampling variation in the 5% sample.<br>

In order to capture the vast majority of such claims, DWP wait for four months after the extract date before beginning the publication process. This provides an acceptable trade-off between quality and timeliness. The level of retrospection is different for housing benefit, council tax benefit and the employment programmes, and for the monthly jobseeker's allowance (claimant count) figures published by the Office for National Statistics. However, the same principle is applied. The published numbers capture the vast majority of these retrospective entries to the computer systems.</p>

 In aggregate, highways authorities started the winter period with significantly higher salt stocks than last year. The recommendations of the winter resilience review related to the level of local authority pre-winter stocks; there is no recommended "running minimum" levels in-winter. It is the responsibility of each Highway Authority to make appropriate arrangements to ensure its winter resilience levels. The Government arranged for the Highways Agency to import 250,000 tonnes of salt as a strategic national reserve in accordance with the recommendations of the winter resilience review, to be available through the 2010-11 winter season.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="110217w0003.htm_para72"><a name="11021775000104">Due to the unusually early onset of prolonged severe winter weather inevitably led to salt stocks being utilised at a faster rate in November and December than normal. The Department for Transport has been regularly monitoring stocks held by local authorities and has taken necessary action including releasing some of the national strategic stockpile to English local authorities with low resilience, making arrangements for the import of a further volume of salt of around 273,500 tonnes as a precautionary measure and, following an urgent audit by David Quarmby, providing new guidance to highway authorities on salt spread rates.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="110217w0003.htm_para73"><a name="11021775000105">These steps taken have ensured that the country is in a better and more resilient position than we were during last winter. At the end of January 2011 and taking results from the most recent complete survey, total salt stocks held in Great Britain, including strategic stockpiles was 971,494 tonnes this is compared to around 270,493 tonnes held on 1 February 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="110217w0003.htm_para74"><a name="11021775000106">However, we are not complacent and it is important that local highway authorities take action to implement the recommendations of David Quarmby's report in October 2010 and the more recent audit in December 2010 to ensure that they are better prepared for future winters. The Department for Transport will continue to maintain a strategic stockpile where conditions warrant it, as recommended by the report, for future winters.</p>

 As we have said previously, we welcomed Israel's move last July from a restricted list of around 120 items permitted to enter Gaza to a far more permissive list of only prohibited and dual use items. Since then the volume and variety of goods entering Gaza has increased significantly. We believe on average that around 250 truck loads of goods enter Gaza through Kerem Shalom on a daily basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="110217w0004.htm_para43"><a name="11021776000808">However, as we continue to stress to the Israeli Government, including when the Under-Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Minister for the Middle East, Alastair Burt, visited the region on 16-19 January, more needs to be done to effect real changes on the ground. For ordinary Gazans, who cannot afford to buy many of the goods now entering Gaza, that means a revival of the economy and opportunities for employment. It also means getting the basics right in terms of reconstruction of Gaza's housing and infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_478"><a name="110217w0004.htm_para44"><a name="11021776000809">We want to see the approvals process for dual use items for reconstruction projects accelerated and for the extension of the process to include raw materials for manufacturing. While we are encouraged by Israel's December announcement on exports, we need to see this translated into reality. Manufacturing exports destined for Gaza's traditional markets of Israel and the West Bank is the key to reviving the economy, countering radicalisation and bolstering Gaza's pragmatic business fraternity.</p>

 We have made no recent assessment of the number of non-governmental organisation (NGO) staff entering and leaving Gaza. However, we and the Department for International Development have a regular dialogue with the NGO community and we are well appraised of the difficulties they continue to face. We have lobbied the Israeli Government on the issue of access permits and residency visas for international NGO staff. More recently we have been aware of difficulties for some international staff members leaving Gaza through the Rafah crossing. We see little prospects for change in access through Rafah in the short term. British nationals intending to visit Gaza should be aware that we continue to advise against all travel to Gaza.</p>

 The Iranian authorities ban activity by human rights groups in Iran as a means to prevent the regular and abhorrent abuses by the state coming to light. We have called on the Iranian authorities to respect their international obligations including the right to freedom of association. We regularly raise concern over the human rights situation in Iran including individual cases, and hope that our doing so will encourage the Iranian authorities to show restraint towards those in Iran who seek to defend and promote human rights.</p>

 My officials have regular discussions with the US and the Palestinian Authority on Palestinian security sector development. It is important that we do so given our substantial political and financial commitment to developing the Palestinian Authority (PA) security forces.
