 Defra is working hard to arrest the spread of bovine TB. We are spending &#163;35 to &#163;40 million a year on a programme of public health protection measures, cattle testing, cattle controls and extensive research.
<P>

<a name="30708w01.html_para0">Last autumn we introduced a package of measures in response to industry calls, aimed at helping farmers under TB restriction and improving the diagnosis of the disease.

<P>

<a name="30708w01.html_para2">Discussions with stakeholders are also under way on a series of short-term policy options. These focus on cattle controls and improving the delivery of the TB programme. We will consult on these proposals later this year.

<a name="30708w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps the Government has taken to tackle climate change and improve air quality.  [124198]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The UK Climate Change Programme, published in 2000, sets out the policy framework for delivering the UK's Kyoto commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below base year levels by 2008&#150;12 and to move towards the domestic goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010.




<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 2003 : Column 670W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30708w01.html_para3">Policies in the Climate Change Programme include the following:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Climate Change Levy, which applies to energy used in the business and public sectors, is helping to fund measures to promote better energy efficiency in business and the public sector;
<P>
<BR>
Climate Change Agreements which allow energy intensive business users to receive 80 per cent. discount from the Climate Change Levy, in return for meeting challenging energy efficiency or carbon saving targets;
<P>
<BR>
the Carbon Trust, which is recycling about &#163;100 million of climate change levy receipts to boost the take-up of cost-effective, low-carbon technologies;
<P>
<BR>
a UK-wide Emissions Trading Scheme, with Government support of &#163;215 million over five years;
<P>
<BR>
targets to provide 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity from renewable sources of energy by 2010;
<P>
<BR>
the Energy Efficiency Commitment, which requires electricity and gas suppliers to help domestic customers to save energy and cut fuel bills;
<P>
<BR>
European Union voluntary agreements with car manufacturers to improve fuel efficiency by at least 25 per cent., backed up by changes to vehicle excise duty and company car taxation, and the 10 Year Plan for Transport.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30708w01.html_para4">Data for emissions of the basket of six greenhouse gases for 2001, submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in April 2003, show that emissions fell by 12.3 per cent. between the base year and 2001. Emissions of carbon dioxide for 2002 are provisionally estimated at 8 to 9 per cent. below 1990 levels.
<P>

<a name="30708w01.html_para5">Latest projections suggest we are well on course to meet our Kyoto commitment, a conclusion that is also supported by a recent independent assessment by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.
<P>

<a name="30708w01.html_para6">The Government's policies on improving air quality are set out in detail in the Air Quality Strategy for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, published in January 2000. The Strategy explains the measures that are in place to reduce emissions of harmful pollutants from all sectors, including road transport and industry. Copies are available via the Department's website at www.defra.gov.uk/environment/airquality.
<P>

<a name="30708w01.html_para7">Air quality in urban areas has improved significantly over the last decade, as a result largely of the progressively tighter European Union standards for new vehicles and fuels, and of the continuing reduction in total emissions from industry. The air quality headline indicator, published annually, shows that the average number of days of moderate or poor air quality in urban areas of the UK has reduced from 59 days in 1993 to 20 days in 2002 and, in rural areas, from 50 days in 1990 to 30 days in 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to ensure that pig farmers comply with Paragraph 4 of the Annex to Council Directive 91/630/EEC (as amended) to ensure that pigs are provided with straw or a similar natural material, rather than objects such as footballs and chains; and if she will make a statement.  [119497]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have fully implemented the provision on environmental enrichment from Commission Directive 2001/93/EC in the Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) (Amendment) Regulations 2003, which came into force on 14 February.
<P>

<a name="30708w02.html_para0">The Directive gives examples of materials suitable for environmental enrichment, rather than a prescriptive list. In terms of enrichment, the choice of material is 



<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 2003 : Column 673W</I><P>
secondary to whether it achieves the aim of enabling the pig to satisfy its need to manipulate and to investigate and thus help to reduce aggressive behaviour. Our new pig welfare code, which provides guidance on the Regulations, stresses that straw is an excellent material, but also gives advice to those farmers where straw is not a practical solution. Objects such as chains or footballs can only be used in conjunction with other manipulable materials or when changed on a weekly basis. When tail biting occurs the code requires that a full investigation is made and also recommends that the provision of environmental enrichment is reviewed and an action plan developed which should be incorporated into the farm animal health and welfare plan. This plan should in any case be revised annually by the farmer and his veterinary surgeon or other advisers.
<P>

<a name="30708w02.html_para1">It is the welfare of the pig that matters. If it is found that the material used does not allow the pigs to investigate and manipulate and the pigs are tail biting, then the farmer will need to find an alternative material.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w02.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The allocation for rights of way improvement is subsumed in the unhypothecated Environment Protection and Cultural Services block, a methodology that was agreed between the Government and the Local Government Association as is supported by all four political groups in the Association rather than through direct grants or ring-fenced support to local government. So we cannot say exactly how much funding has gone to local authorities to improve the rights of way network. I confirmed with the leaders of all four groups on the LGA their agreement that this was the right approach for this funding.

 With the exception of St. George's hospital medical school, which is funded directly by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), medical schools form part of larger institutions. The majority of the funding the HEFCE pays to institutions is given as a block grant and it is for individual institutions to decide how much funding to pass on to each of its academic departments, including medical schools. There are therefore no figures held centrally about the funding for medical schools, other than St. George's.

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has a duty to promote rail use and drive the strategic agenda for developing the national railway infrastructure, of which the Scottish network is an integral part. Although responsibility for infrastructure and safety are reserved to Westminster, the Scottish Executive is responsible for funding and specifying services in Scotland provided under the ScotRail franchise. The Executive, together with the SRA is working towards the re-letting of the current franchise, which ends in 2004.

 DFID, the World Health Organisation (WHO) and others agree that the most effective strategy to reduce maternal mortality is to ensure that all women are attended at birth by a skilled attendant backed by timely access to emergency obstetric care in the event of a life threatening complication. There is consensus on the content of antenatal, natal and post natal care 'packages' and these are considered cost-effective. The global failure to address the high burden of maternal mortality in developing countries does not reflect a lack of available cost-effective interventions but rather the lack of sustained political commitment to act on the scale necessary.

 The Ministry of Defence complies with Deduction from Earnings Requests in full, in all but exceptional cases. Such exceptions might include an appeal by the individual on the grounds of a change in circumstances, or where the deduction would breach the regulations on minimum rates of pay. Minimum rates of pay were introduced around 50 years ago as a result of experience in the second world war to ensure that Service families could meet essential financial commitments. The Army regulations allow for up to 50 per cent. deductions

from pay, where there are no other children or dependants. However, in circumstances where the soldier is legally married and living with his or her spouse, or where the soldier is widowed, divorced or separated and has care of the children, or the soldier does not have care of the children but is providing voluntary financial support, there is a limit of 25 per cent. deduction on pay. The amounts deducted are paid to the Child Support Agency for maintenance payments to be made.
<P>

<a name="30708w08.html_para17">Service personnel were excluded from the law relating to deduction of earnings orders when the Child Support (Collection and Enforcement) Regulations 1992 were drawn up as there was already provision for deductions from Service pay under Armed Forces' legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Government are aware of the strength of feeling among ex-Service personnel and other public servants whose pensions have been affected by periods of pay restraint. Successive Governments have concluded that it would not be affordable to increase the pensions of those affected to compensate for the effect of a pensions "trough". However, in view of the strength of concern on this issue and the fact that only indicative figures are available on the cost of remedying the position, my predecessor agreed that he would put work in hand to provide a more exact estimate of the cost of remedying the trough that occurred between 1976 and 1978. I can confirm that this work is under way. I expect this work to be completed before the summer recess and I will write to the hon. Member once the conclusions are available.

 The Services have detailed targets for manning levels and these reflect expectations of outflow (when personnel complete their engagements or leave for personal reasons) and recruitment plans. One way of measuring retention is by monitoring historical trends in Premature Voluntary Release (PVR) rates as a percentage of those leaving. Details of actual PVR rates over the last five years by individual Service are in the table.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make it his policy to include a sunset clause in all new legislation promoted by his Department unless a specific case can be made to exclude a sunset clause.  [120855]<P>

 Revised Regulatory Impact Assessment guidance, "Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment", was published on 28 January 2003. It advises policy officials to consider time limiting or sunsetting at an early stage of policy development and gives specific examples of where sunsetting may be appropriate.
<P>

<a name="30708w11.html_para1">Most Ministry of Defence legislation relates to the armed forces, and it would be unusual for sunset clauses to be appropriate. Nevertheless, the periodic Armed Forces Acts, which extend the life of the Army and Air Force Acts 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957, do so for only five years at a time and, thus, may be regarded as having a form of inbuilt sunsetting. However, where new primary or delegated legislation that may have an effect on business is introduced, the MOD will consider whether a sunset clause or other arrangements are appropriate on a case by case basis.

<P>
<a name="30708w14.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 The Halliday report 'Making Punishments Work' advocated maintaining the principle of equal treatment and that there should be no preferential treatment between men and women offenders in sentencing. However, this does not mean the same sentences are necessarily right for different groups who may be differently affected. It is legitimate for a court to take into account the impact of a sentence on other people&#151;including dependent children&#151;as one part of the overall picture. The report recommended the establishment of a body with the power to issue guidelines on sentencing issues. The Government accepted this recommendation by proposing the setting up of the Sentencing Guidelines Council, which forms part of the Criminal Justice Bill at present before Parliament. The sentencing of mothers with dependent children is likely to be an issue which the Council will consider as part of its overall work.

Since 1999 and for those measures in Title IV of the Treaty on the European Community subject to QMV where the UK has opted into their adoption, no measures have been adopted with the UK abstaining, outvoted or part of a blocking minority. All measures in Title VI of the Treaty on European Union are adopted by unanimity. Information for the years 1997&#150;99 is available only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many regulations originating from the EU have been implemented by the Department over each of the last five years.  [120839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w15.html_spnew0"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 EC Regulations are, in general, directly applicable in the member states without the need for further incorporation into national law. However, some Regulations may require UK measures to make them workable and enforceable.
<P>

<a name="30708w15.html_para0">Over the last five years, one Regulation has required such implementation by the Home Office: the Council Regulation concerning the establishment of 'Eurodac' for the comparison of fingerprints for the effective application of the Dublin Convention. The legislative changes required to implement the Eurodac Regulation were made in the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999, effective from 11 December 2000, by virtue of the Immigration and Asylum Act (Commencement No 8 and Transitional Provision) Order 2000. Implementation was completed when the centralised Eurodac fingerprint database became operational on 15 January 2003.

<a name="30708w15.html_spnew1"><B> Caroline Flint: </B>

<P>

<a name="30708w15.html_para2">When it comes into force it will provide that extradition requests from the United States will, like those from Council of Europe countries, not have to be accompanied by 'prima facie evidence'.
<P>

<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 2003 : Column 721W</I><P>
supported by 'prima facie evidence'. This must be evidence sufficient to warrant the trial of the arrested person if the extradition crime had taken place within the jurisdiction of the court of committal.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the human rights implications of proposals to allow extradition proceedings to occur without evidence submitted to a British court from the prosecuting foreign legal team.  [123756]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w15.html_spnew3"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 Since the United Kingdom ratified the European Convention on Extradition (ECE) in 1991, other countries which are also parties to the ECE, of whom there are now more than 40, have not had to submit 'prima facie' evidence to accompany their extradition requests.
<P>

<a name="30708w15.html_para4">We do not believe that this has human rights implications but the Extradition Bill, which is currently before Parliament, makes it clear that we can not extradite in any case where extradition would be incompatible with the Convention rights of the person whose extradition is sought.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w15.html_spnew4"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The UK's extradition relations with the United States are currently governed by the 1976 bilateral treaty (amended in 1986). We cannot speak for our European Union partners, but all have bilateral treaties with the USA.
<P>

<a name="30708w15.html_para5">The European Union has no extradition relations with the USA at present. However, the European Union and the USA signed bilateral mutual legal assistance and extradition treaties on 25 June 2003. These will come into force in the UK, once the EU and US agree to put them into force and the UK withdraws its declaration that it will not be bound by the agreements until it has completed its constitutional procedures. This declaration means that any necessary legislation will need to be in place before the agreements can be applied to the UK. The EU decision to bring the agreements into force, like the decision to sign, is subject to unanimity.
<P>

<a name="30708w15.html_para6">The EU/US extradition agreement has no significant impact on UK/US extradition relations, but, for example, ensures that all other member states have extradition relations with the USA based on dual criminality and a penalty threshold, rather than a list of offences.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what changes his Department has made to police disciplinary procedures in the last five years; and what representations he has received from chief constables on reforming police disciplinary procedures.  [122881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w16.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The current misconduct regulations were introduced on 1 April 1999. These are the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 and the Police (Conduct) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1999, which replaced the existing Police (Discipline) Regulations 1985 and the Police (Discipline) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1985. The new Regulations represent a change in emphasis from a discipline code of specific offences to a code of conduct against which an officer's behaviour can be assessed to see whether or not it matches up to the standards expected of a police officer.
<P>

<a name="30708w16.html_para6">Regulations and Guidance on police misconduct procedures are kept under review by the Police Personnel Procedures (PPP) Working Group, which was set up by, and is a sub-group of, the Police Advisory Board for England and Wales. All police interests are represented on the PPP Working Group, which includes a member of the Association of Chief Police Officers. Since the current misconduct regulations were introduced in April 1999 the following amendments have been made:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Greater London Authority Act 1999 (Consequential Amendments) (Police) Order 2000 (SI 2000/1549) removed references to the Assistant Commissioner from the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 and amended the Police (Conduct) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1999 consequential on the fact that the Home Secretary ceased to be the police authority for the Metropolitan Police.
<P>
<BR>
The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 (Consequential Amendments) (Police Ranks) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3888) inserted in the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 various references to chief superintendents, consequential on section 125 of the 2001 Act, and inserted in the Police (Conduct) (Senior Officers) Regulations 1999 a reference to a deputy chief constable, consequential on section 123 of the 2001 Act. Regulation 5(4) amended regulation 18(3) of the Police (Conduct) Regulations 1999 to provide that at a disciplinary hearing, the two officers who assist the presiding officer need not come from the same force as the officer concerned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w16.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what targets he has set for prisoner re-offending rates.  [124034]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w16.html_spnew5"><B> Paul Goggins </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 July 2003]:</i> The Home Office Public Service Agreement (published in the White Paper '2002 Spending Review, Public Service Agreements 2003&#150;2006' (Cm 5571, July 2002) set a target to reduce re-offending by five per cent for young offenders and for adults sentenced to imprisonment or sentenced to community sentences. Progress against this target is measured using reconviction rates, as set out in the 'SR2002 Public Service Agreement Technical Notes' (presented to Parliament in March 2003).
<P>

<a name="30708w16.html_para8">Progress against the proceeding Public Service Agreement Target 10, set in 2000, was reported in Home Office Online Report 16/02.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w16.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the prisoner re-offending rates were in each of the last five years.  [124036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w16.html_spnew6"><B> Paul Goggins </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 July 2003]:</i> Two-year 'un-adjusted' reconviction rates for prisoners discharged from custody are available for 1994 to 1998. These were 56 per cent. in 1994, 58 per cent. in 1995, 57 per cent. in 1996, 58 per cent. in 1997 and 59 per cent. in 1998. These rates are published in 'Prison Statistics-England and Wales 2001'.
<P>

<a name="30708w16.html_para9">Reconviction rates for offenders discharged from custody have also been published according to the requirements of the Governments Public Service Agreement (PSA) 10 target. These are adjusted to take out convictions for offences committed prior to discharge, giving a reconviction rate of 55.3 per cent. for the first quarter of 1999. The equivalent figures for the first quarter of 1997 and 1998 are 56.8 per cent. and 55.7 per cent. respectively.
<P>

<a name="30708w16.html_para10">Neither set of rates indicate trends in rates over time, as they make no allowance for changes in the characteristics and criminal histories of offenders given custodial sentences. To do this a predicted rate is used. Comparisons between the actual and predicted reconviction rates for 1999 show that the actual rate was 1.9 per cent. lower than predicted, equating to 3.3 per cent. fewer offenders reconvicted, as set out in the Home Office On Line Report 16/02.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w18.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what percentage of fines were unpaid in <i>(a)</i> magistrates courts and <i>(b)</i> Crown courts in (i) Chesham and Amersham and (ii) Buckinghamshire in 2002&#150;03; and if he will make a statement.  [123908]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs) have a responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed by both the magistrates courts and the Crown court. Debt collected includes not only fines but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders. It is not yet possible to separate out only fines from the total so the figures provided here include all the elements above.
<P>

<a name="30708w18.html_para0">Data are collected centrally at MCC level, rather than at court level. The payment rate for the Thames Valley MCC in 2002&#150;03, that is the percentage of the total amount collected over the amount imposed, was 69 per cent. On that basis, the percentage of fines unpaid was 31 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30708w18.html_para1">In addition, the Thames Valley MCC accounting system is unable to identify the percentage of fines unpaid in the Chesham and Amersham satellite magistrates court. Information from the Thames Valley MCC indicated that the payment rate in 2002&#150;03 for the Central Buckinghamshire Petty Session Area, which includes Amersham, was 65 per cent.

<a name="30708w18.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wiggin: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what percentage of UK citizens who live abroad participated in the last general election.  [123597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office estimates that there are around 15.5 million UK citizens living abroad, but not all of these will be eligible to register to vote as overseas electors. In February 2001, 11,496 UK citizens were registered to vote as overseas electors. However, no central record is kept on which of those electors chose to vote in the general election that followed in June that year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Government have received many representations on the Convention's proposals. We look forward to receiving many more once the final text of the Convention's draft is published in the next few days. More QMV is essential to push through our solutions to Europe-wide problems in key areas, such as asylum and immigration. But there are areas on which we would not be prepared to move from unanimity. We would not agree to any changes on foreign policy, defence, taxation or social security which threatened the national interest.

<P>
15. <a name="30708w18.html_wqn6"><B> Sir Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the latest situation in Zimbabwe.  [123880]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The political and economic situation in Zimbabwe remains serious. The state continues to use violence and intimidation against its opponents. Formal dialogue between the ruling ZANU (PF) and opposition MDC has not started. The leader of the opposition, Morgan Tsvangirai, now faces two treason charges. The economy continues to spiral downwards. The World Food Programme estimates that nearly half the population, 5.5 million Zimbabweans, will depend on food aid this year.
<P>

<a name="30708w18.html_para4">Responsibility for the present state of Zimbabwe lies squarely with its present Government. Together with the rest of the international community, we will continue to provide humanitarian relief, will work to sustain Mugabe's isolation and highlight his abuses of fundamental human rights and will continue to promote a prosperous and democratic future for the people of Zimbabwe.

<P>
16. <a name="30708w18.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Russell Brown: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the effect of the situation in Zimbabwe on the rest of southern Africa.  [123881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The situation in Zimbabwe continues to have a negative impact on other countries in southern Africa. The crisis there is damaging regional economies and has adversely affected their interest rates, inflation, foreign direct investment and tourism. A study by the Zimbabwe Research Initiative in May estimated the total cost to the combined Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries to have been at least US$1.88 billion at the end of 2002. Zimbabwe's neighbours are also suffering damage to local production from the influx of cheap Zimbabwean goods, unpaid Zimbabwean debts, an increase in largely unskilled migrants, and the cross border spread of foot and mouth disease.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w18.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Consul-General's house failed to match the key performance indicators by which we judge whether to retain estate assets, particularly because it was significantly overscale.

 The situation in Burma is of grave concern to this Government. We have repeatedly called on the Burmese authorities to release immediately Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and other National League for Democracy members detained on or since 30 May 2003. The regimes responses to events so far have been unacceptable. The UK will ensure that pressure is maintained and increased on the Burmese regime to move irreversibly towards democracy and respect for human rights.

 We are concerned that Burma is to take over the presidency of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) in 2006. We take advantage of our regular bilateral and multilateral contacts with all ASEAN nations to discuss Burma related issues, most recently on 17 June 2003 at the ASEAN Regional Forum. We welcome the recent joint statement from the ASEAN Foreign Ministers, which looked forward to the early lifting of restrictions placed on Aung San Suu Kyi. We hope that this will lead to more action on behalf of ASEAN members in the future. We believe that the ASEAN nations have an important role to play in encouraging substantive change in Burma.

 Following Cyprus' accession, the UK's Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) will remain outside the EU, with technical adjustments to ensure the continued smooth functioning of the relationship between Cyprus and the SBAs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The European Commission has stated repeatedly that there is no incompatibility of the UN proposals with the acquis communautaires. Commission officials worked in close co-ordination with the UN team over the drafting of the UN plan. The EU has affirmed on a number of occasions, most recently at Thessaloniki European Council, that it will accommodate the terms of a settlement, in line with the principles on which the EU is founded.
<P>

<a name="30708w19.html_para1">Furthermore, a comprehensive settlement on the basis of the UN plan, before May 2004, would allow a re-united island to be a member of the EU. This is the EU's express and strong preference.

 We believe the UN plan for a comprehensive, just and lasting settlement in Cyprus to be fair and balanced, including on matters of fiscal and financial arrangements. The proposed Greek Cypriot state is currently the richer of the two constituent states that would make up the United Cyprus Republic. This would inevitably lead to some disparity of contributions, as in any democratic state.

 Upon crossing the Green Line, Greek Cypriots travelling north are required to show their passports to the Turkish Cypriot authorities. Their details are logged and checked on return. They are permitted to bring their cars with them, provided they take out Turkish Cypriot third party insurance, and they are allowed to stay for up to three nights in hotels, but not in private accommodation.
<P>

<a name="30708w19.html_para2">Turkish Cypriots travelling south are required to show exit visas north of the Green Line, and then a Republic of Cyprus passport or ID card, or a "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" ID card (in which case their details are logged), when they cross. They are allowed to bring their cars for a period of up to 48 hours.
<P>

<a name="30708w19.html_para3">The Cyprus Government does not permit Turkish citizens to cross from the north to the south, nor does it permit any person who has entered the island of Cyprus through a port of entry in the north to cross to the south.

 The latest figures available record that, as of 21 May, 292,017 Greek Cypriots had crossed to the north, and 142,253 Turkish Cypriots had crossed to the south. Some of these may be repeat visits. Reports continue of thousands of Cypriots crossing each way every week, particularly at weekends.

<P>
<P><I>8 Jul 2003 : Column 738W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30708w19.html_para6">The package includes 9 million euros of financial assistance to boost economic development, through developing infrastructure in the north, introducing grant schemes for Small and Medium Enterprises and conducting feasibility studies on the economic integration of the north of Cyprus into the EU, after a political settlement. The package further includes 3 million euros to bring the north closer to the EU, through information activities on the EU and the acquis. Finally, the package includes proposals on trade, in particular that the Turkish Cypriot Chamber of Commerce could be given the authority to issue movement certificates for goods going from the north of Cyprus to the south.
<P>

 On 30 April the Cyprus Government released a Memorandum on Government Policy vis-&#224;-vis the Turkish Cypriots, detailing proposed measures designed to give the Turkish Cypriots, in the absence of a settlement and where possible, the same rights as those enjoyed by the Greek Cypriots.
<P>

<a name="30708w19.html_para8">These proposed measures include the establishment of an Office of Turkish Cypriot Affairs; the facilitation of the issuing of travel documents, ID cards and birth certificates by the Republic of Cyprus to Turkish Cypriots; the facilitation of the employment of Turkish Cypriots; measures to enable goods for personal consumption to be carried from the north to the south; the facilitation of freedom of movement from the north to the south; the introduction of direct dialling between the south, the north and Turkey; measures regarding Turkish Cypriots missing from the 1960s and 1970s; the participation of Turkish Cypriots in elections for local authorities in the south; measures regarding the teaching of Turkish to Greek Cypriots, and Greek to Turkish Cypriots; the provision of free medical treatment to Turkish Cypriots in the south when referred by a doctor in the north; and various measures regarding cultural events and activities.

 The elections in the north of Cyprus come at a critical time for the future of Cyprus and the prospects for a permanent and comprehensive settlement.

 Our general advice to prospective buyers, found on the FCO's website and given in response to telephone queries, is that non-recognition of the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus", and the possibility of a future political settlement, could have implications for those considering buying property in the north. They should appraise themselves fully of the situation and seek legal advice.

 In line with commitments made to the Republic of Cyprus in the 1960 Treaty of establishment, provided they have entered the island of Cyprus through an internationally recognised port of entry, British nationals have freedom of access and communication to and through the Eastern Sovereign Base Areas (ESBA) from the north. No action is being or will be taken to prevent them from doing so. However, any person who has entered the island of Cyprus through an unrecognised port of entry is considered to be an illegal immigrant by the Government of the Republic of Cyprus. It has been Government policy since 1974 to respect the Republic of Cyprus' immigration policy. The relaxing of restrictions on freedom of movement across the Green Line has required SBA authorities to check and monitor people and vehicles entering and leaving the ESBA. Therefore, some people who might have previously crossed in contravention of SBA law are now no longer able to do so.

<P>
<a name="30708w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Animal welfare issues have long been included among the EU's WTO negotiating priorities. At Doha, the EU was successful in ensuring that the issue of farm animal welfare could be taken into account as part of the current Agreement on Agriculture negotiations.
<P>

<a name="30708w20.html_para10">Reaching agreement on changes to WTO rules explicitly to allow countries to limit imports of goods based only on the way in which a product was made (for instance whether the production method took account of animal welfare standards) remains extremely difficult. Many WTO members, developing countries in particular, are highly suspicious of the EU's motives and fear that animal welfare production standards will be used as an excuse for covert protectionism. The EU continues to raise this issue in all relevant WTO for in order to try and build trust and understanding for the EU's position. We see discussions on farm animal welfare in the current Doha trade round as a helpful step to building trust and understanding for the EU's position on broader animal welfare standards.

<a name="30708w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises ("the Guidelines") are recommendations addressed by adhering countries to multi-national enterprises. They represent a framework of principles of good conduct for multi-national companies in their business activities, designed to help ensure that they act in harmony with the policies of the countries in which they operate and that they consider the views of other stakeholders (for example in respect of social and environmental issues). The Guidelines aim to promote and develop a sustainable approach to business conduct and to build an atmosphere of confidence and predictability between business, labour, governments and society as a whole. It is intended that companies use the Guidelines as a benchmark when developing their own codes of conduct and should be seen as a minimum required standard of behaviour. Further information can be obtained from www.oecd.org

It advises that temporary allotment sites of more than 30-years-old could be re-designated to statutory status on a voluntary basis, however, such sites will not automatically be converted to statutory status.

 The Government's objectives on public spaces are set out in "Living Places: Cleaner, Safer, Greener" (October 2002). The document contains our proposals for improving the quality of urban green spaces including allotments.

 The "English Allotments Survey 1997", commissioned by the former Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, provides estimates of the numbers of allotment plots in England for four specific years. The survey estimates that in 1970, there were 532,964 plots; in 1977, 497,793 plots; in 1978, 479,301 plots; and in 1996, 296,923 plots. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has recently announced plans to commission a full update of the English Allotments Survey this year. Disposal of statutory allotments are also administered and monitored by the Government Offices for the regions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30708w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The cost of a referendum will depend on the population of the region concerned, whether there is a traditional ballot vote or an all-postal vote, whether a poll is combined with, for example, local authority elections on the same day and decisions taken by the Electoral Commission on, for example, financial support for the designated "yes" and "no" campaigns. It is therefore too early to make a firm estimate of the costs.
<P>

<a name="30708w22.html_para2">Assuming a projected cost of &#163;1 per elector, the total cost of a regional referendum would be around &#163;2 million in the north-east, &#163;5 million in the north-west and &#163;4 million in Yorkshire and the Humber.

 The trial at Glasgow has a broader scope than simply a test of a new disability living allowance claim form. It aims to test a shortened claim form that is personalised to the needs of the customer and a revised process for determining claims which is supported by a new prototype IT system. This enables customers to receive fuller information about the basis of the decisions made. The full test started in January of this year and the evaluation work is scheduled to be complete by September 2003. Once this work has been finalised, we will ensure that a copy of the findings are placed in the Library.

 We are ensuring that the benefit system encourages and promotes work where possible.

During the consultation on the Green Paper 'Pathways to Work' (CM 5690) we received a number of comments on the operation of these rules.

 The Government wants all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement. The Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG), introduced in April 1999, has boosted the income of the poorest pensioners. Since April 2003 a single pensioner is nearly &#163;18 a week better off in real terms than in 1997 from the MIG rises. A pensioner couple is nearly &#163;28 a week better off. We also want everyone who is entitled

Pensioner households entitled to Pension Credit will be &#163;400 a year better off on average. Following the introduction of Pension Credit the average pensioner household will be over &#163;1,250 a year better off than in 1997 due to the Governments personal tax and benefit changes. To ensure maximum take up of Pension Credit we are writing to pensioner households to explain Pension Credit and invite applications. In addition around 1.8 million people in receipt of the Minimum Income Guarantee have been advised they will be transferred automatically to Pension Credit.

<a name="30708w25.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will estimate the number of companies which, under the regulations introduced on 8 October 2001, <i>(a)</i> are obliged to provide and <i>(b)</i> have so far failed to offer access to a stakeholder scheme; and what plans he has to ensure that employers who have not complied with the requirement to offer a stakeholder scheme do so.  [123323]<P>

 We estimate that around 350,000 employers are required to provide their staff with access to a stakeholder pension scheme. Latest data from the Association of British Insurers show that 344,983 employers had designated a stakeholder pension scheme by the end of March 2003. This indicates a compliance rate in excess of 90 per cent.

<a name="30708w25.html_para8">The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (OPRA) is responsible for regulating compliance with the workplace access requirements for stakeholder pension schemes. OPRA follows up all reports to it of non-compliance and will take action where compliance has not been achieved. OPRA also takes action to seek out non-compliance through surveys of employers, and by following up any employers that it knows, through its general pension duties, have closed down their company scheme and may therefore become required to offer staff access to a stakeholder pension scheme.

<P>
<a name="30708w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive have not launched a new code of conduct on stress at work. On 16 June 2003, they published draft management standards on work related stress seeking feedback to inform their development. They are currently being piloted and the final standards will be published after consultation. The standards will be a voluntary yardstick by which employers can measure how well they are managing stress in the workplace. Information collected during the consultation phase will be used to inform development of the Regulatory Impact Assessment.

 <i>[holding answer 7 July 2003]:</i> High quality, systematic review of the evidence relating to condom effectiveness has shown that consistent use of condoms is highly effective in preventing transmission of HIV <sup>1</sup> . On the strength of this evidence we have not felt it necessary to commission additional research. We do recognise, however, that factors such as condom failure mean that condoms do not provide 100 per cent. protection from infection, but when used correctly, they can substantially reduce the risk. Advice on the effective use of condoms is, therefore, provided through our national sexual health promotion and HIV prevention activities.

<P>
<a name="30708w27.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency (FSA)'s monitoring programme to detect marine biotoxins in shellfish, including cockles, exists to protect public health. The toxins which are tested have the potential to cause illness, which in some cases may be serious or life-threatening. The DSP test is approved as the standard reference method and is widely used in Europe.
<P>

<a name="30708w27.html_para4">Temporary Prohibition Orders (TPOs), are placed on beds where tests for shellfish biotoxins are positive. Affected areas remain closed until two consecutive negative test results taken a week apart are observed.
<P>

<a name="30708w27.html_para5">Atypical results in tests for DSP have been observed in some samples of cockles and mussels in England, Wales and Northern Ireland since 2001. The FSA has put in place a programme of research work to investigate the cause of the atypical response to the DSP test and to assess its implications for human health. In the meantime, on the basis that the affected shellfish produce neurological symptoms that lead to death in mice within a few minutes, the FSA considers that the shellfish could be harmful and recommends the placing of TPOs on the affected beds in line with standard practice for known biotoxins. The FSA is keeping this policy under review and will use findings from the research work to determine whether its existing policy should be maintained. It expects most of the research to be completed later this summer.
<P>

<a name="30708w27.html_para6">The majority of harvesting areas are open most of the time. In order to reduce the impact of the temporary cockle-bed closures on fishermen, while still protecting public health, the FSA has divided harvesting areas into zones, so that harvesting can continue from beds where tests results are negative.

 A high quality, systematic review of the evidence relating to condom effectiveness has shown that consistent use of condoms is highly effective in preventing pregnancy and transmission of many sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, gonorrhoea and chlamydia <sup>1</sup> .

As a result the promotion of condom usage is strongly encouraged as a risk reduction strategy through the Department of Health's sexual health promotion activities.

<a name="30708w28.html_para0">Children born with cystic fibrosis do not have a normal life expectancy, though it is improving all the time.

<a name="30708w28.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The information requested is not collected centrally. Primary care trusts (PCTs) receive unified allocations to cover the costs of hospital and community health services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent research his Department has undertaken into the numbers of children and young people who smoke; what plans he has to reduce these numbers; and if he will make a statement.  [123054]<P>

<P>
<a name="30708w30.html_spnew9"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The 1998 White Paper, "Smoking Kills", set a target to reduce smoking among 11&#150;15 year olds from 13 per cent. in 1996 to 9 per cent. by 2010, with a fall to 11 per cent. by 2005.
<P>

<a name="30708w30.html_para12">Among 11&#150;15 year olds, smoking prevalence has remained unchanged since 2000 at 10 per cent. and we are on course to meet our target for reducing smoking. Within the adult group&#151;16&#150;19 year olds, data (collected from a different source) show that for young men figures increased in 1998. For young women, there has been a marked improvement in 2000. The figures indicate an overall fall in prevalence in England. Measures the Government is taking to tackle teenage smoking are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a comprehensive ban on advertising, promotion and sponsorship of tobacco products: The cigarettes smoked most by children are also those most heavily advertised;
<P>
<BR>
tough enforcement on under-age sales: on 13 September 2000 the Government launched an Enforcement Protocol with local authorities to ensure that the existing legislation on under-age sales is properly enforced;
<P>
<BR>
the Government supports proof of age card schemes which protect shopkeepers and children alike;
<P>
<BR>
tougher new restrictions on siting of cigarette vending machines;
<P>
<BR>
an extensive health education campaign aimed at smokers and non-smokers;
<P>
<BR>
fiscal policy: the high price of cigarettes is a particular disincentive for young people.

1. Up until 2000, data on the prevalence on smoking from the General Household Survey were only available every two years.<P>

2. Data for 1998 onwards were weighted to compensate for under-representation of people in some groups: earlier figures were based on unweighted data, and are not therefore directly comparable.<P>

3. Respondents who answered "yes" to the question "Do you smoke cigarettes at all nowadays?"<P>

<P>
<a name="30708w31.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The decision as to whether a particular product is a medicinal product is made by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, using the definition of that term in Article 1 of Directive 2001/83, relevant legal precedent and its own published guidance. Products, which are presented to the consumer for treating or preventing disease, would be classified as medicinal products. Sunburn is an adverse medical condition and direct or implied product claims to treat or prevent sunburn would bring the product within the definition of a medicinal product, regardless of the product's level of sun protection factor. Products that modify physiological function could also be classified as medicinal products.
<P>

<a name="30708w31.html_para0">Certain creams or lotions with a sun protection factor of 15 or above, which are not licensed or marketed as medicines, may be assessed by the Advisory Committee on Borderline Substances (ACBS) as being regarded as drugs for the management of specific conditions. Products so recommended by the ACBS may be prescribed under the National Health Service.

<P>

<a name="30708w31.html_para1">The safety assessment of genetically modified (GM) food is undertaken by independent scientists on a case by case basis in accordance with the European Commission guidelines that accompany the EC Novel Foods Regulation (EC/258/97). Regulation 1852/2001 requires the European Commission to publish the data, which supports each GM food application made under EC 258/97.
<P>

<a name="30708w31.html_para2">Several organisations (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and the Food and Agriculture Organisations of the United Nations), including the World Health Organisation have agreed that the assessment procedure for GM foods requires an integrated and stepwise, case-by-case approach.

<a name="30708w31.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA) advises my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, on issues about xenotransplantation (transplantation of live animal organs and cells into humans). The Department of Health commissioned a series of three reviews on different aspects of xenotransplantation on behalf of the UKXIRA between 1999 and 2001. The first two&#151;on infection and on physiology&#151;were published 2001 and 2002. A third review, on the legal and ethical aspects of xenotransplantation, was commissioned from Professor Sheila McLean, of the University of Glasgow, who was also a member of the UKXIRA from 1997 to 2002.
<P>

<a name="30708w31.html_para3">The UKXIRA has considered the review and concluded that it made some useful discussion points and that the summary of the research papers should be placed on the UKXIRA website. While there are no plans to publish Professor McLean's whole review as a Department of Health/UKXIRA document, Professor McLean is free to publish it if she wishes.
