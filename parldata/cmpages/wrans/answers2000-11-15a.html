 <i>[holding answer 6 November 2000]:</i> In June this year, we launched the THINK! road safety publicity campaign which brings together the range of road safety messages for all road users. The total publicity budget for THINK! for the current financial year is &#163;9 million.
<P>

<a name="01115w01.html_para0">Drinking and driving is a year-round issue, and is one of the issues we tackle as part of the THINK! campaign advertising, on television, on radio and in other media.
<P>

<a name="01115w01.html_para1">However, we shall be focusing again on the drink-drive issue in the run-up to Christmas and the new year, and we have set aside around &#163;1.9 million for this. Television advertising will run from 27 November, supported by radio advertising and poster advertising. In addition we are producing display materials for use by the police and road safety officers around the country in support of their own campaigns.
<P>

<a name="01115w01.html_para2">We have received no formal representations about previous advertising campaigns.

<a name="01115w01.html_para4">The Government do not set specific targets for the performance of London Underground's contractors. Their performance is, however, reflected in the targets set for London Underground itself.
<P>

<a name="01115w01.html_para5">In addition to the above targets, the 10-Year Plan includes a target to cut journey times on London Underground services by increasing capacity and reducing delays. Specific targets will be agreed with the Mayor after the Public Private Partnership has been established.

<P>
<a name="01115w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The latest figures available from the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory show that in 1998 the total UK emissions of SO <sub>2</sub>  and NOx were as 1,615 and 1,753 kilotonnes respectively. Between 1994-98 emissions of SO <sub>2</sub>  have been reduced by 56 per cent. and of NOx by 76 per cent. Emissions will continue to reduce under the Environment Agency's ongoing regulation of sulphur emissions and, in the longer term, the revised EC Large Combustion Plant Directive and the proposed National Emission Ceilings Directive, which from 2010 will set annual ceilings of 585 and 1,167 kilotonne for SO <sub>2</sub>  and NOx respectively. A list of large power stations <sup>1</sup> , that continue to emit one or both of these substances, is listed.

 The Road Safety Strategy outlines our commitment to a rural road hierarchy, one result of which would be 30mph speed limits in villages.

The proposal was the subject of a Notice of Proposed Development submitted to Rushmoor Borough Council by the Ministry of Defence. As a competent authority under the Conservation (Natural Habitats, etc.) Regulations 1994, the Ministry of Defence are required to carry out an appropriate assessment of the implications of the proposed works on the Thames Basin Heaths potential SPA and I understand they are undertaking such an assessment.

 The Health and Safety Executive do not license either type of contractor. The duty for ensuring the competence of a contractor in the railway industry lies with the holder of the accepted safety case. The holders of safety cases for the railway industry are (in summary) Railtrack, Railtrack's main contractors, the freight and passenger train operators and London Underground.

<P>
<a name="01115w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 November 2000]:</i> Ultra-low sulphur petrol will have a direct benefit in reducing traffic related air pollutants. It will also facilitate the introduction of new fuel-efficient petrol engine technology. This emerging technology holds the promise of significant reductions in CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions from the vehicle fleet and will help ensure delivery of the voluntary agreements with the car manufacturers to improve new car fuel efficiency by 25 per cent. by 2008.
<P>

<a name="01115w03.html_para0">The reduction of sulphur content of petrol from a maximum of 150 ppm to 50 ppm may result in increased energy consumption in oil refineries and hence CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions, due to the additional processing required. The extent to which this is the case is dependent on the configuration of each individual refinery, and on other factors such as processing lower sulphur crude. The 



<P>
<P><I>15 Nov 2000 : Column: 659W</I><P>
overall effect is, in the short term, likely to be an increase of less than 2 per cent. in the CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions from refineries.
<P>

<a name="01115w03.html_para1">Ultra-low sulphur petrol will become mandatory throughout the EU from 2005 and the Government's CO <sub>2</sub>  emission projections for 2010 already reflect the impact on refinery emissions of a reduction of sulphur levels in petrol.
<P>

<a name="01115w03.html_para2">As more vehicles are introduced onto the market, fuel efficiency improvement is expected to be larger than increases in refinery CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on how many occasions in each year since 1990 his Department received complaints from service personnel or their families of medical negligence by military medical staff, stating in each case <i>(a)</i> whether the complaint was upheld by his Department in the first instance, <i>(b)</i> whether the complaint was upheld after recourse to legal proceedings and <i>(c)</i> how much compensation was paid; and if he will make a statement.

 A central record of complaints from service personnel and their families alleging medical negligence is kept only of those cases where compensation is being sought. However, prior to 1996-97 such claims were not recorded separately from other common law claims for compensation. The vast majority of the claims detailed in the table have been the subject of legal proceedings, but this does not necessarily mean that they were all heard in court. The majority of claims are settled amicably on a legal liability basis without recourse to the courts. The payment of compensation does not necessarily occur in the financial year that the claim was received.

 Eurofighter will be a multi-role aircraft, able to carry both air-to-air and air-to-ground weaponry. Its priority role, however, remains air-to-air. With Tornado GR4 and Harriers continuing in-service for many years, there is less immediate need to arm Eurofighter for its air-to-ground role at its entry into service. Existing plans progressively to enhance Eurofighter's capability in both air-to-air and air-to-ground roles, from its entry into service onwards, remain unchanged.

 I am satisfied that the programme of reforms of the electricity market set out in the Government's 1998 White Paper is now substantially complete. I am therefore lifting the stricter consents policy on gas powered stations with immediate effect.
<P>

<a name="01115w06.html_para1">We considered the stricter gas consents policy necessary as it provided a breathing space for existing coal fired power stations until distortions in the electricity market were ironed out.
<P>

<a name="01115w06.html_para2">I recognise that the ending of the stricter gas consents policy will create a new market and new challenges for coal which is why we are putting in place an aid scheme for the industry which this morning has been approved by the European Commission.
<P>

<a name="01115w06.html_para3">I am aware that the end of the stricter gas consents policy is eagerly awaited by industry. New power stations are important drivers of economic growth both nationally and regionally:

<a name="01115w06.html_para9">It is important developers considering new power station proposals explore the opportunities to use combined heat and power (CHP). CHP can make a major contribution to reducing emissions as well as bringing other benefits such as increased efficiency. We will be publishing guidance to developers on this matter soon.

<a name="01115w06.html_para11">The Government's policy remains that it is for the coal industry to find its own place in a competitive energy market. However it is the task of Government to help industry through a period of change. That is why we are introducing a coal subsidy scheme. This will provide the industry with transitional funding so that it is able to respond to the challenges of the new market conditions that arise from the lifting of the stricter gas consents policy.

 The Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market deals with Community-wide intellectual property rights.

This role is likely to expand following adoption of a Community Regulation which will create Community- wide rights for industrial designs. It is self-financing from fees paid by businesses who use the system, and expects to receive some 60,000 applications for Community trade marks this year. The Office began its work on 1 September 1994 in Alicante, Spain.

<a name="01115w07.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2000]:</i> ADSL service suppliers are expected to specify a number of quality/performance parameters as part of their sales literature. It is likely that the suppliers will specify contention ratio as one of the quality parameters within a service contract and they will be commercially obligated to fulfil their contractual requirements concerning quality of service. Competition in supply of ADSL services will enable customers to select their preferred ADSL supplier based on quality and price. It is therefore for market forces to determine which services consumers are likely to demand and what price consumers are willing to pay for such services based on service quality information.

 <i>[holding answer 10 November 2000]:</i> Milk Marque and the National Farmers Union started judicial review proceedings last year.

When the ECJ has given its views the proceedings in the High court can continue. This legal process is unlikely to be quick.

 <i>[holding answer 10 November 2000]:</i> The Government have not provided any funding to TrustUK, which is an organisation led by the private sector. The Government do however strongly support TrustUK; the Minister for Small Business and E-commerce took part in its launch in July. Officials of the Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of Fair Trading have contributed to the development of TrustUK and have taken part in its process of approving codes of practice for e-commerce.

 DfEE guidance Circular number 4/95 sets out the statutory position on drug education in schools and was supplemented by the guidance "Protecting Young People" (1998) which gives detailed advice to identify what works in drug education and how best to take that forward effectively. To further support schools in the dissemination of effective drug education DfEE in partnership with the Department of Health commissioned the Standing Conference On Drug Abuse (SCODA) to product further guidance for schools, the three "R's", "the right approach", "the right response" and "the right choice". DfEE has also made funding available in partnership with the charity DrugScope to identify, develop , promote and disseminate good practice in drug and alcohol education and prevention programmes for young people, parents and professionals in schools and in informal settings. DfEE will continue to fund the dissemination of guidance and support materials.

<a name="01115w08.html_para0">Spending on drug education will rise from &#163;7.5 million this year to &#163;17.5 million in 2003-04 (a 133 per cent. increase). This funding is available to all LEAs through the Standards Fund. It will help teachers deliver a drug education programme tailor-made to the needs of all young people which equips them with the knowledge to recognise the dangers of drug misuse and make informed choices. It will also fund drug advisers to work directly with schools, training costs of the Connexions personal advisers for 13-19-year-olds and ensure that key partners are engaged in developing drug education programmes relevant to the needs of the local community.

<a name="01115w08.html_para1">We have now established a solid base for drug education in schools. A recent Ofsted survey (July 2000) showed 93 per cent. of secondary and 75 per cent. primary schools now had their own anti-drug policies.

 The Prison Service has developed a safer cell design, which provides protection for those at risk of self-harm. Since 1996, a total of 185 cells have been installed to this "improved cell" standard. 1,088 cells in the new prisons at Forest Bank and Ashfield--Design, Construction, Management and Finance (DCMF) prisons--reflect aspects of the new design requirements.

But the Prison Service has confirmed its intention to incorporate the safer cell designed features into some or all of the cells in new houseblocks being built in establishments. Two new DCMF prisons under construction at Dovegate and Rye Hill will provide 1,353 cells reflecting aspects of the new design requirement.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when the Prison Service Health Care Department will publish the 1997-98 annual report.  [137805]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01115w12.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service Director of Health Care's Annual Report 1997-98 was published early in 1999. I am arranging for copies of the report to be placed in the Library.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01115w12.html_wqn17"><B> Jackie Ballard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many prisoners hanged themselves in 1999;  [137801]
<P>
<UL>(2) what operational lessons have been learned, and what changes have been made, following the deaths in HMP Leicester in December 1999; and if he will make a statement;  [137721]
<P>
(3) how many prisoners suffered permanent damage as a result of an attempted suicide in 1999;  [137802]
<P>
(4) what was the elapsed time between estimated time of death and discovery of the body for each prisoner who committed suicide in 1998 and 1999.  [137800]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01115w12.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 86 of the 91 self-inflicted deaths in custody in 1999 were by hanging. There is no reliable information about attempted suicides as at present no distinction is made between forms of self-harm. Long term or permanent physical or psychological damage can result from a variety of forms of self-harm, including substance abuse.
<P>

<a name="01115w12.html_para8">There were 173 self-inflicted deaths in 1998 and 1999, and full information about the timing of these deaths in relation to the discovery of the bodies could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. Of 40--the first 20 in both years--cases examined, 22 inquest reports contain no record of estimated time of death. Of the remainder, nine deaths are estimated to have occurred between eight minutes and six hours 25 minutes before discovery of the body and nine deaths between 15 minutes and 78 days afterwards.
<P>

<a name="01115w12.html_para9">There have been six self-inflicted deaths in Leicester prison in the last year, including two in December 1999. Internal inquiries are complete in respect of five of the six and have identified no failures of basic procedures or apparent links between the six deaths. Five Coroners' inquests are awaited. Since January 2000, the prison's care suite has been refurbished, is permanently manned and in regular use. Two crisis suites are being introduced. Leicester's good and active Listener scheme has been expanded. Improved accommodation will be provided for new receptions.




<P>
<P><I>15 Nov 2000 : Column: 696W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01115w12.html_para10">The continuing rise in prisoner suicides, particularly in local prisons like Leicester, has prompted a major review of the Prison Service's work on suicide prevention. There will be a focus on local prisons like Leicester because they have high proportions of unconvicted prisoners and large throughputs and disproportionate numbers of their populations at the most risk of suicide or self-harm.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many women prisoners applied for a place in a mother and baby unit in <i>(a)</i> 1998 and <i>(b)</i> 1999 during the reception procedure.  [137809]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01115w12.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is not the practice in any of the female prisons for a woman to make an application for a place on a mother and baby unit during the reception procedure. The Prison Service Order to Governors on the "Management of Mother and Baby Units and the Application Process" was published in February. This requires all women's prisons, as part of the reception process, to identify all eligible women and provide them with the prisoners' handbook "All About Mother and Baby Units" so that they can apply as soon as possible after the reception process. The order also required all women's prisons to appoint a named liaison officer, to be responsible for ensuring that all women, sentenced or unsentenced, who are pregnant or have a child under 18 months, are identified and informed of the arrangements for applying for a place on a mother and baby unit. All women's prisons now have a named liaison officer.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many women have given birth while held in HMP Brockhill in the last five years; and if he will make a statement.  [137806]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01115w12.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Brockhill prison we re-roled to a female prison in 1997. Since then, six women have given birth while held in the prison. Five of these were at the Alexandra Hospital, Redditch, and one this year within the prison.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement regarding the young woman who gave birth inside New Hall prison this summer.  [137808]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01115w12.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 To date, three births have taken place within New Hall prison this year. These happened in July, August and October. However, in all three cases, staff were only alerted when labour was at a very advanced stage. Therefore, there was not enough time to transfer the women to hospital.

initiatives the Syndicate has developed to combat service station forecourt crimes, including the theft of petrol. The Syndicate aims to share information among its members and work with other partners to encourage the spread of best practice.
<P>

<a name="01115w13.html_para0">One such initiative is the establishment of 'Forecourt Watch' schemes in several areas of the country. These schemes, operated in conjunction with the local police, provide service stations with an early warning system of vehicles and individuals involved with crime on forecourts. When a crime is committed local petrol retailers immediately report the incident to the local police, who transmit warnings via a communications system such as 'Ringmaster'. A number of other schemes are currently being developed.

 Data are available on a sample of 1,324 offenders convicted of possession of cannabis in 1998. The following table shows whether these offenders have been reconvicted of any recordable offence at any time. For those offenders originally convicted in the first half of 1998, the table also presents whether they have been reconvicted of any recordable offence within two years of the original offence. A distinction is made between offences where possession of cannabis was the principal original offence, and where it was a secondary offence.

 Statistics held centrally do not distinguish the relationship between an offender and the victim of the crime. It is therefore not possible to tell from those data what sentences offenders who commit domestic violence offences receive or what effect those sentences have. Projects under the Crime Reduction Programme's violence against women initiative, and earlier research, looks at different aspects of domestic violence, including criminal remedies. This work focuses on effective interventions rather than individual sentences. Relevant information is on the Home Office's domestic violence website: www.homeoffice.gov.uk/domesticviolence/index.htm. The probation service Pathfinder initiative is currently looking at perpetrator programmes run by the service for those put under its supervision, to see what works for wider adoption.

 The Government are well aware of the links between domestic violence and child abuse. These have already been documented by a number of research studies. A useful guide is contained in "Making an Impact: children and domestic violence: a training and resource pack". This document prepared by the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC), Barnardo's and the University of Bristol was published by the University of Bristol in 1998. The Government's own publication "Working Together to Safeguard Children"--a guide to inter-agency working to safeguard and promote the welfare of children, makes clear that everyone working with women and children should be alert to the frequent inter-relationship between domestic violence and the abuse and neglect of children. It also notes that domestic violence in itself is likely to have a damaging effect on children's health and development.

<a name="01115w16.html_para0">The Corpus Juris proposals as a whole have not been discussed in any meeting of the Council of the European Union (EU). A proposal by the Commission concerning the creation of a European Public Prosecutor has been discussed briefly in the Inter-governmental Conference (IGC) but the United Kingdom, as well as the majority of other EU member states, opposed its inclusion in the Treaty of Nice.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the level of credit card fraud over the last three years; and what plans he has to reduce its incidence.  [137886]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01115w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Recorded crime figures for credit card fraud and cheque fraud are not separately identified. The total figures for England and Wales in the years ending March 1999 and March 2000 were 141,948 and 173,857 respectively.
<P>

<a name="01115w16.html_para1">The Association for Payment and Clearing Services (APACS) estimates that the value of credit card fraud relating to cards issued within the United Kingdom for the years ending March 1999 and March 2000 at &#163;135 million and &#163;189.4 million respectively.
<P>

<a name="01115w16.html_para2">The Government take the problem of card fraud very seriously and we liaise closely with the Association for Payment and Clearing Services and others to establish and promote best practice in protecting cards.
<P>

<a name="01115w16.html_para3">The Home Office held a seminar at the end of June to seek views from the banks, retailers and others about how the increasing levels of credit card fraud in the United Kingdom could be addressed. The main issues are the introduction of chip cards which would significantly reduce the use of fraudulent cards, and the introduction of a cardholder verification system, probably using a Personal Identification Number (PIN) number, to confirm that the user of the card is genuine. We want to see these important measures introduced as soon as possible. We are working in partnership with the industry to examine other ways in which the response to credit card fraud can be improved. A further seminar to take stock of the outcome of these discussions will take place later this month.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on his policy toward the European Council Initiative on the adoption of a directive on the harmonisation of financial penalties imposed on carriers for carriage of third country nationals lacking necessary documents.  [138087]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01115w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The adoption of penalties on those who transport inadequately documented third-country nationals into member states is one of a number of initiatives agreed by the European Council to tackle the problem of illegal immigration across Europe. It forms an important part of the European Union strategy for tackling this serious problem. We are fully committed to co-operating with other member states on the issue. The United Kingdom has opted in to this initiative. Doing so is consistent with our policy of participating in immigration measures which do not conflict with our position on frontiers.




<P>
<P><I>15 Nov 2000 : Column: 710W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01115w16.html_para4">The United Kingdom already has legislation in place whereby a financial charge may be imposed on carriers transporting inadequately documented passengers. The United Kingdom Government have some reservations about the terms of the draft directive implementing this initiative. We are currently seeking changes to the draft through negotiation.

<P>
<a name="01115w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B>

<P>
<a name="01115w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 provides a means of control of sex shop premises. It is for local authorities to decide whether or not to issue a 'sex shop' licence and there are no plans to relax these controls.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what action he proposes to take following the recent decision (reference number: C.DLA/714/1998) of a tribunal of Social Security Commissioners in relation to the lower rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="01115w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The decision, which we generally welcome, should help to achieve more consistency in decision making on entitlement to the lower rate mobility component. However, a part of the decision, which relates to a disabled person's fear or anxiety while out of doors, goes beyond what Parliament intended. That part of the decision proceeds on the assumption that a person may, for the purpose of entitlement to disability benefit, be

<P>

<a name="01115w16.html_para5">We are, therefore, considering scope for the introduction of amending regulations which would, subject to parliamentary approval, restore and clarify the original policy intention. However, it would not be our intention that any amendment would affect the legitimate conditions of entitlement to the lower rate mobility component, which would allow those people disabled by serious mental conditions, such as agoraphobia, to remain potentially eligible for benefit.

However, the President is keen to ensure that the public has a clear understanding of the level of performance they can expect. That is why he has set a standard of 10 days for the tribunal Chair to produce a full statement of reasons. This is in addition to standards set by the Appeals Service agency of two days to refer the statement to the Chairman, and three days to type and issue the statement to the appellant. This results in an overall standard of fifteen days.
