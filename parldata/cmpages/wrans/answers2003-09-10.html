To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the position of the Christian community in Iraq since the commencement of allied military action earlier this year.  [128077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30910w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Staff in the British Office, Baghdad and UK secondees in the Coalition Provisional Authority have been meeting representatives of many Iraqi political and religious groups, including the Christian community, to hear their views. These meetings are continuing.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30910w01.html_wqn1"><B> Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether he asked his officials to ascertain the reliability and robustness of the information contained in the UNMOVIC working document on Iraq's proscribed Weapons Programmes, of 6 March.  [128597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30910w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Yes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30910w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions have been held with the governments of <i>(a)</i> Jordan, <i>(b)</i> Lebanon and <i>(c)</i> Syria on the situation of the Palestinian community in their countries; and if he will make a statement.  [127814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30910w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We have raised this issue on a number of occasions with Arab governments. We do have concerns about the living conditions experienced by some Palestinian refugees. But ultimately this issue is a matter for negotiation between the parties concerned within the context of a comprehensive peace agreement.

<a name="30910w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Syria</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30910w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions have been held with the Government of Syria regarding their involvement in Lebanon; and if he will make a statement.  [127812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30910w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We have a dialogue with Syria on a wide range of issues, Lebanon included. The relationship between the two countries is close. While Syria has a degree of influence in Lebanon, its presence has the support of the Lebanese Government and is arguably legitimate under agreements made at the end of the civil war. But we welcome the decrease in Syrian troop numbers and urge Syria to reduce numbers yet further.

 United Kingdom maize grain is either used as "corn on the cob" or for animal feed, usually as maize silage. There is no data available regarding the average level of fumonisins or aflatoxins in these products, whether conventionally or organically produced.
<P>

<a name="30910w01.html_para0">The Food Standards Agency is currently carrying out a survey of retail maize products, including "corn on the cob", for a range of mycotoxins, including fumonisins and aflatoxins. It is anticipated that the results of this survey will be available in December 2003.

<P>
<a name="30910w01.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 A number of lifestyle factors are known to be associated with raised blood cholesterol level, an important risk factor for heart disease, including diet (particularly a high intake of saturated fat), overweight and obesity and low levels of physical activity.
<P>

<a name="30910w01.html_para1">Improving diet, increasing physical activity levels and preventing and managing of obesity are at the heart of many of the Government's priority areas, as set out in the NHS Plan, Cross-Cutting Review on health inequalities, national service frameworks and the Priorities and Planning Framework.

<P>

<a name="30910w01.html_para2">The Priorities and Planning Framework for 2003&#150;06 includes targets for reducing coronary heart disease (CHD). One of these targets requires practice-based registers (for patients with CHD and diabetes) and systematic treatment regimes, including appropriate advice on diet, physical activity and smoking. This also covers the majority of patients at high risk of CHD, particularly those with hypertension, diabetes and a body mass index greater than 30.
<P>

<a name="30910w01.html_para3">The quality and outcomes framework within the new general medical services contract, being introduced from 1 April 2004, will reward general practitioners who monitor, and can demonstrate control of, the cholesterol level of patients suffering from chronic heart disease.
<P>

<a name="30910w01.html_para4">Two new initiatives will be key in fostering healthier lifestyles. The Department of Health is leading on the development of a cross-government Food and Health Action Plan. The plan will pull together all the issues that influence what we eat and will address food production, manufacture and preparation, access to healthier food choices and providing information for consumers about healthy eating and nutrition. This is complemented by wide ranging action on physical activity, which will be progressed by a cross-government Activity Co-ordination Team, jointly led by the Department and the Department of Culture, Media and Sport.
<P>

<a name="30910w01.html_para5">The Department of Health has a range of actions already in place aimed at improving diet and increasing physical activity levels. These include: action to increase breastfeeding; reform of the Welfare Food Scheme; the Five a day programme, including the National School Fruit Scheme in England, to increase fruit and vegetable intakes; a wide range of programmes in schools; joint Department and Food Standards Agency (FSA) work with industry to address the sugar, fat and salt content of the diet; and Local Exercise Action Pilots. The FSA also has an important role in improving our diets, as outlined in their Nutrition Action Plan. They provide advice on what constitutes a healthy diet and also address food labelling and claims.

 The 10 per cent. target for electricity generation from renewables, as set in the Renewables Obligation, will be met by the total generation from all eligible renewable energy sources. The obligation does not specify targets for individual technologies as the obligation is a market-led mechanism with the selection and uptake of the technologies to be used to meet the 10 per cent. target a matter for industry, within the framework set by the obligation.

 The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence wrote to me recently to reaffirm the MOD's full commitment achievement for our target that 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity supplies are to be generated from renewable resources.
<P>

<a name="30910w03.html_para0">At official level officials in my Department maintain an on-going dialogue with their MOD counterparts on renewable energy issues including offshore wind power. The MOD attends the Wind Energy and Aviation Interests Working Group which is chaired by the Department and which provides a forum where a range of issues can be addressed.
<P>

<a name="30910w03.html_para1">Companies who intend to submit bids in response to the Crown Estate's July 2003 invitation to tender for offshore wind farm site options have been advised to consult the MOD and the Civil Aviation Authority who will advise whether they would object to development in any particular location on grounds on potential radar interference or for other reasons. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary for Defence has reassured me that where MOD objects to a development his Department will do whatever is practicable to negotiate with the developer to reach a mutually acceptable agreement that would result in objection being withdrawn.
<P>

<a name="30910w03.html_para2">More generally, the Wind Energy and Aviation Interests Working Group has commissioned research into the effects of rotating turbine blades on radar. Work is progressing on a computer model that will describe the effects of particular wind farms on individual radar systems. A second study is investigating measures to mitigate the potential effects on radar of wind turbines.

 I will be meeting with a number of MPs and representatives of the Wood Panel Industries Federation on 21 October 2003 to discuss this issue.

<a name="30910w03.html_para3">On 29 August I launched a statutory consultation paper on the Technical Review of the Renewables Obligation. This consultation outlines a number of changes we propose to make with effect from April 2004 and seeks the views of all statutory consultees and others. One of the key proposals is a set of modifications to the rules on the co-firing of biomass with fossil fuels with a view to enhancing the prospects for the development of a market in energy crops.
<P>

<a name="30910w03.html_para4">My officials continue to facilitate work between representatives of the UK wood industry and co-firing power stations to explore the opportunities offered by co-firing under the Obligation for UK forestry, and, in particular, the potential for using by-products from existing wood industries. It is hoped that this initiative, if successful, will have the dual benefit of reducing imports and making more biomass available to a larger market in the UK, thereby helping to stabilise prices. We understand from the forestry industry that it can meet demand from power generators from existing surplus forestry material. My officials are obtaining

 The Rural White Paper published in November 2000 set out plans for delivering more affordable housing in rural settlements. Funding for the Housing Corporation doubled between 2000 and 2003 to benefit both rural and urban areas, and the Government doubled the target for the programme for small rural settlements (below 3,000 people) from 800 to 1,600 homes a year. The 2003 Sustainable Communities Plan White Paper has further increased this target to a total of 3,500 homes over 2 years (2004&#150;05 to 2005&#150;06).
<P>

<a name="30910w03.html_para5">The Housing Corporation has approved a total of 3,923 homes in small rural settlements (of 3,000 people or fewer) over the years 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03, exceeding their target in each of the years. A further 7,082 homes were approved through other funding sources, Approved Development Programme and local authority funding, in rural settlements of all sizes including market towns.
<P>

<a name="30910w03.html_para6">Through the Countryside Agency and the Housing Corporation we are funding Rural Housing Enablers jointly with local partners, to work with rural communities, housing associations, local authorities and landowners to help increase the supply of affordable housing in rural settlements. Currently there are 37 enablers in post and we aim to have 47 by 2004&#150;05 to give full national coverage.
<P>

<a name="30910w03.html_para7">As my right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Housing and Planning announced on 17 July 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 53WS, the Government are consulting on an update of the existing guidance on planning for affordable housing. The update will be supported by practice advice. The update addresses a number of matters including the provision of affordable housing in rural areas. The proposed changes give greater flexibility to local authorities to seek affordable housing on smaller sites where this is justified. It is also envisaged that in rural areas affordable housing provision may be supported by allocating sites solely for affordable housing, on land within or adjoining existing villages, which would not otherwise be released for housing and where this would contribute to the attainment of mixed communities.

<a name="30910w03.html_para8">The new Regional Housing Boards, introduced by the Communities Plan (2003), are now taking responsibility for the preparation of Regional Housing Strategies. They have been charged to rural proof their strategies with the assistance of the Countryside Agency. The strategies will then provide the basis for our decisions on strategic housing investment priorities in the regions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the Government will allow immediate commercial growing of those GM crops currently being assessed under the farm scale trials programme if the crops are found to be associated with environmental benefits and without any determinable drawbacks.  [128697]<P>

<P>
<a name="30910w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 None of the crops being assessed in the farm scale evaluations yet have all the required authorisations to permit commercial growing in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30910w03.html_para10">To be authorised for commercial cultivation in the European Union (EU), a GM crop would need to be granted a consent on safety grounds under Part C of EU Directive 2001/18. Decisions under this Directive are taken collectively by the European Commission and EU member states on a case-by-case basis. No GM crop would be granted a Part C consent unless it passed a detailed assessment indicating that it posed no unacceptable risk to human health or the environment, and complied with the other requirements of the Directive. To date, only one of the four crops in the farm scale evaluations, a herbicide tolerant GM maize, has a Part C consent.
<P>

In the case of the GM maize that already has a Part C consent, the results will inform us on whether the assessment underpinning that consent remains valid.
<P>

<a name="30910w03.html_para12">GM crops are also subject to other EU legislation. Before any new variety of a crop, including GM varieties, can be grown commercially in the UK, that variety must be entered on either the UK national seed

 The European Aviation Safety Agency has been established under Regulation (EC) 1592/2002. The principle objective of that Regulation is to establish and maintain a high uniform level of civil aviation safety in Europe.
<P>

<a name="30910w04.html_para2">The Agency has a pivotal role in achieving that objective through the drafting of common safety rules; through monitoring, where applicable, the implementation of those rules by member states' national aviation authorities; and through carrying out itself a number of certification tasks, initially mainly in the field of aircraft and product designs.
<P>

<a name="30910w04.html_para3">The Regulation gives the Agency all the necessary powers to carry out these duties in the United Kingdom, in particular powers to carry out relevant investigations for issuing certificates to UK applicants and for conducting standardisation audits of the Civil Aviation Authority.

The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) requires a route risk assessment of passage plans for wake generation, as a pre-requisite to issuing a Permit to Operate for High Speed Craft. This requires the operator to identify circumstances where a hazardous wash may be created and take steps either to reduce the wake from the vessel or re-route the vessel as appropriate.

The Statistics Commission, which is independent of both Ministers and the producers of National Statistics, was established to advise on the quality, quality assurance and priority setting for National Statistics, and on the procedures designed to deliver statistical integrity. The Commission has announced that, using the Census results for Westminster city council as an example, it is considering evidence on whether Census 2001 was properly conducted and whether there are lessons to be learned for the future. The Commission has yet to publish its report, but expects to do so, probably in stages, between the summer and autumn of this year.

<P>
<a name="30910w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Underslung Grenade Launchers for SA80A2 ordered via the Urgent Operational Requirement process were first issued in theatre in early April. In addition, 3 Commando Brigade were already in possession of some Underslung Grenade Launchers, which had been procured earlier for operations in Afghanistan.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the total daily expenditure on <i>(a)</i> regular and <i>(b)</i> reserve forces stationed in Iraq is; and what the total expenditure on the maintenance of British forces in Iraq would be between 1 September and 31 March 2004 if spending were to continue at the current rate.

<a name="30910w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of Operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. The costs, which the MOD would have

incurred had the operation not been undertaken&#151;expenditure on wages and salaries or on conducting training exercises, for example&#151;are deducted from the total costs of the operation.
<P>

<a name="30910w07.html_para0">Accounting records and costs are not maintained on a daily basis and to provide such an average would be misleading. The net additional costs of Reserve and Regular force personnel are not kept separately. Maintenance costs for the force includes stock consumption and impairment of fixed assets. These costs continue to be the subject of study and audit by the National Audit Office as does their proper allocation to financial years 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04. I will write to the hon. Member when robust estimates are available and a copy of my letter will be placed in the Library of the House. This is unlikely to be before publication of the Departmental Resource Accounts.

<a name="30910w07.html_wqn4"><B> Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether the agreement of 5 February to upgrade RAF Fylingdales for missile defence purposes will require amendment to the agreement relating to the establishment and operation of a ballistic missile early warning station at Fylingdales Moor, of 15 February 1960.  [128368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30910w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence said in his Written Ministerial Statement of 5 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 12WS, the radar at RAF Fylingdales will continue after the upgrade to fulfil its ballistic missile early warning radar role and will continue to be operated and staffed by the RAF. The 1960 exchange of letters, which embodies these principles, will therefore remain the cornerstone of our relationship with the United States in respect of RAF Fylingdales, though we are examining the need for additional detailed operational agreements relating specifically to the use of the radar for missile defence purposes.
