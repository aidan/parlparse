 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will remove the safeguarding of land for a possible wide-spaced runway at Gatwick in the event of a decision to proceed with a third runway at Heathrow.  [175977]</p>








<p><a name="40607w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Future of Air Transport White Paper says that land should be safeguarded for a new wide-spaced runway at Gatwick after 2019 in case conditions attached to the construction of a new runway at Heathrow cannot be met. The situation at Gatwick will be reviewed at the stage when any planning application for a new runway at Heathrow has been decided.

<p><a name="40607w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Local authorities chose to set a large number of local transport targets in their 2001&#150;06 Local Transport Plans (LTPs)&#151;an average of 30 in each of the 85 plan areas. The 2003 LTP Annual Progress Reports gave an assessment of progress against those targets, where evidence of progress was available. These assessments indicated that around 70 per cent. of those targets were on course to be achieved.
</p>


<p>

<p><a name="40607w01.html_wqn6"><b> John Thurso: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on progress towards implementation of the International Shipping and Ports Security Code in the United Kingdom.  [176038]</p>









<p><a name="40607w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The UK is making good progress towards implementation of the International Ship and Port Security (ISPS) Code and there is every expectation that all UK flagged ship and port facilities that submit acceptable security plans by the deadlines set, will be ISPS compliant by the 1 July 2004 deadline.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w01.html_wqn7"><b> Patrick Mercer: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will amend Marine Guidance Note MGN 214 <i>(m)</i> to take account of the enforcement of the International Ship and Port Security Code.  [174609]</p>








<p><a name="40607w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 There are no plans to amend MGN 214, which relates to certificates of competency for radio operators, because it is not effected by the introduction of the ISPS Code.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w01.html_para15">
However, MGN 241 regarding advice on piracy to UK seafarers will be amended to reflect the ISPS Code, although the scope of revision has not as yet been determined. It is hoped that the ISPS Code will have both a positive impact on improving the maritime industry&#039;s resilience to terrorist action and have a secondary benefit of helping to reduce piracy. This is because it will generate increased security awareness and tighten security procedures, both on ships and in ports.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the <i>(a)</i> change in average train length, <i>(b)</i> change in average platform length and <i>(c)</i> change in track capacity has been in the London area since January 2002.  [176252]</p>

<p><a name="40607w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Between April 2001 and April 2004 the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has spent &#163;40.7 million on franchise replacements and extensions. This includes the full costs of tendering and implementation. Prior to the SRA&#039;s inception in 2001 total spend, in the period between 1998 and April 2001, on franchising was &#163;6.095 million.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2004 : Column 5W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>






<p><a name="40607w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The Department carried out an evaluation of various small-scale Yellow School Bus schemes in 2003. The evaluation found that well designed schemes do have the potential to reduce car dependency on the school run, but that care needs to be taken to ensure that they are appropriate to local circumstances and, in particular, do not reduce levels of walking or cycling, or undermine the viability of important commercial bus services. I am arranging for copies of the full evaluation report to be placed in the Libraries of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w02.html_para0">
Separately, as part of last year&#039;s Local Transport Capital settlement, the Department has provided &#163;18.7 million of funding for a much larger scale Yellow School Bus scheme in West Yorkshire.

<p><a name="40607w02.html_wqn4"><b> Huw Irranca-Davies: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the risk of exposure to asbestos to householders from building materials in houses and outbuildings, <i>(b)</i> the level of public awareness of such risks, <i>(c)</i> the expected levels of illness and death of householders exposed to asbestos in the home and <i>(d)</i> the desirability of further measures to raise awareness of such risks amongst the public.  [166747]</p>








<p><a name="40607w02.html_spnew4"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The Health and Safety Executive is responsible for exposure to asbestos where it is within the scope of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w02.html_para4">
For the 1974 Act to apply to domestic premises, there would have to be either an associated work activity or undertaking. Therefore, most risks to householders from asbestos in their homes are outside the scope of the Act.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2004 : Column 6W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>







<p><a name="40607w02.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the number of farm buildings in England in which asbestos may be present.  [176643]</p>








<p><a name="40607w02.html_spnew5"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 During the development of the regulatory impact assessment for the new duty to manage asbestos; Regulation 4 of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 an assessment was made of the number of premises likely to require an asbestos survey.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w02.html_para5">
This assessment suggests that approximately 50 per cent. of buildings on farms would need to be inspected for asbestos. The number of agricultural premises requiring a survey under the new regulation was estimated to be 70,000.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w02.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the health risks to farmers and their employees arising from <i>(a)</i> working in, <i>(b)</i> repairing and <i>(c)</i> dismantling farm buildings clad with corrugated sheeting made from asbestos cement containing white asbestos.  [176645]</p>








<p><a name="40607w02.html_spnew6"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The health risks will depend on the methods of work employed and the type of material being worked on.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w02.html_para6">
Asbestos cement, the most common asbestos-containing material on farms, is considered a lower risk than other types of material because it does not easily release asbestos fibres. The controls required when working on asbestos cement are therefore relaxed accordingly. For this reason the Asbestos (Licensing) Regulations 1983 do not require an HSE licensed contractor to be used for work with asbestos cement.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w02.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether farmhouses occupied by farmers or their employees are regarded as workplaces for the purposes of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002.  [176647]</p>








<p><a name="40607w02.html_spnew7"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 If the building&#039;s primary purpose is a residence, farmhouse or other home, whether tied to the farm or rented out, it will normally be classed as domestic premises for the purposes of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations. Therefore regulation 4 (the duty to manage asbestos in non-domestic premises) does not apply to them.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w02.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether financial assistance is available to the farming industry to assist in complying with the provisions of the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002.  [176649]</p>








<p><a name="40607w02.html_spnew8"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 There is no specific financial assistance from the Department of Work and Pensions to help farmers comply with the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w02.html_para7">
However, the new duty to manage asbestos in non-domestic premises is designed to be flexible and compliance with the duty should be costly only where the risk justifies it. For example, asbestos-containing materials should be left in place if they are in good condition and unlikely to be disturbed.

<p><a name="40607w02.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what advice he has given farmers on alternatives to white asbestos construction products used specifically for the purposes of fire prevention and insulation in farm buildings; and what assessment has been made of the safety of these alternatives.  [176651]</p>








<p><a name="40607w02.html_spnew9"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 Centrally the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has consulted with representatives of the farming community, including the National Farmers Union (NFU) and the Rural, Agricultural and Allied Workers section of the TGWU, on issues relating to asbestos through the Health in Agriculture Group which was set up in 1997. Guidance on asbestos is also included in the HSE guide to health and safety on farms &#039;Farmwise&#039;. The NFU have also produced specific guidance on asbestos for their members, upon which HSE commented.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w02.html_para8">
In order to inform the debate on the banning of white asbestos, and on behalf of the EC&#039;s Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment, HSE commissioned the Institute of Environment and Health to carry out a review comparing the risks from white asbestos with other materials that could be used as alternatives. This concluded that the physical properties of a range of alternative materials led to the conclusion that appropriate substitutes for chrysotile asbestos should be used. The findings were endorsed by the EC committee as well as the Department of Health&#039;s committee on carcinogenicity.

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest 5.<br>

2. Please note that the figures for 2003&#150;04 refer only to the main payment run i.e. they do not include the late payment run figures. We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 people in Great Britain paid via late payment runs (0.8 per cent. of all payments). However, since late payment runs are mainly in respect of non-system cases whose claim had not been received by Qualifying Week, they are heavily skewed towards men aged 60.<br>

 Poverty and social exclusion are complex and multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of peoples&#039; lives&#151;including their living standards, health, housing, the quality of their environment and not just low income. &quot;Opportunity for all&#151;fifth annual report&quot;, published on 18 September 2003, contains an annex of indicators tracking the Government&#039;s performance on tackling poverty and social exclusion across a range of domains much wider than income alone&#151;amounting to around 50 indicators in total, 15 of which are child specific.

Information showing the proportion and number of children living in low income households going back to 1979 can be found in the publication &quot;Households Below Average Income 1994&#150;95 to 2002&#150;03&quot;.

<p>
<a name="40607w03.html_para1">
Steady progress is being made towards the PSA target to reduce by a quarter the number of children living in low income households by 2004&#150;05. Between 1998&#150;99 and 2002&#150;03 the number of children in low-income households fell by 600,000 after housing costs and by 500,000 before housing costs. The latest data do not include the effect of tax credits introduced in April 2003, nor do they include the increases announced in the 2003 pre-Budget report.

The document &quot;Measuring child poverty&quot;, published in December 2003 outlines the Government&#039;s measure of UK child poverty for the long term. This new measure will begin from 2004&#150;05 and will be used to monitor our progress towards meeting our goal of halving the number of children in poverty by 2010.

All employers, including those in the entertainment industry, have a duty under the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974 to protect the health, safety and welfare of their employees. This duty extends to risks arising from second-hand smoking. Free guidance published by the Health and Safety Executive provides advice to employers on introducing effective smoking policies in the workplace. The guidance recommends that policies should give priority to the needs of non-smokers who do not wish to breathe tobacco smoke.

<p><a name="40607w04.html_wqn6"><b> Chris Ruane: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many pensioners were living in poverty in each of the last 25 years.  [175070]</p>








<p><a name="40607w04.html_spnew6"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Poverty and social exclusion are complex and multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of peoples&#039; lives&#151;including their living standards, health, housing, the quality of their environment and not just low income. The fifth annual &quot;Opportunity for All&quot; report (Cm 5956) sets out the Government&#039;s strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents information on the indicators used to measure progress against this strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w04.html_para4">
Between 1979 and 1996, there was growing inequality between the richest and poorest pensioners. Our efforts since 1997 ensure that Government money is targeted and as a result income growth for pensioners has been much more evenly spread.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w04.html_para5">
By 2002&#150;03, there were 1.8 million fewer pensioners in absolute low income measured against a 1996&#150;97 baseline. Over the same period the number of pensioners in relative low income (on an after housing costs basis) has fallen by half a million. These figures are for 2002&#150;03 and so do not yet reflect the effects of the pension credit.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w04.html_para6">
Further information showing the proportion and number of pensioners living in low income households going back to 1979 can be found in the publication, &quot;Households Below Average Income 1994&#150;95 to 2002&#150;03&quot;, a copy of which can be found in the Library.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>Notes:</i></p>
</ul>
<p>

1. The estimates are taken from the Department for Work and Pensions&#039; publication, &quot;Households Below Average Income&quot; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. There is no consistent time series using a single data source over the last 25 years for the number of pensioners below low income thresholds. A consistent time series is only available from 1994&#150;95.
2. Absolute low income in the answer is measured using the number of pensioners living in households with equivalised incomes less than 60 per cent. of the 1996&#150;97 median income held constant in real terms using the &#039;before housing costs&#039; income measure reported in HBAI.
3. &#039;60 per cent. of median&#039; is the most commonly used measure of low income and is linked with the PSA target on child poverty. HBAI also classifies households in low income using differing fractions of mean and median income, and reports figures both on a before and after housing costs basis.
4. The income measure used is mean weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income, consistent with HBAI conventions. Income is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household, and is net of income tax, national insurance contributions and council tax.

The European Commission has made proposals to clarify the housing provision by removing the distinction that housing should be provided as part of a social policy and by specifying the inclusion of the repair and maintenance of housing.

 The recent Innovation Report highlighted the challenge the UK still faces in exploiting its significant science, engineering and technology achievements. In order to rise to this challenge the DTI are leading in the development of a national Technology Strategy to stimulate business demand for new and emerging technologies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w08.html_para1">
The Strategy will identify technology priorities critical to the growth of the UK economy, matching business needs with what science can achieve. Government and its agencies will use the Strategy to steer investment in UK and European R and D programmes. It will also inform the future development of wider Government activities, such as innovative public procurement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w08.html_para2">
The Strategy also sits alongside a national policy to address the gender imbalance in science and technology, which included the announcement of a &#163;1.5 million support package. Among other initiatives, this has provided a new science resource centre, officially opening in September 2004, that will encourage female scientists to return to science and more women to pursue successful scientific careers.
</p>

<p><a name="40607w09.html_spnew5"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The available information is shown in the tables. Information by age is only collected centrally for women on their first attendances during the year (first contacts) at family planning clinics and for contraceptive implants fitted by family planning clinics. Totals only are shown for women under 20 due to small numbers.

In England we are taking a number of steps, through the Government&#039;s national strategy for sexual health and HIV and teenage pregnancy strategy, to reduce the rate of unintended pregnancy. The Government are working to improve access to contraceptive services and the range of methods of contraception that are available and to improve sex and relationships education. The number of family planning sessions aimed at young people has increased to tackle high levels of teenage pregnancies and sexually transmitted infections. We have also established a group of key experts to develop an action plan to support the improvement of contraceptive services at local level.

Notes:<br>

In Year Admissions<br>

Between the years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02, a number of National Health Service trusts in the North West reclassified inpatient procedures as outpatients. This has shown itself in apparent falls in activity levels. The majority of residents served by the West Lancashire Primary Care Trust will be referred to the Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust. During this period 3,500 admissions were reclassified from daycases to outpatients at the Southport and Ormskirk Hospital NHS Trust. An in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admission beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Periods of care ongoing at the end of the datayear (unfinished admission episodes) are included. However, admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

PCT Code<br>

PCT codes is a derived field providing the Primary Care Trust responsible for the patient. The PCT code is derived from the GP practice with which the patient is registered (GPPRAC) if this is known, or REGGMP, PURCODE or the postcode of the patient.<br>

<p><a name="40607w11.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The national programme for information technology (IT) is implementing a series of IT solutions to improve patient choice and the quality of patient treatment and care. Fundamental to this is the national health service care records service (CRS) that will enable patient care information to be accessed at the point of need anywhere in England. The intention is to ensure that information on a patient is captured once and used operationally across a range of care settings and in support of a care pathway. This saves time for clinicians and avoids patients having to repeat the same information over and over again as they move from department to department or clinician to clinician.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w11.html_para0">
In most cases, information will be transferred automatically from existing local IT systems and Patient Administration Systems into the nationally available NHS CRS. This will be a similar process to what happens with existing systems every time there is a system refresh or upgrade.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w11.html_para1">
The recording of information about patients is part of normal clinical practice, and it is not envisaged that the use of the NHS CRS will require any significant additional effort from NHS staff than with existing processes and systems.

<p><a name="40607w11.html_spnew3"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 25 May 2004]:</i> The National Health Service Cancer Plan stated that the government would extend and roll out new screening programmes, where it is clear that screening reduces mortality. Currently, there is no such evidence for a screening tool for lung cancer. The United Kingdom National Screening Committee (NSC), which advises Ministers on all aspects of screening policy, considered data from an American study at its meeting in March 2003 and concluded that the findings reinforced the policy not to offer screening. At the July 2003 meeting of the NSC, it was noted that a major trial is currently under way in New York and the topic will be reviewed when that trial reports. The National Cancer Research Institute&#151;established at our request in April 2001 to co-ordinate the national drive on cancer research&#151;has now convened a strategic planning group on lung cancer, which is due to meet for the first time in the summer.

 Positive Activities for Young People (PAYP) is delivered in every Government office region in England. The target Local Education Authority areas within each region were selected using a weighting system encompassing crime levels, education goals on truancy and attendance and experience of previous activity schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w13.html_para7">
The PAYP target is to provide up to 22,500 full-time equivalent places (this could involve up to 67,000 young people) on diversionary activities for &#039;at risk&#039; young people and to provide key worker support for up to 7,500 young people with a view to engaging them with positive outcomes within education and training and thereby reducing the likelihood of offending. Young people remain engaged in PAYP for as long as they need this type of support. The aim is to achieve a 65 per cent. positive outcome rate for PAYP participants, which is measured by entry into education, training and employment.

There is in place a three-year programme of evaluation that will look at the impact of PAYP over a period of time.

<p><a name="40607w13.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The existing regional chambers, or assemblies, do not have a service delivery function. Their principal responsibilities are the scrutiny of regional economic strategies under the Regional Development Agencies Act, 1998. In addition, from 1 April 2003 all the chambers took on the role of regional planning bodies, with responsibility for producing regional planning guidance. Under the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act, 2004, they will have responsibility for producing Regional Spatial Strategies. I have therefore commissioned no such research, but I do require the Regional Culture Consortiums for which I am responsible to develop regional cultural strategies in consultation with a wide range of regional partners including regional chambers and assemblies.

<p><a name="40607w13.html_spnew8"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 As we made clear during the passage of the Communications Act, we do not believe that it is necessary to specify in legislation annual targets for the increased provision of subtitling, signing and audio description. Ofcom has the power to establish interim targets, should they appear to Ofcom to be necessary to meet its duties in respect of people with disabilities. Those duties, combined with the extension of access obligations to cable and satellite channels and the 10 and five-year targets which are set out in the Act, represent a realistic way of achieving the substantial increase in access provision to which the Government are committed.

 There are currently no legal restrictions in place in Colombia preventing access to any part of their country for international organisations and their agencies or for Colombian or foreign NGOs working there. However, the continuing armed conflict and the country&#039;s geography mean that access to the remotest parts of the country can be difficult. In addition, paramilitary or guerrilla groups do attempt to block access by outsiders to some parts of the country, particularly remote rural locations. International organisations and NGOs are also conscious of the potential risk to their staff of attempting to gain access to areas in which the armed conflict is on-going. Through its democratic security policy the Government of Colombia are trying to bring security and accessibility to all regions in the country. We constantly urge the Colombian Government to ensure that the implementation of this policy is in accordance with international law.

<p><a name="40607w19.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 A draft discussion paper on accountability and standards of the port police forces was circulated last year to the Association of Port Police Chief Officers&#039; (APPCO) and the Home Office. Since then the Home Office have consulted on the role of small specialist police forces, including port police forces, in their consultation paper &quot;Policing: Building Safer Communities Together&quot;. In addition the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) are now undertaking their own review of port policing. Our conclusions on the arrangements for ports police need to take account of the results of these two exercises, expected later this year.

 Port police forces are accountable to the relevant port authority by virtue of their establishment under Section 79 of the Harbours Docks and Piers Clauses Act 1847 or the incorporation of that provision into their own legislation.

<p><a name="40607w19.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 To support the delivery of rural transport policy we are providing funding to local authorities to improve transport services in rural areas through the Rural Bus Subsidy Grant.

<p><a name="40607w19.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 The Secure Stations Scheme is designed to improve and standardise good security practices at overground and underground stations. The Scheme awards Secure Stations status to those stations that have worked with their local British Transport Police Crime Reduction Officer to reach specified standards in crime management, station design, station management, and passenger perceptions. Criteria covered include lighting, maintenance procedures, passenger information, incident reporting, and staff training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w19.html_para2">
The Department has spent approximately &#163;15,000 on the printing and distribution of the Secure Stations Scheme guidance. The Scheme is also promoted through meetings, presentations, magazine articles, seminars and conferences with relevant interested parties. Accredited stations are also able to advertise the Scheme themselves through local news features and their own publicity materials (e.g. posters, company magazines).

<p>
<a name="40607w19.html_para3">
Approximately two-thirds of all overground rail journeys and approximately one half of all London underground journeys involve passengers starting or finishing their journeys at a Secure Station.

Stations are awarded Secure Stations status for a two year period once they have met the required accreditation standards on station design, station management, crime management, and passenger perceptions. There is provision for the accreditation to be withdrawn if there is a clear breach of standards during that time. No stations have breached the standards during their accreditation period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w19.html_para5">
Accredited stations can apply for reaccreditation after their two-year award period has expired. Although a large number of stations have become reaccredited, 53 stations have not sought reaccreditation and, therefore, their accreditation status has been removed. There were two of these stations during 2000, three during 2001, 21 during 2002, and 27 during 2003.

<p><a name="40607w20.html_spnew3"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The Government places great importance on the value of employer pension provision, but not on any specific type of provision, which must be suited to the specific needs of the employee and employer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w20.html_para4">
Where Government is the employer, it aims to provide a remuneration package that includes access to an occupational pension and employer financing towards the accruing costs of those pensions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w20.html_para5">
This generally involves providing defined benefit occupational schemes, but defined contribution arrangements may be provided alongside or instead where this is considered to represent value for money.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what percentage of <i>(a)</i> public and <i>(b)</i> private sector employees are members of final salary pension schemes; and what the percentages were in 1997.  [176987]</p>








<p><a name="40607w20.html_spnew4"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The information on employment shown in the table has been obtained from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), and refers to all people who are aged 16 or over and in employment. Figures have been rounded. The information on pension scheme members (also rounded) has been obtained from the Occupational Pension Schemes Survey (OPSS), Government Actuary&#039;s Department.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w20.html_para7">
These are the two most appropriate sources, but unfortunately the GAD survey data is only available for 1995 and 2000 in recent years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w20.html_para8">
The information on scheme membership refers to Defined Benefit (DB) schemes, which may include salary related schemes that are not necessarily final salary schemes. Data for final salary schemes specifically is not available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w20.html_para9">
It should be noted that in calculating the percentage of employees who are members of DB pension schemes, two different data sources (LFS and OPSS) have been used. The percentages should, therefore, be treated as estimates only. For instance, one reason for caution is that the OPSS data is a snapshot of information relating to the year as a whole, while the LFS data presented here relates to the winter period (December to February) of each year.

and South Cumbria Social Fund Districts to form Lancashire West Jobcentre Plus District. The two areas for which data is given above are therefore different, so the data is not comparable.<br>

2. Prior to 2003&#150;04, tax credits refer to Working Families&#039; Tax Credit and Disabled Person&#039;s Tax Credit. From 2003&#150;04, tax credits refer to Child Tax Credit payable at a rate higher than the family element and Working Tax Credit where the disability or severe disability element is included in the award.<br>

3. Where a Sure Start Maternity Grant (SSMG) is awarded and the applicant or partner is in receipt of both IS and Child Tax Credit at the appropriate rate, the SSMG award is usually recorded under Income Support (IS). Similarly, where a SSMG is awarded and the applicant or partner is in receipt of both Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance (Income-Based) and Child Tax Credit at the appropriate rate, the SSMG award is usually recorded under JSA(IB).<br>

4. Sure Start Maternity Grants were introduced on 27 March 2000. The very small number of cases for 1999&#150;2000 have been excluded for data protection reasons.<br>

 The majority of the 140 million remaining rural poor in China live in environmentally fragile and remote areas and are heavily dependent on agriculture and related activities for their livelihoods. The Department for International Development (DFID) has, and is working to develop, a number of activities in China which seek to address aspects of rural poverty, including those related to agriculture.

Official statistics from the Ministry of Land and Resources in China indicate that current available arable land area is 123 million ha, or 12.8 per cent. of the total. The area of land for grain production is reported to have declined from 98 to 76 million ha from 1998 to 2003. DFID does not have equivalent figures for total arable land.

<a name="40607w24.html_para4">
DFID currently provides financial support to a high-level policy body established by the State Council&#151;the China Council for International Co-operation on Environment and Development. It currently has a task force that is looking specifically at agriculture and rural development, including evaluating the change in agricultural land availability. Their results will contribute to monitoring recent trends in land loss and developing approaches to address it. Recent reports from this group indicate that there have been periods of rapid reduction in the available area of land for agriculture over the past 20 years but that there are regional differences. The rate of loss per capita has increased from 0.6 per cent. in 1998 to 2.8 per cent. in 2003. Many academics believe that the overall loss is less than that reported in official statistics. The losses are thought to have resulted mainly from the growth of urban areas and construction, and the conversion of land to forests.

<p><a name="40607w25.html_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 On <i>(a),</i> the general principle I adopt is that the overarching purpose of all DFID&#039;s activity is to work towards the elimination of poverty. In the very limited number of cases where private security companies might represent the most effective means by which DFID can promote this objective in a specific context, DFID may use services of reputable private security companies for specific narrow purposes. For example, we are using private security companies to protect our staff working in Iraq and Afghanistan. We would also consider using private security companies on security sector reform programmes, for example delivering training, if we judged them the most cost-effective option to deliver a given programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w25.html_para5">
On <i>(b)</i> , the principle I adopt is that funds allocated for aid programmes and projects should not be used to purchase arms and ammunition. But in respect of funds allocated to the costs of ensuring the security of staff, when DFID employs private security companies to protect staff implementing projects and programmes in dangerous environments, the security situation might sometimes require those companies to carry arms.

<p><a name="40607w25.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Over the last 12 months, DFID has commissioned two public attitude surveys. The first, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) Omnibus Survey on &quot;Public Attitudes Towards Development&quot; is undertaken annually (since 1999) to monitor the attitudes of the UK adult population. The cost of the July 2003 Survey was &#163;32,990. The results are published on the DFID website and are available in the House Libraries. The second, the Market and Opinion Research (MORI) survey on &quot;Attitudes of Schoolchildren towards Development&quot;, is undertaken annually (since 2000) to monitor the attitudes of young people. The cost of the January 2004 Survey was &#163;12,220. The results will be published on the DFID website and made available in the House libraries once MORI has finalised the report. The results of both surveys are used to inform, and monitor the impact of, the development awareness work of the Department. The key indication from the 2003 &quot;Public Attitudes Towards Development&quot; survey is that 67 per cent. of the public are concerned about poverty in developing countries.

<p><a name="40607w29.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Charles Clarke: </b> 
 Free transport is always necessary for a pupil of compulsory school age (five to 16) who attends the nearest suitable school if it is beyond statutory walking distances. These are two miles for pupils aged up to eight and three miles for those aged eight and over. This is measured by the shortest route along which a child, accompanied as necessary, may walk with reasonable safety.

<p>
<a name="40607w29.html_para0">
Free transport might exceptionally be necessary for a five to 16-year-old who lives within walking distance of school, or who does not attend the nearest suitable school: it is for a local education authority to consider such a case on its merits. In addition, they have discretion to provide assistance in a wide range of other circumstances. It is for each LEA to decide on its discretionary transport policy in line with local priorities and to defend it locally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w29.html_para1">
The current school transport legislation dates to 1944 and has not kept pace with changes to the education system. There are also growing concerns about congestion on the school run, pollution, obesity and lack of exercise. The draft School Transport Bill would seek to allow a small number of local authorities to address the serious environmental and practical issues caused by increasing car use on the school run, and provide attractive alternatives to the family car on the home to school journey.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w29.html_para2">
The Bill will allow pilot authorities to charge fares for those in receipt of school transport, but only at a level which will not increase car use. There are also a number of safeguards built in. Only LEAs that volunteer to become pilots following local consultation will be able to charge and I will then have to approve schemes. While the draft Bill provides as a minimum for pupils entitled to free school meals (FSM) to receive free transport, we hope LEAs will experiment with different approaches to means testing, e.g. considering number of children in family, those just above FSM income cut-off etc.

<p><a name="40607w30.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 I was pleased that the National Audit Office report acknowledged the good progress that had been made in creating new child care places and recognised the Government&#039;s achievement in providing free, part-time early education for 3 and 4-year-olds. There is now one child care place for every four children under the age of 8, whereas in 1997 there was only one place for every eight children. In addition, since the report was published, we have extended the offer of a free, part-time early education place to cover all 3-year-olds.

<a name="40607w30.html_para0">
The Government fully accept the view, expressed in the report, that although a great deal has been achieved, there is still more to be done; and we have welcomed the recommendations. The areas highlighted in the report&#151;the creation of places in disadvantaged areas, the sustainability of places, and the provision of training and support for providers&#151;are ones where we are making particular efforts as we work towards our vision of good quality, accessible, and affordable child care for all parents who want it.

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data are taken from Leeds LEA&#039;s section 52 Outturn Statement submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000. Leeds LEA does not have any pre-primary pupils for the years 1999&#150;2000 onwards so there is no pre-primary split to show. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

2. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. 2002&#150;03 data are subject to change by the LEA. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

3. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEAs.<br>

4. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary and primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.<br>

5. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.<br>

6. The NCE per pupil figures for special schools relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained special schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained special schools sector.<br>

7. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<p><a name="40607w33.html_spnew2"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 We have been modernising the arrangements for the delivery of higher education student finance over recent years. Central to this modernisation is the new IT system, implemented by the Student Loans Company, which LEAs are now using to assess and process paper applications. There have been 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2004 : Column 122W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
some teething problems with the system, which you would expect with an IT project of this size and complexity. However, at this stage we have no strong concerns that students who apply on time will not receive payment at the start of term. We are of course monitoring the situation closely.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w33.html_para2">
The intention was that the new IT system would also provide a service for students to make their applications on-line from this April. However, in order to give the national launch of the new IT system in LEAs the best chance of success, we have decided to delay the introduction of this service. This reflects the fact that this year we had always expected the vast majority of students to apply using paper forms. Postponing the launch of the online facility has not prevented in anyway students from making applications for support on-time as paper application forms have been made readily available to them as in previous years. We remain committed to providing an on-line service in line with e-government targets.

<p><a name="40607w33.html_spnew3"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 The new higher education student finance IT system will not only provide an online application facility for students. The same system is also being used by local education authorities to assess and process paper applications from students and by the customer support office, operated by the Student Loans Company, to answer student queries. It is therefore not possible for us to provide separate figures for the development and running costs of the online facility as these costs are integral to the costs of the system as a whole.

Staffing is the responsibility of Health and Social Services Trusts, taking into account factors such as service needs and available resources. However, the Department has a role in ensuring that sufficient suitably qualified staff are available to meet the needs of the service and to monitor workforce levels in Trusts. This will be done through workforce planning mechanisms, which provide an analysis of the current workforce and of current and future recruitment and retention issues and encompasses issues such as the number of staff required to meet service demands. As at September 2003 there were seven specialist trainees in dermatology, which, allowing for retirements, is sufficient to increase consultant numbers to a projected level of 17 by 2010. The position, as with all hospital-based specialties, is reviewed annually and this informs decisions on investment in the future numbers in training.

The Department has therefore commissioned primary research to examine the role and effectiveness of air ambulance services in the modern NHS.

<p><a name="40607w41.html_spnew4"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 There is no routine collection of information on the number of people living with dementia. The research quoted by the older people&#039;s national service framework in 2001 estimated that approximately 600,000 people in the United Kingdom have dementia, of whom about 583,000 are aged 65 years and above. The prevalence and incidence of dementia increases with age. It is estimated that about five per cent, of people over 65 have dementia, rising to about 20 per cent. in the population over 80. Alzheimer&#039;s disease causes up to 60 per cent. of cases of dementia.

 The White Paper, &quot;Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century&quot; (March 2001), estimated that there were around 25,000 older people, out of a total of around 210,000 people, with severe and profound learning disabilities. In the case of people with mild/moderate learning disabilities, the White Paper stated that estimates suggest a prevalence rate of around 25 per 100,000 population (all ages)&#151;some 1.2 million people in England.

 There are no charges for sight tests provided under the national health service. Sight tests are free to children, older people, people on low income and those susceptible to eye disease who can benefit most from regular sight tests.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w42.html_para1">
More than 85 per cent., of the total income from prescription charges is collected by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors as part of the dispensing of medicines. Charges for dental examinations are collected by dentists. There is no separately identifiable element of the remuneration of any of these professions attributable to the charge collection function.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w42.html_para2">
The administration costs of the sale of prescription pre-payment certificates, which account for the remainder of the income from prescription charges, are around &#163;1.5 million per year.

 My right hon. Friend the Minister for Children and I have joint responsibility for the children&#039;s national service framework (NSF). We meet on a regular basis to discuss matters of mutual interest, such as work on the NSF.

<p>
<a name="40607w44.html_para0">
Departmental officials with responsibility for child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) policy development meet regularly and work closely with policy colleagues within the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) to oversee the whole CAMHS development programme. Officials of both Departments are also working closely on the development of the NSF. The DfES was represented on the external working group looking at CAMHS. We will be publishing the NSF later this year.

<p>
<a name="40607w44.html_para1">
The Department remains committed to meeting the needs of vulnerable young people within the youth justice system. There are clear indications that the prevalence of mental health needs among young people supervised by youth offending teams (YOTs) and in custody is significantly higher than that of the general population. Departmental officials continue to work with the Youth Justice Board (YJB) on child and adolescent mental health service input into YOTs. The Department, together with the Prison Service and YJB, have jointly appointed a programme manager for juvenile health and well being. Among the benefits we expect to see is a greater understanding of the nature and prevalence of mental health disorders, which in turn will lead to primary care trusts being better able to commission services to meet the identified need.

<p><a name="40607w48.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The terms and conditions of service for all staff covered by &quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, including speech and language therapists are set out in the proposed agreement published in March 2003, which is also available on the Department&#039;s website.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2004 : Column 174W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w48.html_para0">
The new system will deliver fair and equitable conditions of service across all groups covered by &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; by harmonising core conditions of service, such as hours and annual leave. In addition, speech and language therapists will have access to payments for working unsocial hours and overtime.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w48.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Todd: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate the numbers of speech and language therapists requiring pay protection from April 2005; and if he will make a statement.  [176518]</p>








<p><a name="40607w48.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 We are currently testing the impact of the whole package of pay reform including the numbers of staff requiring protection, in 12 early implementer sites. The United Kingdom health departments and national health service unions and employer representatives are now reviewing the emerging evidence from the sites and the conclusions from this review are likely to be known in July. The agreed success criterion is that, overall no more than a small percentage of staff should require formal protection. The proposed agreement also includes provision to ensure that for any staff requiring protection, there will be a review during this period of protection, to explore whether the staff concerned could be reassigned to a higher weighted job or offered development and training to fit them for a higher weighted job.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w48.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Todd: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the proposals for working hours for speech and language therapists; and how these will be reflected in earnings.  [176519]</p>








<p><a name="40607w48.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The proposed agreement aims to harmonise the disparate hours of the different staff groups by providing a standardised working week of 37.5 hours for all full-time national health service staff covered by &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; with phased protection arrangements for staff who currently work shorter hours for a period of up to eight years. Nationally speech and language therapists work unconditioned hours and may be working either above or below the proposed hours under the new arrangements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w48.html_para1">
These arrangements support the underlying principles of &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; of ensuring a fair, transparent pay system, based on the important principle of equal pay for work of equal value with simplified consistent conditions of service fairly applied across all staff groups.

 All existing national health service patients have already been assigned a unique identifier.

 Fines are currently imposed on the basis of the seriousness of the offence and the offender&#039;s ability to pay. The Carter Review, &quot;Managing Offender, Reducing Crime&quot;, recommended the introduction of a &#039;day fines&#039; system, which would offer a transparent link with the ability to pay. The Government is currently considering this proposal, which would require primary legislation.

<a name="40607w51.html_para4">
As an example, the IT 2000 Agreement obliges Sirius to advise the Home Office on the frequency of electrical safety testing of portable IT equipment. Sirius&#039;s advice is that visual inspection at the time of first installation, reassessment via visual inspection at three year intervals and &quot;combined inspection and test&quot; (i.e. PAT testing) at five year intervals provides the appropriate assurance. However, Sirius are committed to a programme of Technology Refresh leading to the replacement of their equipment before it is five years old. On this basis, formal PAT testing of Sirius&#039;s equipment is not required and no formal programme of PAT testing for IT equipment has been conducted since the IT 2000 Agreement was signed.

<a name="40607w51.html_para5">
Any equipment not covered by the various IT Agreements is tested under the agreements held with the various Facility Management (FM) companies responsible for the maintenance of each of the buildings concerned.

<p><a name="40607w52.html_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11 May 2004]:</i> There were seven reported incidents of self-harm in the Segregation Unit at Stoke Heath young offender institution involving juveniles during 2003, and one so far reported in 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w52.html_para4">
A new form for reporting self-harm was introduced across the prison estate in December 2002. This has improved the consistency with which self-harm incidents are reported and, by broadening the range of questions that are asked, improved the detail and quality of the information collected. Prior to 2003, data on the location in the prison where the self-harm incident occurred were not collated centrally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w52.html_para5">
Suicidal intent is not easy to establish. The reasons why people self-injure are highly complex, and it is often difficult to distinguish between acts of self-harm that were attempts at ending life, and those which occurred for other reasons. It is not possible, therefore, for the Prison Service to extrapolate from the data recording incidents of self-harm those acts that may have been attempts at suicide.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w52.html_para6">
A number of intervention strategies have been introduced into prisons, young offender and juvenile establishments for people who self-harm. These include counselling, support groups, and specialised psychological interventions. While evaluation of these interventions is, at present, very limited, evidence from research in non-prison settings suggests that male and female adolescents who self-harm repeatedly may benefit from group therapy. A network of establishments has been set up to develop interventions, facilitate evaluation and share good practice. Guidance to staff on managing people who self-harm has also been circulated to establishments.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the <i>(a)</i> number and <i>(b)</i> percentage of miscarriages of justice at each level of the criminal justice system in each of the last 10 years.  [173108]</p>








<p><a name="40607w53.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Home Secretary&#039;s powers to consider alleged miscarriages of justice came to an end on 31 March 1997, and were replaced by new powers vested in an independent body called the Criminal Cases Review Commission.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w53.html_para0">
In its first seven years, the Commission received 6,647 applications for case review and referred 226 of these to the relevant court of appeal. Of the appeals resulting from these referrals that the courts have determined, some two-thirds have resulted in the conviction being quashed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w53.html_para1">
Figures available from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) show that 290 convictions were overturned in 1998, 171 in 1999, 150 in 2000, 136 in 2001 and 166 in 2002. These would have included cases referred by the Commission, in addition to normal in-time appeals and those where the court granted leave for an out-of-time appeal.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what procedures are in place to review case files following a referral to the courts by the Criminal Case Review Commission; and what mechanisms are in place <i>(a)</i> to address case-particular errors and <i>(b)</i> to identify general improvements that may reduce the risk of further miscarriages of justice.  [173109]</p>








<p><a name="40607w53.html_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Once closed by the Commission, the files for both referral and non-referral cases are retained for five years at which point the Commission reviews the files for record keeping purposes. It is possible for an applicant whose referral is unsuccessful or whose case is not referred by the Commission to reapply at any time.

<a name="40607w53.html_para2">
It is an objective of the Commission to analyse the causes of miscarriages of justice and to suggest ways in which the criminal justice system might be improved to reduce their incidence. It is still too early for the Commission to do so authoritatively. The Commission has only referred 226 cases (as at March 2004) and about a fifth of these have yet to been determined. The difficulty in drawing sound conclusions relevant to today&#039;s criminal justice system is that these cases concern a wide spectrum of offences and convictions spread over half a century.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w53.html_para3">
However when the Commission&#039;s database contains a greater number of recent cases, it should be possible to analyse comprehensively the legal and investigative issues that still commonly arise in miscarriages of justice. The Commission should then be able to formulate sound advice to other stakeholders and agencies within the criminal justice system on actions and legislation that could help to minimise their incidence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w53.html_para4">
While section 23 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1995 precludes the Commission from disclosing any case information obtained in the exercise of its functions the Commission does liaise with other agencies and individuals in the criminal justice system. This includes discussion of issues raised in cases reviewed by the Commission.

 Youth Offending Teams make the initial assessment as to whether a child is vulnerable. The ASSET assessment tool developed by the Youth Justice Board (YJB) sets out how the Youth Offending Team (Yot) should consider vulnerability and evidence their concerns. The following factors are taken into account for each child:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Whether they are bullied, abused or neglected (behaviour of others)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Whether they are affected by separation, loss or change of care (other events)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Whether they are risk taking, including substance misuse (own behaviour)</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Whether there are indications of self-harm or suicide concerns.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w55.html_para3">
In deciding on the appropriate placement for each child assessed by the Yot as vulnerable, the YJB (or in some cases, the Prison Service Juvenile Group on behalf of the Secretary of State) takes into account the nature and level of the young person&#039;s vulnerability, their age and type of offence, their educational and healthcare needs and other relevant factors, such as proximity to home.

 The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The United Kingdom garrison in Belize was withdrawn in 1994. From the early 1980s until reductions in advance of withdrawal in the early 1990s, the garrison comprised a full battalion group with an element of RAF support, numbering in total an estimated 1,200 to 1,500 military personnel. In 1994, the garrison was replaced by the much smaller British Army Training Support Unit Belize (BATSUB). BATSUB currently has around 70 permanent military staff. In addition, many hundreds of personnel pass through BATSUB for short periods of training each year.

This figure does not translate into a specific number of MTDs, since each individual is paid differently according to rank, skill, and length of service. As a general guide, the MTD budget enables each member of the TA to undertake some 30 MTDs per year.

 Between 1950 and 1960, when the period of full time service was set at two years, the policy was that all national servicemen would have routinely received basic training appropriate to their service.

 The additional cost of the Trooping of the Colour 2003 including all rehearsals, the General Officer Commanding&#039;s review, the Colonel&#039;s review and The Queen&#039;s Birthday Parade was &#163;22,500. This can be attributed to the hiring of vehicles required to transport the participating troops to and from central London. Other minor costs, such as dry cleaning, communications and rations may also have been incurred, but these cannot be separated from general expenditure for similar purposes made throughout the year. The cost of seating spectators in 2003 amounted to some &#163;141,000, which was recovered from the sale of tickets for the event. The Metropolitan Police and Westminster City Council may also have incurred costs, but my Department has no visibility of the extent of these.

<p><a name="40607w60.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 18 May 2004]:</i> On the one hand, the contraction and convergence framework promises both global participation in efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and a means of ensuring that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised in the atmosphere at a level that avoids dangerous climate change. On the other hand, it requires upfront agreement on the level at which greenhouse gas concentrations should be stabilised, something that many countries are reluctant to discuss; it is based on a per-capita approach which a number of countries with high per capita emissions strongly oppose, and requires a governance structure that binds countries in for decades.

 Defra is working with a wide range of organisations to ensure that people will enjoy the full benefits of the new right of access introduced by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. The first two regions, the South East and lower North West, open for access on 19 September.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w60.html_para7">
We are looking in detail with the Countryside Agency, Ordnance Survey and other bodies closely involved in the implementation of the new right at ways to make information about the Act widely available to the public. As part of our communications strategy, the Countryside Agency will very shortly be issuing guidance to access authorities (National Park Authorities in National Parks and local highway authorities elsewhere) and land managers on the use of signs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w60.html_para8">
The guidance will give access authorities the lead role in erecting and maintaining signs to show where open access rights exist and will encourage them to consult widely with land managers, local access forums and other interested parties in drawing up their plans. New signs will not be needed in every case and the guidance will advocate careful thought about whether additional signage is appropriate. The Countryside Agency will also be issuing a new and up-to-date Countryside Code on 12 July. Ordnance Survey is preparing to show access land on its Explorer maps.

<p>
<a name="40607w60.html_para9">
Defra is funding the Countryside Agency, National Park Authorities and the Planning Inspectorate to implement Part 1 of the Act. The Countryside Agency has so far spent &#163;29.30 million, consisting of &#163;0.75 million in 1999&#150;2000; &#163;0.92 million in 2000&#150;01; &#163;5.17 million in 2001&#150;02; &#163;8.30 million in 2002&#150;03; &#163;13.25 million in 2003&#150;04; and &#163;0.77 million to date in 2004&#150;05. The Agency expects to spend a further &#163;14.23 million in the current financial year. National Park Authorities have been allocated an additional &#163;4.725 million, consisting of &#163;0.875 million in 2002&#150;03; 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2004 : Column 223W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
&#163;2.0 million in 2003&#150;04; and &#163;1.85 million in 2004&#150;05.

Further, I have announced funding of &#163;2 million for 2004&#150;05 towards an access management grant scheme to support local authorities in implementing the new right of access. The scheme, which will be administered by the Countryside Agency, will contribute towards access authorities&#039; preparatory planning costs and cover between 50 per cent. and 75 per cent. of the cost of new infrastructure work agreed with the Agency, such as signage, foot bridges and gates. It will give highest priority to especially sensitive nature conservation sites where effective management will avoid the need for a legal restriction to be placed on access, but will also fund management measures on sites outside nature conservation areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w60.html_para11">
The scheme runs to the end of March 2005 and I will be considering whether to extend it in the light of its success this year and in the context of Defra&#039;s future spending priorities. Interim guidance about how the scheme will work has been available since April. The Agency will issue final guidance in early June.

Houses are counted when risk reduction is actually in place, either on completion of the project or on completion of a phase within it. This method of counting was introduced with the SDA target in March 2003. I am able to provide the outturn figure for SDA 27 for 2003&#150;04 only, which is a total of some 20,000 houses.

The figure of 20,000 is a total for both flooding and coastal erosion risk.

Breaking the link between subsidy and production also removes an incentive for farmers to maximise production and so reduces environmental damage from intensive farming such as over-use of pesticides and fertilizers. Through cross-compliance obligations, the agreement also makes subsidy dependent on farmers meeting certain EU environmental, food safety, plant and animal health and animal welfare standards as well as maintaining their land in good agricultural and environmental condition. More subsidy will also be diverted from production to wider rural development and environmental initiatives which farmers undertake.

 Local authorities are responsible for regulating air emissions from some 17,000 industrial and other installations and regulating a wide range of environmental impacts from up to 1,000 industrial and other installations. These responsibilities involve deciding whether to issue permits to the specified installations and, if so, imposing conditions which represent the best available techniques to minimise pollution. As part of this, local authorities&#039; functions include inspecting regulated premises and maintaining a public register.

ONS publishes some statistics where the components draw on the expertise of statisticians from the Government Statistical Service, who work in other Departments.

The National Statistician, who is Director of the ONS, has released his own correspondence confirming that it was the advice of a senior statistician in the Transport Department which led to his senior staff deciding to change the press release which summarised the content of the Environmental Account being published by ONS.

<sup>(62)</sup> Figures are based on deaths occurring in each calendar year.<br>

<sup>(63)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that data for respiratory diseases, circulatory diseases and cancer are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The data should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from these causes is described in a report published in May 2002 and a more detailed analysis of the impact of ICD-10 in trends in circulatory disease mortality was published in May 2004.<br>

 The Government published draft Freedom of Information fees regulations in 2000. No decision has been taken to alter these.

<p><a name="40607w68.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Individual Electoral Registration Officers keep records of the number of postal voters in their registration area, though separate records are not kept of long-term postal voters and those for one election only. It is possible to apply for a postal vote at any time, but figures are not maintained on a yearly basis. Available statistics show that at the 2001 general election, 1,758,055 postal votes were issued in total, compared to 937,205 at the 1997 general election.

 Given that the Electoral Commission evaluation will include a statement of the number of ballot papers received in the period of a week after the close of poll, I have no plans to make any further such request of Returning Officers.

 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w68.html_para1">
The detention and training order is the main custodial sentence for 12&#150;17 year olds: the minimum term is four months and the maximum 24 months. Time spent in custody is followed by an equivalent period in the community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w68.html_para2">
The DTO is one of a range of options available to courts dealing with young offenders. Most disorder offences would not normally attract custody: the tests for the court are whether the offence or offences in question are so serious that a custodial sentence is the only adequate response; or, where an offence is violent or sexual, whether custody is necessary to protect the public from serious harm from the offender.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w68.html_para3">
Research commissioned by the Youth Justice Board on the first two years&#039; operation of the DTO found that, in the main, the combination of custody and community supervision worked well. It concluded that greater co-operation across the youth justice system would help to meet the needs of DTO trainees, including the need to prevent reoffending. The Youth Justice Board is addressing this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w68.html_para4">
Following consultation in its 8 September 2003 paper Youth Justice&#151;The Next Steps, the Government proposes to keep the DTO and simplify the range of available community sentences . We also intend to introduce a new Intensive Supervision and Surveillance order for use with serious and persistent young offenders.

In addition there is a backlog of unmet need of 112,000 households. The London Housing Board has begun the preparation of the next long-term housing strategy for the capital to cover the period up to 2016. This will take account of the detailed housing requirements study the Greater London Authority is currently carrying out. On 21 October last year my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister announced &#163;2.1 billion for investment in housing in London for the next two years. My right hon.

<p><a name="40607w69.html_spnew0"><b> Keith Hill: </b>

<p><a name="40607w69.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 Council tax is payable on a daily basis. If a dwelling is no one&#039;s sole or main residence and is substantially unfurnished it is exempt from council tax for a period of up to six months. A dwelling which is furnished and is no one&#039;s sole or main residence is subject to council tax at a discounted rate. From the financial year 2004&#150;05, the Government have given local billing authorities the discretion to set the council tax discount offered on furnished unoccupied homes at any point between 10 per cent. and 50 per cent. This followed a consultation exercise in 2001 when there was overwhelming support for the idea of second homeowners paying full council tax on their second home. The regulations allow local authorities to differentiate between those properties which have a planning restriction preventing occupancy all year round and those which do not.
</p>

<p><a name="40607w69.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 Council tax is only payable on a domestic property which is on the valuation list. It is for the Valuation Office Agency to decide whether a dwelling should be included on the list. In doing this they would take account of the case Lewis v Christchurch Borough Council [1996] RA.229 in which 340 beach huts resting on a sand bank were found to be dwellings for the purpose of council tax and should be included separately in the valuation list. If a property is on the valuation list, the local billing authority will determine council tax liability.

Counterfeit goods are a serious threat to consumers, industry and the economy as a whole. Last year we introduced a number of very effective measures to help business tackle counterfeiting. For example we removed

The priorities for local authority trading standards departments are not uniform and will vary according to local circumstances.

<p><a name="40607w70.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what consultations he has held since January with Fire Service regional management boards.  [176972]</p>








<p><a name="40607w70.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The target date for Fire and Rescue Authorities to establish Regional Management Boards (RMBs) was 1 April 2004, after the most recent consultations&#151;on Fire and Rescue Control Rooms and on Charging by Fire and Rescue Authorities&#151;had already commenced.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w70.html_para0">
However, as joint committees, Regional Management Boards do not directly account to the electorate for the performance of the fire and rescue service. This is the responsibility of their constituent Fire and Rescue Authorities, so the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will continue formally to consult the Authorities on Government proposals.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w70.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the legal status is of the Fire Service regional management boards.  [176973]</p>








<p><a name="40607w70.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister understands that, in accordance with the guidance issued by the Local Government Association in November 2003, Regional Management Boards have been established as joint committees under Sections 101 and 102 of the Local Government Act 1972.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w70.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on progress towards establishment of new negotiating machinery within the Fire and Rescue Service.  [176974]</p>








<p><a name="40607w70.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Pay and Conditions Agreement June 2003 between the Fire Brigades Union and the Local Government Employers stated that

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;By 30th November 2003 a working group representative of fire service stakeholders will propose revisions to the Constitution of the NJC.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w70.html_para1">
The time-scale for the work was subsequently extended and a report from Rita Donaghy, chair of ACAS, recommending changes to the National Joint Council&#039;s constitution was published on 15 March. Negotiations on this are still continuing.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w70.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) if he will make a statement on the merits of <i>(a)</i> giving statutory effect to section IX, paragraph 13 of the Fire and Rescue Service&#039;s Grey Book and <i>(b)</i> indemnifying firefighters for loss due to insurance policy exclusions in respect of terrorist incidents following death or injury on duty as methods of resolving the problem faced by firefighters whose insurance contains exclusions relating to activities which they may be required to perform in the course of their duties;  [176994]

</p>



<p>(2) if he will indemnify members of fire brigades within defined limits against failure by life or disability insurers to pay out on policies held by firefighters following death or injury on duty on the grounds of policy exclusions in respect of terrorist incidents.  [176941]</p>








<p><a name="40607w70.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Conditions of Service (Grey Book) agreed by the employing authorities and the Fire Brigades&#039; Union provides in Section IX for compensation for death and serious injury on duty. This 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2004 : Column 257W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
is no fault compensation and negligence does not have to be proved. It is not appropriate for this to remain as part of the Conditions of Service and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister intends to bring these, together with injury benefits from the firefighters&#039; pension scheme, into a separate death and injury scheme which will be made under clause 33 of the Fire and Rescue Services Bill.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w70.html_para2">
There are provisions within the Conditions of Service and the Firefighters&#039; Pension Scheme that provide for awards in the event of injury or death either occurring in, or as a result of, the exercise of duty. Dependent on the circumstances of an individual, these can provide up to 85% of salary in the event of an injury curtailing earning capacity and up to seven times pensionable pay in the event of death. The latter is more generous than that available to any other public sector worker, including members of the Armed Forces.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w70.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what his latest estimate is of the total cost of implementing the strategy of regional fire control rooms, including procurements, relocation and redundancy costs.  [177001]</p>








<p><a name="40607w70.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Mott MacDonald report on the &quot;Future of Fire and Rescue Service Control Rooms in England and Wales&quot;, published on 11 December 2003, includes estimates of both the number of posts that will no longer be required and redundancy costs. Copies were made available in the Library of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w70.html_para3">
The estimated procurement cost is commercially sensitive information which cannot be released during the current procurement process. As sites for the regional control centres have not yet been chosen, relocation costs cannot yet be known.
</p>






<a name="40607w70.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Fire Safety</h3>





<p><a name="40607w70.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Amess: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what procedures are in place to consult stakeholders on the content of guidance proposed to support the implementation of the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order.  [176564]</p>








<p><a name="40607w70.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will be producing guidance documents aimed at different sectors. In each case we will be consulting with representatives of the fire industry and the enforcers and with business interests relevant to the sector covered by the guidance document. Consultation will take place as each guide is developed.


</p>







<p><a name="40607w70.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Amess: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) if he will introduce into the Building Regulations limitations on the generation of smoke and toxicity from construction materials;  [176565]

</p>



<p>(2) whether he proposes to retain compartmentation as the basis of fire protection in non-domestic buildings when Approved Document B to the Building Regulations is next reviewed;  [176566]

</p>



<p>(3) what plans he has to change the requirements for compartmentation fire protection in large warehouses in the next review of Approved Document B to the Building Regulations.  [176567]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2004 : Column 258W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40607w70.html_spnew6"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 The review of the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations in England and Wales that is now under way is considering a broad range of issues, including those that the hon. Member has mentioned. Any decision in the future with regard to changes to Approved Document B would need to take account of a range of views, expert advice and of course a full Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA). The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects to be in a position to publish a detailed public consultation paper, including a supporting draft RIA, early in 2005.
</p>






<a name="40607w70.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Firelink Radio System</h3>





<p><a name="40607w70.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Hammond: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when he expects to announce a decision on the selection of a contractor for the Firelink radio system.  [176971]</p>








<p><a name="40607w70.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 Contract award is expected in November 2004.

<p><a name="40607w70.html_wqn8"><b> Mr. Cousins: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister which former officials of the former Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions asked for permission to join <i>(a)</i> Pricewaterhouse Coopers, <i>(b)</i> Deloitte and Touche, <i>(c)</i> Ernst and Young and <i>(d)</i> KMPG.  [177505]</p>








<p><a name="40607w70.html_spnew8"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not have any record of any application covering the organisations listed above for those former Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions officials who subsequently became Office Deputy Prime Minister officials.

<p><a name="40607w70.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Denham: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the pay gap between men and women employed by his Department and its agencies in <i>(a)</i> Southampton, <i>(b)</i> Eastleigh, <i>(c)</i> Winchester and <i>(d)</i> Romsey.  [171630]</p>








<p><a name="40607w70.html_spnew9"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and its agencies do not have offices in the areas referred to but my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has ministerial responsibility for Ordnance Survey (OS) which is a non-ministerial Government Department based in Southampton.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w70.html_para4">
Ordnance Survey undertook an Equal Pay Review in mid 2002 covering all aspects of the pay system. There were no significant issues to address but Ordnance Survey is continuing to monitor the situation.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what research evidence he has on which to base his statement to the London Tenants&#039; Federation conference on 27 November that some means of transfer meets the interests of the tenants better than having stock run by councils.  [176274]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Jun 2004 : Column 263W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40607w71.html_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s research report Views on the Large Scale Voluntary Transfer Process&#151;May 2000, which is available in the Library of the House, provides evidence that tenants of LSVT associations are more satisfied with their current landlord than local authority tenants as a whole.

 Copies of the evidence submitted by local authorities, as well as other interested parties who responded to the consultation &#039;The Way Forward for Housing Capital Finance&#039;, August 2002, will be made available in the Library of the Houses.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment his Department has made of the increase in housing waiting lists in the South East; and if he will re-evaluate the Government&#039;s pledge to provide a decent home for all in the South East to take account of this increase.  [177474]</p>








<p><a name="40607w71.html_spnew6"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The number of households on local authority housing registers in the South East rose from 116,000 to 147,000 between April 2000 and April 2003. This does not, however, on its own, provide a robust assessment of housing need. This is because different criteria are adopted for inclusion in registers, some authorities operate joint registers with housing associations and some households will no longer be in housing need&#151;the frequency of checks that applicants continue to require housing differ.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w71.html_para2">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister remains committed to its targets to bring all social housing up to a decent standard by 2010 and to reduce the proportion of vulnerable private sector households living in non decent housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w71.html_para3">
Our existing target to reduce the numbers of statutorily homeless families in temporary accommodation, as part of the Public Service Agreement framework, reflects our commitment to tackling shortages in affordable housing. Funding for affordable housing has increased significantly since 2001&#150;02. Allocations for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 reflect recommendations from the South East Regional Housing Board for prioritisation for local authority areas with particular affordability or homelessness problems.

In an initial response to the findings of the Barker Review of Housing Supply, my right hon.

<p><a name="40607w72.html_wqn0"><b> Andrew George: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment his Department has made of the cost to <i>(a)</i> each of the local authorities in Cornwall and <i>(b)</i> the Council of the Isles of Scilly of meeting its obligation of monitoring, inspection, review and assessment by, for (i) the Audit Plan, (ii) the Audit Commission, (iii) the

[176730]</p>









<p><a name="40607w72.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister does not currently hold information on the cost to individual local authorities of meeting inspection and monitoring requirements. We are however committed to driving performance improvement and recognise the need to ensure that inspection and monitoring are co-ordinated, proportionate and responsive to improvement priorities of each council. We have already introduced a range of freedoms for councils linked to Comprehensive Performance Assessment. As a result &#039;excellent&#039; councils have seen significant reductions in inspection activity and the removal of all service plan requirements beyond the Best Value Performance Plans and Community Strategy. All other categories of council will have seen a 75 per cent. reduction in the number of plans overall and around a 20 per cent. reduction in the number of days inspectors spent in councils compared to 2002&#150;03. We are working with the Office for Public Sector Reform to build on this work and to develop an approach to assessing cost effectiveness and the benefits of inspection within local government.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s &#039;Key Worker Living&#039; (KWL) programme is aimed at helping to alleviate recruitment and retention&#151;where these are linked to the high cost of housing&#151;in frontline public services such as education, health and community safety. Only key workers directly employed by the public sector are eligible to apply for assistance through KWL. We have no plans to extend the programme to private sector employees.

[176828]</p>








<p><a name="40607w72.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 Regulations under the Local Government Act 2000 provide that under each local authority&#039;s code of conduct members must promote equality by not discriminating unlawfully against any person, and must treat others with respect. In addition, the amended Race Relations Act puts a statutory duty on all local authorities to promote race equality, and prepare and publish a Race Equality Scheme that must

Due to changes in the funding and functions of local authorities between 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 it is inappropriate to compare these directly. The 2003&#150;04 Formula Spending Share (FSS) and Formula Grant have therefore been adjusted to enable comparisons on a like-for-like basis. The percentage changes in both FSS and Formula Grant have been supplied for convenience.

 Mobile phone mast and base station developments near schools, hospitals and in residential areas are subject to the normal planning regulations in place throughout England, unless exempted by the regulations set out in Part 24 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO). The planning arrangements for telecommunications developments were significantly strengthened in 2001 and include improved requirements for consulting local people about mast proposals. The changes to the GPDO were underpinned by revised guidance, set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8, Telecommunications. The changes to the planning guidance also underlined that school governors must be consulted on all proposals for new masts on or near a school or college.

 The Balance Sheet of Ordnance Survey is shown in the Annual Report and Accounts. The most recent Accounts including the opinion of the Comptroller and Auditor General of the National Audit Office were published on 10July 2003 and show a value of &#163;57,919,000.

<p><a name="40607w74.html_spnew2"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no current plans to amend the structure under which private finance initiative contracts are awarded. We continue to follow Her Majesty&#039;s Treasury guidance on Private Finance Initiative.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on his policy requiring electoral registration officers to issue lists of postal voters who have voted prior to polling day in general, European, local council and regional elections and referendums; and if he will estimate the timescale for introducing such a requirement.  [159041]</p>








<p><a name="40607w74.html_spnew3"><b> Phil Hope: </b> 
 Ordinarily, our electoral arrangements do not provide for the release by returning officers, before the close of poll, of &quot;polling progress information&quot; showing lists of electors who have voted. However, political parties have tended to make arrangements to identify electors who have cast their votes at polling stations on Polling Day. Such arrangements are not possible at an all-postal election.

Against this background, some local authorities were permitted in 2002 and 2003 to provide polling progress information before the close of poll at local election pilots. The European Parliamentary and Local Elections (Pilots) Act 2004 requires that such information must be provided by returning officers in this year&#039;s four pilot regions to persons or organisations specified in the pilot order made under its provisions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w74.html_para4">
Before taking decisions about introducing such a requirement in elections or referendums more generally, we will want to have careful regard to the outcome of the pilots undertaken in this year&#039;s combined European Parliamentary and local elections and to the Electoral Commission&#039;s evaluation of those pilots.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the further report by Professors Blanchflower and Oswald on Calculating an Appropriate Regional Funding Adjustment for Worcestershire, a copy of which has been sent by the county council; and what assessment he has made of the relative pay levels of Worcestershire compared to neighbouring areas.  [177065]</p>








<p><a name="40607w74.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister have considered the further report by Professors Oswald and Blanchflower and concluded that it does not provide a case for awarding Worcestershire an area cost adjustment (ACA) top-up within the local government funding system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w74.html_para5">
The relative pay levels of Worcestershire, if they were to be considered separately, would similarly not justify an ACA factor higher than one, which is the present ACA factor for Hereford and Worcestershire.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40607w74.html_para6">
As announced in the 2001 white paper &#039;strong local leadership&#151;quality public services&#039; (CM5237) the funding formulae will be frozen for at least 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06.

<p><a name="40607w74.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 While neither my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister nor I have had any such discussions with the Standards Board, my officials have sent to the Board&#039;s Chief Executive guidance, issued by the Secretary of the Cabinet, on the conduct of business in the period before elections.
