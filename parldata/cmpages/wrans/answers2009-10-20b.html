Although both MHRA and SHOT actively encourage participation in the SHOT scheme, it is possible that not all reports to MHRA will be shared with SHOT, and there may be further clinical investigation of individual cases reported via SHOT, hence the slight discrepancy between MHRA and SHOT figures.

Many automated methods of payment such as child maintenance received from the non-resident parent by direct debit are forwarded once the banking system has cleared the funds.

The Programme Board has been reviewing the recommendations made in the strategy and, as indicated in my answer to the hon. Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) on 11 May 2009, <i> Official Report</i>, columns 521-22W, some of the recommendations are either no longer appropriate or need reviewing.

 It takes approximately six weeks for the decision of the AIT to be notified to visa sections overseas, including time taken for the UK Border Agency to decide whether to appeal against the decision. The visa section will then contact the appellant within three weeks, to request return of the passport. Once this is obtained, further checks may be carried out to ensure there has not been a change of circumstances since the decision. The visa is then issued. The visa section aims to complete the further processing as soon as possible but this will depend on the speed with which the passport is returned and the number of checks that need to be carried out. It is too early to give details on the last three months.</p>

All TA activity not directly in support of operations will therefore be stopped or reduced for the remainder of this financial year.

 The creation of a comprehensive land register for England and Wales is one of Land Registry's strategic objectives. Over 70 per cent. of England and Wales, including most urban land, is now registered in about 21 million registered titles. The registered area has increased from 45 per cent. in 2004 when data on geographic coverage first became available. This growth is principally attributable to Land Registry's strategy of persuading landowners of the benefits of voluntarily first registration.</p>

 There are different eligibility criteria for civil and criminal legal aid:</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="91020w0012.htm_para0"><a name="09102047001669">Eligibility for legal aid in civil matters depends on the client satisfying the relevant financial eligibility criteria, and the case must pass a merits test and be within the scope of the scheme. Those in receipt of income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, guarantee state pension credit or income related employment support allowance automatically qualify financially for legal aid. Otherwise, they can obtain 'free' or non-contributory assistance, if they have a gross monthly income of less than £2,657, a monthly disposable income below £315 and disposable capital of £3,000 or less. If their monthly disposable income is between £316 and £733, or disposable capital between £3,000 and £8,000, they will be offered funding on the basis that they agree to pay contributions towards their legal costs. On 6 April 2009 we increased the financial eligibility limits for civil legal aid by 5 per cent. to their current level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="91020w0012.htm_para1"><a name="09102047001670">The merits test considers whether legal aid applicants have reasonable grounds for taking, defending or being a party to proceedings, and that it is reasonable, in the particular circumstances of the case, for legal aid to be granted.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="91020w0012.htm_para2"><a name="09102047001671">Eligibility for legal aid in criminal trials depends on the defendant satisfying the 'Interests of Justice' test and the relevant financial eligibility criteria. Suspects being held at the police station as part of a criminal investigation are automatically entitled to legal advice, regardless of income; this may be provided on a 'face to face' basis under the police station duty solicitor scheme, or for less serious offences, via a national telephone helpline.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="91020w0012.htm_para3"><a name="09102047001672">The income-based means test for defendants appearing before the magistrates court weights the applicant's gross annual income to reflect their family and household circumstances. If an applicant's weighted gross annual income exceeds £22,325, they are financially ineligible for a grant of representation; if it is £12,475 or less, they are financially eligible for a grant of representation. All applicants in receipt of income support, income-based jobseeker's allowance, or the guaranteed state pension credit are automatically deemed financially eligible, as are applicants under the age of 18.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="91020w0012.htm_para4"><a name="09102047001673">For those applicants whose adjusted gross annual incomes fall between the two thresholds, a more detailed assessment of their income is carried out. After certain deductions are made, if the applicant's disposable income does not exceed £3,398, they will be financially eligible under the new scheme.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families with reference to the Ofsted report entitled Learning lessons from serious case reviews: year 2, what steps he is taking in respect of those serious case reviews which were found to be inadequate. [294639]</p>

<p><a name="st_358"><a name="09102066000311"><a name="91020w0018.htm_spnew11"><a name="09102066002683"><b>Dawn Primarolo:</b>
 Since 1 December 2008 all Local Safeguarding Children Boards responsible for serious case reviews which have been judged inadequate convene an independently chaired panel to reconsider the review before sending a report to the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families, and copied to Ofsted, which addresses the review's inadequacies. This process was applied retrospectively to all serious case reviews which Ofsted had evaluated as inadequate, as well as to those receiving an inadequate judgment after 1 December. Ofsted reported that 62 out of the 63 reports received by 31 March 2009 following inadequate SCRs were judged to be satisfactory. A further report was requested in respect of the one inadequate report; the revised version was judged by Ofsted as satisfactory. Ofsted noted in their report that the reconsiderations had resulted in greatly strengthened reviews and valuable lessons learnt with regard to safeguarding practice. These arrangements are reflected in new draft guidance currently subject to public consultation (chapter 8 of "Working Together to Safeguard Children").</p>

<i> [holding answer 20 July 2009]: </i>The DCSF does not publish any estimates of pupil mobility. Estimates of pupil mobility in primary and secondary schools are provided here using the mobility indicators that form part of the DCSF's Contextual Value Added (CVA) models. These identify pupils as mobile if they join a school at non standard times. Only pupils at the end of Key Stage 2 and the end of Key Stage 4 in 2007/08 are included in the figures. A copy of these tables has been placed in the Libraries.</p>

 This information requested is available only at disproportionate cost due to the complexity of the computations and assumptions involved.
