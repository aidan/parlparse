 TV Licensing's inquiry officers have no authority to enter any premises without the owner's or occupier's consent, unless authorised to do so by a search warrant issued by a justice of the peace in England, Wales or Northern Ireland or, in Scotland, a sheriff. Under section 15(1) of the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1949 (as amended), a justice of the peace or a sheriff may issue a warrant if satisfied by information on oath that there is reasonable ground for suspecting that an offence under the Act has been or is being committed, and that evidence of the commission of the offence is to be found on the premises specified. The Government consider that this provides adequate safeguards and therefore have no plans to amend the 1949 Act.

Overall command of this operation remained at all times in Russian hands. The decision on whether or not to deploy the LR5 depended on an inspection of the Kursk by specialist Norwegian divers. Tragically, following that inspection, the Russian authorities confirmed that all on board the Kursk had died. The LR5 was not therefore required and the Royal Navy Submarine Search and Rescue Service was withdrawn.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what provisions have been made to ensure family contact on 25 December, 31 December and 1 January 2001 for those members of the armed forces who will be separated from their families on these dates; and if he will make a statement.  [139758]<P>

<a name="01130w04.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 We attach great importance to service personnel deployed on overseas operations being able to keep in touch with their families throughout the year. It is for this reason that personnel deployed on operations are given 20 minutes' publicly funded telephone time each week. Previous concerns about the adequacy and reliability of the welfare telephone services in some overseas theatres have been resolved by the introduction of Project Welcome. This welfare telephone service is deployed in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Italy, Kosovo, Bosnia and Sierra Leone and aboard some of the operationally deployed ships and RFAs (Royal Fleet Auxiliaries). Free blueys (aerogrammes), e-blueys and concessionary parcel rates are also provided. We are also in the process of introducing free access to e-mail facilities.
<P>

<a name="01130w04.html_para2">Meetings have been held with the contractor responsible for providing the operational telephone welfare service (Project Welcome) to ensure that it is robust enough to cope with the extra demand that will be placed on it over the Christmas period. Measures to give service personnel on operations extra concessionary rates over the Christmas period, for calls beyond their free allowance, are also under consideration.
<P>

<a name="01130w04.html_para3">For ships at sea who are not covered by Project Welcome funding has been secured to provide personnel with 10 minutes free call time over the Christmas period.

 The decision of the Army Board reflects the view of an employer about the future service of two employees. Queen's Regulations allow for the retention of individuals who have received a custodial sentence where there are exceptional reasons that make retention desirable. The Board gave the fullest possible consideration to all of the relevant circumstances of the case before coming to its decision. This is a confidential matter for the employer, the Army, and the employees. Given the degree of public interest we have been as open as we could be about the Board proceedings and we have confirmed the outcome. To go further than that, and to release the Determination of summary of its contents, which inevitably covers matters personal to the soldiers, would clearly be inappropriate.

<a name="01130w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Early in the 1990-1991 Gulf conflict, the Ministry of Defence decided that the DU-based tank round should be brought into service to give our forces a better capability against Iraqi tanks. At the same time a bulletin was produced setting out safety procedures. Explosive ordnance disposal personnel, whose work entailed a direct risk of significant exposure, were provided with detailed instructions on the precautions that they should take to protect their health. Instructions were also issued to Ordnance Corps personnel involved in the handling, transportation and storage of the ammunition. It appears that tank crews and other personnel were not issued with such advice. This omission was publicly recognised by MOD in July 1993.
<P>

<a name="01130w05.html_para2">More recently, a copy of a signal message dated 25 February 1991, from the MOD to one Armoured Division in Saudi Arabia, has been found.

 A number of precautionary operating restrictions have been put in place on the use of the Warrior Armoured Vehicle. Over the past nine months there have been three separate incidents of a failure in the drive shaft system of Warrior vehicles. Damage has also been found in a further four vehicles following a fleet-wide inspection programme that was initiated following a failure in February. The most recent failure occurred on 17 November 2000. Prior to this year Warrior had experienced only two similar failures since entering service in 1987.
<P>

<a name="01130w05.html_para4">The particular problem concerns the universal joint of the drive shaft system. On each occasion the joint has broken causing a loss of drive, braking and steering to the left-hand track of the vehicle. In view of the potential safety implications of further failures restrictions have been introduced. The main restrictions are the introduction of a 30 kph speed limit, limited use on public roads and an increase in the frequency of inspections.
<P>

<a name="01130w05.html_para5">Work on a technical solution is well advanced and trials of a modification are under way. If these trials prove successful, delivery and fitting of modified drive shafts is expected to begin in March 2001 with all 786 vehicles expected to be converted by August 2001.

 The Army monitors centrally only statistics of those who have been tried by court martial. Records of those who appear in civilian courts are held at individual regiments and to interrogate those would incur disproportionate costs. We are aware, however, of two people who have been retained in the Army following a conviction of murder in a civilian court. Any murder committed in the UK or Cyprus comes under the jurisdiction of the civil police and is tried in a civilian court. Any murder committed in Germany would, however, be subject to court martial action. No soldier has been tried for murder, by court martial, in the last five years.

 Combating sex tourism is one aspect of a wider set of issues in which poor people--particularly young women and children--are vulnerable to the interests of the sex industry, national and international trafficking and associated illegal activities. It is an international problem which requires internationally coordinated action. Much of our focus is on reducing the vulnerability of young people being recruited into this industry. With other Government Departments, we are supporting efforts of regional and international agencies to combat trafficking, strengthen law enforcement and improve the mechanisms for prosecution of those who commit sex offences abroad.

This year, for example, we have worked with the Save the Children Fund, the British Red Cross, the International Committee of the Red Cross, Medecins sans Frontieres and Oxfam. Our assistance has focused mainly on emergency health and nutrition, and water and sanitation.

 Figures from the Office of National Statistics show that before the Government introduced the new law in April 1999, around 1.5 million workers were earning less than the minimum wage. By spring this year, that figure had fallen to 300,000. And many of those 300,000 are in receipt of training or accommodation, where lower rates can legitimately be applied.

<a name="01130w07.html_para4">But poverty among those with jobs is only part of the problem and the national minimum wage is only part of the solution.

<P>
<a name="01130w08.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 A key aim of the Government's White Paper, "Excellence and Opportunity: a science and innovation policy for the 21st century", which was published in July of this year, is to strengthen the links between business and universities to realise the business opportunities offered by science. The White Paper sets out a range of measures to support these stronger links which build on the success of schemes such as Science Enterprise Centres to bring business skills into the curriculum and University Challenge to provide seed funding. These will provide our scientists and engineers with more incentives and skills, and strengthen the links between them and industry, so that they can play a greater role in wealth creation.
<P>

<a name="01130w08.html_para4">The White Paper announced a Higher Education Innovation Fund of &#163;140 million over three years to further enhance university-business knowledge transfer. This will triple existing HEROBAC funding by the third year. It will be a permanent funding stream to build on universities' potential as drivers of growth in the knowledge economy, and will, therefore, help universities to respond to the needs of business--especially SMEs. We are also providing funding for one more round of University Challenge and putting &#163;15 million more into Science Enterprise Centres. We are also doubling the number of new starts for Faraday Partnerships, from four to eight a year, to link the science base to business networks.

 New guidance announced on 9 August, which is available on the Cabinet Office website, includes a number of important advances on previous practice. Civil servants are required to prepare an initial regulatory impact assessment early in the policy-making process before Ministers consider regulatory and non-regulatory policy options. As the policy develops, the guidance requires more thorough assessment of costs and benefits of proposals throughout the lifetime of the policy in

We are aware that energy supply companies, including Northern, are in the process of writing to all their non-domestic customers, forewarning them of the inclusion of the climate change levy on their energy bills following 1 April 2001. The climate change levy is intended to increase energy efficiency across all sectors of business, and will help the UK to meet its Kyoto targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and move towards our domestic goal to cut CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions by 20 per cent. Some of the revenues from the levy will be used for energy efficiency initiatives which will help small businesses.

Such payments do not apply to offices for which the post office remuneration is less than &#163;14,000 a year. I have asked the Post Office to consider whether more can be done to make the contractual terms and arrangements more flexible and attractive to prospective subpostmasters.

 The Department of Trade and Industry has responsibility for two organisations which conduct scientific research: the National Physical Laboratory (a government-owned, contractor-operated organisation) and the UK Atomic Energy Authority (a non-departmental public body; NDPB).
<P>

<a name="01130w10.html_para0">DTI also has accounting officer responsibilities for the Research Councils which are established as seven separate NDPBs.

<a name="01130w10.html_para1">The budgets for 2000-01 are necessarily estimates. The figures given are the estimated total budgets for the individual organisations. These estimates will typically include predicted income from a number of different sources including other parts of the public sector, the private sector and international sources. The estimated income will not all be directed to the funding for research as the same organisations also carry out other functions of a technical nature (this is particularly the case for UKAEA).

 My Department has just completed a revised set of energy projections for the UK.

<P>

<a name="01130w10.html_para2">The DTI makes no projections of oil demand outside of the UK. Some bodies make such projections, principally the International Energy Agency and the European Commission. The latter's baseline scenario projects modest growth in the use of oil.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The gas from the UK Continental Shelf would be suitable as a feedstock for gas to distillates technology. The exploitation of this technology would depend on the business case for this process in a UK context. The UK does not have significant reserves of either of the other two sources.

 All the magnox reactors in the United Kingdom, with the exception of those at Chapelcross, are subject to Euratom safeguards and to the terms of the UK/Euratom/IAEA safeguards agreement. These safeguards arrangements are designed to detect the diversion of nuclear material from its declared civil uses. The announcement of the outcome of the Strategic Defence Review (SDR) in July 1998 included a commitment that all planned future reprocessing would be carried out under safeguards. All such reprocessing of irradiated magnox fuel, including that from Chapelcross, is therefore subject to the safeguards arrangements described above.

At the High Court hearing in Sheffield two weeks ago Mr. Justice Turner, the High Court judge with responsibility for the British Coal respiratory litigation, praised the efforts and commitment of all concerned to improve the progress on what is the largest personal injury litigation ever in the UK, while recognising that significant improvements still needed to be made.

These directives are designed to ensure that radio, electronic and electrical equipment can co-exist in the electromagnetic environment.

<a name="01130w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 At the Amsterdam Council in 1997 and in two further Council decisions in 1998 and 1999, it was unanimously agreed by EU member states that when the ECSC expires in July 2002 its assets should be transferred to the European Community budget and used to fund research into the coal and steel sectors. These industries fully support this decision since the ECSC's assets derive from the ECSC levy paid by them until 1997. The Legal Services of the Council of the EU have advised that such a transfer cannot be achieved under the Treaty Establishing the European Community as it stands, as there is no legal provision for it. Member states all agree that the forthcoming inter-governmental conference meeting in Nice should be invited to adopt, as part of the Nice Treaty, a protocol which will be attached to the Treaty Establishing the European Community. This will enable the transfer to take place. Parliament will be asked to ratify the protocol before it comes into force.

 The Department conducts a quarterly survey of 1,200 manufacturing companies in Great Britain, the results of which are published in "Energy Trends". Data collected by the survey for Quarter 2 2000 indicate that extra large industrial users of electricity, i.e. those consuming more than 150,000 kWh per annum, pay 2.57p/kWh.
<P>

<a name="01130w13.html_para0">The average price of electricity for extra large industrial consumers has fallen continually in real terms over the past five years. Between Q2 1995 and Q2 2000 the average price paid by extra large industrial consumers had decreased by nearly 25 per cent. in real terms.
<P>

<a name="01130w13.html_para1">The New Electricity Trading Arrangements (NETA) will put significant downward pressure on electricity prices. Indeed, in anticipation of NETA, forward prices for 2001 are already 30 per cent. lower in real terms than in 1998. The programme of plant divestment by major electricity generators has also contributed to these price reductions.

 During the period 31 March 1999 to 31 March 2000, a special adviser travelled abroad on official business on one occasion--on a visit to the Netherlands on Millennium Bug business. The total cost of this visit was &#163;936. The cost of this visit was accounted for in expenditure on Ministers' travel overseas published by the Prime Minister on 28 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 968W, which for 1999-2000 was &#163;4.6 million compared to &#163;7.9 million for the last year of the previous Administration.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the contribution made by <i>(a)</i> UK-based airlines and <i>(b)</i> UK airports to greenhouse gas emissions; and what contributions they are expected to make to help the UK reach its Kyoto targets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The UK reports its emissions as required by internationally agreed reporting guidelines, including greenhouse gas emissions. In 1998 greenhouse gas emissions from civil aviation movements entirely within the UK were 0.95 MtC. Under the Kyoto Protocol, emissions from international flights are not allocated to individual countries. Emissions from UK airports are not reported separately. The UK total greenhouse gas emissions in 1998 were 192.65 MtC.
<P>

<a name="01130w13.html_para4">Details of action being taken, both in the UK and internationally to reduce future aviation emissions, will be set out in the UK's climate change programme to be published shortly. It is not possible to quantify the contribution that the results of this action may make to achieving the UK's Kyoto target. But in any event action in other areas of the transport sector and in other sectors of the economy is expected to achieve the target and move the UK towards its domestic goal to cut emissions of carbon dioxide by 20 per cent. by 2010.
<P>

<a name="01130w13.html_para5">In keeping with the requirements of the Kyoto Protocol, the UK is working within the International Civil Aviation Organisation on measures to reduce emissions from international civil aviation. Options include technological and operational improvements and market-based incentives. An ICAO decision on policy options is expected in autumn 2001.
<P>

<a name="01130w13.html_para6">The UK supports an emissions trading scheme in the long term and an emissions charge in the meantime.

 <i>[holding answer 2 November 2000]:</i> The business case for HSE's Yorkshire and North East Accommodation Review was co-ordinated by Jim Sykes, Head of the region's Specialist Group. A document entitled "Accommodation Review: Yorkshire and North East Region" setting out a range of options was prepared for internal use. Since it was believed that none of the accommodation changes identified would affect the level of service provided by HSE, the report was not circulated outside HSE. A copy of this document is, however, now being placed in the Libraries of the House, and is being sent to trade unions and employers in the Humberside region. No record exists of the cost of preparing the business case, but it is estimated that the document

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent decisions he has made about <i>(a)</i> the private sector operating in the London Underground and <i>(b)</i> running the deep-level underground; what consultations he has held on these matters with the London Mayor and the Greater London Authority; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="01130w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Some Underground support functions, such as cleaning, are already contracted out to the private sector. We have no plans, however, for private sector operation of core train or station functions, or running of the Underground, as proposed by the opposition. We are continuing to make progress with the public-private partnership, which will leave operations in the hands of the public sector and bring in the private sector to invest in maintaining and upgrading the infrastructure. Ministers have had several meetings with the Mayor and the GLA on the subject of the Underground.

The remaining consultancy work required on the project has now become clearer and London Transport estimate that the final amount should be around &#163;92 million. I can also report, pursuant to my answer to the hon. Member for Eltham (Mr. Efford) of 18 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 252W, that the consultancy expenditure incurred by London Transport to 31 March 2000 was over-stated at &#163;60.3 million and should have been reported as &#163;59.6 million.

 At present, all households aged 60 or more and in receipt of Income Support, Council Tax Benefit, Housing Benefit or income-based Job Seekers Allowance are eligible for the higher tier of grants available under the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES) for England. This higher tier is in recognition of the particular difficulties faced by low-income older households. In total, we estimate that over 3.7 million older households--some 60 per cent. of all such households--are eligible for grants up to &#163;2,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what regulations govern the installation of mobile phone transmission equipment as it relates to human health.  [140464]<P>

<P>
<a name="01130w15.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There are no specific regulations governing the installation of mobile phone transmission equipment as it relates to health. However, telecommunications operators have a duty under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and the Management of the Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to ensure that so far as is reasonably practicable, their work activities--which would include the installation and operation of their equipment--do not expose people to risks to their health and safety.
<P>

<a name="01130w15.html_para6">The Government's statutory adviser, the National Radiological Protection Board, has published guidelines on limiting exposure to electromagnetic radiation. All mobile phone transmission equipment should meet these guidelines. Following publication of the Stewart report on mobile phones and health in May 2000, the Government accepted that, as a precautionary measure, the emissions from mobile phone base stations should meet the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure as expressed in the EU Council Recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0Hz to 300GHz). Most base stations already meet the ICNIRP guidelines and all new base stations will do so.

 The recently completed Driver Fatigue project included an investigation of sleep related vehicle accidents occurring on certain motorways. About 25 per cent. of the sleep related vehicle accidents occurring on these motorways were work related (ie involving commercial vehicles). This type of accident occurs more often between 0200 hrs. and 0700 hrs. suggesting that night workers are particularly vulnerable, as are those driving home after a night shift, in the early morning and after the shift has lasted 12 hours.

 Flytipping is not defined in legislation but the term is generally used to refer to the illegal disposal of waste on sites which have neither a waste management licence nor a registered exemption from licensing--in contravention of sections 33 or 34 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. However, it is also an offence under section 33 to dispose of waste in contravention of a licence. The available data do not separately identify the two different types of offences committed under section 33 and the following information therefore includes offences other than flytipping.
<P>

<a name="01130w15.html_para9">The Environment Agency advises that in the time available to answer the question it is unable to provide a list of those prosecuted specifically under sections 33 or 34 of the 1990 Act in the London area in 1999 and 2000.

 There are strict controls in place to ensure that waste is disposed of without danger to the public or the environment. The responsibility for the investigation of any alleged breaches of these controls and subsequent enforcement action rests with the Environment Agency and, in some circumstances, with local authorities as waste collection authorities. Any evidence of flytipping, including the involvement of criminal gangs, should be reported to the Environment Agency so that it may undertake relevant investigations.

<P>

<P>
<a name="01130w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The maximum penalties for flytipping of waste are already severe--an unlimited fine and up to five years' imprisonment on conviction in a Crown Court--and the Government have no plans to increase them. The courts are independent of the Government and it is for them to determine the penalties they impose, within the terms of the relevant legislation, and to ensure that sentences fully reflect the gravity of offences which damage the environment.
<P>

<a name="01130w15.html_para16">However, it is the Government's view that severe penalties should be imposed for significant breaches of environmental law. The Government's response to the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee's Reports on the Environment Agency (2000) and on the Operation of the Landfill Tax (1999) made this clear and set out the action being taken to ensure that the Courts are fully aware of the Government's concern about this issue.

<P>
<a name="01130w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government currently have no plans to review the legislation on flytipping. However, the FlyTipping Forum which brings together the Government, the Environment Agency, local authorities, the National Farmers' Union, the Country Landowners Association and other national organisations is addressing the specific problem of flytipping on farms. It is assessing the scale of the problem, and will look at how the enforcement agencies can work more effectively together, including the pursuit of offenders and more effective deterrence. The Government will then consider the results of this research and any recommendations which the Forum may make.

 Local authorities' responsibilities for flytipping are funded through the Revenue Support Grant. Substantial extra resources--an increase of &#163;1,127 million by 2003-04--will help fund environmental, protective and cultural services. Local authorities will set their own priorities for the use of these resources.

<a name="01130w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Environment Agency's emergency hotline (0800 80 70 60) plays an important role in alerting the Agency to all types of environmental incidents--including flytipping.

 The Environment Agency received 30 reports of fly tipping incidents on their 24 hour emergency telephone hotline (0800 80 70 60) in the period from 31 March 1999 to 1 April 2000. The hotline is used for the reporting of all environmental incidents and the Agency does not collate data on how many prosecutions result from the public's use of it. However, I have asked the Agency whether it is possible to establish how many of the 30 reported flytipping incidents have resulted in prosecutions. I will write to my hon.

The paper was designed to stimulate a positive discussion among WTO members on the nature of the problem and what our aims should be in clarifying the relationship. It discusses the need for some form of WTO accommodation mechanism for trade measures mandated by MEAs. An option for this mechanism considered by the paper is "reversal of the burden of proof" under Article XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (the General Exceptions clause), which would require that any party challenging a mandated

 Responsibility for the maintenance of the 'symbol' diversion signs from the M25 in Essex rests with the highway authority of the road on which the sign is placed. For trunk roads my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, the Environment and Regions is Highway Authority and the Highways Agency acts on his behalf. The Highways Agency maintains the signs in accordance with an agreed code of practice. For other roads the local authority takes responsibility and Agents act on its behalf.

 The only estimate made by the Secretary of State for installing the Train Protection and Warning System (TPWS) was as part of the regulatory impact assessment for the Railway Safety Regulations 1999, laid in the House in August 1999. This showed an estimated cost ranging between &#163;130-&#163;155 million. The Secretary of State has not made an estimate of the cost for installing Automatic Train Protection (ATP). More recent industry estimates suggest that the figure will be closer to &#163;330 million for TPWS and in the order of &#163;2 billion for ATP.

 NATS has an ongoing programme to recruit and train new air traffic controllers for NATS units throughout the UK. There is no shortage of staff to meet operational requirements in Area Control operations at the London Area and Terminal Control Centre at West Drayton in 2001. In addition, NATS has a full complement of 255 controllers to meet current operational requirement in the Terminal Control operation at West Drayton, although a slight shortfall, 10 to 14 controllers, is expected after the introduction of two new air traffic sectors in spring 2001.

This overbearing has been in place for some time in order to meet development requirements at the New En-Route Centre. Next year the overbearing will be used to provide cover for the operational conversion training programme. By June 2001, the actual number of controllers is anticipated to increase to 374.

<P>
<a name="01130w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Working Group of the Review of Marine Nature Conservation was originally due to report its findings to Ministers by the end of this year. However, since that timetable was agreed the Review's Terms of Reference have been extended to include consideration of issues beyond UK Territorial Waters to the limit of UK jurisdiction. In view of this, the timetable for reporting on the outcome of the Review has been extended and the Working Group is now expected to report on its consideration of issues to the extent of UK Territorial Waters during the first quarter of next year. The Working Group's final report, taking into account issues to the limit of UK jurisdiction, will be presented to Ministers by the end of summer next year.

 My right hon.

Detailed arrangements will be subject to consultation with the motoring organisations.

<a name="01130w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has not received any representations from rural post offices regarding climate change levy charges. The climate change levy will take effect on 1 April 2001 and will apply to all of the non domestic sector. The levy will play a major role in helping the UK to meet its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of progress towards achieving his target of

a 28 per cent. increase in the recovery and recycling of packaging materials up to the end of 2001; and if he will make a statement.  [141179]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w21.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 When the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 Regulations came into force, recovery was at 30 per cent. of which recycling made up around 27 per cent. By the end of 1999 we had reached 38 per cent. recovery and we expect to reach 50 per cent. in 2001 in line with the EC Directive target. We are already meeting the Directive's recycling target of 25 per cent.
<P>

<a name="01130w21.html_para4">Businesses obligated under the packaging Regulations have been working towards the target levels of packaging waste recovery in the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste since the Regulations came into force in 1997. The Directive requires the UK to recover 50 per cent. of packaging waste by 2001. In our estimation, the UK's recovery of packaging waste will have to increase from around 38 per cent. at the end of 1999 to reach 50 per cent. in 2001, i.e. an increase of some 12 percentage points or, in tonnage terms, just over one million tonnes. We would expect further progress to be made in the course of 2000 but final figures for 2000 will not be available until mid 2001.

 In the three full years in which the recovery and recycling obligations under the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 have been in effect, the recovery and recycling infrastructure in the UK has had to develop to deal with increasing amounts of reprocessing in order to meet interim targets under the Regulations.

The UK recovery and recycling infrastructure will therefore have to deliver some 4.65 million tonnes of packaging waste recovery next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what powers he has to set limits on domestic air fares; and if he will make a statement.  [141171]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w22.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Domestic air fares in the UK are subject to Council Regulation 2409/92 on fares and rates for air services, which provides for Community air carriers to set fares at the levels they wish and to enter the markets they wish without restriction. The Regulation allows member states to withdraw a basic fare which is considered, in the 



<P>
<P><I>30 Nov 2000 : Column: 797W</I><P>
light of all relevant factors, to be excessively high in relation to the costs of providing the service, and to take action against predatory pricing.
<P>

<a name="01130w22.html_para2">These provisions do not apply to fares established by public service obligation in accordance with Council Regulation 2408/92 on access by Community air carriers to intra-Community air routes. Member states may impose a public service obligation in respect of scheduled air services to an airport serving peripheral or development regions within its territory, or on a thin route to any regional airport, such route being considered vital for the economic development of the region, to the extent necessary to ensure the adequate provision of services satisfying fixed standards of continuity, regularity, capacity and pricing, which standards air carriers would not assume if they were solely considering their commercial interest, and may reimburse carriers for meeting these standards. A public service obligation may therefore include a tariff obligation limiting fare levels or requiring concessionary fares for certain categories of passenger.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Department (together with MAFF's Pesticides Safety Directorate) provides the secretariat for the Pesticides Forum which brings together organisations with an interest in the use of pesticides and their impact. The Forum's primary purpose is to advise on and promote responsible pesticide use. The Government have been exploring with the agrochemical industry whether the objective of minimising the adverse environmental impact of pesticide use could be achieved through a partnership approach. The industry has proposed a package of voluntary measures, but the Government believe these still fail to meet a number of concerns raised in the recent consultation exercise. The Government would like to see further improvements and will be holding discussions with the Crop Protection Association on developing a more substantial package in the run up to Budget 2001.

 This incident was investigated by the Department's Air Accidents Investigation Branch and copies of their report, which was published on 2 November, have been placed in the Library. As the aircraft involved in this incident was on the US aircraft register and operated by a US airline, it is regulated by the US Federal Aviation Administration and not the Civil Aviation Authority. The majority of the recommendations contained in the report were addressed to the aircraft manufacturer and the FAA. However, the CAA has accepted recommendations 99-50 and 99-51 and has initiated appropriate action.

 In Great Britain, V85/1 and V11 licence renewal reminders that have or will be sent to hauliers in respect of licences expiring at the end of November and December 2000 have already been produced and quote the full rate of Vehicle Excise Duty. However, when hauliers apply for a new licence using these forms at one of DVLA's local offices, the lower rate will be applied. Reminder issues from January 2001 will quote the lower rate. Similar arrangements will apply in Northern Ireland.

<P>
<a name="01130w24.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2000]:</i> Child care support for parents in learning is a key component of Government action to increase participation in education and training. Those in training in Great Britain are primarily assisted by the New Deal programme, including the New Deal for Lone Parents, and through Career Development Loans. Where trainees receive a wage, they are eligible, under the normal rules, for Working Families Tax Credit. Students in full-time further education may also be assisted by these two schemes and through the Access Funds and the Childcare Support Fund (England only). For students in higher education, this year we have introduced a Mature Students Bursary, paid through universities' and colleges' Access Funds, of up to &#163;1,000 a year, which is intended for the additional costs such as child care or travel that mature students incur. Students with children are also eligible for age-related child dependants grants and for the institutions' Hardship Funds which provide sources of funding for child care costs.
<P>

<a name="01130w24.html_para7">Expenditure for 2001-2002 on the schemes of support for those in training and in further education will be announced shortly.

 To date 448,228 people have opened an Individual Learning Account in England.

<a name="01130w25.html_para1">The further information requested is contained in the following tables. This relates solely to accounts opened under the national framework of individual learning accounts and reflects account usage from September 2000. The breakdown is not available nationally in relation to the 192,615 accounts opened through Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs)/Chamber of Commerce Training and Enterprise (CCTE) before the national framework was launched. Of the 255,613 accounts opened under the national framework, 78,314 account holders are currently using their accounts. This understates the position as there are two factors which result in a difference between the number of accounts opened and the number being used. People need to open their accounts before booking their learning, and learning providers have up to 42 days in which to notify the Individual Learning Account Centre of learning being undertaken by ILA holders.

<P>
<a name="01130w25.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Our investment in education includes several initiatives that will help to support the improvement of schools' ICT infrastructure. Our main programme is the National Grid for Learning, which is supporting a total of over &#163;1 billion of publicly funded expenditure, including &#163;657 million between 1998 and 2002 (including &#163;205 million in 2000-01, and &#163;245 million in 2001-02), and a further &#163;710 million between 2002 and 2004. This will ensure that all schools are able to reach a common threshold of access to ICT, and to progress beyond this.
<P>

<a name="01130w25.html_para4">In addition, several other initiatives support ICT-related expenditure, including technology colleges and City Learning Centres (which provide state-of-the-art ICT-based learning opportunities for pupils and the wider community) and Education Action Zones and Excellence Clusters (which may use ICT as part of a package of measures to address under-performance). With the exception of City Learning Centres, private sector sponsorship supports each of these initiatives, but it is not possible to predict how much sponsorship will become available during this period.

<a name="01130w25.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The e-Learning Foundation will help the Government's drive to bridge the digital divide by providing children from low income families and in disadvantaged areas with portable computers and internet access to learning materials. The initiative runs in parallel with the National Grid for Learning's programme of connecting all schools to the web by 2002 and improving pupil/computer ratios in schools. 98 per cent. of all secondary schools and 86 per cent. of all primary schools are already connected to the internet.
<P>

<a name="01130w25.html_para5">The initiative is a partnership between Government, community groups and the private sector. Local e-Learning Foundations across the country will engage parents, the local business community and other major sponsors in funding equipment for disadvantaged children in that community. The national e-Learning Foundation is charged with brokering contributions from the corporate business sector.
<P>

<a name="01130w25.html_para6">Specific targets for private sector contributions will be agreed between the national e-Learning Foundation and my Department's officials in due course.
<P>

<a name="01130w25.html_para7">E-Learning Foundations can operate at a range of different levels; for example, an individual school, a group of schools, or a wider community foundation. LEAs may wish to run their own foundation, as has happened in the case of Nottingham local authority.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2000]:</i> Between 1989-90 and 1996-97, under the previous Government, the unit public funding for higher education students in England fell by 36 per cent. In 1997, the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education chaired by Lord Dearing stated that planned further rapid reductions in unit funding were not achievable without putting quality unacceptably at risk, and that efficiency improvements should be limited to 1 per cent. a year for the following two years. The present Government agreed with and followed Lord Dearing's recommendation. Now, for the first time in over a decade, there will be a real-terms increase in funding per student in 2001-02, and that level of funding will be sustained in the following two years.

 The Department does not use the phrase "high specification" computers or provide a minimum technical specification of computers suitable for use in schools since this will change continually as technology develops. It is also important that schools are able to choose the ICT that they consider most appropriate to improve educational opportunities for their pupils. The Department therefore provides schools with advice and guidance so that they are able to plan, procure and use ICT effectively. In doing so they are able to make reference to appropriate functional specifications for networking, hardware, software and content, training and support that have been agreed as the basis for NGfL (National Grid for Learning) Managed Services.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Corporate Services and Development Directorate:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Corporate Services and Development Directorate is responsible for the delivery of value-for-money services within the Department, covering information technology, human resources, facilities management and procurement.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Government Offices for the Regions:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The role of Government Offices is to manage programmes on behalf of parent Departments, to support and facilitate effective linkages between partners and programmes and to inform the development of Departments' policies from the regional perspective.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Finance and Analytical Services Directorate:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Finance and Analytical Services Directorate covers a broad range of work aimed at ensuring good value for money from the Department's resources. This includes securing and allocating the resources needed to deliver the Department's overall aim and objectives through the regular Spending Reviews. Policy work is also supported by the analytical teams who produce statistical reports, including production of the school performance tables on which school improvement is measured; provide an evidence base on which the whole Department can depend; and commission and manage research aimed at informing policy development. All of this will help us to get our priorities right and ensure that we make the most of our limited resources.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Strategy and Communications Directorate:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>SCD is responsible for effectively developing the Department's strategy at national, regional and local levels, and ensuring that it is communicated with target audiences across everything DfEE does. SCD manages DfEE policy interests with Government Offices and Regional Development Agencies, and sponsors closer working by the rest of DfEE with employers. It also has responsibility for cross-Government initiatives including those on social exclusion and regeneration, and manages relationships with the public whether through correspondence, telephone or Internet.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="01130w27.html_para2">The Department aims to deliver high quality public services as part of a modernised civil service. Against this background we have created a unit to drive forward a continuous improvement strategy that encompasses: a programme of Better Quality Services reviews to assess whether our current delivery arrangements are the best available; "Identifying Efficiency Action" reviews which are incisive scrutinies of a range of the Department's activities that offer scope for efficiency action; and the promotion of the European Foundation For Quality Management Model and Benchmarking in the development of Divisional Improvement Plans. These reviews are key in moving resources to deal with new pressures.

 Firstly, can I make clear that claims for Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) are not subject to disqualifications. Sanctions replaced disqualifications when JSA replaced Unemployment Benefit (UB) in 1996.
<P>

<a name="01130w28.html_para2">Information on the numbers and types of decisions given by Employment Service Officers on labour market questions are published in the "Analysis of Sector Decision Making" (formerly known as the "Analysis of Adjudication Officers' Decisions"), copies of which are held in the House of Commons Library.

<P>

<a name="01130w28.html_para4">You may wish to note a number of factors underlying the figures set out in this letter. First, the total number of JSA claimants was falling over the period set out. Secondly, during the period October 1996 to March 1997 a number of claimants continued to receive UB as a transitional arrangement, and were liable to disqualification rather than a JSA sanction.
<P>

<a name="01130w28.html_para5">From the introduction of JSA in October 1996 to September 1997, the Employment Service Annual Performance Agreement (APA) included a target for referrals to adjudication officers on a number of grounds including Refusal of Employment. After a period of piloting, this was replaced in April 1999 by a new Labour Market Activity Target which, among other factors, measured the extent to which possible cases of RE had been appropriately followed up. The higher figure in the first quarter of 2000 reflects a period when a backlog of cases from the previous quarter was identified and referred for a formal decision. Figures for RE sanctions imposed during the period July to September 2000 are due to be lodged in the Library of the House by the end of December.

<a name="01130w30.html_para0">This answer refers to England only, as Sure Start in Wales is a devolved issue and a matter for the Welsh Assembly. To date in England, 122 Sure Start programmes have been established in areas of disadvantage, with a further 72 under development. Sure Start programmes are not 'proposed' by local district authorities. Rather, districts with high levels of deprivation are identified and local partnerships in these 



<P>
<P><I>30 Nov 2000 : Column: 824W</I><P>
areas, comprising of representatives from statutory, voluntary and community bodies, are invited to develop a Sure Start programme in their area. The 194 programmes referred to above are in the 152 local authority districts in England listed and are located in all types of area: urban; semi-urban; semi-rural and rural. Sure Start programmes are targeted on the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods and thus all address deprivation. The following table indicates the type of district in which Sure Start programmes are located, although the nature of the Sure Start catchment area may differ from that of the district as a whole.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what evaluation he has made of the Sure Start programme.  [140677]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w30.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="01130w30.html_para1">The Sure Start programme is based on evidence of what works in improving the health and well-being of young children, so that they will be ready to succeed when they start school. It is a cornerstone of the Government's drive to tackle child poverty and long term social exclusion. The evidence for Sure Start has been drawn from other countries, as there has been no other similar programme in this country.
<P>

<a name="01130w30.html_para2">The Government are committed to undertaking a long term, wide ranging national evaluation of the Sure Start programme in England. The Sure Start Unit is in the process of commissioning this from independent, external experts and work will begin in January 2001. The evaluation will look at the extent to which Sure Start makes a difference to children, families and communities in the short, medium and long term. It will attempt to establish what works, why, how and under what circumstances. The evaluation will also look at how cost effective the Sure Start programme is. A large sample of children will be tracked over time to see whether and how Sure Start has improved outcomes for them in later life.
<P>

<a name="01130w30.html_para3">In addition, each local programme will evaluate its own activities and monitor its progress towards national targets and objectives. These local evaluations will feed back into the on-going development of the programme and also inform the national evaluation.
<P>

<a name="01130w30.html_para4">Sure Start is a very new programme but there is already significant enthusiasm for the programme by parents in Sure Start areas and signs of better co-ordination of services for young children and their families at local level.

On 26 November Hezbollah detonated a roadside bomb about 1km from the Blue Line in the Occupied Golan. Since 7 October Israeli forces have regularly violated Lebanese airspace, including high altitude observation flights as far north as Beirut and low level helicopter flights over the south, one of which landed in a Lebanese village. In response to the two Hezbollah attacks, Israeli forces have also mounted operations against targets in south Lebanon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent assessment Her Majesty's Government have made of the distribution of &#163;4 million given to the Mauritius Government in 1982.  [141065]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w33.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Under a 1982 Agreement between HMG and the Government of Mauritius, the &#163;4 million paid by HMG was placed in a Trust Fund for the benefit of the Ilois. Power over the distribution of the funds rested with the Fund's Board of Trustees, made up of representatives of the Government of Mauritius and Ilois.

 The feasibility study covers the outer islands, not Diego Garcia. It is too early to specify when the study will be completed. But the terms of reference for the studies, drawn up by independent consultants, make clear that it will not be in less than a year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w33.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 In line with the recent court judgment, section 4 of the BIOT Immigration Ordinance 2000 allows the Ilois to visit and remain on the islands of the Territory, excluding Diego Garcia where access will continue to be controlled strictly and will be by permit only.

 The stated hope of Ilois representatives to return to live on Diego Garcia has been discussed with US officials. While there are no plans for them to do so, there are no impediments in BIOT law or policy preventing Ilois from being employed by the contractors on Diego Garcia.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w33.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 HMG have paid over &#163;4.5 million for the direct benefit of the Ilois. There is no intention to make any further similar payments. But HMG are undertaking a comprehensive feasibility study, the results of which will give us a better idea of what is possible and what will need to be provided by way of physical and social infrastructure. The costs in terms of public funding will need to be considered at that point.

 Yes. In such a case the claimant would satisfy the criteria for payment on two counts--first, as a surviving member of one of the British groups held captive by the Japanese during the second World War and, second, as the surviving spouse of someone who would otherwise have been entitled to an ex-gratia payment.

<a name="01130w35.html_para0"><i>Letter from Charlie MacKinnon to Mr. Howard Flight, dated 29 November 2000:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked Alexis Cleveland to respond to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what percentage of disability living allowance claims are referred to appeal; what are the key issues considered in appeals; and if he will make a statement. Due to annual leave I am replying on her behalf.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Appeals can arise from any decision given during the life of a Disability Living Allowance (DLA) claim and it is therefore not possible to provide statistics which relate solely to appeals which are received against new and renewal claims. However, the attached table of figures gives an indication of the ratio of appeals to all appealable decisions.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>30 Nov 2000 : Column: 844W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>DLA has two separate components, mobility and care, which are based upon the claimant's care and mobility needs arising from a medical condition. There are two rates of mobility component and three rates of the care component and entitlement depends on the level of the claimant's needs.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Decision-makers assess entitlement to DLA based on all the evidence presented in support of an individual claim against the criteria for each component. If a claimant is unhappy with a decision, he has the right to request a reconsideration. If the decision-maker finds no evidence to revise the decision at the reconsideration stage, the dispute process allows the claimant to appeal to an independent appeal tribunal. The main issues which tribunals are asked to consider are dissatisfaction with decisions which do not award any rate of DLA or those where the level of benefit which has been awarded is disputed, and dissatisfaction with the period of an award.</FONT></UL>

The latest average reduction for parents with care on Income Support is &#163;20.99 per week. This figure is based on an average of two quarters, May 2000 and August 2000. Other years' average reductions for Scotland are:

<BR>
A reduced Benefit Direction will not be made when a lone parent has good cause for not seeking maintenance. Good cause is accepted where there are reasonable grounds to believe that the parent or any child living with her would suffer harm or undue distress as a result of pursuing child maintenance. Reductions will not be implemented if the parent with care is in a vulnerable group such as where there is a Disability Premium in payment.
<BR>
Benefits Agency staff now visit the parent with care and help her complete an application form. This has led to a significant increase in the number of parents co-operating. Some 90% of parents with care co-operate now, compared to 30% in 1997, and there has also been a 72.7% reduction in the number of Reduced Benefit Directions imposed in 1999/2000 against 1998/1999 figures.
<BR>
Data have been provided by DSS Analytical Services Division (ASD) using a quarterly 5% sample of cases on the Income Support Computer System. These figures, which are rounded to the nearest thousand, may be unreliable because they are subject to sampling error.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how his Department has utilised the power to incur expenditure on child support reform provided under the terms of section 82 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999; and if he will set out the procedures that have been developed in relation to this and future uses of the section 82 power.  [141294]




<P>
<P><I>30 Nov 2000 : Column: 850W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w36.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Section 82 of the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act allows my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State to seek the approval of the House for expenditure in preparation for a change in the law ahead of the law receiving Royal Assent, where, without such advance expenditure, it would not be possible to deliver a service for which he is responsible by the due date. Section 82 requires a report to be laid before the House and the House to approve the report by resolution before expenditure can commence.
<P>

<a name="01130w36.html_para2">In addition to the specific procedures and controls specified in the legislation, the Government have already given a commitment that the Social Security Select Committee and the Committee for Public Accounts will be provided with copies of drafts of such reports, before they are formally laid before the House--19 May 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1337-38. This will enable both Committees to have an input into the process and, in particular, to ensure that the use of this power is only for the purposes stated to Parliament by Ministers.
<P>

<a name="01130w36.html_para3">We can now give a further undertaking, to provide the House with an outturn report setting out the actual expenditure incurred under the terms of section 82 for each use of the power, either at the end of the specific period to which the power relates or following the termination of its application by the receipt of Royal Assent to the related Bill, whichever is earlier.
<P>

<a name="01130w36.html_para4">The first, and so far the only, use of the power was in respect of Child Support reform. On 11 April 2000 the House approved expenditure of up to &#163;45 million divided into two elements:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) a maximum of &#163;6 million for expenditure by the Child Support Agency on the legislative-dependent elements of the child support reform process;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) a maximum of &#163;39 million of accruing liability under a PFI contract, also on the legislative-dependent elements of child support reform.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="01130w36.html_para5">At the time of the approval of the report it was not clear whether the related legislation, the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act would secure Royal Assent ahead of or following the parliamentary summer recess. In the event, Royal Assent was secured on the last day before the recess, 28 July 2000. Equally, the timing of the signing of the PFI contract with Affinity was not clear at the time of the preparation of the report, but in the event took place in early August.
<P>

<a name="01130w36.html_para6">The actual expenditure relying on section 82 was therefore confined to &#163;2.66 million, spent by the Child Support Agency on the early costs of reform implementation. In the event it was not necessary to incur any liability under the PFI contract ahead of the Act passing into law.

<P>

<a name="01130w37.html_para1">Significant rises in Child Benefit now mean that &#163;15 a week is paid for the eldest child (up by 26 per cent. in real terms since 1997) and &#163;10 a week for all other children. The introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit alongside the National Minimum Wage guarantees families with children with one person in full-time work, a minimum income of &#163;208 per week (from October 2000), which rises to &#163;214 from April 2001.

 Currently around two million pensioners and pensioner couples benefit from the Minimum Income Guarantee. As a result of the measures outlined in the pre-Budget report, over two million pensioners will benefit in 2001-02, this will increase to 2.2 million in 2002-03.

<a name="01130w37.html_para2">From 2003 the Pension Credit will be introduced. We estimate that half of all pensioner households, comprising 5.5 million pensioners, will benefit from the Pension Credit.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer to the hon.

<a name="01130w37.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The increases to the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) rates will benefit nearly two million pensioners. From April 2001 the new MIG rates will be &#163;92.15 for all single pensioners-a real terms increase of &#163;12.45 a week. The new MIG for couples will be &#163;140.55 a week--a real terms increase of &#163;16.65 for the poorest couples.
<P>

<a name="01130w37.html_para3">The expected cost of this for income-related benefits over the next three years will be around &#163;420 million annually and is included in the forecasts of expenditure. The number of additional pensioners that will be eligible for the main income-related benefits as a result of the new MIG rates will be around 300,000 a year.

 Guidance on the level of discretion available to officials in this Department and other matters relating to disclosure of information to the police is contained in the Protection of Customer Information Guide. This was published in April 2000, to replace previous guidance which had been issued in 1992 and which had become out of date. The level of discretion available to officials was unaffected by the revision of the guidance.
<P>

<a name="01130w39.html_para0">We have had an exchange of correspondence with ministerial colleagues in the Home Office about the guidance and officials have had discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers. We have received no representations from the Police Federation about it. A copy of the new guidance has been placed in the Library. The new guidance can also be viewed on the DSS homepage at www.dss.gov.uk. The previous guidance was withdrawn when the new guide was published, but I am arranging to place a copy in the Library for comparison purposes until the end of 2000.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Expenditure for 2000-01 to date covers the period April to September 2000 and does not include Jobseeker's Allowance (income-based). Jobseeker's Allowance expenditure on Asylum Seekers is, however, negligible.<P>

2. Estimates are based on the Income Support Quarterly Statistical Enquiries from May 1999 to August 2000, and the Jobseeker's Allowance Quarterly Statistical Enquiries from May 1999 to February 2000.<P>

3. The amounts shown reflect the revised figures for Asylum Seekers receiving Income Support published in table 7.1 of the August 2000 Quarterly Statistical Enquiry. Figures previously published and used as the basis for previous calculations of expenditure were incorrect due to a tabling error.<P>

4. Housing Benefit (HB) and Council Tax Benefit (CTB) expenditure on Asylum Seekers in 1999-2000 cannot be estimated until the May 2000 1 per cent. sample of HB and CTB claims has been published (spring 2001).<P>

5. Responsibility for the costs of asylum seeker support passed to the Home Office in April 1999 following the Comprehensive Spending Review. The Department is reimbursed by the Home Office for the costs of social security benefits paid to asylum seekers. <P>

<a name="01130w40.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) if he will further amend the Housing Benefit (General) Amendment (No. 2) Regulations 1998, part 3(h), to take account of individuals whose financial circumstances have changed between selling the property they continue to reside in and making a claim for Housing Benefit;  [140437]
<P>
<UL>(2) for what reason the amendment of Regulation 7 of the Housing Benefit Regulations excluded from benefit people who had previously owned their home.  [140438]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w40.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The intention of the provision was to halt the abuse where an owner-occupier transfers ownership of his or her home without money changing hands, or for less than the market price, and rents it back. Housing Benefit is still available to anyone who can prove that he or she was forced to transfer or sell because of, for example, mortgage arrears.

<P>

<a name="01130w40.html_para1">We are also aware of some cases where people sold their properties on a commercial basis some time ago and are now renting them. There is no evidence to suggest that such transactions took place to enable the seller to take advantage of the Housing Benefit scheme. We are proposing, therefore, to introduce regulations shortly which will enable an ex-owner to claim Housing Benefit provided five years have elapsed since he or she ceased to own the property.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what impact the transfer of local authority housing stock into other control has had on expenditure on Housing Benefit to date.  [141193]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w40.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The information is not available. This is because the data local authorities provide on Housing Benefit spending do not enable us to distinguish between spending on tenants who live in stock that has been transferred and those who live in other stock.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w40.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what recent meetings he has had with interested parties on the subject of Housing Benefit; and if he will make a statement.  [141104]<P>

 In recent months I have, on behalf of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security, met with local councillors, local authority representatives and Members of the House who have an interest in Housing Benefit.
<P>

<a name="01130w40.html_para2">We are always keen to listen to the views of people with an interest in Housing Benefit. To this end, we are currently studying the consultation responses to the Housing Green Paper and we will take decisions on how to proceed in the light of them. We will announce our intentions shortly.

The centres are also equipped to carry out spirometry assessments, along with an additional centre in Cardiff.

<P>

<a name="01130w43.html_para1">We urged the insurance industry to continue to give maximum priority to dealing with flood and other severe weather-related claims. We were assured that claims are being--and would continue to be--dealt with as speedily and effectively as possible. The Government will be looking to the whole industry to deliver on this commitment, and encourage all insurers to aim to meet the highest possible standards.
<P>

<a name="01130w43.html_para2">Looking to the future, industry representatives made it clear that the industry is keen to provide continued insurance cover for homes and businesses around the country, and would be encouraging individual companies not to make hasty judgments on large premium increases or future insurability. Government and industry will need to work closely in partnership to deliver continuing protection for homeowners and businesses at risk of flood damage, to ensure that issues of vital importance are taken forward effectively and speedily (including the appropriate development of planning policies, building regulations, sustainable construction practice and design, farming practice and flood defence policy).

 Mammalian meat and bone meal may not be used in fertilisers for agricultural land. Fertilisers for non-agricultural use may include mammalian meat and bone meal only if it has first been treated to the pressure-cooking standard.
<P>

<a name="01130w43.html_para10">In June 1996, SEAC considered the disposal of blood and gut contents from abattoirs. The Committee noted that the spreading of blood and gut contents on land had been normal practice. They noted that concern had been expressed about the practice; however, given that no BSE infectivity had ever been detected in blood, and that there was no evidence of horizontal transmission of disease which would suggest that cattle wastes were directly infective to cattle, they saw no reason to recommend that this practice should be prohibited.

<P>
<a name="01130w44.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 I am disappointed to announce to the House that predictions for farm incomes this year suggest a further significant fall of 27 per cent. by comparison with 1999. A statistical press release has been placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="01130w44.html_para0">The Government remain committed to helping farmers through these difficult times; last December I announced the Government's long-term strategy for agriculture, which aims to help secure a more competitive and sustainable farming industry, with a stronger market orientation.
<P>

<a name="01130w44.html_para1">This commitment is underpinned by a comprehensive range of initiatives including: reform of the Common Agricultural Policy; significant increases in expenditure on rural development and agri-environment schemes; new measures to reduce the burden of regulation on farming; promotion of increased co-operation and collaboration across the food supply chain; and targeted financial support to the sectors in greatest difficulty.

<a name="01130w44.html_para3">The Government have listened to industry concerns about the volume of red tape which farmers have to face, and we are taking steps to review the IACS forms and guidance, in the light of the Group's recommendations about the readability, familiarity and appearance of the IACS scheme literature, so as to achieve not only simpler English and clearer communication, but also a common format with other MAFF documentation. Consultation with industry during the drafting stages remains a key feature. From 2001, we plan to make it possible for all farmers submitting claims in England to complete and submit the IACS form electronically. These 'intelligent' forms will both save time for farmers, and also lessen the possibility of making inadvertent errors, since inconsistencies will be highlighted and totals calculated automatically.

<P>
<a name="01130w44.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Under the EU's Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) most payments to cereal growers in respect of this year's harvest are required to be made between 16 November 2000 and 31 January 2001. In England the Ministry's Regional Service Centres commenced payments on 16 November and estimate that over 70 per cent. of claims will have been cleared for payment in the first two weeks of processing. It is hoped that the exercise will be completed by the end of December.

<P>
<a name="01130w44.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Chardon LL was proposed for addition to the National List in March 2000. Information has come to light recently that the testing of this variety for distinctness, uniformity and stability (DUS) by the French authorities was based on one year's data from accredited breeders' trials and one year's data from Government run trials. This may not have complied with EC requirements. MAFF is seeking the views of the European Commission on the legal status of the DUS testing procedures used by the French authorities for this variety. The UK authorities are not seeking further tests on Chardon LL pending receipt of the European Commission's views. Chardon LL will be added to the UK National List only if all the legal requirements have been met in full.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w44.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 November 2000]:</i> The CAP has increased unit returns from the production of beef and milk (among other products). This has encouraged the use of a greater volume of inputs per unit of output and some increase in stocking rates. In recognition of this the EU has introduced measures to begin to mitigate these effects--extensification payments for beef and agri-environmental schemes in other sectors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w45.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No assessment has been made of the number of animals which remain conscious after being stunned in slaughterhouses, and the information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) conducts a biennial review of animal welfare in slaughterhouses, and the latest review indicated that in 0.6 per cent. of slaughterhouses some bovines, and in 0.3 per cent. of slaughterhouses some sheep, were stunned ineffectively.
<P>

<a name="01130w45.html_para0">Legislation protecting the welfare of livestock at slaughter requires that any animal inadequately stunned must be re-stunned immediately. The legislation is monitored and enforced on a daily basis in licensed slaughterhouses by Official Veterinary Surgeons of the MHS.

 The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has policy responsibility for flood and coastal defence, while operational responsibility for delivering the service falls to the operating authorities: the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards. The Environment Agency has a general supervisory duty over all matters relating to flood defence. Local authorities and internal drainage boards are empowered to undertake work on non-main rivers. The Ministry provides grant aid for capital flood defence schemes. To be eligible for Ministry grant, schemes must meet specific economic, environmental and technical criteria and achieve an appropriate "priority score" (derived from an assessment of ministerial priorities, urgency and benefit:cost ratio).

 The Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) operates a statutory national surveillance scheme, which implements Directive 96/23.

However, in its report of June 1997 the European Commission's Scientific Committee for Food stated that a representative level of the substance in salmon would be 0.1mg canthaxanthin per 100g of fish.

 <i>[holding answer 30 October 2000]:</i> The number of people over 65 eligible for flu vaccine is shown in table 1. The number of shots of vaccine available to each health authority is not held centrally. Health authorities are currently collating the latest information on uptake rates so far to submit to the Department and we will release these figures in due course.
<P>

<a name="01130w46.html_para2">General practitioners order their supply of flu vaccine direct from manufacturers. This year there are five suppliers of flu vaccine. Unfortunately one of the manufacturers, Solvay, has encountered problems in growing a strain of the vaccine which has led to delays in some deliveries. Solvay have been in touch with the affected GPs to tell them details of any delays, but have confirmed that all ordered vaccine will be delivered by the end of November, in time to protect people this winter. Table 2 shows the main health authorities affected, all of which will receive the full supplies by the end of November.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice he has received from the Food Standards Agency about the Restriction on Pithing (England) Regulations 2000 with particular reference to the impact on working practices in abattoirs.  [139649]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w47.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency has advised that many abattoirs may have to modify their current working practices to compensate for the ban on pithing. I understand that to minimise the risk of injury to staff from involuntary kicking by stunned animals, abattoirs will need to hoist and slaughter animals very quickly after stunning. To achieve a short stun to slaughter time modifications may be required to enable staff to operate out of the range of kicks. In some cases this may mean abattoirs will have to adapt buildings and/or equipment.
<P>

<a name="01130w47.html_para0">The Food Standards Agency is undertaking a consultation exercise on the introduction of the Restriction on Pithing (England) Regulations 2000.

 The children's social services core information requirements do not impose new tasks on councils.

They are the Department's response to long-standing requests from local authority social services that a "minimum data set" for children's services be mapped and published. The core requirements comprise statistical information collected by central Government and the additional information that local authorities need themselves to plan and manage children's social service effectively. Most authorities do already collect the bulk of the specified information, either routinely or as and when required. The requirements are intended to assist local authorities in their negotiations with software suppliers to commission information systems that best suit their needs and promote the greatest possible efficiency in children's services.

 It is not possible to estimate with accuracy the number of National Health Service dentists needed to ensure that everyone has access to a NHS dentist. There are now 17,692 dentists in the General Dental Service (traditional, high street dentists) in England compared to 16,303 in 1997.

<P>

<a name="01130w47.html_para7">Although the number of dentists has consistently risen, the amount of time they spend treating NHS patients has dropped. This is because, on average, dentists have increased the amount of time that they devote to private practice and more are working part-time.

 The information for England has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01130w47.html_para9">The information shows that the number of patients registered with a dentist has declined since 1993. This is mainly due to dentists choosing to increase their private practice, to more dentists working part-time, the reduction in the registration period in 1996 and a drive to eliminate duplicate registrations.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2000]:</i> The Government are committed to researching into the nature and extent of child abuse and its causes. In 1995, they published key findings from a programme of 20 pieces of research, undertaken at the time of the implementation of the Children Act 1989, which came into force in October 1991. "Child Protection: Messages from Research" is available from The Stationery Office; it served to make the lessons of research accessible to professionals working with children and to demonstrate their relevance for policy and practice.

 Relenza (zanamivir) is for the treatment of both influenza A and B in adults and adolescents of 12 years and over who present with symptoms typical of influenza when influenza is circulating in the community.

 Relenza (zanamivir) is classified as a Prescription Only Medicine under criteria embodied in United Kingdom and European Community legislation.

 The recent independent systematic review of water fluoridation conducted by the University of York Centre for Reviews and Dissemination confirmed that fluoridation reduces tooth decay by, on average, 2.25 teeth per child, and increase by 15 per cent. the proportion of children completely free from tooth decay.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department on which circuits and at which lodgings circuit judges are accommodated under arrangements made on those circuits; if, when circuit judges are accommodated in judges' lodgings, they are entitled to <i>(a)</i> no allowance in addition, <i>(b)</i> a lesser allowance than High Court judges and <i>(c)</i> the same allowance as High Court judges; and if he will make a statement.

 The network of judges' lodgings is primarily provided for High Court judges when they try serious criminal and civil cases on circuit in the principal towns and cities outside London, although occasionally circuit judges also reside there.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the impact on the number of firms that will be able to put in applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission into legal aid support following the introduction of the changes to the franchise requirements in April 2001.  [140836]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w51.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 In order to ensure minimum quality standards for firms providing publicly funded defence services, from 2 October 2000, only those firms with a Crime Franchise were entitled to carry out work funded by the Legal Services Commission. This includes applications to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC). Although the number of offices of legal firms doing criminal work reduced from some 6,500 to 3,300, these 3,300 offices represented over 90 per cent. of expenditure for criminal legal aid in the previous 12 months.
<P>

<a name="01130w51.html_para1">In order to accommodate those firms which specialised in CCRC work, special arrangements were introduced in March 2000 to enable them to obtain a Crime Franchise.
<P>

<a name="01130w51.html_para2">From April 2001 all work funded by the LSC will be under contract and all firms with a Crime Franchise will be eligible. It is expected that the 3,300 quality assured firms currently working in this area will apply for a contract and continue to provide services after April 2001.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w51.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how much legal aid was paid for appeals to the Criminal Cases Review Commission in each of the past three years.  [140842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w51.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Criminal legal advice and assistance is available to make applications before the Criminal Cases Review Commission. However, the Legal Services Commission does not keep central records at the necessary level of detail to readily identify expenditure on these cases. The information requested could therefore be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<P><I>30 Nov 2000 : Column: 911W</I><P>
could be accessed in order to assist judges to take a consistent approach when carrying out summary assessment of costs for pre-trial proceedings in fast-track cases and selected proceedings in multi-track cases, and to propose a method of gathering data and analysing it in order to provide a basis for benchmarking.
<P>

<a name="01130w51.html_para3">The study found that fixed and benchmarking exercise could not be developed from historical data and recommended that a sampling exercise be carried out to obtain and analyse reliable data to inform any decisions on the establishment of fixed and benchmark costs.
<P>

<a name="01130w51.html_para4">The findings of the study were discussed with the senior judiciary. They felt that guidelines should be developed using the expert knowledge of the judiciary and in consultation with the professions, on the basis that actual data might only produce figures reflecting the current inconsistent approach to assessment.
<P>

<a name="01130w51.html_para5">The Senior Costs Judge has, through consultation with designated civil judges, district judges and representatives of the legal profession, collected and published guideline rates for solicitors throughout the country, to assist judges and practitioners when carrying out summary assessment. The Senior Costs Judge, at the request of the Master of the Rolls, is consulting widely with judges, the legal profession and other groups in order to develop benchmark figures for a limited range of procedures in both the fast track and the multi-track. The senior judiciary envisage that the benchmark figures might be applied to those procedures, while at the same time retaining the discretion of the court to depart from them in out of the ordinary cases. The senior judiciary wish to see how the benchmark scheme operates in practice before it is extended to other procedures or further developed for the fast-track.

<P>
<a name="01130w52.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 I have received a number of representations about the effectiveness of child contact centres both from hon. Members and from others. The Government greatly value the work of contact centres and the service they provide for children, their parents and other family members. We firmly believe that it is for the benefit of children as well as parents to remain in contact with each other unless there is some reason why this would be unsafe or inappropriate in a particular case.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w52.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Simon Hughes: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department in each of the last three years, what disciplinary inquiries he has made into the inappropriate granting of legal aid in criminal cases; what the value was of payments recovered; and if he will make a statement.  [140943]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w52.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Earlier this year, the Court Service instigated a disciplinary investigation into one case, that of the granting of legal aid to Kenneth Noye. Three members of staff were involved: one person resigned before the disciplinary process was complete; a second has had a disciplinary penalty imposed, which is currently subject to appeal within agreed procedures; and the third has been found not culpable. There were no investigations in either of the previous two years.
<P>

<a name="01130w52.html_para0">No payments have been recovered in this case. Even if it could be proved that Mr. Noye has misrepresented his financial position on his legal aid form, the Department is unlikely to consider undertaking civil action for damages to recover the costs of legal aid. It would be an unwarranted use of public funds to take such an action where the prospect of recovering any significant sum of money is remote, bearing in mind Mr. Noye's status as a bankrupt and the competing claims of other creditors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w52.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Under the Crime Reduction Programme Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Initiative, businesses may join crime and disorder reduction partnerships to bid for funding for external CCTV systems as a deterrent, and to help identify offenders entering or leaving their premises. The current bidding round under the initiative, which closes on 22 December, specifically encourages bids from small shopping centres to deal with this kind of problem. Protection of goods and persons on these premises falls within the general duty of care owed by employers and service providers towards their staff and customers, and the requirements of Health and Safety legislation. Internal CCTV systems are widely used for this purpose, but since business premises do not require a licence to trade at unsocial hours, their use cannot be a condition of licensing.

The value of the relocation business for this period is estimated at &#163;5 million, which includes the basic management fee charged for each case handled by the relocation company but paid for by the Home Office and prison service for the relocation case, such as legal fees, valuations and bridging costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his estimate is of the number of individuals believed still to be in the UK but whose whereabouts are unknown, <i>(a)</i> who have applied for asylum but whose applications have not yet been finally determined and <i>(b)</i> whose applications for asylum have been refused.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many asylum seekers whose claims were made <i>(a)</i> prior to 1 July 1993 and <i>(b)</i> between 1 July 1993 and 31 December 1995 have been granted leave to remain, and for what periods, under the backlog clearance exercise; how many granted leave to remain had their asylum applications considered under normal procedures and refused; how many did not receive an initial determination of their asylum application; and if he will make a statement.

<a name="01130w53.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[pursuant to her reply, 10 November 2000, c. 425W]:</i> The figure 6,135 is the number of applications lodged prior to July 1993 and the figure 15,400 is the number of asylum applications lodged between 1 July 1993 and 31 December 1995. The number of applications still not determined under the backlog clearance exercise is now negligible.

 Figures from the Lord Chancellor's Department showing the average number and length of adjournments in the youth court since February 1999 are at annex A. Statistics are not collected centrally on the various reasons for adjournments.
<P>

<a name="01130w54.html_para0">Annex B summarises returns from youth offending teams on the number of remands made between 1 January 1999 and 31 March 1999, 1 April 2000 and 30 June 2000 and 1 July 2000 and 30 September 2000.
<P>

<a name="01130w54.html_para1">The Youth Justice Board are supporting some 120 bail supervision and support projects across England and Wales. We await full evaluation reports, but expect the schemes progressively to improve young defendants' responses to bail and hence courts' confidence in it.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement about the risk assessment of inmates who share cells.  [140932]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w55.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service is committed to preventing loss of life or injury to prisoners who are required to share cells.
<P>

<a name="01130w55.html_para1">Improvements have been made to the way in which prisoners are risk assessed--a revised Prisoner Escort Record (PER) that accompanies individuals during court or prison moves and highlights specific risk factors, including violence, racist behaviour and sexual offences, now in use estate-wide. Accompanying guidance reinforces the importance of passing PER information to the staff involved in, for example, first-night risk assessment and accommodation issues.
<P>

<a name="01130w55.html_para2">Work has also been undertaken to develop a Safer Prisons initiative. The Prison Service will shortly be introducing a Safer Prisons Standard that will encourage a 'whole-prison' approach. As well as setting out actions to reduce violence and bullying in establishments, it also focuses on prisoner care and staff/prisoner relationships.

<P>
<a name="01130w56.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Stoate: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the eight pilot schemes introduced in January allowing police forces to retain income from speeding fines in order to finance the operation and provision of speed cameras in their areas; and what plans he has to introduce the scheme nationwide.  [140973]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w56.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The pilots were launched in April for a two-year period and the six monthly evaluation is nearing completion. The success of the pilots is to be judged primarily on casualty reduction; early indications are encouraging. The Government Departments concerned and the Association of Chief Police Officers are considering the issue of a national rollout in the light of the emerging information from the pilots.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much of the budget for the <i>(a)</i> Police Service and <i>(b)</i> Prison Service was spent in Wales in the last 12 months for which figures are 



<P>
<P><I>30 Nov 2000 : Column: 927W</I><P>
available (i) in actual terms, (ii) as a percentage of total expenditure on these services and (iii) per head of population in Wales.  [141011]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01130w56.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In 1999-2000 revenue spend by police authorities on the police service in Wales, supported by Government grants, in actual terms was &#163;375.438 million. This is 5.04 per cent. of total police net revenue expenditure in England and Wales and &#163;127.83 per head of population in Wales.
<P>

<a name="01130w56.html_para0">The only information available for the Prison Service in respect of spend in Wales for the financial year 1999-2000 is the expenditure by Cardiff, Prescoed/Usk and Swansea Prisons and the payments made to the operators of Parc Prison. Spend in 1999-2000 was &#163;54.753 million in actual terms. This represents 2.97 per cent. of the total Prison Service expenditure in 1999-2000 or &#163;18.64 per head of population in Wales. However, because many Welsh prisoners, particularly from North Wales, are held in prisons in England this does not give a true reflection of the impact of Wales on Prison Service costs.

 I announced on 6 November 2000 that the Government were publishing a consultation document on proposals to deregulate certain aspects of the bingo industry. Our paper makes three proposals. It suggests abolishing the current requirement for licensed bingo clubs to notify the licensing authority of changes in their charges to players 14 days in advance; allowing clubs to have a mixture of jackpot and lower prize gaming machines; and amending the law on multiple bingo so that it can offer more than one national, regional and house prize.
<P>

<a name="01130w57.html_para0">The consultation period for these proposals ends on 16 February 2001. Subject to comments received, the Government plan to lay a draft Order under the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994 to give effect to them, for scrutiny by Parliament.
<P>

<a name="01130w57.html_para1">Earlier this year, we amended the statutory regulations which govern the charges which licensed bingo clubs may make to their players. This change has considerably simplified these arrangements.
<P>

<a name="01130w57.html_para2">In February this year, we announced an overall review of the controls on gambling in Great Britain. The review, chaired by Sir Alan Budd, is proceeding and it will report to the Home Secretary next summer. Aside from our proposed Order under the 1994 Act the Government have no plans to make any other changes to the Gaming Acts as they relate to licensed bingo prior to receiving this report.

<a name="01130w59.html_para0"><i>Letter from John Pullinger to Mr. Edward Davey, dated 30 November 2000:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent questions on the methodology for adjusting for quality improvements in the Retail Price Index (RPI) (137865) and hedonic price indices (137864). I am replying in his absence.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Office for National Statistics (ONS) does not currently use hedonic regression techniques to correct for changes in quality of new goods in the RPI sample. However, changes in quality are allowed for in two ways. Firstly, explicitly using option costs for computers. In this case the actual costs of individual changes of specification in the computer are recorded, and 50 per cent of this cost is applied to the price of an item as the value of the quality change. Secondly, for all other items, we make an implicit adjustment. In this case when a new item is selected during price collection, to replace an item no longer available, any price change, above that seen in other goods of this type, is assumed to be related to quality changes.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However the ONS is actively participating in discussions about which methods are most appropriate for quality adjusting price indices. As part of the ongoing methodological research programme for the RPI, the ONS is looking closely at the question of adjustments for quality changes in new goods introduced into the index, whether these be improvements or reductions in quality. This work involves a technical assessment of the current methodology used in the RPI, comparing this with practices in other countries and evaluating which methodology is most appropriate for the UK.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As part of this work we are examining techniques either used by other National Statistics Offices, or recommended by academics, to see if they are of potential use in the UK. In particular, we are looking at whether the hedonic regression techniques adopted in the USA, and other countries, would be suitable for the UK, both theoretically and practically. The research will not, necessarily, recommend a single quality adjustment technique, but rather may recommend different solutions for different product groups.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The New Earnings Survey (NES) provides earnings data for different industry sectors based on the 1992 Standard Industrial Classification (SIC92). Estimates for full-time employees are published for all industry sectors when there is a sufficiently large sample of employees and the statistics have an acceptable level of accuracy. I have provided data for the SIC92 'financial intermediation' industry sector in the attached table including previously unpublished estimates for part-time employees and for all males and all females. The figures are for Great Britain and are based on the 2000 NES, the latest survey for which data are available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The NES is based on a one per cent sample of employees in the PAYE system and is therefore likely to under-represent low paid staff earning below the tax threshold and in particular those who work part-time. Averages will be affected by a relatively small number of employees earning very high gross weekly earning.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Registrar General for England and Wales I have been asked to reply to your three recent questions about the arrangements for the coming into force on 1 January 2001 of section 24 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (the 1999 Act). As you know, section 24 is concerned with the duty on registration officers to report suspicious marriages. Specifically you asked about registration officers checking passports and visas and their training and guidance to be issued. (139340/1/2)</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>30 Nov 2000 : Column: 943W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Under current legislation, registration officers need to ensure the accuracy of information contained in the notice of intention to marry. To achieve this they may examine a variety of documents. The person giving notice of marriage may be asked to provide documentary evidence showing use and spellings of names and details of age and marital status in order to verify the particulars. A variety of documents, including a passport, may be produced.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have not issued any policy guidance to registration officers regarding checks on passports on the validity of visas of persons intending to marry. However, the 1999 Act places a duty on registration officers to report to the Home Office marriages they reasonably suspect as being sham marriages. If, in the course of examining a passport, a registration officer discovers the visa of a part to a marriage has expired this may be taken into account, together with other factors, in assessing whether the marriage is a sham.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Registration officers in England and Wales have been invited to attend a seminar arranged to address both the impact on their statutory duties and the consequential amendments to marriage law arising from the 1999 Act.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Reporting of Suspicious Marriages and Registration (Miscellaneous Amendments) Regulations 2000 are to be laid before Parliament shortly. They set out the procedure for reporting sham marriages to the Secretary of State for the Home Department where it is suspected that the marriage is or has been entered into for the purpose of avoiding the effect of United Kingdom immigration law. The regulations specify that reports are made direct to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and stipulate the information to be contained in reports.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A copy of these regulations will be issued to every superintendent registrar in England and Wales. They will also receive written guidance and revised instructions for inclusion in the Handbook for Registration Officers that will contain advice about reporting arrangements.

 <i>[holding answer 23 November 2000]:</i> The Chancellor visited Canada on 30 September 1998 to attend the Commonwealth Finance Ministers' Meeting and on 24 October 2000 to attend a meeting of G20 Finance Ministers. On both occasions he had a number of additional bilateral meetings. No other Treasury Ministers have visited Canada since May 1997. The information requested on visits by officials is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Labour Force Survey (LFS) is the main source of labour market data on individuals used by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The official measure of unemployment is derived from the LFS and is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO). It counts as unemployed people who are a) without a paid job, b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ONS also publishes the monthly number of people who are claiming unemployment-related benefits, also known as the claimant count.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The only figures available on vacancies are those notified to Jobcentres. It should be borne in mind that Jobcentre vacancies represent only a proportion of all vacancies in the economy, broadly a third overall.

In response to question two, the items contained in the basket of goods, which is used to calculate both the RPI and the Pensioner Price Indices are reviewed annually.
<BR>
In answer to your third question, the Pensioner Price Indices relate to pensioner households whose income is mainly (at least 75%) dependent on state benefit. The Pensioner Price Indices are effectively a subset of the RPI as the same price data is used to produce both, however the Pensioner Price Indices exclude certain items that the RPI includes, such as housing costs, school meals and NHS prescription charges. For items where pensioners receive special rates (such as rail and bus fares), we produce special pensioner indices that differ from those in the RPI. In addition, there are various items and sections where pensioner expenditure patterns differ greatly from those used in the RPI--these include milk, soft drinks, footwear, fees and subscriptions, takeaways, T.V. licences, beer and wine sales (both 'on' and 'off'), tobacco, domestic services, chemists' goods, maintenance of motor vehicles, and books and newspapers. The weights used to construct the Pensioner Price Indices are therefore adjusted accordingly to take these different spending patterns into account.
