<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will change the rules on providing help to firms for which more than 25 per cent. of ownership is in foreign hands.  [65029]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 June 2002]:</i> I am not aware of any such general rules. However, there are certain schemes of assistance which are only open to small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs). This would exclude a firm which was more than 25 per cent. owned by a non SME, whether that was a UK or overseas undertaking. Whether it is appropriate to extend schemes of assistance to larger companies is a matter to be addressed on a scheme by scheme basis. In some circumstances, though, EC state aid rules would preclude such extensions.

<a name="20710w01.html_wqn1"><B> Ms Shipley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much brownfield land has been redeveloped by each regional development agency in each year since their formation.  [66243]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 During the three years after the RDAs were created on 1 April 1999 up to the introduction of their Single Programme funding on 1 April 2002, the RDAs reported to each funding Department individually on the outcome of their separate programmes. Brownfield land redevelopment was funded by what is now the Office of my right hon. Friend, the Deputy Prime Minister. Accordingly DTI does not hold any figures for these years.

<a name="20710w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Lazarowicz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will introduce measures to reform the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to ensure that time orders can be used to the advantage of debtors in Scotland.  [65621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 As part of the Government's review of consumer credit legislation, we will be looking at how we can make the consumer protection measures in the 1974 Act more effective. The Scottish Executive have also recently consulted on the Enforcement of Civil Obligations in Scotland and this consultation mentions time orders under the 1974 Act while recognising that any changes to the 1974 Act would be a reserved matter. The Government will take account of any comments made about time orders under the 1974 Act in our review of consumer credit legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 In February a group was set up to coordinate the response of key regulators to the issues for accounting, auditing and aspects of corporate governance raised in the aftermath of Enron. It will produce an interim report by the end of July. The Government will also publish in July its first formal response to the recommendations of the Company Law Review.

 The Co-ordinating group set up in February to co-ordinate the responses of the key regulators to issues for audit and accounting raised in the aftermath of Enron, and now WorldCom, will produce an interim report by the end of July. The Government have made clear that it is important to restore confidence in the independence of auditors.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what her policy is on multi- disciplinary professional practices; and if she will make a statement.  [68249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Multi-disciplinary professional practices can be beneficial for both the parties concerned and consumers. Any restrictions on such practices should be no more than is necessary to ensure that conflicts of interest are avoided, standards of ethical and professional conduct are maintained and consumers are properly protected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on how successful the UK has been in attracting inward investment.  [69036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 With my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, I am pleased to inform the House that the UK is still Europe's top inward investment location, despite a fall from last year's record totals in the number of investment projects and jobs created.
<P>

<a name="20710w01.html_para0">Invest.UK has announced in its annual review published today, that for the period between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2002, the number of direct investment projects by foreign owned companies into the UK reported to Invest.UK by its partner agencies in Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and the English Regional Development Agencies totalled 764.
<P>

<a name="20710w01.html_para1">The UK is an excellent place to do business and this is reflected in our success in attracting consistently high levels of inward investment since Invest.UK was founded

in 1977 as the Invest In Britain Bureau. Indeed we continue to be the top inward investment location in Europe.
<P>

<a name="20710w01.html_para2">Today's Invest.UK figures show that the UK is not immune from the global economic downturn. New inward investment projects in to the UK have fallen 12 per cent. from last year's record figures. This reflects international investment falls across the world, caused particularly by reduced activity in the technology sectors. In the UK the sharpest fall is in US investment in the technology sectors.
<P>

<a name="20710w01.html_para3">In the current economic climate international business is more cautious. Many investors will have postponed decisions until confidence returns and we must be ready to secure these opportunities as recovery comes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Salmond: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps she will take to encourage employers in the offshore sector to implement the terms of the European Working Time Directive in advance of the date when the directive must be enforced.  [68350]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_spnew7"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government have had regular contacts with both employers and employee representatives in the offshore sector about the implementation of the directive, which is due in August 2003. The Government will carry out a full public consultation on its proposals for implementation. It is for the industry to decide whether to take steps to implement the directive ahead of the August deadline.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what proportion of the board members of each regional development agency were <i>(a)</i> living and <i>(b)</i> working in their respective region in (i) 1999, (ii) 2000, (iii) 2001 and (iv) 2002.  [68664]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_spnew8"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The information requested can be provided only at disproportionate cost as records containing this information are not held regionally or centrally. However, in each appointment round for board members, an understanding of the issues affecting the region has been a core selection criterion. For example, the current appointment process for board members includes the criterion "Applicants must have a good knowledge of the region, with a good operational network of regional contacts and in-depth experience in at least one area of the RDA's work".

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w01.html_spnew10"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The average number of working hours per week for all full-time workers in the UK was 44.2 in 2000. This data was collected from the EU Labour Force Survey, which is also used to determine the EU average for full-time workers.

<P>

<a name="20710w02.html_para0">We support the principle of free movement of labour within the EU and the need to ensure that exceptions are clearly justified.
<P>

<a name="20710w02.html_para1">Government officials have previously been in contact with the European Commission about the French national rules, which the French Government have argued in the past reflect public duties placed on the captains of French vessels. The Commission has expressed the view that these appear compatible with Community law. My Department will consider any particular case that is brought to our attention.

installed Stage I petrol vapour recovery controls. It is estimated that this measure is likely to have effected around 1,700 petrol stations in the UK over a six year period, based on 1998 site figures. In England and Wales local authorities are responsible for the implementation of Stage I equipment at petrol stations in their region. In Scotland this is the role of SEPA and in Northern Ireland the local enforcing authority.

<a name="20710w02.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Unfortunately, there are no uninhabited areas of the United Kingdom large enough to meet all our essential military aircraft training needs. It is, therefore, our policy that, in principle, the whole of the United Kingdom is open to low flying by military aircraft in order to spread the disturbance as thinly as possible.
<P>

<a name="20710w02.html_para7">The Ministry of Defence is fully committed to ensuring that our relationships with local communities are as harmonious as possible. To that extent, we will do all that we can to keep disturbance to an absolute minimum, while maintaining the training of the armed forces which is vital to their operational readiness.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w02.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The ability to fly fast and low continues to be an essential skill in our armoury of tactics. Training for aircrew to achieve and maintain these skills is vital.
<P>

<a name="20710w02.html_para8">The amount of low flying training carried out in the UK Low Flying System (UKLFS) during the training year April 2001 to March 2002 was the minimum necessary for aircrew to reach and maintain these skills. Hours booked for low flying training in the UKLFS (excluding the Rotary Wing Dedicated User Areas, where different booking arrangements apply) during this period amounted to an overall increase of 8.7 per cent. compared to the previous training year. It is likely that there are a variety of reasons for this increase, such as preparation for operations, the return of Royal Air Force squadrons from Germany and low flying by the Eurofighter and Apache aircraft in preparation for their introduction into service. Since detailed records of hours booked began in 1995, the annual total has reduced by some 31 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20710w02.html_para9">The distribution of low flying training across the UK has not changed significantly over previous years. It is spread as widely as practicable, but for a variety of reasons including population distribution, and geographic and climatic considerations, it is inevitable that some parts of the country will see more low flying than others.
<P>

<a name="20710w02.html_para10">I have today placed in the Library of the House a report giving a detailed account of low flying training in the UK Low Flying System for the period April 2001 to March 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Currently, there are 90 aircraft, on average, undergoing work in the St. Athan Fixed Wing Business Unit. Existing plans envisage Red Dragon project would cater for 48 fixed wing aircraft, and takes account of process improvements and future fleet reductions. Filling the facility will be dependent on the Defence Aviation Repair Agency successfully winning competitions for this work after the guaranteed order book expires in April 2004. There are no current plans to transfer rotary wing work to St. Athan.

 I have had no recent discussions with the British embassy in Paris, the Commonwealth War Graves Commission or the French Government about war graves in the Somme. However, the embassy is maintaining close contacts with the French authorities who are involved with proposals for a third airport for Paris. Early indications had suggested this project might affect war grave cemeteries maintained by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in the Chaulnes area of the Somme.
<P>

<a name="20710w03.html_para0">The Ministry of Defence has had no further discussions on this subject since the new French Government made clear that it would be looking again, from first principles, at the need for a third airport in the Paris basin. We are monitoring this review process very closely; we do not expect an early conclusion to be reached.

<P>
<a name="20710w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2002]:</i> The study by Central Science Laboratory and Sussex university showed that badgers frequently visited buildings on two farms in Gloucestershire, to exploit a range of food items. During some visits cattle feed was contaminated with badger faeces and badgers came into close direct contact with housed cattle. Given that there is a substantial body of circumstantial evidence implicating the badger in the transmission of bovine TB to cattle, such situations could potentially carry a high risk of infection. CSL will embark on a wider-scale DEFRA funded study later this year to investigate this phenomenon further.

<a name="20710w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Departments are required to comply with the Government's general policy on insurance, which is set out in "Government Accounting", chapter 30, para 30.2.5, which notes that Government do not need to purchase insurance to protect the viability of its business, and should consider insurance only where the value of claims met would exceed the cost of insurance premiums. Commercial insurance of a building is acceptable in cases where (a) insurance is a condition of a lease (b) the lessor will not accept a Government indemnity (c) incurring the total cost of the accommodation in question, including the cost of the insurance, is more cost-effective than other accommodation options ("Government Accounting", para 30.2.11a).
<P>

<a name="20710w05.html_para0">Commercial insurance is not usually payable in respect of leasehold properties where the Department is the sole occupier. In the case of leasehold property shared with other tenants, the cost of insurance is not always identified separately by our landlords. Furthermore, premiums are payable at different times of the year and our landlords may not have had to renew cover since 11 September 2001.
<P>

<a name="20710w05.html_para1">It is not possible, therefore, to provide a precise assessment of the cost of commercial buildings insurance paid by the Department either before of after 11 September 2001. However, where insurance premiums have been separately charged this year, they have increased by between 3 per cent. and 90 per cent. It is impossible to say what proportion of these increases is due to the events of 11 September 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2002]:</i> The Government undertake an extensive surveillance programme for pesticide residues. Priority is given to the surveillance of crops but some animal feed is also tested. A total of some 4,000 samples are analysed each year for a wide range of pesticides generating over 100,000 individual test results. The results for the testing programme are all published in the quarterly reports of the independent Pesticide Residues Committee (PRC) available on its website at www.pesticides.gov.uk/ committees/PRC/prc.htm
<P>

<a name="20710w05.html_para2">A consumer risk assessment is conducted in relation to all residues which exceed a statutory maximum residue level or are otherwise of potential concern. The methodology used in these risk assessments and their outcomes are described in the PRC's reports.

<P><I>10 Jul 2002 : Column 953W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20710w05.html_para3">The methodology of risk assessment for residues in animal feeds is more complex. It assesses both the potential risk to the animal and the potential risk to humans consuming animal products from the animal. Ministers are advised on the aspects of risk assessment for pesticides by an independent expert committee, the Advisory Committee on Pesticides (ACP). Details of the committee are available from its website at www.pesticides.gov.uk/committees/acp/acp.htm
<P>

 Japanese Knotweed is a large, vigorous weed. It is a non-native introduction which appears to have no natural enemies in Britain. It is an offence under Section 14 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act (1981) to plant or otherwise cause Japanese Knotweed to grow in the wild. There is no obligation on landowners to control Japanese Knotweed on their own land.

In this particular case, the Commission received an application for a licence to fell trees with an aim to improve the management of the woodland area. The trees were subject to a tree preservation order, so the Commission consulted East Dorset district council who then raised an objection to the proposed felling. The application now therefore falls to be determined by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister under the terms of the tree preservation order.

In addition, sheep dipping, tagging and scanning will no longer require a licence. The rules for multiple pick-ups and multiple drop-offs of livestock will also be simplified.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent analysis the World bank and IMF have sent to her Department of the poverty and social impact of structural reforms supported by their programmes in poor countries; in how many instances the impact has been found to be negative; and what mitigating measures the World bank and IMF have agreed to in order to support in such instances.  [67771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w06.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Over recent months the British Government have pressed both the World bank and IMF for a timetable of poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA), setting out the policy reforms that need to be analysed and who will support countries to do the analysis. We welcome the commitment of both institutions to PSIA. We have also supported PSIA pilots in six countries in order to demonstrate how it can be carried out.
<P>

<a name="20710w06.html_para10">Of the 35 IMF Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)-supported programmes considered by the IMF Board between 1 July 2000 and 30 September 2001, IMF staff papers show that roughly 60 per cent. include some form of PSIA&#151;though only around a third of PRGF-supported programmes had full studies undertaken to assess the effects of specific policies ('formal' PSIA).
<P>

<a name="20710w06.html_para11">Figures are not available on the number of instances in which PSIA has shown IMF structural reforms to have been negative. However around two thirds of PRGF- supported programmes over the period included some measures aimed to offset potentially adverse short-term effects of either macroeconomic reforms, structural reforms or exogenous shocks on the poor. There is also evidence of PSIA influencing the design of economic policies. Examples include Uganda, where plans to liberalise the sugar industry were changed; Senegal, where 15&#150;20 per cent. diesel and kerosene subsidies were maintained rather than eliminated; and Cambodia, where large-scale retrenchment of civil servants was delayed until safety nets for retrenchees could be put in place.
<P>

<a name="20710w06.html_para12">The World bank have made similar commitments to use PSIA in their Poverty Reduction Support Credits. The British Government see all these documents, given our membership of the World Bank Board. IMF and World bank reviews of PRGFs and Poverty Reduction Strategies respectively contain further information on PSIA. These can be found at www.imf.org and www.wordbank.org.

 The UK's Working Group on Access to Medicines, which I chair, is looking at options for bringing about widespread, sustainable and predictable differential pricing of essential medicines, so that such medicines can be made available to the world's poor at affordable prices. The group's final meeting is on 25 July, after which it will report back to the Prime Minister. Differential pricing could apply to anti-retrovirals, which are now on the World Health Organisation's (WHO) essential drug list. We are encouraging key partners&#151;pharmaceutical industry, developing countries, donors and international organisations&#151;to play their part in making widespread differential pricing a reality.
<P>

<a name="20710w07.html_para0">The Government recognise that affordability is only one of four key factors that WHO has identified as influencing access to medicines. There is also a need for sustainable financing, the rational selection and use of existing drugs, and reliable health and supply systems.
<P>

<a name="20710w07.html_para1">On sustainable financing, we have pledged $200 million over five years to the Global Fund to Fight TB, AIDS and Malaria (GFATM). We have also committed over &#163;1 billion, since 1997, to strengthening developing countries health systems, building their capacity both to deliver medicines to the poor and to make effective choices about the selection and use of drugs.

 The purpose of DFID humanitarian assistance policy is to save lives and relieve suffering; hasten recovery, and protect and rebuild livelihoods and communities; and reduce risks and vulnerability to future crises. The poor, and those whose vulnerability is increased due to disease, such as HIV/AIDS, are disproportionately affected by disasters and conflict. For example, in southern Africa, a serious drought has led to food shortages, which have stretched the coping capacity of the poorest families, many of whom are already suffering from having one or more of their family with HIV/AIDS. I have recently allocated &#163;45 million to support the most vulnerable people in Zimbabwe, Zambia, Malawi, Lesotho and Swaziland.
<P>

<a name="20710w07.html_para2">My Department supports comprehensive HIV/AIDS prevention programmes tailored to local needs and situations. These can include interventions such as condoms, harm reduction, educating youth and safe needle exchange programmes. As part of DFID's HIV/ AIDS strategy, we have identified a focus on working with the most vulnerable groups in the society, which often include women, commercial sex workers, injecting drug users and men who have sex with men. Education leading to behavioural change is a central element of our strategy towards fighting the HIV/AIDS epidemic. It forms the basis for any prevention, treatment and intervention programme.

 Community Safety Partnerships are made up of the statutory organisations responsible for the delivery of services at a local level. The Partnership should engage with voluntary and community organisations to identify issues of concern at a local level and develop collaborative ways of tackling these issues. The Partnership should determine how best to interface with the voluntary and community sector.

 We keep the security situation under constant review. The Secretary of State receives regular advice from the Acting Chief Constable, the GOC and his security advisers. The Acting Chief Constable is on record as saying that he believes that paramilitaries on both sides have been involved in orchestrating the recent street violence in Belfast. This is a worrying development.

 The vast majority of parades held this year have passed off peacefully.

In the event of public disorder, the security forces have appropriate contingency measures in place to ensure the determination of the Parades Commission is upheld.

 Together with the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the Policing Board, we are laying the foundations of a new beginning to policing.

And there has been an excellent cross-community response to recruitment under new 50:50 provisions with 35 per cent. of applications coming from Catholics and around 350 new recruits now in training. There have also been other major changes: policing with the community is now the statutory core function of the Police Service; a major programme of action is under way to focus policing in Northern Ireland on a human rights based approach.

 Representations about alternative methods of funding the BBC are not recorded separately from other representations about television licensing received by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. In the year from April 2001 to March 2002, the Department replied to 272 letters from Members of Parliament and 611 letters from members of the public about television licensing issues, a minority of which related to alternative funding methods.

 The British Tourist Authority (BTA) promotes Britain overseas as a tourist destination. Its baseline funding was &#163;35.5 million in 2001&#150;02 and is &#163;35.5 million in 2002&#150;03. In addition, the BTA received &#163;14.2 million from the reserve in 2001&#150;02 to combat the impact of the outbreak of foot and mouth disease and in 2002&#150;03 the Government committed up to &#163;20 million from the reserve for the "Million Visitor" tourism recovery campaign, to be matched by contributions from the industry in cash and in kind.
<P>

<a name="20710w10.html_para0">Baseline funding for English tourism rose from &#163;10 million in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;12 million this year. The English Tourism Council has also been awarded funds for e-tourism projects: an award of &#163;0.9 million was made in 2001 from the Capital Modernisation Fund and &#163;3.6 million in 2002 from the Invest to Save Budget.
<P>

 The Government have no plans to pursue such harmonising measures with the EU. The design features and production of set top boxes are matters for the manufacturers to decide. However, we have launched a joint consultation with the DTI to examine how integrated digital television sets will help achieve switch over. We are seeking comments on what conditions should apply to digital decoders in order to ensure that consumers with disabilities can get all the benefits of digital television. This will inform our future policy decisions on digital television.

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture Media and Sport has not met the Secretary of State for Health formally to discuss obesity, but is involved in the health inequalities cross cutting review discussions chaired by the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="20710w10.html_para2">I chair monthly cross-governmental ministerial meetings, attended by Ministers from the Department of Health, where issues relating to sports policy are discussed, including sport and physical activity initiatives which have a role in combating obesity. The last meeting was held on 2 July.
<P>

<a name="20710w10.html_para3">My Department accepts that physical activity has an important role to play in combating the prevalence of obesity. We are committed to increasing the number and quality of opportunities for participation in sport and physical activity by all sectors of the community and especially for pupils in schools, and we are working closely with Department of Health and Department for Education and Skills to help achieve this objective.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what action the Government are taking to encourage local authorities to recognise the role that sports can play in society.  [68532]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Local authorities are key providers of sport and recreation and play a central role in the delivery of sport for local communities. The Government has taken significant action to encourage local authorities to recognise the important role that sport can play in society. These measures include forging successful partnerships with local authorities through Sport England to deliver a number of key sports programmes such as 'Active Sports' 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jul 2002 : Column 973W</I><P>
(which helps children and young people achieve more from their sport, delivered at local level by local authorities, sports clubs, education services, schools and governing bodies of sport), and 'Active Communities' (which involves working closely with local authorities and other partners in the community to increase life long participation in sport and to promote the improvement in the delivery of local sporting opportunities and services for the community).
<P>

<a name="20710w10.html_para4">Sport England has also published "The Value of Sport"&#151;a major advocacy tool to help local authorities to respond in a positive way to the Government's Best Value and Modernising initiatives. The document responds to the challenge of 'Why invest in sport?', and highlights the key role of the public sector in enabling and providing sport at the local level. It actively champions the benefits and contribution that sport can make to the broader local authority policy agenda, including health, education, social inclusion, community safety, community regeneration, the economy and the environment.
<P>

<a name="20710w10.html_para5">The Government's Beacon Council Scheme aims to raise standards of local authority services by a programme designed to spread best practice. Beacon Council status recognises councils which are excellent in a particular service or cross cutting area and have good performance across the board. The scheme requires Beacon Councils to share best practice with other councils through a national co-ordinated programme of events. In 2001 the Beacon Council Scheme identified four successful councils excelling in Regeneration through Culture, Sport and Tourism, which were Knowsley, Sunderland, Gateshead, and Nottingham. These successful authorities will use their position as Beacon Councils to promote and share best practice with other authorities. My Department is also encouraging local authorities to develop Local Cultural Strategies by the end of 2002. These strategies will help local authorities express their own cultural visions and priorities in response to the needs and aspirations of local communities. They will provide a strategic overview, recognising the role of cultural services, such as sport, in tackling the wider objectives of social inclusion, regeneration, life long learning, and creating healthier and safer communities. Cultural Strategies will help local authorities to ensure equity and access for everyone to cultural activities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There is no requirement for a EU-flagged fishing vessel operating under third country agreements to notify the UK when it is involved in a collision. UK registered fishing vessels are required to report accidents to the Maritime Accident Investigation Branch. The reports do not require information on whether the vessel is operating under third country agreements. We therefore do not have these figures.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement of security arrangements in the handling of passengers' baggage in provincial airports in the European Union following the events of 11 September 2001.  [63533]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 International standards for aviation security are set down by the International Civil Aviation Organisation and, within Europe, by the European Civil Aviation Conference. Responsibility for the implementation of those standards, which apply to all airports handling relevant flights, including provincial airports, rests with the appropriate states. The UK has a programme in place to meet international standards. In addition, the UK has a programme of security measures for UK airlines to follow when operating overseas to supplement the host states' requirements.
<P>

<a name="20710w11.html_para0">Following the events of 11 September, legislation is before the European Parliament to strengthen aviation security standards throughout the EU, including a requirement to screen all hold baggage by 31 December 2003. In the UK, hold baggage on international flights has been screened since 1998. Screening of cabin baggage has been in place in the UK and throughout Europe for many years.

 Information is not available about the total number or percentage of elderly people involved in road injury accidents. However, a provisional estimate for 2001 is that around 10 per cent. of those killed or injured in road accidents in Great Britain were aged 60 or over.

 The Department publishes forecasts, but not targets, for road traffic. The Department has been conducting and commissioning work to improve its modelling capabilities, with the aim of developing from the National Road Traffic Forecasting framework a fully multi-modal approach, as announced in the 10 Year Plan for Transport. This work continues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's proposals for reducing the noise levels near the strategic network of English trunk roads, including motorways, were published in the 10 Year Plan for Transport. These include a commitment that over 60 per cent. of the network, including all lengths having concrete surfaces, will be resurfaced with quieter materials by the end of the plan period. All proposals for new or improved trunk roads will include the use of quieter surfacing. In addition, other noise reducing measures will be provided in the most serious and pressing cases where there is no early prospect of the road being resurfaced. Priority in such cases will be given to roads where there are severe effects on adjacent properties and no such measures were provided when they were built or last improved.

 My right hon.

 The Strategic Rail Authority is an executive non-departmental public body, whose accounts are not consolidated into the Department's accounts. Any grants paid by the Department to the authority are treated as programme expenditure in the Department's own accounts.

<P>
<P>

 The rights of the commercial lenders are determined through commercially confidential loan agreements as and when they are entered into by the lenders and Network Rail.

 The details of the notification made to the European Commission in respect of the support which the Government has agreed to make available to Network Rail if it successfully completes the acquisition of Railtrack plc are confidential. However, the contingent liabilities which the Government would incur as a result of this support are set out in the two Minutes which were laid before the House by my right hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w13.html_spnew22"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 "Other sums" refers to additional amounts that may be payable that are customary in facilities of this type, such as break costs. Break costs are costs which may be incurred if (i) the loan is prepaid (ii) an interest period is shortened by virtue of the prepayment and (iii) lenders are adversely affected. It is not possible to quantify these amounts in advance as they would depend on circumstances at the time, for example the level of interest rates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w13.html_spnew24"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics takes independent decisions in matters concerning the classification, preparation and publication of statistics.

<a name="20710w13.html_para3">On 5 October 2001 the Department was informed that the ONS had determined that Railtrack's scheme for a new special purpose vehicle&#151;RenewCo&#151;would be classified in the public sector, if set up as proposed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if the Government would allow the SRA to exceed the borrowing limit outlined in paragraph eight, sub-paragraph six of Schedule 14 of the Transport Act 2000 in order to meet its liabilities as outlined in paragraph 21 of the Network Rail Minute to the House.  [67061]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w13.html_spnew26"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The provision of any funds necessary to meet the SRA's financial obligations would be made by way of grant under paragraph 7 of schedule 14 of the Transport Act 2000 or by permitting the SRA to borrow in accordance with paragraph 8 of that schedule. Whether, and the extent to which, the SRA would be allowed to borrow would be determined at the time. The SRA's borrowing could not exceed &#163;3 billion without this limit being extended by statutory instrument, a draft of which had been approved by the House of Commons.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w13.html_spnew27"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The SRA have committed to provide Network Rail with grants to remunerate legacy costs incurred in the period 1 April 2001 to 30 September 2004, up to a cap of &#163;5 billion, to the extent they are not recognised in an interim review. The regulator set out his proposed approach to an interim review in his statement of 27 June.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if the Government have made a financial provision for the potential additional costs arising from an increased settlement to Network Rail resulting from an interim review by the Rail Regulator.  [67165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w13.html_spnew28"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 While the legacy of Railtrack and its cost overruns creates potential additional costs, the Government expects Network Rail to operate more efficiently than Railtrack with lower financing costs and a re-investment of operating surpluses back into the network. We cannot anticipate the outcome of the proposed interim review that would take all of these factors into account.

 The Higher Education Funding Council for England issues capital grants to higher education institutions including those with medical schools, which are used for a number of purposes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many schools in Somerset provide up to two hours of sport and physical education each week.  [67588]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The Government are committed to all children having two hours of high quality physical education (PE) and school sport a week, within and outside the curriculum. The Specialist Sports College and the School Sport Co-ordinator programmes are helping schools make that a reality. From September 1.8 million pupils will be benefiting from the School Sport Co-ordinator programme within 142 partnerships with nearly 750 co-ordinators and over 3500 primary or special school link teachers.
<P>

<a name="20710w15.html_para0">The Department for Education and Skills does not collect data on the number of schools in Somerset that are providing the two hour entitlement. However, we do know that Somerset currently has 1 School Sport Co-ordinator partnership (with 6 co-ordinators) and King Arthur's Community School will begin operating this September as a Sport College. Nationally we estimate that about 25 per cent. of schools&#151;those within School Sport Co-ordinator Partnerships&#151;are offering their pupils access to the two hour entitlement. However, an audit due to take place during the autumn term will check this assumption.

<P>
<a name="20710w15.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2002]:</i> Prior to 1998&#150;99, funding for discretionary support was made within the Education SSA. This is not broken down into specific funding lines and individual LEA allocations are therefore not available. In 1999, discretionary funding for young people post-16 in schools was transferred to the School Access Funds. The amount of School Access Funds made available to LEAs for discretionary support in the EMA pilot areas is set out in the table.
<P>

<a name="20710w15.html_para1">Separate allocations of Access Funds are also made available to colleges, including sixth form colleges. The amounts are listed in the Further Education Funding Council and Learning and Skills Council Circulars (FEFC Circulars 97/32, 98/29, 99/27,00/14, LSC Circular 01/08).

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2002]:</i> The National Advisory Committee on Creative and Cultural Education reported jointly to the Secretaries of State for Education and Employment and Culture, Media and Sport in 1999 via the report "All our Futures". The report contained 59 detailed recommendations for action by a range of bodies including Government, schools and higher education institutions. My Department has worked closely with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and external partners, to implement the recommendations.
<P>

<a name="20710w16.html_para0">Some of the main steps taken so far include funding of &#163;270 million for the introduction of the Music Standards Fund to protect and expand LEA Music Services; the establishment of Artsmark, a national awards scheme now in its second year which recognises schools which offer

a wide range of arts provision; and the recent joint announcement of &#163;130 million for the Space for Sport and Arts programme which will fund almost 300 primary schools nationwide to modernise or build new multi-use halls and sports facilities and new music and arts studios.
<P>

<a name="20710w16.html_para1">Other major initiatives in progress include the development of 16 Creative Partnerships Pilots, with the aim of building long-term, sustainable relationships between creative professionals and schools. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is undertaking a project focusing on pupils' creativity across the curriculum which will produce guidance for schools on ways to promote pupils' creativity.
<P>

<a name="20710w16.html_para2">Our White Paper, "Schools: achieving success", repeats our commitment that all pupils should have access to a broad and rich education with a variety of extra-curricula activities and that, over time, all primary school pupils who want to should have the opportunity to learn a musical instrument.

The requirements constitute the minimum deemed necessary for a dwelling house to be fit for human habitation. Among other requirements a dwelling should have adequate provision for lighting, heating and ventilation, have an adequate piped supply of wholesome water, have an effective system for the drainage of foul, waste and surface water, have a suitably located WC for exclusive use of the occupants, have a bath or shower and wash-hand basin, with hot and cold water.

This includes ensuring such properties have adequate toilet and bathroom facilities and adequate means of escape from fire and other fire precautions. The Housing (Fire Safety in Houses in Multiple Occupation) Order 1997 (SI 1997/230) places a mandatory duty on local authorities to ensure, in consultation with local fire authorities, that HMOs of three storeys or more and occupied by more than four persons are adequately equipped with means of escape from fire.

<a name="20710w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Current planning guidance on telecommunications is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 (revised) (PPG8). PPG8 states that health considerations and public concern can in principle be material considerations in determining applications for planning permission and prior approval. Whether such matters are material in a particular case is ultimately a matter for the courts. It is for the decision-maker (usually the local planning authority) to determine what weight to attach to such considerations in any particular case.
<P>

<a name="20710w18.html_para6">However, it is the Government's firm view that the planning system is not the place for determining health safeguards. It remains central Government's responsibility to decide what measures are necessary to protect public health. In the Government's view, if a proposed mobile phone base station meets the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure it should not be necessary for a local planning authority, in processing an application for planning permission or prior approval, to consider further the health aspects and concerns about them.

 Local planning authorities already have powers to decline to determine an application for planning permission if, within the previous two years, the Secretary of State has refused a similar application called in by him, or has dismissed an appeal against the refusal of a similar application, provided in each case there has been no material change in circumstances. The Planning Green Paper said that we propose to extend these powers to allow local planning authorities to decline to determine applications where a similar application has been refused and not appealed, or a similar application is still under consideration by them, or is at appeal, or has been called in.

 In our White Paper, "Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services", we made clear that we would use our reserve capping powers only in exceptional circumstances. We have carefully considered this year's increases and concluded it would not be appropriate to use the powers this year. (However, we remain concerned about the level of council tax increases and the willingness of local people to pay them. We have issued guidance on best practice on consulting local people about tax and spend decisions and we will be looking at how effectively authorities have engaged their local tax payers on future council tax increases.)

5. There were no new preserved rights cases after March 1993 when the community care arrangements came into force. The amount paid for preserved rights cases has declined in line with the case load which reduces by about 10,000 cases each year.<P>

<a name="20710w20.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what help has been given to manufacturing workers who have been made redundant in finding alternative employment.  [66159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> We recognise the devastating impact redundancies can have on local economies and the people directly affected. Wherever major redundancies occur, in manufacturing or any other sector, Jobcentre Plus together with other key regional partners, will set up a task force to identify and provide the support needed by those affected. This can include help through the Rapid Response Service where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="20710w20.html_para1">The aim of the Rapid Response Service is to provide support for those affected by redundancy and help people make the transition into sustainable new jobs. The nature of the help provided by the service will be tailored to the needs of the individuals, the employer, and the local labour market. This could include offering information, advice and guidance to those affected, help with jobsearch, facilitating retraining where necessary, or developing customised retraining programmes. People affected by redundancy can also have early access to Jobcentre Plus programmes such as the New Deals and Work Based Learning for Adults. Assistance is currently being made available to over 13,000 people from 47 different companies.
<P>

<a name="20710w20.html_para2">On 1 April 2002, the Rapid Response Service became fully operational, supported by a further investment of &#163;6 million over two years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what measures he is taking to increase <i>(a)</i> awareness and <i>(b)</i> accessibility of benefit entitlements in rural areas.  [66787]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> We are leading a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it from a passive organisation paying out benefits to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self- sufficient and independent. To do this service delivery is being overhauled to offer distinct services that meet the different needs of the Department's client groups: pensioners, people of working age and children. We are investing in improved and modernised services that are easier for customers to access, make better use of technology, and are more accurate and secure.
<P>

<a name="20710w20.html_para3">Jobcentre Plus is addressing the difficulties faced by people living in rural areas, both in securing employment and gaining access to its services. A key part of the new Jobcentre Plus process involves initial contact being made by telephone, improving service for people whose nearest office is a distance from their home.




<P>
<P><I>10 Jul 2002 : Column 1014W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20710w20.html_para4">Customers can also access Employer Direct, Jobseeker Direct and the Benefit Enquiry Line (for people with disabilities) by telephone. In addition, they can access Worktrain, Learndirect and UK Online centres through the internet. Jobcentre Plus will continue to look for innovative ways of delivering and marketing its service, building on current experiments such as locating Jobpoints and other services in retail outlets and post offices.
<P>

<a name="20710w20.html_para5">The local service element of the Pension Service is being developed to reflect the communities it serves in rural areas and it will take full account of the needs of individual communities. Among other things, it will raise awareness and encourage the take-up of benefits to which pensioners may be entitled. At present, a visiting service is provided for customers. From October 2002, we plan that the local service will start to provide surgeries for both appointments and drop-in calls.
<P>

<a name="20710w20.html_para6">Drop-in surgeries will be available from April 2003 such as community centres or the premises of voluntary bodies regularly visited by pensioners, increasing awareness and accessibility of the Pension Service and its work. There will also be a network of formation points in similar locations and a benefits information service for care workers, volunteers and others to raise awareness of pensioner benefits.

<P>
<a name="20710w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Our embassy in Khartoum has made representations at ministerial level in Khartoum, both bilaterally and in co-ordination with EU partners, on the Sudanese Government's reported plans to legalise female genital mutilation (FGM). The Government of Sudan reassured us that there were no plans to legalise the practice. The embassy also works closely with Sudanese civil society groups in advocating the eradication of FGM. It forms part of the campaign for ratification of the UN Convention on the Eradication of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) in which we have actively supported the growing women's rights movement and UN attempts to address these issues. In particular, our embassy has on-going discussion with UNICEF. We have also funded various project aimed at eradication of FGM, including the national advocacy campaign for 2002&#150;03.

These 1992 negotiations envisaged a Cyprus composed of a Greek Cypriot Federated State and a Turkish Cypriot Federated State.

 The United States is one of our closest allies. The closeness of the relationship was reinforced by the events of 11 September. There are regular UK ministerial meetings with State Department and other Administration officials in Washington. The Foreign Secretary talks regularly with the Secretary of State. Parliament has close links with Congress and our ambassador in Washington and his embassy have access to the US Administration across a wide range of issues. The UK probably has more high level daily contacts with the US than any other country allowing us to foresee problems and work hard to iron out our differences.

However, based on data published by the European Commission and European Court of Auditors, the UK's net contribution to the EC budget in 2000 was &#163;63.1 on a per capita basis. This figure includes the UK's payments to and receipts from the EC budget, but does not, however, capture other benefits which membership of the EU brings to the UK through closer economic ties with our neighbours. For example, over three quarters of a million UK companies now trade with the rest of the EU, which accounts for over 50 per cent. of the UK's total exports, and affects around 3 million UK jobs.

 The Lord Chancellor has no such plans. Section 50 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 requires employers to allow reasonable time off for undertaking magisterial and other duties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w25.html_spnew11"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Chancellor has had no recent discussions on this specific subject. Under the long- standing agreements which govern VAT law across the European Union, member states are only permitted to introduce reduced rates of VAT for a prescribed list of goods and services set out in annex H of the sixth VAT directive. General 'fire prevention materials' for use in the home are not among the items included in the annex H list.
<P>

<a name="20710w25.html_para4">However, the UK's zero rate for the construction of new dwellings does include fire retardant building materials, as well as fire alarms, smoke detectors and fire safety equipment installed when a new home is being built. Similarly, the 5 per cent. reduced rate for residential conversions and renovations includes fire retardant building materials, fire alarms, smoke detectors and fire safety equipment installed at the time of the conversion.
<P>

<a name="20710w25.html_para5">We have also reduced to 5 per cent. the VAT on grant funded installation of smoke alarms when these are installed at the same time as energy saving materials or central heating systems. This is part of the VAT reduced rate introduced to support DEFRA's home energy efficiency scheme (HEES). HEES grants are primarily targeted at less well off people aged over 60 or receiving specified benefits, so the related reduced rate is similarly well targeted at those who need help most.

 The setting of fees is the responsibility of the Financial Services Authority in relation to the duties it performs under the relevant industrial and provident society Acts. The new level of fees has not yet been finalised and through consultation the FSA has listened carefully to the concerns that have been raised by some in the movement.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2002]:</i> The Department has not issued any guidance on this subject and has no plans to do so. Devolving power within the national health service recognises that frontline clinicians are best placed to make decisions on how to run the local health service and gives the freedom for them to decide how they will develop relationships in running the health service locally. However, 'Shifting the Balance of Power: The Next Steps' (January 2002) makes it clear that primary care trusts (PCTs) need to develop close working relationships with partners in NHS trusts. The relationship that PCTs develop with their colleagues in NHS trusts, including consultants, will be central to PCTs effectively discharging their functions for example planning and commissioning services for their local populations. PCTs will need to ensure that they engage in effective dialogue with clinicians working within NHS Trusts if they are to secure the best possible services to meet the needs of the local population. It is, however, a matter for PCTs and hospitals to decide the detail of how they do this.

 National health service trusts can charge for car parking in order to raise additional income to improve the health service using income generation powers.

 The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) receive reports of suspected adverse drug reactions (ADRs) submitted by doctors, dentists, pharmacists and coroners via the Yellow Card Scheme by doctors, and there is a legal requirement for companies to report 'suspected' ADRs to their drugs. In 2001, a total of 21,350 reports of 'suspected' ADRs were received through this scheme of which 1,964 ( 9 per cent.) occurred in patients over 75 years of age. The number of reports received via the yellow card scheme does not directly equate to the number of people who suffer adverse reactions to drugs for a number of reasons including an unknown level of under reporting. It is important to note that the reporting of a reaction does not necessarily mean it was caused by 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jul 2002 : Column 1038W</I><P>
the drug and may relate to other factors such as the patient's underlying illness or other medicines taken concurrently.
<P>

<a name="20710w27.html_para4">According to the Department's hospital episode statistics (HES) it is estimated that 151,571 bed days were lost in patients over 75 years of age during 2001 due to the adverse effects of drugs, medicaments and biological substances in therapeutic use. This estimate is based on 16,747 finished consultant episodes (FCEs) where the primary reason for admission was due to adverse effects of drugs, medicaments and biological substances in therapeutic use. FCES are not the same as the number of patients treated because a hospitalised spell can consist of more than one FCE. These figures would only include adverse drug reactions occurring in hospital if a different FCE resulted where the primary cause was the adverse drug reaction. Cost of treatment is not recorded in HES.
<P>

<a name="20710w27.html_para5">Over the last 20 years, 'suspected' ADRs with a fatal outcome account for 2&#150;3 per cent. of the reports submitted via the yellow card scheme. A total of 643 reports with a fatal outcome were received during 2001, of these 130 occurred in patients aged over 75 years. The Office of National Statistics also collates data on deaths certified by doctors and coroners as due to adverse effects of drugs in therapeutic use. The quality of these data may be inconsistent as many thousands of doctors write certificates with a wide variation in knowledge, training and practice. The latest available figures are for 2000, during which 84 of the 159 deaths that were certified as due to adverse effects of drugs occurred in persons aged 75 years and over.

 No, the vaccine can be used without clinical trials. There are currently no plans to undertake clinical trials of the smallpox vaccine in the UK. Since smallpox does not currently exist in the population, trials of protective efficacy are not possible. The EU committee for proprietary medicinal products is currently developing the requirements for the manufacture of second generation smallpox vaccine, which will include guidance on the design of any clinical trials.

 Work is in hand, through the Department's Directorate of Health and Social Care, with the local leadership of the national health service to identify local health economies in which international establishment schemes can respond to real and sustained capacity needs. As the prospectus notes, NHS commissioners will have a key role, in conjunction with the Department, in defining requirements from such initiatives.

 The national health service pension scheme for England and Wales does not keep a separate record of the pensions paid to retired NHS staff and general practitioners. However, the total amount paid for 2001&#150;02 by the NHS pension scheme in respect of pensions to retired members and their dependents was &#163;2.8 billion.

 Funding for diabetes is being considered as part of the current Government spending review, together with other priorities. The Budget provides the highest sustained growth in national health service history with annual average increases of 7.4 per cent. in real terms over the five years 2003&#150;04 to 2007&#150;08. Decisions about the allocation of the increased funding will be announced later this year.

<a name="20710w30.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 There is a well established association between diabetes and coronary heart disease. There are a number of common risk factors. In particular, people who are overweight or obese, those who are not physically active and those who do not enjoy a balanced diet are at greater risk of both Type 2 diabetes and coronary heart disease. The standards for the diabetes national service framework, published in December 2001, highlight the importance of common strategies for prevention and treatment. In doing so, they build on the frameworks for coronary heart disease and older people.

<P>
<a name="20710w30.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Estimates of the number of people awaiting diagnosis for diabetes vary depending on which study is consulted. The Department has based its estimates upon the health surveys for England. Extrapolation from the 1993 survey, the largest and most representative study on this question, leads to an estimate of around 550,000 people currently with undiagnosed diabetes. However, other smaller studies suggest that the number could be greater.

<P>
<a name="20710w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government are introducing a range of initiatives to reduce antisocial behaviour among young people. We are evaluating the success of Acceptable Behaviour Contacts and will be disseminating good practice for practitioners. We are enhancing the effectiveness of antisocial behaviour orders so the community can be protected more quickly. The range of other measures being introduced includes truancy sweeps and the safer schools partnerships scheme. These initiatives build on the work being delivered through the youth inclusion programmes and the Connexions Service as well as a range of programmes introduced by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.

 The latest guidelines on speed enforcement thresholds were issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) in February 2000. They stress proportionality in applying the law, targeting of enforcement action and consistency of approach among police forces. I welcome the guidelines as providing a sound and transparent basis for police enforcement action in what is a sensitive area of policing. While they are designed to promote a consistent approach by police forces, the police retain full discretion to take account of the particular circumstances of any individual speeding offence.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the reply the Minister of State, my right hon. Friend the Member for Southampton, Itchen (Mr. Denham) gave the hon. Member for Chipping Barnet (Sir Sydney Chapman) on 9 April 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 702W.
<P>

<a name="20710w32.html_para4">Since my right hon. Friend's answer, these figures have been revised. The Cabinet Office published a report on 3 July 2002 stating that the minimum cost of identity fraud to the economy is now estimated to be in excess of &#163;1.3 billion per annum. Two key reasons for this are the weaknesses in the process used to issue documents used as identity, and the weaknesses in processes used to check identity at point of use.

<a name="20710w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The private sector has a key role in contributing to the delivery of crime and disorder reduction. The 1998 Act requires that the private sector are invited to participate in the development and implementation of crime and disorder reduction strategies for their area in co-operation with the local crime and disorder reduction partnership. We will shortly be embarking on extensive consultation with representatives from business organisations on how best to create a more effective partnership between business, Government and other key stakeholders to deliver reductions in crime and disorder.

 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2002]:</i> Airwave, which uses terrestrial trunked radio system (Tetra) technology, will enhance officer safety by providing the police with a modern and reliable communication system. Concerns have been expressed, in general, about the safe use of mobile phones and, in particular, about pulsed signals. Current evidence suggests that it is unlikely that the unique features of Tetra pose a hazard to health. However, a precautionary approach is being taken and the Home Office, advised by independent experts, is commissioning further scientific studies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w34.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary made a statement to the House on 3 July 2002 announcing the publication of a consultation paper on Entitlement Cards and Identity Fraud. The consultation period will last until 10 January 2003. The Government have made it clear that the introduction of an entitlement card would be a major step and that it would not proceed without consulting widely and considering all the views expressed very carefully. The consultation paper rules out a scheme where it would be compulsory to carry a card but does raise the option of a universal scheme where everyone would have to register and obtain a card.
<P>

<a name="20710w34.html_para3">The paper includes a number of estimates of what a scheme would cost, depending on the sophistication of the card. A reasonable estimate would be that a scheme would cost around &#163;1.3 billion over a 13-year period covering the three years it would take to set up the necessary information technology systems and the 10-year period for which the first cards would be valid.
<P>

<a name="20710w34.html_para4">This would include much more stringent identity checks than currently apply for passports and driving licences in response to increased levels of fraudulent applications.
<P>

<a name="20710w34.html_para5">It would also include the costs of using biometric information (fingerprints or iris images) which would uniquely link the card holder with a card.
<P>

<a name="20710w34.html_para6">A universal entitlement card would be a powerful weapon in the fight against crimes of identity fraud which cost the economy at least &#163;1.3 billion each year. It could also help to combat illegal immigration and illegal working. The degree to which a card scheme could reduce these crimes would depend on the type of card scheme introduced, to what services it was linked and the speed of its introduction. The Government will be consulting on these and other issues during the consultation exercise.

<a name="20710w34.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much money was spent by the relevant pension fund on paying pensions to retired members of the police force in 2001&#150;02; if he will estimate the corresponding amounts to be spent in <i>(a)</i> five years' time, <i>(b)</i> 10 years' time, <i>(c)</i> 20 years' time and <i>(d)</i> 30 years' time; if he will estimate in each case the proportion of such liabilities which will arise from (i) unfunded pension schemes and (ii) pre-funded pension schemes; and in the case of pre-funded schemes; if he will estimate the value of the corresponding pre-funded funds in each of these years.  [66560]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w34.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Police Pension Scheme is an unfunded scheme. The cost of police pensions in England and Wales in 2001&#150;02 is estimated at &#163;1.1 billion. Estimated costs to individual police authorities in 2001&#150;02 are set out in the table. No projections of police pensions' costs in five, 10, 20 and 30 years' time are available. These are matters for individual police authorities.
<P>

<a name="20710w34.html_para8">As we made clear in the White Paper 'Policing a New Century: A Blueprint for Reform', we are aware of the need of police authorities and chief officers for a system which brings greater clarity about pensions obligations on individual police authorities. With the Treasury we are examining the options for a revised system of funding which would bring this about.

 At 30 September 1997 there were 107,505 full-time equivalent male police officers and 19,357 full-time equivalent female police officers in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="20710w34.html_para11">At 30 September 2001 there were 105,136 full-time equivalent male police officers and 22,094 full-time equivalent female police officers in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="20710w34.html_para12">We have reversed the long-term decline in police strength. Police officer numbers had reached a record number by the end of January 2002. We are on track for our target of 130,000 officers by spring 2003.
<P>

<a name="20710w34.html_para13">The proportion of female officers has risen from 15 per cent. to 17 per cent., and raising the representation of women in the Police Service is an area we are continuing to address.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidelines are issued to police forces regarding <i>(a)</i> colour blindness tests for recruits and <i>(b)</i> the standards which recruits must attain to be accepted.  [66465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w34.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Guidelines issued by the Home Office (Home Office Circular 7/98) state that candidates for the police service need to be able to pass the City University Colour Vision Test and achieve 7/10 of the plates to pass.
<P>

<a name="20710w34.html_para14">The Home Office are currently funding research to develop new job related medical and eyesight standards. The research includes whether there is a continuing need for a colour vision requirement. Draft recommendations on eyesight requirements are due shortly. These will be discussed with The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and police interest groups and are expected to be introduced later this year. All forces will be expected to apply the new standards consistently.

 The management of police property and allocation of resources are matters for each police authority and the chief officer who are best placed to assess local needs for the policing plan and local operational priorities, taking local opinion into account.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many special constables are serving, and what the total was on 1 May 1997, broken down by individual police authorities; how many special constables <i>(a)</i> were recruited to each police authority in each year since 1997 and <i>(b)</i> left; what regulations govern the method of recruitment and enlistment of special constables, and whether they vary between police area; and how long a gap there was on average in the last 12 months between a potential special constable's volunteering and eventual enlistment, broken down by police area.

 Statistics on the strength of the special constabulary are collected by the Home Office Research Development and Statistics Directorate for the end of March and September each year.
<P>

<a name="20710w35.html_para0">The tables show the strength of specials, by force, in 1997 and 2001 and details, by force, of recruitment and wastage for each year since 1997.

<a name="20710w35.html_para1">The Special Constables Regulations 1965 (as amended) specify that a person appointed as a special must have attained the age of 18 years and be of good character and health. Beyond that, the regulations leave qualification for appointment to the discretion of the chief officer. However, the Home Office has issued guidance on the eligibility and recruitment of specials, in particular, Home Office Circular 12/2000, copies of which have been lodged with the Library.
<P>

<a name="20710w35.html_para2">Information on time taken between the application and appointment of specials is not collected centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proportion of <i>(a)</i> lorries and <i>(b)</i> other vehicles passing through Dover from France were not checked for purposes of seeking to discover illegal entrants over the last 12 months.  [68620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20710w37.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2002]:</i> Approximately 2,500 lorries arrive at Dover every day on board cross Channel ferries. The majority of these vehicles will have undergone pre-boarding checks conducted by agents for either the carrier or the port authority. In addition, over the last 12 months the Immigration Service has checked on average of almost 8 per cent. of lorries on arrival at Dover. With effect from May 2002 the search ratio has increased to 12 per cent. Selection is based on collated intelligence and profiles.
<P>

<a name="20710w37.html_para2">Other vehicles such as private cars and vans are not systematically checked by Immigration Officers at Dover, but checks are carried out where a vehicle fits a particular profile or where the Immigration Officer's suspicions are otherwise aroused.
