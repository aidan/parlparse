 DFID provides targeted project support to tackle leprosy through the Leprosy Mission in India and the Leprosy Relief Association in Brazil. This funding supports community based efforts to improve access to care, reduce stigma and rehabilitate those affected. DFID commitment to these projects for 2005&#150;6 is &#163;196,453. Similar projects with other non-government organisations have recently ended in Brazil and Nepal. Overall DFID commitment from 2002 to 2008 is &#163;1,152,453.

 The UK bilateral programme in 2002&#150;03, 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 was &#163;395,000, &#163;267,000 and &#163;231,000 respectively. The attributed UK share of EC expenditure from 2001 to 2003 was &#163;400,000, &#163;200,000 and &#163;200,000 respectively.

<a name="stpa_1">Bilateral expenditure in 2005&#150;06 was &#163;200,000. This was accounted for entirely by the Small Grants Scheme. During 2005&#150;06, it was agreed that responsibility for this scheme globally would be transferred to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. The formal DFID bilateral programme in Mongolia is therefore coming to an end.

<a name="stpa_15">On multilateral aid&#151;most of the funding provided through UN agencies is earmarked to specific activities and is therefore included in the bilateral assistance above. The UK share of the European Commission Humanitarian Office (ECHO) expenditure is 17.25 per cent. Current ECHO expenditure in Somalia in response to the drought is &#8364;1,358,233. The UK share is therefore &#8364;237,689, or &#163;164,020.96. The UK also contributes to other multilateral organisations, some of which may have contributed in response to the drought&#151;for example the African Development bank has said it will provide $500,000 to the World Food Programme (WFP) for its operations in Somalia. However as these agencies will not report expenditure incurred in 2006 until the end of 2007, it is not possible to calculate an imputed UK share at this stage.

<p><a name="st_16"><a name="60329w03.html_spnew2"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The political and security situation in much of south and central Somalia makes the provision of aid very difficult. Our assessments are led by the impact of:

<p>
<a name="60329w03.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_19">However, the establishment of the Transitional Federal Institutions provides the best opportunity for bringing lasting peace and governance to Somalia. The recent convening of the Transitional Federal Parliament (TFP) in Baidoa, is a positive step forward after almost a year of political division. Parliament is the only institution which can give legitimacy to the transitional process and, as the most inclusive body of the TFIs, it needs to begin to operate. The parliamentary session in Baidoa marks the start of the resumption of the process of restoring central governance to Somalia. The international community agrees that supporting it is a priority, and we, with other donors, are providing funds for this.

The recent outbreak of heavy fighting in Mogadishu threatens the wider reconciliation process. I hope that those involved will stop the conflict and reach a settlement. Such fighting, together with the drought, currently worst affecting the south, demonstrates again why Somalia so badly needs a new government to bring stabilityA; and restore human rights and dignity to the people. DFID has responded to the drought with contributions totalling &#163;7 million since December 2005; and our wider programme to help rebuild Somalia&#039;s destroyed social and governance sectors, and those in Somaliland, continues. This includes support to the restoration of public safety and security in Somalia, focusing on the re-establishment of policing, with &#163;600,000 this year through the United Nations Development Programme. We also support the Transitional Federal Government (TFG) in developing the National Security and Stabilisation Plan requested by the UN Security Council.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 2 March 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 868&#150;9W, on Apache helicopters, what were the reasons for the four-year delay in reaching the full complement of trained Apache helicopter pilots.  [57065]</p>








<p><a name="st_71"><a name="60329w08.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The fact that the full complement of Apache Attack Helicopter (AH) pilots will not be achieved by the target date of July 2006 is due to a combination of factors. The main reason was a shortfall of qualified helicopter instructors (QHIs). This has been an enduring issue that has had a marked impact on the quantity of pilots being trained for front line operational units. The original assumption (based on our experience 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>29 Mar 2006 : Column 1004W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
of Lynx and Gazelle training, and advice from subject matter experts) was that a single instructor could train two AH students. However, once training began it became apparent that this assumption was unworkable and the training effort had to be switched in order to generate more instructors. This effectively reduced the pilot delivery rate to the field army. The plan to generate more instructors was further undermined when six QHIs elected to leave the Army shortly after the expiry of their four year time bar. Given that it takes up to 11 months to train an AH instructor, as opposed to six months to convert a pilot, the output of AH qualified pilots has remained lower than planned. Other factors, such as aircraft availability and weather, have exacerbated the situation.

<p><a name="st_89"><a name="60329w11.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 On 12 September 2002, the Health and Safety Executive was notified of the project on their standard form F10: Notification of Project, as required under the CDM Regulations 1994. There was no further discussion with the HSE prior to opening, and it is not normal practice to do so. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) was consulted in December 2002 about the memorials design, and in June 2004 was asked to advise on any further safety measures that should be taken before the memorial was opened to the public. RoSPA&#039;s recommendations were implemented.

 Before the memorial opened The Royal Parks Agency commissioned an independent operational risk assessment and implemented its findings. It also consulted The Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents (RoSPA) which advised that, because of the unusual nature of the site, safety measures would need to be closely monitored during the first months of operation until patterns of visitor behaviour became clear. When a persistent problem was identified, The Royal Parks acted swiftly to close the Memorial while designers, engineers and health and safety experts revised the management of the site.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_115">The CSA does not collect data in exactly these categories but such information as is available is set out in the tables attached, together with notes describing each category.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_116">The Agency defines an application as having cleared the overall application process if a maintenance calculation has been carried out and a payment arrangement between the parent with care and the non resident parent is in place. Additionally, since not all Child Support Agency applications result in a calculation, an application is also defined as cleared if the case is closed, the parent with care is identified as claiming Good Cause or is subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision, or the application is identified as being a change of circumstances on an existing case as opposed to a new application.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_117">The time from application clearance to first payment represents the first stage of the compliance and enforcement part of the process, as by this point the onus will now be, to a large extent, on the non-resident parent to accept financial responsibility for their children and comply with the request for maintenance.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_118">As you will notice, many of the cases yet to clear individual stages of the process are more than a year old, a level of performance which is clearly unacceptable to our clients. In the Operational Improvement Plan announced by the Secretary of State on 9th February 2006, the Agency set itself a target of reducing the backlog of uncleared new applications to the point where, by March 2009, 80% of applications will be cleared within 12 weeks and there will be no backlog in this area.</p>

Notes:<br>

1. Intake type refers to the parent with care&#039;s (PWC) benefit status at the time that their application is received, and not their current benefit status nor the status at the point when the case is cleared. The PWC&#039;s benefit status may change during the course of their application being processed and these figures make no provision to take account of such changes.<br>

2. The pre-application stage is where a potential application is screened to establish whether it is valid. Pre-application clearance is where the case either progresses to the application stage, a reduced benefit decision (RBD) is applied, good cause is accepted, or the case is closed.<br>

3. A case enters application stage where it has been accepted as valid at the pre-application stage. An application clearance occurs when a calculation is carried out, a RBD is subsequently applied, good cause is subsequently accepted or the case is subsequently closed.<br>

4. A case enters post calculation stage where clearance at the application stage results in a calculation being carried out. Post calculation clearance is where a collection schedule is set up, an MD arrangement is set up immediately after calculation, a RBD is subsequently applied, good cause is subsequently accepted, the case is subsequently closed, or the calculation is classified as being a nil liability meaning that no further action is required.<br>

5. The first payment stage is the time between a collection schedule being set up and a first payment being made to the PWC, or a maintenance direct arrangement being put in place. There are an additional 2,000 cases where payment was made to the PWC prior to a schedule or maintenance direct arrangement being agreed (i.e. voluntary payments), which have been excluded from the first table.<br>

6. For those cases that do not result in a calculation, clearance of the overall application process can occur at any stage. Cases can also have cleared individual stages, but still be part way through the overall process. This means that, mathematically, neither the average time to clear the whole application process, nor the age of all uncleared cases can be obtained through summing the components presented in the table.<br>

7. These figures do not include 84,000 cases received via the Jobcentre Plus interface that are yet to be processed, and for which we do not currently have sufficient management information for them to be included in this analysis.<br>

8. In addition, analysis of clearance times excludes 104,000 cases received via the Jobcentre Plus interface that have been closed, or identified as a change of circumstance to an existing case (as opposed to a new application) as, again, we do not currently have sufficient management information for them to be included in this analysis.<br>

9. Figures are rounded to the nearest day.<br>

The Child Maintenance Premium was introduced to provide an incentive to parents with care to co-operate with the Agency and also to selectively target additional support to children in the poorest households. A consequence of child maintenance premium has been a reduction in the amount of maintenance collected by the Agency and paid to the Secretary of State to offset the annual cost of Income Support administered by Job Centre Plus.</p>

 The nature of Maoists&#039; clandestine organisation and operations makes it very difficult to assess how many insurgents there are in Nepal.

However, we estimate that there may be up to 20,000 or 30,000 other activists who may not be armed but will be heavily involved, for instance in detonating small bombs, organising logistics, carrying out extortion. In addition to this, there are probably thousands more political supporters and sympathisers.

 One of the main aims of the caution, as stated in the Cautioning of Adult Offenders Circular 30/2005 issued by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform is to reduce the likelihood of re-offending. It is not possible to set out definitive rules on the circumstances in which cautions are appropriate, because their use involves the exercise of discretion by the police who have to take into account a number of considerations in each case. These considerations include whether a caution is appropriate to the offence and the offender and whether it is likely to be effective in the circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60329w17.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_93">The circular advises that both national and any locally held records must be checked before a caution is given. If the suspect has previously received a caution, then a further caution should not normally be considered. However, if there has been a sufficient lapse of time to suggest that a previous caution has had a significant deterrent effect (two years or more), then a caution can be used. If evidence of repeat cautioning, of the kind

 Concerning action that is been taken I refer the hon.

This built upon the strategy developed since 2001 that included: Over &#163;26 million invested in safer custody arrangements, through the Safer Local Prisons Programme. 2,650 &#039;Listeners&#039; (Samaritan-trained prisoner peer supporters) recruited across the estate. Suicide Prevention Coordinators (or their equivalents) placed in all prisons to provide a focal point for and increase the profile of suicide prevention.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60329w18.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_99">The strategy is aimed at protecting all prisoners, though the Government recognises that prisoners are particularly at risk of self-harm and suicide in their early period in custody, whether sentenced or on remand. Prisoners in early custody are therefore subject to a number of policies and practices designed to enhance their safety. These include health screening upon arrival 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>29 Mar 2006 : Column 1039W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
that includes an assessment of risk of suicide or self-harm, the use of peer supporters (&#039;Insiders&#039;) to offer information and support to new prisoners, and First Night and Induction procedures.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures are being put in place to ensure that the number of international students coming to the UK will not be reduced by the abolition of the appeal system for student visas in the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Bill.  [60745]</p>








<p><a name="st_160"><a name="60329w18.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 I recognise the important economic and cultural contribution that international students make to the United Kingdom. We welcome genuine students and do not want to dissuade them from coming to the country. There is no evidence that potential students are attracted to apply for a course in a particular country because they are eligible for a right of appeal should they be refused entry clearance. We do not, therefore, believe that the removal of appeal rights will be a disincentive to student applications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60329w18.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_101">There is no right of appeal against refusal of entry clearance in many other countries, for instance Australia, Canada and New Zealand. Under the new points based system, students will be granted entry clearance on the basis of transparent and objective criteria. At the moment entry clearance officers are required to make subjective judgements in accordance with the immigration rules. For example, the officer must assess an applicant&#039;s intention and ability to study.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60329w18.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_102">The points based system will abolish this requirement, and an offer from an approved institution will act as a proxy for intention and ability. This will be made possible by the Home Office and education institutions working in partnership to share the responsibility of ensuring that genuine students can come to the country while preventing abuse of the immigration system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60329w18.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_103">Appeal rights will be removed simultaneously with the introduction of the points based system. We plan to implement the new system in phases. This will mean, for example, that as tier four is implemented, and so appeal rights for students will be removed. The systemic improvements brought by the points based system will facilitate the removal of appeal rights.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60329w18.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_104">In lieu of a full right of appeal, people will be able to apply for administrative review of the refusal of entry clearance. If a person is refused, the entry clearance officer&#039;s notice will set out precisely why the decision has been made, referring back to the criteria for which points are awarded. When applying for administrative review the applicant must set out which aspect of the decision, as justified in the refusal letter, was incorrect. Administrative review will provide applicants with a swift and effective remedy where a factual error has been made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60329w18.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_105">We are taking additional steps to ensure that there is a high quality of entry clearance decisions. The role of the Independent Monitor will be enhanced, for example, to provide greater oversight of the operation.

 There are three types of accident and emergency (A&E) department for reporting purposes. Primary care trusts and national health service trusts together with strategic health authorities are expected to use this to determine into which category an individual service falls. The current definition is as follows:

</p>
<ul>

<p>
<a name="60329w23.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_129">A type three department may be doctor led or nurse led. A defining characteristic of a service qualifying as a type three department is that it treats at least minor injuries and illnesses, for example sprains, and can be routinely accessed without appointment. A service mainly or entirely appointment based, for example a general practitioner practice or outpatient clinic, is not a type three A&E service even though it may treat a number of patients with minor illness or injury.

 Bishop Wulstan Catholic School in Warwickshire is a poorly performing school&#150;only 12 per cent. of pupils achieved 5 A*-C grades at GCSE last year-that has experienced falling rolls-only 22 pupils are due to enter the school in September. Officials at my department have had a number of conversations with Warwickshire county council and the Archdiocese of Birmingham about the options available to secure better education for the pupils attending the school over the past few months. As the school has not been deemed by Ofsted to require special measures, the decision as to the future of the school is for the local authority to make rather than the Secretary of State, and therefore I can give no indication on the timing.

 It is for individual schools and local authorities to determine staffing levels, having regard to the number of children with special educational needs, the range and complexity of SEN represented with a given school, the resources available and other relevant factors. School decisions will be informed by the Education Act 1996 which contains the current legal provisions applying to SEN, the SEN Code of Practice (2001) which provides statutory guidance, the associated SEN toolkit and other relevant publications, such as The Management of SEN Expenditure&quot;

<a name="stpa_185">Previously, the then Department of Education and Science did issue a circular in December 1990, numbered 11/90 and entitled Staffing for pupils with special educational needs&quot;, outlining considerations local authorities and schools might bear in mind when determining staffing levels for pupils with SEN. Following representations to withdraw this on the grounds that it had become outdated and misleading, the Department signalled formally, on 20 September 2005, its intention to withdraw 11/90. Comments and objections were invited from interested parties, namely the teacher associations, local government interests and special school organisations. In the light of these, which revealed no major objections, the Department confirmed its intention to withdraw the circular.
