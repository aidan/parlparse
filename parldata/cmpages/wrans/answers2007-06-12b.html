 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will assess the implications of Leeds United Football Club's move into administration for the effectiveness of the regulation relating to companies entering administration where a party involved in the decision to initiate the process has a commercial interest in the assets of the company. [141250]</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 June 2007]: </i>I should state at the outset that the Secretary of State has no powers to impede a company moving into administration as this process is commenced by way of a court order or as a result of a qualifying floating charge holder, company or its directors filing a Notice of Appointment at court.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="70612w0003.htm_para2"><a name="07061263000430">Administrators, as licensed insolvency practitioners, are regulated professionals and are obliged by law to perform their functions in the interests of the company's creditors as a whole. Accordingly, where there is a sale of assets to a connected party of the company in administration, the administrators will need to have satisfied themselves that they are not only achieving the best possible price in the circumstances but that it is an arm's length transaction. Such a sale is sometimes the best option for delivering value for creditors. The Secretary of State has no power to stop a sale and even if he did, such a power could harm the interests of creditors of the company, many of whom have already lost considerable sums as a result of the failure. It is only a creditor or member of a company in administration that can apply to the court if they consider the administrator is acting, has acted, or proposes to act so as unfairly to harm the interests of the applicant (whether alone or in common with some or all members or creditors).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="70612w0003.htm_para3"><a name="07061263000431">I believe it is important to emphasise that in the specific case mentioned, the administrators agreed to the sale of assets on the condition that it would be approved by the body of creditors as part of a proposal to put the company into a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) and that this arrangement was approved on 1 June by more than 75 per cent. of creditors in value.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="70612w0003.htm_para4"><a name="07061263000432">This Government want to promote an effective framework for corporate activity, to give confidence to investors, business and other stakeholders. Within that framework it is essential that we have an insolvency regime, which, while encouraging enterprise and reducing the stigma associated with failure, deals fairly and effectively with financial failure and at the same time deters fraud and misconduct. I can assure you that we are fully committed to tackling abuse and misconduct and that we have in place, and in use, mechanisms to deal with that abuse.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="70612w0003.htm_para5"><a name="07061263000433">You may be interested to know under the Insolvency Act 1986 (before it was amended) the only option to floating charge holders would have been to have put the company into administrative receivership. Under this procedure the administrative receiver's main duty was to the appointing floating charge holder. Under the provisions of the Enterprise Act this was amended to give the option of administration so that now the interests of the creditors as a whole are taken into  <br>

 There is a robust process to establish and sustain the requirement for pilots qualified and able to serve as fast jet pilots. The process for the RAF is undertaken by RAF manpower planners who compare the forecast requirement for fast jet pilots against the forecast strength. Any anticipated gap is then adjusted by modifying the forecast number of fast jet pilots required to graduate from the operational conversion unit as necessary. The RN process is very similar. The process helps to predict manning trends such as premature voluntary release, medical discharge, promotion and normal retirement.</p>

 To ask the Minister of State, Ministry of Justice if she will make a statement on the effectiveness of the Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP) for <i> (a)</i> high, <i> (b)</i> medium and <i> (c)</i> low risk offenders; and what the subsequent reconviction rates are for offenders from each of these categories who took part in the SOTP since its inception.

 The most robust evaluation of the Sex Offender Treatment Programme (SOTP) in England and Wales (Home Office, 2003) examined the impact of the prison-based programme. This compared two-year reconviction rates for prisoners who participated in the programme with those who did not.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="70612w0012.htm_para3"><a name="07061279002533">Findings indicated that the SOTP had an impact on reconvictions for sexual and/or violent offences (as a combined measure). An explanation for this effect could be that a proportion of violent reconvictions were sexually motivated offences. Sexual reconvictions were combined with those for violent offences because sexual offenders (in the absence of intervention) are reconvicted for sexual offences at a very low rate&#151;less than 5 per cent. over two years. Any decrease in this rate as a result of treatment is therefore unlikely to be statistically significant.</p>

Treatment participants in the medium-low and medium-high risk groups showed a statistically significantly lower rate of reconviction than respective risk groups in the comparison sample (see Table 4 in HORF 205).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_500"><a name="70612w0012.htm_para5"><a name="07061279002535">For general and sexual reconviction rates, the treatment group showed lower rates of reconviction than the comparison group although differences were not statistically significant (see Tables 5 and 3 respectively in HORF 205).

Advice and support is offered at every stage of the process. This includes: finding accommodation; establishing income; applying for national insurance credits; registering with a GP and accessing appropriate healthcare and counselling; opening a bank account and budgeting; family/relationship issues; employment and training needs; finding a solicitor to deal with compensation claims.</p>

This local authority area table differs from criminal justice system (CJS) area tables in that an issuing court can be outside the area in which the restrictions have been imposed.  2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 Difficulties with drivers avoiding prosecution do not come primarily from their being untraceable to an address. In 97.5 per cent. of cases, it is possible to trace a vehicle from the database maintained by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA).

 My reply of 16 May referred to the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) Main Grant allocations for 2007-08. As the DIP has evolved, there have been changes to the funding mechanisms each year.

 Reflex, the multi-agency Government taskforce on organised immigration crime was set up in March 2000 and has been successful at disrupting organised immigration crime gangs leading to a large number of arrests and seizure of criminal assets.

 The majority of our knowledge regarding the extent of human trafficking in the UK relates to trafficking for sexual exploitation. It remains difficult to make an accurate assessment of the extent of the problem although intelligence suggests there has been an increase in the trafficking problem over the last two or three years. The findings from a Home Office research paper suggests that at any one time in 2003 there were in the region of 4,000 victims of trafficking for prostitution in the UK. In 2006, a police led multi agency operation on trafficking for sexual exploitation led to the identification of 87 victims from 22 different countries, predominantly from Eastern Europe, China/South-East Asia, Africa or Brazil.</p>

These are: to deny criminals the use of the roads, to reduce road casualties, to tackle thee threat of terrorism, to reduce antisocial use of the roads and to enhance public confidence and reassurance by patrolling the roads.

The recent report of the UN Secretary-General on Cyprus (accessible at: http://www.un.org/Docs/sc/sgrep07.htm) outlines in detail the reasons why this process has not yet started.

 The Department has not made any assessment. It is for councils to decide on how to set charges for non-residential social services. The legal basis is that charges generally should be reasonable, and that no one should be asked to pay more than they reasonably can.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_566"><a name="70612w0021.htm_para15"><a name="07061288000092">Until the guidance on home care charges, &#147;Fairer Charging Policies for Home Care and other non-residential Social Services&#148;, was implemented, councils with social services responsibilities operated under few constraints or guidelines on how to charge for home care and practice varied widely. &#147;Fairer Charging Policies&#148; is statutory guidance, issued under section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970; councils must have regard to it.</p>

It seeks to ensure that, where councils do charge, this will be based on fairer, well designed charging policies. In particular, it aims to ensure that service users on low incomes are protected from charging and that any charges levied on disability benefits are subject to an assessment of disability costs, to ensure their reasonableness.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_568"><a name="70612w0021.htm_para17"><a name="07061288000094">Local authorities have discretion as to whether they charge people receiving benefits for domiciliary care or not. However, if they do decide to do so, the guidance states very clearly that service users should not have their incomes reduced below basic levels of income support or the guarantee credit of pension credit, plus a buffer of 25 per cent., as a result of charges.</p>

Northamptonshire Primary Care Trust is now restarting the provision of IVF following a temporary period of suspension. We are working with the patient support organisation Infertility Network UK to help PCTs share best practice in the provision of fertility services and engage with fertility patients in the planning and prioritisation of services.</p>

 In collaboration with the European Commission and other European health administrations we are exploring ways in which citizens could, if they so choose, make key health data available when seeking treatment in other European states, subject to stringent confidentiality safeguards. This work is at a very early stage and complex technical and information governance issues have yet to be resolved. In particular, any transfer of patient information would need to be in line with the undertakings given in the NHS Care Record Guarantee, and subject to compliance with the European Union Data Protection Directive.</p>

The Department&#146;s NHS Connecting for Health agency is in fact the global leader in healthcare interoperability. NHS Connecting for Health have developed the message implementation manual which uses the international standard HL7V3 to define a standards-based approach to clinical message interchange. These messages are used by the systems which have been through the NHS Connecting for Health national integration centre, to create the largest range of heterogeneous interoperable systems in healthcare globally, with in excess of 100 certified systems. This interoperability framework is underpinned by a robust and resilient messaging infrastructure, known as the spine, which already supports the transfer of many millions of messages every week across the national health service.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_587"><a name="70612w0022.htm_para18"><a name="07061288000152">Another key aspect of healthcare system interoperability is the consistent use of a clinical terminology.

 Expenditure under the contracts let for the core components of the national programme for information technology in the national health service in England, as at 31 March 2007, was &#163;1,001.5 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_597"><a name="70612w0023.htm_para6"><a name="07061288000323">Information about local NHS spending by primary care trusts (PCTs), NHS trusts and other NHS organisations on the national programme for information technology, to complement the investment from central funding, is not collected centrally. However, any such spending is very significantly outweighed by the savings accrued locally from participation in the programme. Most notably, some &#163;4.5 billion has been saved by central rather than local procurement, a figure confirmed by independent industry analysts. In addition, savings have been achieved in the prices paid by the NHS for information technology goods and services due to the central buying power of NHS Connecting for Health, as well as in NHS staff time saved through using the programme's systems and services. For example, the National Audit Office have acknowledged savings of &#163;860 million achieved through centrally negotiated enterprise wide arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_598"><a name="70612w0023.htm_para7"><a name="07061288000324">In addition, PCTs have been specifically reimbursed for funds spent on upgrading existing general practitioner practice systems to make them choose and book compliant, and funding support has also been made available to support NHS trusts deploying a choose and book compliant patient administration system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_599"><a name="70612w0023.htm_para8"><a name="07061288000325">The successes of the national programme are visible every day of the week in hospitals, general practices and pharmacies across the NHS, and the benefits are being experienced by doctors, nurses and, most importantly, by patients. On any typical day the national programme currently enables some 120,000 prescriptions to be transmitted electronically, reducing errors and inefficiencies; 17,000 choose and book electronic bookings to be made, putting patients in charge of their care and reducing significantly the numbers not attending out-patient appointments; almost one-and-a-half million queries to be processed on the patient demographic system, ensuring receipt of around three-quarters of a million letters a year that would otherwise be posted to the wrong address and enabling patient information to be handled more efficiently; over a hundred thousand NHSMail users, each of whom has an e-mail address for life, to send one million secure e-mails, one-third of which contain confidential patient information; five new secure broadband connections to be installed; and some 30,000 general practitioners (GPs) to use the quality management analysis system (QMAS) to deliver better care to patients under the new GP contract.</p>

 Patients registered with the national health service will not be able to prevent their basic demographic and contact details from being held within the NHS care records service (NHS CRS). The NHS has maintained registers of its service users from the earliest days of its existence to support the delivery of healthcare. A record is also kept of which general practice each patient is registered with, and reasons of efficiency and probity require this to be held centrally, for example to prevent multiple general practitioners from being paid for the same patient, and to ensure that the correct commissioning body meets the cost of care provided. A register is also needed to enable the Secretary of State to meet the obligation to provide healthcare, free at the point of contact, for those patients who are ordinarily resident in England.</p>

Access to the PDS is controlled by a member of staffs relationship with the patient, and by what they need to see to do their jobs, and is dependent on their having a current secure smartcard and a valid pass code.</p>

change on the world's poorest nations is integrated into the World Bank energy policy. [140628]</p>

 Climate change is likely to have the greatest impact on the poor, with Africa being particularly vulnerable, even though it has not caused the problem. A high priority for DFID is to work with our international partners, including the World Bank, to help reduce man-made climate change as well as help developing countries adapt to some of the inevitable impacts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_634"><a name="70612w0025.htm_para13"><a name="07061288000454">At the Gleneagles summit in 2005, the UK secured G8 agreement that the World Bank should lead on establishing a new Clean Energy for Development Investment Framework (CEIF) that would operate across the international financing system. The aim of this framework is to accelerate and catalyse public and private sector investments in cleaner energy in developing countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_635"><a name="70612w0025.htm_para14"><a name="07061288000455">The CEIF has three main parts: improving access to energy, especially in Africa; promoting transitions to low-carbon energy, especially in large emerging economies; and helping countries adapt to climate variability and change.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_636"><a name="70612w0025.htm_para15"><a name="07061288000456">The first phase of this work is under way with the World Bank and regional development banks, like the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Inter-American and Asian Development Banks. They are developing work programmes to help their borrowers tackle climate change. Each bank is tailoring its approaches and initiatives to the conditions and challenges of its region and its specific experience and comparative advantage. The World Bank is continuing to work on exploring financial options to support clean energy investments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_637"><a name="70612w0025.htm_para16"><a name="07061288000457">The second phase in implementing the World Bank Action Plan for the CEIF will be reported at the G8 Summit in 2008, to be hosted by Japan. The World Bank has already increased its commitments and resources for clean energy investments. A recent World Bank report shows that in 2006 the Bank increased the financing of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects by 45 per cent., to a total of $668 million, exceeding the 20 per cent. annual increase target set in 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_638"><a name="70612w0025.htm_para17"><a name="07061288000458">We are also working with the World Bank on the adaptation part of the CEIF. For instance, future climate change may affect rainfall patterns, which in turn could directly affect electricity generation from hydropower schemes, so the work involves climate change risk screening. The aim is to make sure that investments, including those in the energy sector, take full account of the potential future impact of climate change and establish what it will cost to adapt.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_639"><a name="70612w0025.htm_para18"><a name="07061288000459">We are looking for a range of G8 outcomes on energy and climate change this year. This includes an invitation to the World Bank to undertake pilot schemes to reduce emissions from deforestation in developing countries. On this, the World Bank is developing a proposal for a Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) to provide support for pilot schemes in developing countries. This follows on from pilot studies to determine low-carbon opportunities in middle-income countries.</p>

 The Global Campaign for Education (GCE) hold an annual Week of Action aimed at raising awareness of the importance of Education for All. The 2006 Week of Action (24-30 April 2006) included a focus on the global shortage of teachers. Following the Week of Action many schools across the United Kingdom discussed the issues and subsequently raised their concerns with their local Members of Parliament or through direct correspondence. My Department received about 80 letters from schools. Most of the letters asked the Government to help provide more teachers for those children living in poorer parts of the world.</p>

 While the UK has not made any direct assessment, we are kept informed by the regular assessments made by relief agencies on the ground. Fighting in and around Mogadishu in the first three months of 2007 resulted in large numbers of deaths and injuries, and has led to the largest displacement of civilians in the world this year, with an estimated 390,000 people newly displaced since the beginning of February. Most of these are additional to the existing 400,000 Internally Displaced People (IDPs) in Somalia. Without access to food, clean water and shelter these people need humanitarian assistance, as do many of those that were not displaced but lost access to services and livelihoods that were disrupted in the fighting. Prior to the fighting, the UN had estimated that 1 million people required humanitarian assistance, and had launched an appeal for $237 million to address these needs.
