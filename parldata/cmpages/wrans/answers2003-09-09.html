To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will place in the Library an estimate of the impact on the level of income of a transfer of all changes in the total level of taxation since 1997 to income tax, broken down by households with annual incomes of up to <i>(a)</i> &#163;30,000, <i>(b)</i> &#163;50,000, <i>(c)</i> &#163;75,000 and <i>(d)</i> above &#163;75,000.  [127059]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30909w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 There are many ways in which income tax increments or decrements equivalent to changes in current receipts since 1997 could be represented. These include raising or lowering one or more of the income tax allowances, increasing or reducing one or more of the tax rates or the size of an income band to which that rate applies and introducing new lower or higher rate bands or allowances. The impact on households with very different annual incomes would very much depend on which approach was adopted.

 General practitioners do not normally receive compensation if they are no longer required to dispense National Health Service prescriptions. Primary care trusts can make transitional arrangements to ensure an orderly winding-down of such dispensing services.
<P>

<a name="30909w04.html_para6">The Government has no plans to change the conditions under which certain GPs can dispense NHS prescriptions. However, in our response to the Health Select Committee Fifth Report, The Control of Entry Regulations and Retail Pharmacy Services in the UK (Cm 5896) on 17 July 2003, we said that we would invite medical and pharmacy representative bodies to look again at existing proposals to reform the rules governing rural NHS dispensing.
<P>

<a name="30909w04.html_para7">We are setting up an advisory group to advise on how best to implement a series of changes we are proposing to current NHS dispensing rules. We published further details on 29 August 2003 in Proposals to Reform and Modernise the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 1992. A copy has been placed in the Library. We will also ask the group to consider the results of the representative bodies' consideration of their proposals for reforming the rules governing rural NHS dispensing.

<a name="30909w05.html_para2">The need for a Bill on Mental Incapacity was raised by many who responded to consultation on the draft Mental Health Bill, which was published in June 2002. The draft Mental Incapacity Bill aims to provide a better decision-making framework for people who are unable to make some decisions for themselves and those that care for them. The Department of Health is working closely with colleagues in the Department for Constitutional Affairs to make sure that the Bill addresses the needs of all vulnerable adults, including people with dementia and those who look after them, whether informal carers or professionals in health or social care services.

<a name="30909w05.html_para6">There is a clear pattern of significant reduction demonstrated in the waiting time information at the end of March 2003. Across all the time bands there have been significant reductions in the number of patients waiting compared to March 1997. This reduction is most apparent in the number of over 12 month waiters, where a total of only 103 patients were waiting at the end of March 2003.

Department of Health form QF01
<i>Notes:</i>
A finished consultant episode is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant in one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as one person may have several episodes within the year.
Figures in this table have not yet been adjusted for shortfalls in data.
Waiting time statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment at a given point in time and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.

 Significant changes have been made to these procedures within the Department since 1 April 2002. The parliamentary section responsible for overseeing them has been substantially reorganised and a new database has been introduced to help drive and monitor the process. This was immediately made available to all departmental staff; its predecessor having been solely for use by the parliamentary section. It records each stage of the answering procedure, provides a transparent means of checking precisely where a question is in the process and helps to identify and clear blockages in the system.

 The consultants Arup estimated the costs of a London Olympics at &#163;3.6 billion with expected revenues of &#163;2.5 billion. This implied a net public subsidy of &#163;1.1 billion. The Government and the Mayor have agreed a funding package of up to &#163;2.375 billion, allowing a generous contingency, including up to &#163;1.5 billion from the lottery and up to &#163;625 million from a London Olympics Council Tax. As is explained in the Memorandum of Understanding, which was included in the Government response to the Select Committee Report, "A London Olympic Bid for 2012" (HC 268), ref. Cm 5867:

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The flow of funds will depend on the organisations that are nominated to deliver various aspects of the Games. These details have not yet been fully worked up. Because rises or falls in one sector of Olympic cost may be offset in another sector it is not possible to completely earmark particular strands of funding to discrete objects. Within that, the broad intention is that Lottery funding should be primarily directed to sports investment, Olympic facilities and event staging and that money raised from the Olympic precept should address capital requirements of the Games including transport infrastructure."

 Preliminary estimates provided by Camelot, and assessed by the National Lottery Commission, suggest that any reduction of income to the existing good causes from Olympic lottery games would be small&#151;approximately 4 per cent. for the remainder of the Camelot licence period (until 2009). Each game will be subject to approval by the NLC, and in designing the games, Camelot will seek to minimise the effect on the core lottery games.

 Domestic violence proceedings are a high priority for the Department for Constitutional Affairs and the Legal Services Commission (LSC). The LSC's funding code criteria allow such cases to be funded more widely than most other family and non-family areas. This gives the victim of domestic violence the means to secure various remedies against the other party. The latest available figure for expenditure on domestic violence (civil representation) for the financial year 2002 to 2003 is &#163;53.4 million.
<P>

<a name="30909w06.html_para4">The LSC has Regional Legal Services Committees who are tasked with assessing legal need regionally on an on-going basis. The Yorkshire and Humberside Committee have undertaken a project with the aim of developing good practice in identifying and addressing the legal advice needs of victims of domestic violence in the context of the Community Legal Service (CLS). The Legal Service Regional Committee's Periodic Survey of Justiciable Problems are publishing a research report in the next issue of the Family Law Journal which addresses the issue of legal need in domestic violence cases and examines the strategy needed to encourage victims to seek remedies.

<P>
<a name="30909w08.html_spnew0"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The draft Mental Health Bill will break the automatic link between compulsory treatment and detention, allowing patients to be treated in the setting most appropriate to them. Treatment in the community will provide a positive alternative for the many patients who do not want or need to be detained in hospital and an opportunity to minimise the disruption to their lives.
<P>

<a name="30909w08.html_para0">Jobcentre Plus services are designed to meet the needs of disabled people, including those with mental health problems. The reform will allow more people with complex mental health problems to access Jobcentre Plus services. Officials are considering the implications for the training of front line Jobcentre Plus staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The method by which the Department estimates the costs for equipment projects has changed since 1998 as a result of the adoption of resource accounting and budgeting in 1999. In 1998, the estimated cost based on a STOVL design was around &#163;2 billion, based on 1998&#150;99 constant prices (which excluded inflation). The estimated procurement cost of the future aircraft carriers using the innovative, adaptable design is around &#163;3 billion at resource outturn prices (which includes compound inflation). The CVF Programme is still in the Assessment Phase and we expect to award the Demonstration and Manufacture contract in Spring 2004 as planned.

 From June 2001, when the C17 was first available for tasking, to 31 July 2003, 11,540 hours have been flown. The original planned flying task for the aircraft was 3,000 hours per year for the seven years of the lease. From 1 April 2003, this was increased to 4,000 hours per year.

 The annual running cost of the 16 P2000 class craft in financial year 2002&#150;03 was &#163;5.835 million. These figures include the cost of capital and depreciation. In addition the annual average maintenance cost for the P2000 fleet is &#163;1.873 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 11 July 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1030W what assessment he has made of the reasons for self-harm incidents at Deepcut barracks since 1995; what measures are being taken to prevent further incidents; and if he will make a statement.  [127071]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30909w08.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 There are no discernible trends to the number of self-harm overdose incidents at Deepcut, although in most cases the decision to overdose appears to have been taken on the spur of the moment. Causes identified include homesickness, depression and boredom.
<P>

<a name="30909w08.html_para1">A number of measures are in place in an effort to prevent self-harm incidents. As in all Army training establishments, the permanent staff at Deepcut are trained to be on the alert for signs of depression, altered behaviour and other possible indicators of self-harm; new recruits receive education on substance misuse and are encouraged to focus on themes such as looking out for each other and team cohesion. Details of helplines for a number of welfare organisations, including the Samaritans; the Army Welfare Service; and a Confidential Support Line, provided by the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association Forces Help, are promulgated widely throughout the barracks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many <i>(a)</i> service personnel of officer rank, <i>(b)</i> service personnel of other ranks, <i>(c)</i> industrial civilian personnel and <i>(d)</i> non-industrial civilian personnel were employed by (i) the United Kingdom Defence Standardisation team in each year since its inception and (ii) the Directorate of Standardisation in each year from its inception to its re-organisation in 1999; how many of these were employed in Scotland; what the total manning costs were for each category in each year; what the manning costs were for Scotland in each year; and if he will make a statement.  [128037]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30909w08.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Directorate of Standardisation (DStan) was formed in the mid 1960s and since then has gone through a number of reorganisations and change of location. As a consequence many of the historical records no longer exist.
<P>

<a name="30909w08.html_para2">What is known is that in 1978 the complement was 121 Civilian non-industrial staff and 2 Service personnel of officer rank, all working in London. Since then there has not been any industrial or non-officer service personnel within the organisation.
<P>

<a name="30909w08.html_para3">In August 1983 the majority of DStan staff (83) were dispersed to Glasgow (Montrose House) with 8 posts remaining in London. In late 1986 DStan moved to the newly opened Kentigern House in Glasgow and a further three posts were transferred to Glasgow. In the years from 1996 to 2003, the total number of Dstan staff has varied between 35 and 40, between 30 and 33 of whom have worked in Scotland. More detailed, though not exhaustive, records are available from 1989 and are summarised in the following table.

<a name="30909w09.html_para0">The Ministry of Defence is currently engaging with industry to determine the most appropriate and cost effective locations for the Defence Training Establishments within the rationalisation programme. The earliest that any decisions on the locations of training units will be made is December 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what <i>(a)</i> scientific and <i>(b)</i> medical evidence was used as the basis of the statements in paragraph 4.10 of his Department's report on first reflections on operations in Iraq, that there is no reliable scientific or medical evidence to suggest depleted uranium has previously been responsible for post-conflict incidences of ill-health.  [126923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30909w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Royal Society's independent expert Depleted Uranium Working Group recently completed an extensive review of the scientific work on potential health and environmental effects of depleted uranium (DU) munitions. The findings of the review are detailed in two reports entitled "The Health Hazards of Depleted Uranium Munitions" (2001, 2002). They support the Ministry of Defence's view that risks posed by DU to the health of soldiers on the battlefield are minimal except for a small number of extreme cases. The United States Government has carefully monitored the health of those US soldiers who were exposed in extreme circumstances when DU rounds accidentally hit their vehicles during the 1990&#150;91 Gulf Conflict. Some seventeen of them have had DU shrapnel embedded in their bodies for the last twelve years. None of the groups shows signs of health problems attributable to DU. The offspring of the highly-exposed US veterans, amounting to some sixty children, are all healthy.
<P>

<a name="30909w09.html_para2">Some 53,000 British troops took part in the 1990&#150;91 Gulf Conflict, and some 3,300 subsequently felt the need to attend the Gulf Veterans Medical Assessment Programme. The results of the first 3,000 patients to attend have been published: 75 per cent. were found to be well, no novel or unusual conditions were found and 



<P>
<P><I>9 Sept 2003 : Column 348W</I><P>
the most common condition was found to be post-traumatic stress disorder. No evidence of ill-health due to DU exposure was found.
<P>

<a name="30909w09.html_para3">The findings of United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) studies in Kosovo (2001), Serbia and Montenegro (2002) and Bosnia and Herzegovina (2003) note very low levels of DU contamination which do not present immediate radioactive or toxic risks for human health. UNEP's findings are consistent with MOD's view that any DU contamination will be limited and localised and that actions to reduce any potential intakes will only be necessary in some extreme cases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 In 1999 it was estimated that the capital works required at Chichester to provide joint police service training, excluding provision for the Ministry of Defence Police, would be &#163;3.5 million. Subsequent study has shown that the site does not offer the opportunity for redevelopment and modernisation to accommodate the full requirement for joint police training, including the MOD Police.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30909w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The initial estimate of the total savings from moving the Royal Military Police from Chichester to the lowest cost site is &#163;695,000 per annum. In addition, a receipt from the disposal of the Chichester site will be realised. Over a 25 year period moving from the current service police, MOD Police and Guard Service training locations at Chichester, HMS Excellent, Wethersfield and Worthy Down to the benchmark site at RAF Halton is calculated to generate savings of at least &#163;430 million.

<UL>(2) what joint service military police training is taking place; at what cost; and what proportion <i>(a)</i> by number of trainees and <i>(b)</i> by cost of all military police training, (i) excluding and (ii) including Ministry of Defence police, it represents.  [127241]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30909w09.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There are no plans to initiate joint Service military police training other than through the Defence Training Review rationalisation programme. However, the training at the Royal Military Police Training School (RMPTS) is open to all three Services and some common training has also been carried out with the MOD Police. In practice, personnel from the Royal Marines, Royal Navy and RAF have attended the following courses: Royal Military Police (RMP) Junior Non Commissioned Officers (JNCO), RMP Investigations, and RMP Scenes of Crime. Information for 2001&#150;2002, which is the most recent year for which data are readily available, shows that students from the Royal Air Force, Royal Navy and Royal Marines make up 2.5 per cent. of the total student throughput and represented 2.4 per cent. of the total cost of RMPTS courses.

 Under the terms of the Long Term Partnering Agreement, QinetiQ is contracted by the Ministry of Defence to maintain the West Freugh airfield infrastructure on a care and maintenance basis.
<P>

<a name="30909w11.html_para0">This level of maintenance meets MOD's requirements for the airfield and is consistent with its current status of disused and unlicensed.

 Representatives from the prospective lenders to the project, including the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), met Government representatives from Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey during a trip to the pipeline transit countries in July 2003. Discussions centred mainly on the Host Government Agreements (HGAs) entered into separately between the three countries and the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan Pipeline Company. ECGD is now awaiting information from the relevant Governments about the drafting of the HGAs.
<P>

<a name="30909w11.html_para1">An ECGD business principles expert also took part in a trip to the region in June 2003, where he met the Georgian Minister of Environment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations the Government will be making at Cancun on the effect of subsidies on cotton produced in developed countries on the economies of less developed countries; and if she will make a statement.  [125082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30909w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The UK Government are committed to the Doha mandate aimed at achieving substantial reductions on trade distorting domestic support and reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies. We will push for progress on both these areas at Cancun. That way we will achieve benefits for all Developing Countries in all sectors.

<a name="30909w11.html_para4">The UK Government also recognise the important role of commodities like cotton for development and poverty reduction in many developing countries. For this reason we welcome the fact that four West African countries&#151;Benin, Chad, Mali and Burkina Faso&#151;have come together to identify their common interests on cotton and argue their case in the WTO. The UK Government have provided Euro50,000 to the non-governmental organisation IDEAS who will offer technical assistance to these countries to strengthen their WTO case. It will, however, be important to ensure that the focus of negotiations at Cancun remains on achieving substantial reductions in agricultural support across all products to maximise gains for developing countries as a whole.

sites on the basis of sea depth and proximity to the electricity grid network. A particularly sensitivity coastal strip was excluded following strategic environmental assessment of the three areas. Developers interested in developing offshore windfarms in areas outside of the round two areas should inform DTI of their plans, as indicated in the DTI's consultation paper "Future Offshore&#151;A Strategic Framework for the Offshore Wind Industry". This information will feed in, along with the results of DTI's current review of the UK offshore marine renewable resource, to the planning of the future strategic environmental assessment programme that will determine the programme of future site leasing rounds.

 In 2001 Garrad Hassan and Partners Ltd. completed a study for the Scottish Executive entitled "Scotland's Renewable Resource 2001". This included tidal stream and wave in addition to offshore wind. It can be viewed on the web at http://www. Scotland.gov.uk/enterprise/energy (click on More Information on Renewables). DTI is commissioning a survey of marine energy resources across all UK waters, which should be completed early in 2004. The results of this survey will be used to inform the programme of future strategic environmental assessments. Strategic environmental assessment of an area is necessary before that area can be offered to developers to tender for site leases for offshore renewable development.

 From 1998 to 2001, the UK and our EU partners conducted a thorough review of the EU procedure for assessment and approval of genetically modified organisms, including GM crops.

<a name="30909w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No GM crops that show reduced acrylamide formation have been trialled in the UK, and there are no current applications to market such crops in the EU. Acrylamide is formed during the cooking of some foods, and is believed to be produced as a result of a chemical reaction between the sugars and amino acids that naturally occur in foodstuffs. Recent research has indicated that acrylamide may be harmful to consumers. It might be feasible to reduce the formation of acrylamide during cooking by altering the composition of crops. This could be achieved either using conventional plant breeding or genetic modification.

 It is not possible to give precise estimates of the impact of growing GM herbicide-tolerant (GMHT) crops in the UK on fuel consumption, soil erosion or herbicide usage. These issues are analysed in the report published by the Government's Strategy Unit in July on the costs and benefits of GM crops www.strategy.gov.uk. This notes the potential for GMHT crops to deliver various benefits through improved crop management practices, but does not offer firm conclusions because of the complexity of the issues and the limitations of the available evidence.

 I am not aware of any such discussions. However, the European Commission has presented a proposal to the Council for a Euratom Directive on the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. The draft Directive would require each member state to establish a clearly defined programme for radioactive waste management that includes all radioactive waste under its jurisdiction and covers all stages of management. The Commission's draft favours disposal in a deep repository, without the intention of retrieval, as the most suitable method for long-term management of the most hazardous forms of solid and solidified radioactive waste.

They do so in close discussion but within the confines of their own individual remits. Both Departments have worked particularly closely over the last three years in the preparation of Holocaust Memorial Day, which in addition to commemorating the victims of the Holocaust also seeks to address and confront the dangers of prejudice and discrimination today. The Department for Education and Skills produces free resources for schools for Holocaust Memorial Day, which amongst other issues addresses anti-semitism. The resources are promoted with the support and co-operation of both Departments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the average cost charged to companies was by each local authority in England for the occupation of highways during street works, in each year since the introduction of the Street Works (Charges for Occupation of the Highway) (England) Regulations.  [128602]<P>

<P>
<a name="30909w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 To date, charges under the Street Works (Charges for Occupation of the Highway) (England) Regulations have only been applied on roads within Middlesbrough and the London borough of Camden. Comprehensive figures for charges levied are not available at this stage. However, we have appointed consultants&#151;Halcrow&#151;to monitor the operation of the charging scheme, and they will be reporting to us shortly with an assessment of the scheme's first 12 months. Copies of their report will be placed in the Library of the House later in the year.
