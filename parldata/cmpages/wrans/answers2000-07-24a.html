<a name="00724w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2000]:</i> 1 Battalion Welsh Guards has Reme support for its Saxon vehicle holdings. As at 18 July, 23 vehicles were operational and 12 waiting to be repaired. The Regiment is issued with the Clansman combat net radio and although three mobile telephones are held for duty personnel, there is no intention to supplement Clansman holdings with mobile telephones.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the average length of time for the processing of complaints to the Army Board and Her Majesty the Queen.  [130745]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The average time taken from first submission of complaint by the individual to his or her Commanding Officer to promulgation of the Army Board determination of those cases in the system over the last 12 months (from 1 June 1999 to 31 May 2000) is 82 weeks. 72 per cent. of all cases are decided below Army Board level and consequently take far less time to resolve. After the individual has received the Army Board determination and decides to petition the Sovereign, further legal advice is sought and a report prepared for the Army Board and subsequently the Secretary of State for Defence. The Secretary of State is responsible for putting the petition to Her Majesty. The length of time taken for the process varies very significantly from case to case reflecting the relative difficulty and complexity and the need for the Army Board and the Secretary of State to deal personally and carefully with each case. In the six cases submitted to Her Majesty in the 12 months from 1 June 1999 to 31 May 2000 the time taken from the original determination by the Army Board to submission varied from 30 months to eight months.
<P>

<a name="00724w01.html_para1">We recognise the problem delay causes in the processing of Redresses of Complaint. The Chain of Command has been provided with clear guidance explaining that every effort must be made to resolve complaints as swiftly as possible and at the lowest possible level, in the interests of good management, efficiency and justice. The Army General Administrative Instructions dealing with Redresses of Complaint have also been amended to ensure that the message is clearly understood by all involved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Olner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the future basing plans for the Army.  [131152]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I am now able to give details of our plans for the future basing of units following the Strategic Defence Review restructuring. Since my predecessor published outline basing proposals last year, we have discussed the implications of these changes with the local authorities concerned. We have also, as part of our commitment under SDR to put the environment at the heart of decision making, subjected our proposals to a rigorous examination as part of the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) of the whole of the SDR. The SEA has confirmed that the Army's plans for barrack redevelopment, which flow from the relocation and re-roling of units, are unlikely to have major effects on the environment. Where a potential impact has been identified we have either already changed our plans accordingly or plan to take the necessary action to address the problem as part of our detailed development proposals.
<P>

<a name="00724w01.html_para2">The changes from the outline proposals announced last year are not in themselves substantial. However, they do provide the Army with a firm basis on which to plan for changes in the roles of units and their parent formations 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 377W</I><P>
and for a number of relocations of units, all of which are necessary to bring about a more balance operational and training cycle.
<P>

<a name="00724w01.html_para3">The Headquarters of 12 Mechanised Brigade has formed in Aldershot and that of 16 Air Assault Brigade in Colchester. Aldershot Garrison will house enhancements to 101 Logistic Brigade, including 10 Transport Regiment RLC which will move from Colchester, and the lighter elements of 12 Mechanised Brigade. We intend to keep the overall position in the Garrison under review as Project Connaught, the PPP Project, develops.
<P>

<a name="00724w01.html_para4">Tidworth Garrison will accommodate an additional armoured regiment, armoured infantry battalion and engineer regiment, required for 12 Mechanised Brigade. Sixteen Close Support Medical Squadron will be moved out of Tidworth to be incorporated into three Close Support Medical Regiment, in Catterick. We are still considering the most appropriate location for the additional artillery regiment, which we originally planned to accommodate in Larkhill. Project Allenby, the PPP Project, is currently scoping the potential for this regiment to be based in Tidworth or Bulford Garrison instead, as part of its overall strategic look at the operational requirement.
<P>

<a name="00724w01.html_para5">Catterick Garrison will accommodate a number of additional units and enhancements as follows: an additional field workshop will form part of five Battalion REME. Eight Transport Regiment RLC will be enhanced and its fuel handling capabilities rationalised. Three Close Support Medical Regiment, which provides medical support to three (UK) Division, will also be based in Catterick. It will incorporate 24 Close Support Medical Squadron, which is already based in Catterick, 16 Close Support Medical Squadron, which will move from Tidworth, a new close support medical squadron and an evacuation squadron.
<P>

<a name="00724w01.html_para6">Thirty-eight Engineer Regiment in Claro Barracks, Ripon will be enhanced by the addition of a Close Support Squadron. However the nine very heavy tracked bridge laying vehicles with which the Squadron will be equipped could cause a high environmental risk to the cultural heritage in Ripon town centre, and undesirable traffic congestion. We have therefore decided to locate these vehicles at Cambrai/Megiddo Barracks, Catterick.
<P>

<a name="00724w01.html_para7">Colchester Garrison will be the main garrison for 16 Air Assault Brigade, although the aviation regiments and one of its infantry battalions will be based elsewhere and the engineer regiment will be located at Woodbridge. Two parachute regiments and a parachute artillery regiment will be based in Colchester, replacing the existing airmobile units.
<P>

<a name="00724w01.html_para8">The 4th armoured reconnaissance unit will be based in Stanley Barracks, Bovington. Dalton Barracks, Abingdon will house additional sub-units for both 3 Close Support Regiment RLC and 4 General Support Regiment RLC.
<P>

<a name="00724w01.html_para9">Some moves are already taking place (such as that of two parachute battalions from Aldershot to Colchester with a corresponding move of two infantry battalions from Colchester to form part of the new 12 Mechanised Brigade). Most unit relocations will however have to await the preparation and refurbishment of accommodation, which 



<P>

will be spread over a number of years, and the usual Notice of Proposed Development process. In carrying out this work we shall take every opportunity to provide our military personnel with the sort of modern, efficient, good quality accommodation which they deserve.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 As at 1 April 2000, the latest date figures for which are available, 39,560 armed forces personnel were serving overseas (this does not include Naval personnel afloat). The three Services collate data on location of personnel slightly differently and this has determined the presentation of the breakdown by country, as follows:

 Searches of Mr. Smith's cell were conducted by the prison authorities on 15 and 23 June 2000. Ministry of Defence officials provided advice and assistance in relation to documents stored in the cell. The purpose of the searches was to remove classified information which Mr. Smith was not entitled to keep in his cell and to arrange for its secure storage within the prison. The documents were examined in a separate room, under the prison Governor's powers of search, which do not require the presence of a prisoner's legal representative. Mr. Smith and a member of the Board of Prison Visitors were present at the search on 15 June. Mr. Smith declined to be present at the search on the 23 June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w03.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions from which sources the United Kingdom accepts the import of toxic waste for <i>(a)</i> incineration and <i>(b)</i> landfill.  [129973]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 UK policy on waste imports is set out in the legally binding United Kingdom Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste, which came into effect in June 1996.
<P>

<a name="00724w03.html_para5">The policies in the UK Plan prohibit most waste imports for disposal, and are designed to encourage countries to become as self-sufficient as possible in waste disposal. However, where countries cannot reasonably be expected to deal with specific wastes in an environmentally sound manner, the UK is prepared to accept them given that we have the necessary treatment facilities which meet tough environmental standards.
<P>

<a name="00724w03.html_para6">Consistent with this approach the UK currently accepts imports for disposal by high temperature incineration from Brazil, Guernsey, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Portugal, South Africa and Thailand. We also have extant agreements to accept waste from Argentina, Chile, Egypt and Pakistan, although there have been no shipments to date from these countries.
<P>

<a name="00724w03.html_para7">We have only accepted waste for landfilling from the British Antarctic Territory, the Falkland Islands and the Isle of Man.
<P>

<a name="00724w03.html_para8">Earlier this year the UK made a bilateral arrangement to accept wastes from the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia on Cyprus for disposal by either option, although there have been no shipments under the arrangement to date.
<P>

<a name="00724w03.html_para9">The position is different for imports for recovery, which under European law includes incineration where the primary purpose is energy recovery. The UK Plan, consistent with the EC Waste Shipments Regulation and OECD Decision C(92)39/Final, permits movements of wastes for recovery between OECD members on the basis that this trade provides a valuable source of raw materials; and that no country is self-sufficient in waste recovery.
<P>

<a name="00724w03.html_para10">However, while any OECD member country may export hazardous wastes to the UK for incineration with energy recovery, to date we have only received hazardous wastes from Guernsey, Ireland, the Isle of Man, Jersey and the Netherlands.
<P>

<a name="00724w03.html_para11">UK policies and procedures on the acceptance of waste imports are being considered as part of the current review of the UK Plan. I have made it clear that the UK would 



<P>

expect developing countries to develop, as quickly as is feasible, appropriate facilities to deal with their own waste, as far as is compatible with environmentally sound and efficient management.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 We published our consultation paper on control of noise from civil aircraft on 20 July. This proposes legislation to strengthen aerodromes' powers to establish and enforce noise amelioration schemes, and to enable the Secretary of State to designate an aerodrome requiring it to agree such a scheme with an appropriate local authority; together with related matters. The consultation paper will shortly be available on the Department's website. We have invited responses by 13 October. We shall study these carefully before making a decision.




<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 386W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00724w04.html_para2">To be most effective, engine noise reduction technologies need to be applied at the design stage. The airframe and propellers are also significant sources of noise, and thus the success of retro-fitted silencers depends on the type of aircraft and operating conditions. They may also have an impact on aircraft performance; they would not be appropriate in any case where safety would or could be compromised as a result. The CAA can advise on their appropriateness in specific cases.

Through the Construction Research and Innovation Programme, the Department supports the development of a range of tools and guidance, such as BRE's Environmental Estimating Design software (ENVEST) and Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM). These are aimed at helping clients and designers to identify more sustainable approaches to the supply and use of all construction materials.

Similar provisions apply in Northern Ireland. In addition, the Government have recently proposed an amendment to the Countryside and Rights of Way Bill to increase the protection given to cetaceans. The amendment will make it an offence to intentionally or recklessly disturb a cetacean.
<P>

<a name="00724w04.html_para8">Within the European Union, harbour porpoises are protected under the Council Directive (92/43/EEC) on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora, known as the Habitats Directive. This requires member states to designate appropriate sites of community importance for harbour porpoises as Special Areas of Conservation and prohibit the deliberate killing and disturbance of this species. This Directive is transposed into UK law by the Conservation (Natural Habitats &c.) Regulations 1994.
<P>

<a name="00724w04.html_para9">The Government are currently considering the implications of last autumn's judgment by the High Court that the Habitats Directive extends beyond the limits of the territorial seas. They expect to consult before the end of this year on regulations to transpose the Directive to cover the marine environment within the United Kingdom's jurisdiction outside the territorial seas.

<P>
<a name="00724w05.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the measures needed to protect ocean habitats.  [131997]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 At its annual meeting in Copenhagen on 26 to 30 June, the OSPAR Commission adopted and launched the Quality Status Report on the whole of the North-East Atlantic, the "QSR 2000", along with reports covering the five regions of the OSPAR maritime area. The UK participated, in particular, in the preparation of the reports on the Greater North Sea (Region II) and the Celtic Seas (Region III). Together, these reports comprise the first detailed assessment of the health of the North-East Atlantic.
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para1">The assessment concludes that worsening trends in the pollution of the North-East Atlantic have been reversed, and that many significant sources of pollution have been stopped. Nevertheless, the North-East Atlantic is still under threat. The main fields where action is needed are the sustainable management of fish stocks, the continuing impact of some fisheries on fragile ecosystems, and the elimination of inputs of hazardous substances. Organotin compounds from antifouling treatments of ships and concerns about endocrine disrupters are particularly highlighted as problems.
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para2">Other important issues identified by the OSPAR Commission are climate changes resulting from human activities and the consequent effects on the marine environment, the need to protect marine biodiversity and ecosystems from human activities, and the impacts of oil spills and discharges of ballast water from shipping.
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para3">The Government consider, in line with the conclusions of the Quality Status Report, that the long-term OSPAR strategies, adopted by the Ministerial Meeting in 1998 at Sintra (in which my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister played a leading role) and subsequently, provide a sound framework for future action on hazardous substances, radioactive substances, eutrophication, the protection of marine biodiversity and habitats and the offshore oil and gas industry. The Government will also pursue action in other relevant international forums, including the Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol, the International Maritime Organisation (particularly on tributyl tin) and the European Community (particularly on the further development of the Common Fisheries Policy).
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para4">The assessment also shows that, in spite of major scientific efforts of OSPAR Commission parties over the last 25 years, there are still major gaps in our understanding of the marine environment, and that improvement of our knowledge base remains a priority. 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 390W</I><P>
The Government will be working, with our OSPAR partners, to develop effective programmes to remedy such gaps.
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para5">The Government are also considering the implications of last autumn's judgment by the High Court that the EU Habitats Directive extends beyond the limits of the territorial seas. They expect to consult before the end of this year on regulations to transpose the Directive to cover the marine environment within UK jurisdiction outside the territorial seas and have begun the process of identifying possible candidate Special Areas of Conservation in that area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w05.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the net present cost of the Luton Airport Parkway project under the private finance initiative; what the value is of the public sector comparators in <i>(a)</i> pre-risk and <i>(b)</i> risk-adjusted terms; what risks are identified as having been transferred; and if he will make a statement.  [131937]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w05.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Luton Airport Parkway Station project was carried out by Railtrack, who took all the design, construction and operational risks. The final cost of the scheme was &#163;23 million and a fixed &#163;2.8 million contribution to the scheme was made through our local transport allocations for the Luton/Dunstable area.
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para6">The Station was opened by Her Majesty the Queen in November last year and has been very successful. 23 per cent. of passengers at the rapidly expanding airport are now using public transport, with 16 per cent. using the new station. Railtrack worked very hard to complete the complicated scheme which they took over from the previous promoters. In addition to an intensive service operated by Thameslink, Midland Mainline services started calling at the station in May.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w05.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the component parts will be of the Government's new definition of fuel poverty, including specific exclusions; and if he will make a statement.  [130935]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The information is as follows.
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para9">1. The Inter-Ministerial Group on Fuel Poverty, chaired jointly by my right hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe and my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, has reviewed the commonly applied definition of fuel poverty, namely a household that needs to spend more than 10 per cent. of income to achieve a satisfactory heating regime. The Group has taken account of responses to last year's consultation on the new Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES), which sought comments on the definition, and in particular:
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para10"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>whether the use of fuel for non-heating purposes should be included in assessing the amount of fuel needed to achieve a satisfactory heating regime;and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00724w05.html_para11"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>whether the calculation of household income should exclude any element of housing costs such as rent or mortgage payments.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00724w05.html_para12">Some 60 per cent. of the 252 respondents commented on one or both of the questions.
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para13">2. The Group has concluded as a consequence that the 10 per cent. threshold is appropriate for defining fuel poverty. On non-heating fuel, the Group noted that 54 per cent. of respondents to the new HEES consultation had commented that all fuel costs should be taken into account; 6 per cent. had other suggestions; and the other 40 per cent. did not comment. The Group believes that the definition should be based on all fuel use.
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para14">3. As regards the treatment of housing costs, the Group noted that 34 per cent. of respondents suggested that they should not be excluded from the calculation of household income; 20 per cent. that some allowance should be made; 6 per cent. offered other suggestions; and 40 per cent. did not comment. The Government's Poverty Strategy has shown income data both with no allowance for housing costs, and excluding costs met by Housing Benefit or Income Support for Mortgage Interest (ISMI). The Group has taken account of responses to the consultation exercise and the difficulty of producing definitive figures, and has concluded that the draft Fuel Poverty Strategy which will be issued in the autumn will focus mainly on the first basis, but will identify the number of fuel poor on both bases. But the Government will consult further and will invite comments on this, when they publish their draft Strategy.
<P>

<a name="00724w05.html_para15">4. Some commentators have argued that all mortgage, rent and other housing costs should be excluded in calculating household income. On this basis, however, more than one in three households in England would have been classed as fuel poor in 1996, based on the English House Condition Survey. Although fuel poverty is unacceptably widespread, this definition would include many households who would not be regarded--or regard themselves--as being in material fuel poverty.

 A range of quarry trade organisations has been invited by the Treasury, HM Customs and Excise and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions to participate in the process of researching the environmental impacts of aggregate quarrying, developing the mechanisms of the proposed levy (including two consultations on draft clauses), discussing the content of a voluntary alternative package of measures, and clarifying the implications of the Chancellor's announcement in Budget 2000. Trade organisations recorded as having been involved in one or more of these processes include the British Aggregates Association, the British Cement Association, the Confederation of British Industry, the Quarry Products Association and the Silica and Moulding Sands Association. Views have also been received from representatives of the coal and ceramic clay producers.

 The Neighbourhood Renewal Fund will make a key contribution to the delivery of the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal--including new targets for education, crime, employment, health and housing in deprived areas--and help to get money to where it is most needed. Authorities will work with new Local Strategic Partnerships to draw up local deprivation strategies which will spell out how the additional funding will help to renew the most deprived communities and promote closer co-operation with the police, health and other local services.

 The Social Exclusion Unit's Policy Action Team on "Learning Lessons" (Policy Action Team 16) recommended setting up a National Centre for Neighbourhood Renewal, to play a leadership role in promoting effective, inclusive approaches to neighbourhood renewal. The Government have accepted this recommendation.
<P>

<a name="00724w06.html_para3">The Policy Action Team envisaged that the Centre would promote: quality training and development for neighbourhood renewal among policy makers, professional and practitioner groups and community organisations; better access to "lessons learned" from previous experience; better collaboration between those involved in neighbourhood renewal; better research on the issues; and better leadership.

 This Government are committed to maximising the re-use of previously-developed land within urban areas, bringing empty homes back into use and converting existing buildings, in preference to the development of greenfield sites. The target for England is that, by 2008, 60 per cent. of additional housing should be provided on previously-developed land and through conversions of existing buildings.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what his plans are for housing investment in future years; and if he will make a statement.  [132683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that the Government's spending plans for 2001-02 to 2003-04, announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 18 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 219-29, provide extra investment of &#163;1.6 billion a year for housing by 2003-04 compared to 2000-01. These extra resources confirm our commitment in the Housing Green Paper to ensure that everyone has the opportunity of a decent home. Our full spending plans are set out in the tables.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para2">The settlement includes, over the three years:
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an additional &#163;400 million for council housing placed in arm's-length management companies;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00724w07.html_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>support for the transfer of up to 200,000 homes each year from local authorities to housing associations;
<P>

</FONT></UL>
<a name="00724w07.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an additional &#163;120 million for a new Safer Communities Supported Housing Fund.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00724w07.html_para8">Total additional spending over the three years will be just over &#163;1.8 billion. In addition, we will be boosting the Housing Private Finance Initiative, providing for an extra &#163;600 million investment in council housing over the two years 2002-03 to 2003-04. This will bring total additional investment in housing over the three years to nearly &#163;2.5 billion.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para9">By 2003-04, annual capital investment in housing, excluding the Private Finance Initiative, will have risen to more than &#163;4 billion. This compares with the planned capital investment we inherited in 1997 of just &#163;1.5 billion for 1997-98, with further cuts proposed by the last Government for 1998-99 and 1999-2000. We acted swiftly to tackle past and planned under-investment. Our Capital Receipts Initiative provided nearly &#163;800 million extra in 1997-98 and 1998-99. Through our 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review, we provided an additional &#163;3.9 billion for the years 1999-2000 to 2001-02 so that, in 2001-02, capital investment in housing will be double the amount we inherited.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para10">In the 2000 spending review, we have looked closely at our priorities for housing in the context of our Housing Green Paper and the many initial comments we received in response to it. We concluded that, despite the higher levels of investment planned in 2001-02, additional resources would be needed to fulfil the commitments in the Green Paper. The extra resources we are making available over the next three years are on top of the planned funding level for 2001-02 agreed during the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para11">Our new spending plans will help to ensure that we meet our Green Paper commitment to bring all social housing up to a decent standard within a decade, with a third of homes that currently fail to reach those standards improved by 31 March 2004.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para12">We are providing an extra &#163;400 million for investment in local authority-owned housing. In line with the Green Paper proposals, we are putting that, together with 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 399W</I><P>
&#163;60 million of existing resources, into a special pot of &#163;460 million, available to authorities which have set up arm's-length management companies and demonstrated excellence in their performance under the new Best Value regime. In this way, we are rewarding good performance as well as encouraging authorities to separate their landlord from their strategic function. We expect that the money available will result in improvements to approaching 100,000 homes by 2003-04.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para13">Within the Housing Revenue Account for local authority housing we are providing a Major Repairs Allowance as part of a new, more business-like financial regime. The Major Repairs Allowance will be &#163;1.6 billion in 2001-02. In future years, the amount per dwelling will be up-rated in line with inflation. We expect the total amount to be &#163;1.5 billion in 2003-04 and &#163;1.4 billion in 2003-04, reflecting the reduction in the number of local authority dwellings as a result of stock transfers and Right to Buy. These amounts will be drawn from the total provision for capital expenditure by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para14">We also propose that management allowances will rise by 2 per cent. in real terms in each of the years 2002-03 and 2003-04. Maintenance allowances will be up-rated in line with inflation over the same period.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para15">Taken together, we believe these measures will provide authorities with the resources and the freedom to manage their housing assets more effectively.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para16">As the Green Paper stresses, the transfer of council housing to housing associations will play an important part in bringing social housing up to decent standards, in separating authorities' strategic and landlord functions for housing, and in creating a more diverse range of social landlords. We have made provision in our spending plans to support the transfer of up to 200,000 homes each year from 2001-02, where proposals have the backing of tenants. We are conducting a review of the stock transfer process. We will be setting up a new Community Housing Task Force to assist local authorities and tenants to carry forward transfer as part of a reformed process. The task force will help to ensure that new social landlords created by the transfer process empower tenants and regenerate communities.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para17">The Private Finance Initiative is another important option for improving local authority housing. Currently, there are eight authorities testing this approach through pathfinder schemes. Our new spending plans provide &#163;160 million in 2001-02 to fund the existing pathfinders, with an extra &#163;600 million over the following two years to fund new schemes.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para18">The provision of affordable housing is a vital part of our strategy for ensuring that everyone has the opportunity of a decent home. We believe that local authorities are best placed to assess the need for affordable hosing in their areas and to reflect those assessments in their housing strategies, their investment plans and in the implementation of planning powers for affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para19">We have already acted to put that policy in place.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para20">We did so through the 1998 Comprehensive Spending Review, increasing the resources available to local authorities for housing investment, including investment in new affordable housing. We also increased the scope 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 400W</I><P>
available to them to reflect local priorities in their investment plans, through the creation of a single pot for housing capital expenditure. We were able to halt planned cuts to the Housing Corporation's investment in new affordable housing. We have also encouraged the Corporation to strengthen the links between its investment decisions and the priorities of local authorities at regional and local levels.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para21">Our recently revised planning guidance for housing (PPG3) reinforces the powers available to authorities to seek the provision of affordable housing as a proportion of new private developments, complementing public investment. We will be issuing best practice guidance to help authorities to make more effective use of these powers in future years.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para22">These policies are helping to deliver more affordable housing and to ensure that homes are provided where they are needed most. However, we do not believe that this is sufficient. Local authorities and housing associations in urban and rural areas of high demand have impressed upon us the difficulties they face in improving existing poor condition housing for their tenants, while at the same time providing decent homes for families in need of affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para23">We have taken account of these representations in the spending review and will increase funding through the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme. Ahead of the spending review period, we are providing an additional &#163;50 million this year. This will be followed by an extra &#163;872 million between 2001-02 and 2003-04. Our new spending plans will result in investment through the Approved Development Programme nearly doubling from planned expenditure of &#163;691 million in 2001-02 to &#163;1,236 million by 2003-04. This will allow increased provision of affordable housing in both urban and rural areas. We expect to see increasing use of modern construction techniques and greater efficiency in line with the Construction Task Force report.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para24">Most people aspire to home ownership, and nearly 70 per cent. of households in England own their own homes already. However, despite relatively low interest rates and a stable economy, high house prices in some areas can act as a barrier to home ownership for people on lower incomes. Our Housing Green Paper recognised the need to expand our existing programme of support for low cost home ownership, particularly to help key workers who need to live close to the communities they support. Through our Green Paper, we are consulting on proposals for a new Starter Home Initiative to help key workers to achieve home ownership in high price, high demand areas. Our spending plans provide an additional &#163;250 million between 2001-02 and 2003-04 to support low cost home ownership. We will announce details of the Starter Home Initiative in the light of responses to the Green Paper.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para25">Increased funding for the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme and the new Starter Home Initiative will significantly increase the provision of affordable housing. Local authorities will continue to be able to complement Housing Corporation and Starter 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 401W</I><P>
Home Initiative investment from their own capital allocations, in line with their own local housing strategies. Their funding decisions will influence the total level of affordable housing provision across England.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para26">The spending review has also underlined the importance of supported housing. Our new Supporting People programme will come into effect in 2003-04, providing an integrated policy and funding framework for support services for vulnerable households. We will be providing revenue funding of &#163;153 million between 2001-02 and 2003-04 to ensure the effective implementation of Supporting People.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para27">In the run-up to implementation, we have also decided, in line with the Government's commitment to reducing crime and protecting the vulnerable, to provide &#163;120 million additional capital funding for a new Safer Communities Supported Housing Fund, together with associated capital funding for a new Safer Communities Supported Housing Fund, together with associated revenue support of &#163;17 million. This will provide new housing and support for young people at risk and other vulnerable people, such as those fleeing domestic violence. It will also provide housing and support for ex-offenders and people with drug or alcohol problems. The fund will be administered by the Housing Corporation, and will be conditional on local authorities providing matching capital funding for housing provided in their areas. Projects must also have the full support of the local crime and disorder partnership. More details of this scheme will be announced in the autumn.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para28">Disabled Facilities Grants fund adaptations to enable disabled people to live with dignity in their own homes. We are providing an extra &#163;39 million over the three years for these grants, increasing funding to &#163;88.8 million by 2003-04.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para29">Home Improvement Agencies play an important role in helping elderly and vulnerable home owners to maintain and improve their homes. We are providing an extra &#163;6 million in grants to local authorities for Home Improvement Agencies over the next three years.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para30">Our new spending plans include a total of over &#163;200 million over the three years to prevent rough sleeping throughout England and to help former rough sleepers rebuild their lives through education, training and employment. These resources will ensure that, having achieved the Government's target of reducing the level of rough sleeping by at least two-thirds, those reductions can be sustained.




<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 402W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para31">Our spending plans will help to improve the quality of housing and the support we provide for the most vulnerable members of society.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para32">In addition to quality, choice is a key theme of the Housing Green Paper. By improving the quality and supply of housing, we will also improve the choices available to people as home owners or tenants.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para33">We are also keen to encourage local authorities to introduce more customer-focused lettings schemes which given tenants a greater choice over where they live. Over the next three years, we will be providing &#163;11 million to support pilot schemes involving local authorities and registered social landlords which test choice-based lettings policies.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para34">We are about to conduct extensive research into the availability and quality of local authority gypsy sites. The results will be considered as part of the next spending review. In the meantime, we are making available &#163;17 million over the next three years to help authorities to improve and refurbish a limited number of sites, as part of the Government's policy to discourage unauthorised camping and all the problems associated with it. We will publish details of the scheme in the autumn.
<P>

<a name="00724w07.html_para35">Our aim is to ensure that everyone has the opportunity of a decent home. Our Housing Green Paper sets out our strategy for meeting that aim. Our new spending plans provide the resources necessary to deliver it. This money, together with the additional resources being made available in other programmes, ensures a major contribution to the renaissance of our cities and countryside, which will be highlighted in our Urban and Rural White Papers.

<a name="00724w08.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Amess: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if he will publish the medical research and evidence on which the Committee for the Safety of Medicines based their recommendation that levonorgestrel 0.75 mg could be supplied as a pharmacy medication;  [129410]
<P>
<UL>(2) what trials have been conducted in the United Kingdom to test the safety and long-term health effects of levonorgestrel 0.75 mg.  [129409]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w08.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 A product containing levonorgestrel 0.75 mg has been authorised in the United Kingdom as a prescription only medicine. This followed advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) who were satisfied as to the product's quality, safety and efficacy. The evidence considered included two World Health Organisation sponsored pivotal studies. One study involving approximately 3,000 women in 14 countries, including the UK, has been published in <i>the Lancet</i> (1998). The other, published in Human Reproduction (1993), involved 880 women. Copies are available in the Library. Other supporting data not in the public domain are confidential to the application.
<P>

<a name="00724w08.html_para0">Evidence of safety as stated was taken into account when the CSM considered the proposal for levonorgestrel 0.75 mg to be available without prescription. There is also evidence from a study of the effects of self-administering emergency contraception (<i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>, 1998). Levonorgestrel 0.75 mg has been available from pharmacies in France without a doctor's prescription since June 1999. The criteria for prescription control are defined in the legislation. The CSM considered each of these criteria and advised that they did not apply to levonorgestrel 0.75 mg for emergency contraception in women of 16 and over. They considered that all the steps required to supply emergency contraception safely could be successfully completed in a pharmacy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what priority is being given in the Health Service to emphasising <i>(a)</i> the health dangers of bacterium E.coli and <i>(b)</i> ensuring that the disease can be speedily identified.  [131420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w08.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 The bacterium currently of most concern is vero cytotoxin producing E.coli, of which E.coli 0157 is the commonest. In may this year the Chief Medical Officer's Update, which is distributed to all medical practitioners, carried an article "VTEC Guidance" which drew attention to the seasonal increase in infection, the risks from farm visits and the susceptibility of children to developing Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome following infection with E.coli 0157. A further CMO Update in August will alert medical practitioners to the potential increased release of toxin that can be caused by certain classes of antibiotic in patients with E.coli 0157. The CMO also issued a press release "Health advice issued for farm visits by children" in April alerting the public to the risks of infection associated with farm visits and advising on sensible precautions to be taken to avoid infection. This advice was sent to all directors of public health and consultants in communicable disease control. Information has been given to vulnerable groups such as pregnant women on how to avoid infection. The Pregnancy Book, given to all first time mothers, contains advice on safe eating and how to avoid infection and this advice is repeated in the leaflet "While you are pregnant: safe eating and how to avoid infection" given to all mothers. Guidance was issued by the CMO in July 1998 on the safe cooking of burger meat to prevent foodborne infection.
<P>

<a name="00724w08.html_para1">All Public Health Service Laboratories test all stool samples for E.coli 0157 in accordance with agreed Standard Operating Procedures. The PHLS published its "Guidelines for the control of infection with Vero cytotoxin producing Escherichia coli (VTEC)" dealing with sampling and identification procedures. E.coli 0157 infection that is foodborne, which is the majority, is 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 405W</I><P>
notifiable as a 'foodborne disease', and all laboratories voluntarily notify all E.coli infections as part of an agreed reporting protocol.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what response he has made to the submission by Methodist Homes for the Aged to his consultation paper on Nationally Required Standards for Residential and Nursing Homes for Older People.  [130781]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 I am aware that the supportive response from Methodist Homes to the consultation document raised a number of concerns including about the staffing and physical environment standards and the timescale for implementing the standards.
<P>

<a name="00724w08.html_para2">I refer my right hon. Friend to the reply I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Warrington, North (Helen Jones) on 20 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 287-88W. This set out the conclusions we have reached in relation to the physical standards in residential and nursing homes based on the responses to the consultation process on "Fit for the Future?".
<P>

<a name="00724w08.html_para3">Regarding staffing, we do not accept that fixed ratios are the best means of specifying the number and qualifications of staff to be employed in a nursing home. For qualified nurses, numbers should relate to the assessed needs of residents at any one time. We are considering what models of assessment should be recognised by the National Care Standards Commission for this purpose and how nursing needs are defined so that nurse staffing levels can be set accurately and realistically. For ancillary staff, levels should take account of the degree of efficiency and effectiveness demonstrated by providers in managing ancillary tasks.
<P>

<a name="00724w08.html_para4">The standards for nine out of the eleven topic areas that we consulted upon in "Fit for the Future?" received overwhelming support and these will form the basis for the full set of national minimum standards which we will publish later this year.

The vast majority of these staff are employed on a contract basis. These contracts relate to individual plants and to a specific number of hours. The above figures therefore do not equate to full-time equivalent figures which are considerably less.

<a name="00724w08.html_para6">Veterinary Meat Hygiene Advisers have been employed by or on behalf of the Food Standards Agency since its established on 1 April 2000.

In Scotland and Wales, these duties are carried out by staff of the State Veterinary Service (SVS).

<a name="00724w08.html_para7">SVS staff throughout Great Britain may also from time to time visit abattoirs on other official business. The above figures do not include veterinary surgeons employed by the SVS who undertake any of these other duties.

 The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) has conducted approximately 180 investigations into cases of national Websites allegedly offering medicines for sale.

 I have received one proposal from a member of the public suggesting that the Dome is kept within the public sector and used to celebrate events such as the Queen's Golden Jubilee. My officials responded on 19 July stating that the Government believe that a sale to the private sector is the best way to secure the Government's objectives for future use of the Dome. The selection criteria used to shortlist proposals for the future use of the Dome specifically aim to maximise the public benefit.

 <i>[holding answer 21 July 2000]:</i> The Government believe that the Football Task Force's first report provided an effective blueprint for eliminating racism in football. The report's one recommendation for the Government was implemented by means of Section 9 of the Football (Offences and Disorder) Act 1999, which made the chanting of racist material by individual supporters an offence.
<P>

<a name="00724w11.html_para0">The report's other recommendations were intended for the football authorities, and a number of these have already been implemented under the aegis of the Kick it Out campaign. I understand that the sport's governing bodies will shortly announce a review of the implementation of the Task Force's reports on racism, disabled access and community involvement.

 Following extensive discussions with the Football Association, FA Premier League and other interested parties, the Football Foundation became operational last month. The Foundation is a partnership between the sport and Government. The Foundation will receive funding from the Football Association, the FA Premier League, the Lottery Sports Fund and other Government sources.

We are aware that the Belarusian opposition suspect official involvement but we have not seen any evidence to support this. The Belarusian Government have said that they are searching for Zavadsky. Our Embassy in Minsk are monitoring the situation.

 Poverty is a multi-dimensional problem which cannot be defined solely on the basis of a particular level of income. One indicator which may be used, however, is whether the income of households is below 60 per cent. of median. The following table provides this information for the proportion of children living in households below 60 per cent. of median equivalised income in 1998-99 in the age bands requested.

 For 2000-01, &#163;640,000 has been allocated to my Department to develop the New Deal for Disabled People. To date the pilot phase has consisted of 24 Innovative Schemes and a Personal Adviser Service in 12 areas, covering around a quarter of a million people on Incapacity Benefit, and including South Tyneside in the North-East. Since autumn 1998 (when the pilots began) to the end of March 2000, the latest figures available, nearly &#163;3 million had been spent on the Innovative Schemes and over &#163;10 million on the 12 Personal Adviser pilot areas. During the same period 2,755 people had found jobs as a result of the pilots (3,454 to the end of May 2000). Together with colleagues at the Department of Social Security we are currently considering lessons learned from the pilot and hope to make an announcement in the near future about our plans for national extension.

 The information is not available in the precise form requested. We have been piloting the New Deal for Disabled People (NDDP) since autumn 1998. People coming forward to date have a wide range of disabilities: many have more than one disability. The extra help and support provided takes account of the individual needs of each person who volunteers to take part in the NDDP pilots. The latest figures, to the end of May, show that 12,199 disabled people on Incapacity Benefits have joined the programme so far by participating in the 24 innovative schemes or by drawing up an agreed work-focused action plan with a personal adviser in 12 NDDP pilot areas. I am pleased to say that 3,454 people have found jobs as a result.

<P>
<a name="00724w15.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 It is not possible to identify funding which is specifically available for the training of play workers. However, we have allocated &#163;18 million in England to Training and Enterprise Councils between 1998-99 and 2000-01 to support the training needs of the child care workforce, including playworkers. Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships also spend a proportion of their budget on training. Further Education Colleges also spent &#163;93.32 million on child care related training in 1998-99. This is in addition to the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) budget for the UK of &#163;220 million from 1999-2003 to fund a significant expansion in out of school provision. Training is an acceptable element in bids made to NOF for support under the programme.

We are currently assessing which locations will be included in the pilot projects and details will be announced later this year. &#163;252 million of funding from the Capital Modernisation Fund (CMF) is being used to set up around 700 ICT Learning Centres across England. This will be complemented by &#163;77.5 million of New Opportunities Fund money to provide revenue support and develop Community Grids for Learning.

All four-year-olds already have free access to early education. Two thirds of three-year-olds will be able to access a free place by 2002. The priority is to reach those three-year-olds in social need who would most benefit from a free nursery place.

 The UK Government have taken the lead in seeking to mobilise the international development system including development NGOs to focus on the achievement of the 2015 targets. We have always made clear that the 2015 targets are extremely challenging, but very substantial progress has been made and more is possible. Some targets are nearer to achievement than others. It is also possible that some of the targets will be achieved overall but not achieved in some countries. The purpose of the targets is to seek to galvanise a greater effort in each country and by all parties.
<P>

<a name="00724w19.html_para2">At last year's Summit in Cologne, the G8 called for an annual poverty report from the international financial institutions as a means of focusing the international effort toward the targets. The first report has been prepared for this year's Summit in Okinawa. The report draws attention to the concerted and sustained commitment that will be needed if the 2015 targets are to be met. However its conclusion is that achieving the targets is still possible overall, though it will be more difficult in some parts of the world than in others. The report proposes a comprehensive range of measures for dealing with this: these include improving the global environment faced by developing countries; increasing aid flows and improving the effectiveness of aid; accelerating the implementation of the enhanced heavily indebted poor countries initiative; harnessing new

 The role of the Brazilian Environment Agency (IBAMA) is to monitor and control logging rather than actively engage in it. Our assessment is that environmental management capacity in Brazil needs to be developed in order to implement policies that have already been formally adopted. We believe that IBAMA are currently under-resourced and there are many weaknesses in the enforcement of existing forestry legislation owing to lack of incentives and capacity.

<a name="00724w19.html_para5">For a country to receive HIPC debt relief, it requires not only unsustainable levels of debt, but also a commitment to poverty reduction and reform. In the case of Bangladesh, any consideration of debt relief would be likely to require further progress in areas such as public expenditure allocations on essential services for poor people, measures to improve the quality of public services, improving revenue administration, and a serious start on structural measures such as financial sector and public enterprise reform.

 Mozambique's aid debts of &#163;21.8 million to the UK were cancelled in 1983. Under the Government's policy on 100 per cent. debt relief for countries eligible under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, debt service payments on Mozambique's remaining debt of &#163;9.5 million to the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) ceased. The enhanced HIPC Initiative both removes the unpayable portion of Mozambique's debt and halves the debt service that it was previously paying to official creditors.
<P>

<a name="00724w20.html_para0">We do not have figures for Mozambique's debt to the private sector. However, since we estimate its worldwide private sector debt to be less than one per cent. of its total debt, the amount owed to the UK is presumed to be minimal.

<a name="00724w22.html_para2">The Home Office is committed to processing project licence applications as expeditiously as possible, but no targets have been, or indeed can be, set for the time needed to consider any particular application.

A well-drafted application for a replacement licence to continue existing work or for a minor amendment to an existing licence may be assessed quickly. One for a new study could take a considerable time to examine--indeed, some may take months where complex scientific issues are involved. There are usually negotiations between the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate and the applicant to ensure that the 3Rs (the Refinement of scientific procedures; Reduction in numbers of animals used; and their Replacement wherever possible) are rigorously applied in every case. Applicants may also take time preparing supplementary or revised material for consideration. The situation is further complicated when

<a name="00724w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In 1999, the Home Office conducted a study with the aim of collecting information on the types of neighbourhood warden schemes operating in Britain and where possible to examine the effectiveness of such schemes. Fifty existing and recent neighbourhood wardens projects were examined, a good proportion of which were funded at least in part by local authorities. Partnership proved to be a crucial aspect of a large number of the initiatives. It was concluded that further research was needed to establish the impact of neighbourhood wardens schemes on levels of crime and disorder and quality of life in local areas and to identify elements of good practice. The Home Office subsequently commissioned further research which is examining eight neighbourhood warden schemes in detail. The report of this research will be available later this year.
<P>

<a name="00724w22.html_para8">The Home Office study of neighbourhood warden schemes was conducted in support of Policy Action Team (PAT) 6 on Neighbourhood Wardens set up by the Social Exclusion Unit. Following the report of PAT 6, a Neighbourhood Wardens Unit was established jointly funded by the Home Office and the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). An Advisory Committee was set up to advise the Unit on a broad range of issues on neighbourhood wardens. The Advisory Committee meet quarterly and consist of representatives who have a key interest in neighbourhood wardens, including the police and local authorities. More specifically, the advisory committee includes members from:

The Neighbourhood Wardens Fund is being administered by the Neighbourhood Wardens Unit in the DETR. Local authorities and others have been eligible to apply for this funding.

 The rights of prison officers to contact their Member of Parliament are set out in the Prison Service Staff Handbook. This reminds staff that civil servants should not attempt to bring political or other outside influence to support any personal claims as a civil servant. It makes it clear that this does not restrict staff's right to approach their Member of Parliament. A copy of the Prison Staff Handbook is available in the Library. The relevant paragraph is paragraph 19.84.

<P>
<a name="00724w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The statistics for the number of self-inflicted deaths among staff are set out in the table. Statistics on staff suicides are not collected centrally and so these have been collated from a number of sources (some of which may have been compiled on different bases).
<P>

<a name="00724w23.html_para1">These figures include those deaths where the coroner has recorded a verdict of suicide and, in some cases (generally the most recent), other deaths where the inquest is still pending or the verdict has not been notified to the Prison Service, but the circumstances in which the body was found suggest that the death was self-inflicted. The figures may underestimate the number of self-inflicted deaths, in that they record those deaths whose circumstances are known to the Service. If family members choose not to report the circumstances of the death, the death may not be recorded here.
<P>

<a name="00724w23.html_para2">Records of the cause of staff deaths before 1990 are not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. A full breakdown of the figures according to grade and location could likewise be obtained only at disproportionate cost. An analysis carried out in 1998 indicated that, of 34 staff who had committed suicide since 1990, 18 were prison officers, five were senior officers and one was a principal officer. The other staff were drawn from a number of different grades within the Service.




<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 461W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00724w23.html_para3">In 1994, the Prison Service was greatly concerned to note the increased number of staff suicides. The causes of each suicide were examined. In all cases, the principal cause appeared to be the member of staff's private life rather than their work with the Prison Service. A workshop was held that year, to examine issues relating to staff suicide. A number of ideas emerged from that and the Service has continued to keep this issue under very careful review, to see whether there are any additional steps which could usefully be taken.
<P>

<a name="00724w23.html_para4">The Prison Service's Staff Care and Welfare Service offers confidential support and assistance to staff for a range of personal and emotional problems. The Staff Care and Welfare Service co-ordinates the provision of post-incident care and also provides a welfare service which all staff can use at any time. Part of that service is provided via trained Care Teams, drawn from a cross-section of grades, which are based in prisons and provide an on-site support network. While this is primarily geared towards post-incident work, increasingly these teams do offer a greater range of support to staff. In 1999, welfare officers dealt with more than 7,000 cases, most of which related to transfers, physical illness, work-related stress and debt.
<P>

<a name="00724w23.html_para5">Welfare officers, who are based in five geographical areas, provide a comprehensive support and referral service for staff. They deal with a multitude of problems and can call upon specialist services--both internal and external--as necessary to meet the client's needs. Given the operational duties which the majority of Prison Service staff perform, they are often referred to external counselling services so that they may discuss in confidence the personal and emotional problems which may be generated by working with prisoners.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what alternatives <i>(a)</i> exist and <i>(b)</i> he has trialled to (i) the life signs monitoring system and (ii) the AVID hand-held radar detection system; and if he will make a statement.  [131764]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) has evaluated two alternative systems, AVIAN and MICROSEARCH for the detection of life signs in vehicles. PSDB has also conducted trials on the Mandec UK life signs monitoring system for use in calls. Some work has also been conducted on alternative methods of life signs monitoring in cells based on Closed Circuit Television and optical systems, audio systems or microwave radiation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the unit cost of <i>(a)</i> an AVID hand-held radar system and <i>(b)</i> a static X-ray system, for the detection of people and animals in freight trucks; and if he will make a statement.  [131772]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The cost of the AVID system is not known. Static X-ray systems are not designed to detect people and animals. The cost of a static X-ray system for detecting drugs, explosives, weapons and other contraband ranges from &#163;190,000 to &#163;4,118,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 An inconclusive trial of a radar system was held at Dover on 25 August 1999. A trial of a hand-held radar device will begin at Portsmouth on 26 July. A trial of some other equipment will begin as soon as the supplier receives the upgraded hardware from the manufacturer.
<P>

<a name="00724w24.html_para2">The Immigration Service is holding discussions with other companies who are pursuing a range of solutions and further trials are a possibility.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Immigration Service at Status Park has for some years been seeking low cost, portable and effective devices to detect the presence of human beings hidden inside vehicles and freight containers. The search has included small handheld devices. The Immigration Service at Status Park has conducted trials of such equipment within the last few years and will continue to consult with the industry to find a workable solution.

 A trial of the Life Signs monitoring system was conducted during 1999 at Belmarsh Prison in an unoccupied room in the Health Care Centre. Unfortunately the equipment failed and the trial was aborted. The Prison Service are currently considering how best to proceed with this project in order to test out the feasibility of this system.

 My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer will in the context of the Spending Review 2000 shortly publish a comprehensive list of public service agreements for all Government Departments.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will publish a revised table of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's objectives and annual targets as set out on pages 32 and 33 of the IND Annual report 1999 to take account of the conclusions of, and the period covered by, the Comprehensive Spending Review.  [132353]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The table at pages 32 and 33 of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) Annual Report 1999 lists the 21 business objectives and targets agreed for IND following the last Comprehensive Spending Review in 1998. They cover the three year period from April 1999 to March 2002. Following the announcement of the outcome of the 2000 Spending Review on 18 July, IND will work to develop similar objectives and targets for the next three years through to March 2004, supplementing those to be published in the Public Service Agreement and the Service Delivery Agreement.
<P>

<a name="00724w25.html_para0">Eighteen updated objectives and targets for this year are listed in the table. More details will be available in the IND Business Plan for 2000-01 which is to be published shortly. A copy will be placed in the Library. Details of IND's objectives and targets for the next three years will be published in future business plans.
<P>

<a name="00724w25.html_para1">The target for initial asylum decisions for this year has been revised upwards to 130,000-150,000 from the 65,000 in the last IND Business Plan. This will substantially clear the backlog. Funding for the increase is being provided as part of the &#163;609 million extra for IND in the current financial year. That funding will also enable IND to increase the number of detention places. This is an essential element in the strategy to meet our target of removing 12,000 failed asylum seekers this year and at least 30,000 a year in the next three years.
<P>

<a name="00724w25.html_para2">These figures reflect the important changes introduced by the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. All entitlement of new asylum applicants to cash social security benefits ended on 3 April 2000. Public expenditure overall would be significantly higher if such entitlements continued.

<a name="00724w25.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 An Order extending the Attorney-General's powers in relation to unduly lenient sentences is being laid before Parliament today. This will enable the Attorney to refer sentences imposed for offences of illegal trafficking in drugs and pornographic material involving children and offences specifically against children (unlawful sexual intercourse with a girl under 16, inciting a girl under 16 to have incestuous intercourse and indecent conduct towards a young child). The Order comes into effect on 21 August 2000 and will apply to any sentence imposed after that date. The Government will keep under review whether further extensions should be made in future.

 I have today placed in the Library copies of a Consultation Paper on the Regulation of R18 videos. As hon. Members will be aware, I was extremely disappointed with the High Court decision, on 16 may, which dismissed the British Board of Film Classification's application for Judicial Review in respect of appeals against their decision not to classify seven sexually explicit videos in the R (restricted) 18 category--which are available only in licensed sex shops. The Government maintain a firm commitment to the protection of children from unsuitable sexually explicit material and, in the light of the recent judgment, are publishing a consultation paper which examines a number of options to improve the safeguards for children from possible exposure to videos classified in the R (restricted) 18 category. The paper also suggests measures for modernising and strengthening the recruitment and appointment procedures of the Video Appeals Committee.

<a name="00724w26.html_para0">MAFF's aim has been amended to give a clearer and more focused picture of what the Department wants to achieve: good quality food which meets consumers' requirements; modern, sustainable, competitive farming and fisheries businesses; protection of the rural and marine environment and a thriving rural economy.
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para1">I should like to explain how the Spending Review settlement will impact on MAFF's programmes over the next three years and assist the Department in pursuing its aims and objectives.
<i>Safe, good quality food</i>
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para2">MAFF's responsibility for handling food safety transferred in April with the creation of the new Food Standards Agency (FSA). But MAFF will continue to play a key role in ensuring there is good quality, safe food meeting consumer requirements. As well as its wider commitment to sponsoring all the industries in the food chain, MAFF will retain as a key priority tackling the threat from animal diseases that are transmissible to humans and threats to the health and welfare of farm animals.
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para3">Over the next three years we will: continue to work towards the eradication of BSE, with a target by 2004 of being on track for fewer than 30 cases by 2006. We will introduce a scrapie control programme. This will comprise a ram genotyping programme, designed to encourage the use of scrapie resistant rams, and new testing and control measures. Consultation documents on the first stage of this programme, involving ram genotyping, will be issued on 28 July and copies will be placed in the Library of the House. We will pursue our strategy for controlling TB in cattle. There will be additional funding to increase testing in response to the spread of the disease, in line with EU requirements and veterinary advice. And we will complete the field trial of badger culling in 10 areas of high cattle TB incidence, as

<a name="00724w26.html_para4"><i>Rural development and restructuring</i>
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para5">The Government set out on 7 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 701-12, their long-term strategy for the future development of an agriculture industry that must be competitive, diverse and flexible, that must respond better to consumer demands (including those of the food industry), that must be more environmentally responsible and that must play an integral part in the wider rural economy.
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para6">The &#163;1.6 billion, seven-year England Rural Development Plan (ERDP) is a key component in the delivery of this strategy. Over the next three years we will spend a total of &#163;600 million under the ERDP. This will be funded in part by redirecting (or modulating) CAP payments and matching them with further Government funding on a pound for pound basis. There will be extra money for the agri-environment schemes, allowing more farmland to be protected and enhanced under the Countryside Stewardship Scheme and approved for conversion to organic farming. And there will be a substantial increase in funding over the three years for measures to encourage diversification and restructuring. We will replace Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances with a new area-based scheme of support for hill farmers.
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para7">We will also provide funding over the next three years for agricultural measures in the Objective 1 areas of Cornwall and the Scilly Isles, South Yorkshire and Merseyside. And there will be funding for rural regeneration projects under the new LEADER+ programme.
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para8">The other major plank of the Government's strategy for agriculture is the Action Plan which was announced on 30 March 2000. We will carry forward the measures announced in that Action Plan by: providing an additional &#163;40 million up to March 2003 for the Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme; maintaining the increased rate of grant under the Farm Waste Grant Scheme; continuing the new programme of business advice to farmers through the Business Link Partnership; providing additional funding for the applications currently being considered under the Agricultural Development Scheme; and making additional funding available for the development of an electronic portal for farming, providing access from a single source to information and interactive advice for farmers.

<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para10">We will maintain a strong and varied programme of research to support, inform and facilitate the implementation of MAFF's policies and its regulatory and environmental activities. Over the next three years we will: increase spending on research and surveillance on TSEs in sheep by a total of &#163;26.2 million. There will also be an additional &#163;10.5 million to invest in the facilities in which to carry out this research; invest in new and improved facilities at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency which will contribute to MAFF's programme of research on TSEs and research, diagnosis and surveillance in respect of other major animal diseases, including those transmissible to humans; and complete the procurement

<a name="00724w26.html_para11">We will shortly be conducting a major consultation on our Research Strategy for 2001-05. I shall consider the overall priorities for the whole research programme on the basis of that consultation, taking the advice of my new MAFF Science Committee, which will be launched soon.
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para12"><i>Improving services</i>
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para13">A key objective for MAFF over the next three years is to modernise the Department and make real and lasting improvements in the efficiency with which we deliver services to our stakeholders. The major initiative in this area will be the creation of a new CAP Payments Agency, for which there is additional provision of &#163;130 million over the Spending Review period. The Agency will merge the paying agency functions of the Intervention Board and MAFF's Regional Service Centres to provide top quality customer service using modern electronic systems. I am making a separate announcement today on this exciting and challenging project.
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para14"><i>CAP reform</i>
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para15">We will continue to work with our European partners to secure further reform of the CAP which will increase the competitiveness of the whole food chain.

<a name="00724w26.html_para17">An additional &#163;10 million in 2002-03 and &#163;20 million in 2003-04 will be made available to local flood and coastal defence operating authorities for investment in maintaining and improving defences. There will also be additional funds for improving storm tide forecasting and warning systems.
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para18">An in-depth review of the current arrangements for the funding and provision of flood and coastal defences will be completed in 2001.

<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para20">Securing a sustainable future for the sea fishing industry remains a priority for MAFF. A total of &#163;11 million will be made available for a three year programme of structural measures under the EU's Agenda 2000, including provision for safety training, encouragement of environmentally sustainable fishing, improvement in the quality of fish and support for regional fisheries management initiatives.
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para21"><i>Charging</i>
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para22">We will waive cattle passport charges for a further two years until March 2004. This waiver is worth around &#163;18 million a year to the industry.
<P>

<a name="00724w26.html_para23">As Minister responsible for co-ordinating the implementation of the Government's Action Plan for farming, I am considering with colleagues the recommendations of the task force which was set up to examine alternative approaches to charging for meat hygiene inspection, in response to concerns expressed by small and medium sized abattoirs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w27.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what progress is being made regarding the restructuring of his Department's regional activities; and if he will make a statement.  [132559]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 I have decided to make a number of important changes to the way MAFF operates in the regions, in order to improve the services we offer to farmers and to strengthen the contribution we make to the wider rural economy. We will participate fully in the Government Offices for the Regions, strengthening MAFF's regional policy capability; we will set up new organisational structures to enhance the delivery of rural 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 473W</I><P>
development policies; and we will invest up to &#163;130 million over the next spending period to modernise the way we administer CAP schemes, taking full advantage of the benefits of electronic services delivery.
<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para0">I have given careful consideration to the findings of a detailed study of methods of delivering CAP payments, submitted at the beginning of this year by PricewaterhouseCoopers. I have concluded that the interests of farmers, traders and taxpayers would best be served by the creation of a new CAP Payments Agency, merging the paying agency functions of MAFF's nine Regional Service Centres and the Intervention Board to provide top quality customer service using modern electronic systems. Farmers and traders will benefit from a reduction in "red tape" and more efficient and rapid processing of payments, with the achievement of 95 per cent. electronic service delivery capability by March 2004. There will be significant benefits for taxpayers, with a 10 per cent. cut by March 2004 in unit costs of administering payments and further savings in subsequent years after the new Agency is fully established.
<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para1">I have written today to the main organisations representing farmers and traders to explain how the Agency will work, and to seek their views on the best ways of ensuring a smooth transition to the new arrangements. We will work very closely with our customers to help them reap the benefits which electronic service delivery offers. However we recognise that many farmers are apprehensive about changes in the way their claims are handled and will maintain arrangements for face-to-face local contacts with farmers, at least until the new IT systems are fully operational and everyone has easy local access to the internet.
<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para2">The Agency will be constituted as an executive agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and will therefore be answerable to me. It will continue to administer the schemes currently operated by the Intervention Board in all parts of the UK and the devolved administrations will therefore be represented on its Ownership Board. It will operate from five sites, with its headquarters at Reading and other sites at Carlisle, Exeter, Newcastle and Northallerton. The work that will transfer to the new Agency currently accounts for some 80 per cent. of the 2,000 staff in the Regional Service Centres and nearly all the Intervention Board's 1,350 staff. By the time the new systems are fully operational (2004) we estimate that the total number of staff required will fall to around 1,950. We will make every effort to find suitable alternative employment for staff who are no longer required as a result of the modernisation programme.
<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para3">I have also been reviewing other aspects of MAFF's organisation in the regions in the light of the Modernising Government initiative and the recent PIU reports "Rural Economies" and "Reaching Out". It is now right to establish greater integration of MAFF's strategic and policy activities in the regions with Government Offices. I am therefore preparing to provide a senior member of MAFF staff, with appropriate support, to join each Government Office. This will help strengthen the rural capability of the Government Offices and improve their links with my Department. And it will foster closer relationships with regional stakeholders, including the agriculture, fisheries and food industries, and their 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 474W</I><P>
representatives, regional institutions such as the Regional Development Agencies, and representatives of rural and environmental interests.
<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para4">Parallel to the integration with Government Offices, I have decided to restructure the work currently carried out in the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency (FRCA) and the non-CAP payment functions of the Regional Service Centres. We will create a single, nationally managed but largely regionally based service to carry out this work. The service will be set up so that it relates effectively to Government Offices. Its staff will be located throughout England and will continue to provide a local service on the ERDP schemes.
<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para5">We will build on the considerable skills of staff in FRCA and the Regional Service Centres to create the new service as a centre of excellence for the delivery of rural development polices and programmes, particularly one of MAFF's flagship policies--the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP). It will provide continuing employment opportunities for some of the staff at the RSCs which are not in CAPPA locations (Bristol, Cambridge, Crewe, Nottingham and Worcester) as well as for FRCA staff.
<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para6">I would expect to review these organisational arrangements in 2003 at the end of the mid-term evaluation of the ERDP, and to consider at that stage whether full integration with the Government Offices would be sensible.
<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para7">The decision to implement this comprehensive programme of changes is a further element in my Department's commitment to delivering efficient and responsive modern public services. The new CAP Payments Agency will ensure that service standards to farmers and traders are second to none. And agriculture and the wider rural economy will benefit through the strengthening of MAFF's regional policy presence.
<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para8">I recognise that these decisions will create considerable uncertainty for staff in my Department's Regional Service Centres and at the Intervention board who have worked hard to provide good services to their customers. I have met the Trade Unions to discuss the position, and to assure them that I am committed to ensuring that everyone is treated fairly and sensitively as we take the change programme forward.

 Under both UK and EU pesticides legislation the responsibility for undertaking research into the health risks lies with the companies who market the pesticides. Lindane is presently under review in both the UK and EU programmes. Both reviews have required the submission of data and research studies by companies wishing to support the compound.
<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para9">In the EU review, 562 studies were submitted on, among other things, the compound's identity; physical and chemical properties; classification; methods of

<P>

<a name="00724w27.html_para11">Until recently the UK and EU reviews of lindane have been running in tandem. Under the UK review the Government have moved swiftly to ban those uses of lindane in this country which posed an unacceptable risk. At EU level the Commission has just produced a proposal to withdraw the agricultural uses of lindane as insufficient data have been submitted to support its continued use for these purposes. The Government have supported and welcome this development.

 There are no controls in either UK or European Community law on the pricing of veterinary medicinal products.

Similarly, the cost of veterinary treatment is not controlled by legislation but is a matter for negotiation between veterinary surgeon and client.
<P>

<a name="00724w28.html_para0">However, we have received representations about comparatively high prices of veterinary medicinal products in the UK and the issue is being investigated by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) who are currently conducting an inquiry into the pricing of veterinary medicines in the UK. It will consider whether there is any evidence of anti-competitive practices. In addition, my right hon.

This review will examine current dispensing practices and their impact on the supply, availability and costs of veterinary medicines. An announcement of the membership of the Review Group and its terms of reference will be made shortly. The review will be completed by the end of March 2001.

 <i>[holding answer 21 July 2000]:</i> Tenders for over-30-months scheme abattoir services were considered and contracts awarded on a regional basis. The only region without its own abattoir is East Anglia, which was grouped with the South East of England as a single region in view of the small number of cattle coming forward for slaughter from these areas, as compared with the rest of Great Britain. I will be placing in the Library of the House a copy of a map locating the OTMS abattoirs.

 <i>[holding answer 21 July 2000]:</i> In the run up to the Agenda 2000 CAP negotiations the Ministry commissioned The University of Manchester to carry out a study on the milk quota system. In its report 'An Economic Evaluation of the UK Milk Quota System' it concluded that despite the fact that conditions in the UK are well suited to milk production, the imposition of milk quotas is a source of economic inefficiency.
<P>

<a name="00724w28.html_para1">In addition to this, the UK, together with Italy, Sweden and Denmark, produced a paper that concluded that the abolition of the milk quota system would provide greater flexibility in the dairy market, encourage investment in the UK dairy industry and leave it free to compete for a share of the growing world markets.

<a name="00724w28.html_para2">Since August 1999, the Government have announced two significant packages of assistance for the livestock sector delivering in total &#163;419 million. Livestock farmers also receive around &#163;1 billion each year in payments under the CAP to which this &#163;149 million is an addition (CAP payments for beef producers are also set to rise this year by &#163;130 million as a result of the reform of the beef regime). Beef and dairy farmers also benefit from the Over-thirty-months Scheme which itself costs around &#163;400 million each year to run.

 The Spending Review is internal to Government; there are no formal consultations with outside bodies.

Friend the Under-Secretary has met with representatives of 20 of the 22 local authorities in Wales. These meetings have given me a sound understanding of the funding needs for local government ahead of the 2000 Spending Review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The aggregates levy is based on independent research which verified that there are significant environmental costs associated with quarrying, including noise, dust, visual intrusion, loss of amenity and damage to biodiversity. The Government decided to address these costs through the introduction of the aggregates levy. It will be introduced at a uniform rate in order to keep it simple and to give a clear signal to purchasers of primary aggregates to use more sustainable materials. It will reward quarry operators who invest in equipment for recycling, and ensure that all users of aggregates are taking responsibility for the costs that the production of their inputs imposes on the rest of society. This is consistent with the polluter pays principle.
<P>

<a name="00724w30.html_para1">There would be a number of practical difficulties with a levy which attempted to differentiate between quarries with different environmental performance. These relate to assessing compliance, defining environmental performance, the treatment of imports, EU state aids rules and UK competition policy. A uniform levy was therefore considered to be the most viable option.




<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 2000 : Column: 485W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00724w30.html_para2">All the revenues raised from the levy will be recycled back to business through a cut in employer National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and a new 'Sustainability Fund' aimed at delivering local environmental benefits. It is not possible to say precisely what the effect of the levy, the cut in employer NICs and the Sustainability Fund will be on the aggregates and construction industries, since this will depend, among other things, on future employment trends and the degree to which firms switch to recycled materials.

 It seems likely that the strong expansion in employee job opportunities since 1997 has encouraged some of the self-employed to switch to employee jobs. Total employment has increased by over one million since the General Election in 1997.

 Very few Parliamentary questions will not have been answered substantively, either in their entirety or in part, for reasons other than those specified in the hon. Member's question.

<P>
<a name="00724w31.html_wqn14"><B> Mrs. Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the outcome is of the Treasury's five-yearly review of National Savings.  [132685]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00724w31.html_spnew14"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Government's quinquennial review of National Savings was announced on 11 January. The review took a fundamental look at the strategic purpose of the functions carried out by the agency in the light of developing circumstances and Government policy. It then considered what organisational structure might best deliver the Government's policy objectives. In doing so, it looked at all the options on their merits, with the aim of identifying whether National Savings remains the most suitable way of delivering policy.
<P>

<a name="00724w31.html_para1">The review recognised the importance of recent innovations in National Savings to making the agency more efficient and more flexible. This includes the role played by outsourcing its operations. It is now better placed than ever to build on this achievement to modernise and adapt to the changing market in which it operates. It now has the potential to match the best in the financial services market, providing choice and good value products for savers and investors in the very competitive savings market.
<P>

<a name="00724w31.html_para2">The review sees these developments as central to National Savings continuing to make a valuable contribution to the cost-effectiveness of the national debt by offering attractive products and services to members of the public. It will set a clear and overarching objective to achieve cost-effective Government debt management. National Savings, which will remain a Government agency, funds a significant amount--over &#163;62 billion--of the national debt. Taxpayers will continue to see the benefit of National Savings' contribution, which is more cost-effective than comparable gilt-edged securities.
<P>

<a name="00724w31.html_para3">This is also good news for existing National Savings savers and for future customers. National Savings will be working to give its current and new customers more attractive, more up to date products and services. People will also get more choice on how they access those products. In addition to being able to get National Savings products through the Post Office and by post as they do now, customers will in future be able to choose from a wide range of channels.
<P>

<a name="00724w31.html_para4">In taking forward the review's recommendations, National Savings will continue to modernise its activities to make and keep it relevant, efficient and cost-effective. This will involve focusing on developing those aspects of the business that can operate competitively and cost-effectively, and continuing to develop new products as well as embracing innovations and new ideas.
<P>

<a name="00724w31.html_para5">The outcome of the review will be taken forward in a new business strategy, and reflected in the framework document which governs the relationship between the Agency, the Treasury and Ministers.
