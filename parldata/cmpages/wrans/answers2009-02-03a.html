 The procurement was undertaken through a mini-competition using the Office of Government Commerce's (OGC) Catalist framework. This was undertaken in accordance with the OGC's guidance and in line with European Union requirements; however, the approach did not use the competitive dialogue procedure. The competitive dialogue process is normally used when a specification may be unclear, and ongoing engagement is needed with potential suppliers. In this instance a specification was sufficiently developed and so a competitive dialogue was unnecessary.</p>

 The Government&#146;s assessment is that current sterling exchange rates will not have significant effects on budgetary provision for the 2012 Olympics. The Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) receives its revenues, and makes its payments, in sterling. It is the responsibility of the ODA tier one contractors to manage exchange risks as defined by their contractual arrangements with the ODA. The ODA is reviewing the current exchange rate fluctuations with its Delivery Partner and the tier one contractors to assess the level of impact on future procurement. To date, no call has been made on the contingency in relation to exchange rate fluctuations. The contingency (within the &#163;9.325 billion funding package) does, however, include provision for identified risks with the potential to impact on projects across the ODA programme such as exchange rate fluctuations.</p>

As a result, LOCOG has taken steps to effectively minimise exposure to exchange rate shifts and it is expected that recent movements in both currencies against sterling will have no significant impact on LOCOG&#146;s revenues. As the majority of LOCOG&#146;s costs are sterling-based, it is expected that recent movements in both currencies against sterling will have no significant impact on LOCOG&#146;s costs.</p>

The cost is not quantified, and, indeed, individual regulations are rarely mentioned other than the &#145;overall&#146; effect.

<i> [holding answer 27 January 2009]:</i> The Government and a number of other bodies have undertaken work on various aspects of digital and media literacy. In the Communications Act 2003, we gave Ofcom a statutory duty to work with others to promote media literacy in the UK. My Department works closely with Ofcom on its media literacy priorities and contributes annual funding to Ofcom's work in this area, which includes the periodic audit of changes in media literacy skills across the UK. Their audit has demonstrated that progress has been made, but we recognise that there is more work to be done.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="90203w0002.htm_para2"><a name="09020331000143">The new BBC Charter and Agreement also places a specific duty on the BBC Trust to promote media literacy. Furthermore, a wide range of activity is being undertaken by both education providers and industry&#151;such as the Media Literacy Task Force&#151;aimed at increasing levels of media literacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_368"><a name="90203w0002.htm_para3"><a name="09020331000144">In addition, the Government have set out a range of cross-departmental strategies that will further enhance media literacy. The Prime Minister has appointed my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales as Minister for Digital Inclusion and he has recently consulted on a Digital Inclusion Action Plan, aimed at improving access and skills to encourage the best use of digital technologies, building on the success of the 6,000 UK online centres in England. Furthermore, as one of the key recommendations from the Byron Review on internet safety, we have established the UK Council for Child Internet Safety which is developing a strategy including education and awareness for parents, carers and children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_369"><a name="90203w0002.htm_para4"><a name="09020331000145">The interim Digital Britain report (Cm 7548) identifies the skills and literacy challenges to a fully digital Britain. We have therefore asked Ofcom to make an assessment of its current responsibilities in relation to media literacy and, working with the BBC and others, to recommend a new definition and ambition for a National Media Literacy Plan as a contribution to the final Digital Britain Report in the summer.</p>

Resolution of the issue of liability for these cases is subject to the outcome of the trial of a sample of four cases, due to be heard in November 2009. From these cases, we aim to identify generic issues that allow the issue of British Coal&#146;s liability to compensate to be resolved one way or the other.</p>

 Paragraphs 34 and 35 of the judgment refer to section 3 of the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000.

The explanation for their inclusion relates to the procedure of the House of Commons where a provision of a Bill introduced in that House may give rise to public expenditure. This is not a matter that is specific to the Warm Homes and Energy Conservation Act 2000, but raises wider issues relating to parliamentary procedure and Bill drafting practice generally.

2. Claim processing performance data is supplied to DWP by local authorities and is un-audited.<br>
3. Not all local authorities provide all four quarters worth of data. Where a local authority has not provided data in a particular quarter, the data they have provided is multiplied to cover the appropriate period; this is then used to calculate the national average.<br>

 Flexible working hours (FWH) or flexitime schemes operate widely in the Home Office where the nature of the work allows for it.

 The UK Border Agency International Group does not hold accurate information to answer this question. In order to provide an answer, the amounts would have to be estimated and this could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The visa refusal rate is approximately 20 per cent. globally, though this is spread across the various categories of visa, with different fees attaching to each.</p>

 Between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2008, 272 subject profile records were deleted from the NDNAD under the Exceptional Case Procedure (i.e. following a request to the chief officer of the responsible force from the person concerned).

 Our approach is to provide parents with positive support and guidance to help them manage their children's behaviour more effectively.

<p><a name="stpa_504"><a name="90203w0021.htm_para13"><a name="09020362001787">When employers in the education sector have ceased to use the services of a person because they consider that person is unsuitable to work with children, or they would have ceased to use the person's services where the person has left their employment, they are required to refer information to the Department. The police also refer to the Department cautions and convictions for those who have been working in educational establishments in accordance with Home Office Circular 6/2006 (The Notifiable Occupations Scheme).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_505"><a name="90203w0021.htm_para14"><a name="09020362001788">In addition, regulations which came into force on 28 February 2007 extended the range of offences which result in automatic inclusion on List 99. These amended regulations include cautions as well as convictions for sexual offences against children and other very serious offences against adults, regardless of whether the individuals concerned have ever been in employment in the education and children's work force. The Department is notified of relevant offences by the police. The vast majority of the increase in the total number of notifications is as a result of the implementation of these regulations.</p>

<i> [holding answer 27 January 2009]:</i> Officials meet representatives from the National Farmers&#146; Union frequently, both individually and in the context of discussions with other stakeholders, and at national and local levels. These discussions sometimes focus specifically on food security, such as the workshops held in September and November 2008, based on the discussion paper &#147;Ensuring the UK&#146;s Food Security in a Changing World&#148;, published in July last year. However, the issue of food security is also addressed in the context of broader discussions about the Department&#146;s strategic objectives, such as achieving a sustainable, secure and healthy food supply and a thriving farming and food sector. It is therefore not possible to provide a specific number of occasions when the topic has been discussed.</p>

 There is no figure available for the number of equidae in England. However, estimates of the horse population in Great Britain range from 1.0 to 1.35 million. Horse passports are an EU requirement introduced to prevent contaminated meat from entering the human food chain. Passports are also intended to reduce fraud and aid disease control and surveillance. The Meat Hygiene Service play an important role in ensuring that the horse is correctly identified and its passport is in order before horses are accepted for slaughter for human consumption. Samples are taken from a small number of horses entering the food chain as part of the UK statutory surveillance programme checking the appropriate use of veterinary medicinal products. In cases of non-compliance the Veterinary Medicines Directorate, which operates this programme, requires an investigation to be carried out which involves checking the details on the passport of the animal.</p>

Between 1999 and 2004, the entry rate was 2 per cent. of farming population and the exit rate 18 per cent., mainly because of a decline in the total number of farmers and farm businesses. The report identified no evidence of major barriers to entry that justified policy intervention and no evidence of significant market failure in the processes of entry to and exit from farming. The research found that entry and exit decisions are rational and driven by strong market forces and personal motivations and that financial inducement to affect the rate of entry or exit would be expensive and ineffectual. Any use of financial incentives to facilitate entry to and exit from farming risks &#147;deadweight&#148; i.e. that many would enter farming in any case&#151;the majority of those entering farming do so through the family farm. The most common reason given for the low rate of entry to farming was the expectation of relatively low incomes. This cannot be addressed through a start up grant as envisaged in the Rural Development Regulation but rather by developing a competitive, viable and sustainable farming sector. DEFRA is supporting the industry-led initiative &#145;Fresh Start&#146; which encourages new entrants into farming whilst at the same time stimulating existing farmers to think how they will respond to CAP reform, such as expanding their business, diversifying or even retiring. Such choices create opportunities for new entrants.</p>

As the European Commission noted in 2002, &#147;research has shown that both farm animal welfare and product quality improves when the people who care for, transport and handle the animals are well-trained, have a positive attitude towards their jobs and the animals, treat the animals with care, and are attentive to their needs. It is therefore important to educate and inform these professionals&#148;. It is felt that this strikes the right note and properly records the importance of extending good animal health and welfare beyond the farm gate. Ongoing payments for animal welfare (normally for between five and seven years under the Regulation) would not be the most effective way of delivering animal health and welfare outcomes in England, and in particular would represent a significant diversion of funds away from other priorities.

3. The published QOF information was derived from the Quality Management Analysis System (QMAS), a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health.<br>
4. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. QMAS is a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF.<br>
5. The system calculates practice achievement against national targets. It gives general practices, PCTs and strategic health authorities (SHAs) objective evidence and feedback on the quality of care delivered to patients.<br>
6. The QMAS captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists.<br>
7. Unadjusted prevalence = (number on disease register/list size) *100. These are raw data.<br>
8. QOF data are collected annually.<br>

 The CAA received an application for the validation of the Spanish certification of the ELA 07 gyroplane in April 2006. As part of the certification process the CAA had consulted the Spanish authorities on the differences between the Spanish and UK airworthiness codes for gyroplanes. Significant differences between the codes were identified. As a result, the CAA have been involved in discussions with the Spanish authorities and ELA, the manufacturer, of the gyroplane, with a view to agreeing and approving the modification necessary to meet the UK requirements. The CAA last met with the Spanish authorities and the manufacturer in October 2008. All of the follow up action from that meeting rests with ELA. ELA has requested the CAA not to do any additional work on the validation until ELA and the Spanish authorities have agreed the way forward.</p>

including burial grounds, along the route. This investigation was carried out by the Museum of London Archaeological Services. Although there are a number of burial grounds on the route, this is not generally an issue where the running tunnels are at some depth underground. There are issues, however, at the stations where excavation must of necessity be carried out from ground level.</p>

The techniques for dealing with these matters are well understood by archaeologists and the necessary specialist advice will be taken.</p>

<i> [holding answer 2 February 2009]:</i><i> </i>Current legislation requires compulsory motor insurance against third party risk for the use of a vehicle on a road or other public place. There is no statutory requirement to insure vehicles in private storage or under repair and declared under statutory off-road notification (SORN).</p>

Up to the end of December 2008, over 290 households have taken up this opportunity to access home ownership and stay in their communities, including those tenants who did not previously have an opportunity to purchase their current home.</p>

 The demolition of buildings constituting development is permitted development under Part 31 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995, so planning permission is not generally required. Permitted development rights do not apply where a building has become unsafe or otherwise uninhabitable by deliberate action or neglect by the owner, so planning permission is necessary in such circumstances. Where the demolition of a building is required as part of a redevelopment for which planning permission is sought, details of the demolition should be included in the planning application, and any planning permission granted for the development should include permission to demolish the building. The demolition of listed buildings, buildings in conservation areas, and buildings designated as scheduled monuments, is not classed as development but is subject to consent under separate consent regimes.</p>

 It is possible to have a power shower in a code level 6 home. The Code for Sustainable Homes is outcome based; it does not specify particular technologies or solutions. A code level 6 home must achieve a projected average water consumption of 80 litres per person per day, which is assessed through the code water calculator methodology. This approach allows greater flexibility for the designer as it enables them to decide which fixtures and solutions to use to achieve this target in each location.</p>

It works by taking away years of caring responsibilities from the number of qualifying years needed for a full basic state pension. Since 2002, it has also given entitlement to additional state pension in some circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_670"><a name="90203w0038.htm_para1"><a name="0902049000270">Over 99 per cent. of people become eligible for Home Responsibilities Protection automatically through the award of child benefit for a child under 16. Most people who satisfy the conditions for receiving HRP as a carer for a disabled person also satisfy the conditions for carer's allowance as these are very similar. Since recipients of carer's allowance are credited with national insurance contributions, they do not normally need HRP.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_671"><a name="90203w0038.htm_para2"><a name="0902049000271">There is publicity about HRP in a variety of leaflets concerning pensions and carers available in Jobcentre Plus offices, from the Pension, Disability and Carers Service and other outlets and on Government websites to alert the remaining carers to the need to make an application. Deficiency Notices issued by HMRC following the end of a tax year in which people have not gained a qualifying year for pension purposes also give advice about HRP and credits. There was an extensive national publicity campaign in early 2006 to make carers aware that they might need to apply for HRP in order to gain additional state pension.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_672"><a name="90203w0038.htm_para3"><a name="0902049000272">The Pensions Act 2007 introduced a comprehensive package of reforms to help more carers build better pensions. These include the replacement of HRP with a system of weekly national insurance credits for parents and carers which will build up entitlement to basic and additional state pension and will extend pension protection to persons undertaking lower levels of caring. We are working to ensure that people are aware of the whole package of state pension reforms we will introduce from 2010. We want to reach all those who may be entitled to the new credits whether they have been in contact with the benefit system or not and will continue to work with interested parties to determine how best we deliver it.</p>

 The Government&#146;s White Paper on Energy &#147;Meeting the Energy Challenge&#148; (2007) indicates that making best use of UK Energy resources, including coal reserves, where it is economically viable and environmentally acceptable to do so, contributes to the Government&#146;s goal of security of energy supplies. Planning Policy for coal extraction in England (whether open cast or deep mine) is set out in Minerals Policy Guidance Note 3 &#147;Coal Mining and Colliery Spoil Disposal&#148; (MPG3) published in 1999. Consistent with the broader policy in the White Paper, this sets a presumption against such development unless the proposal meets specific tests in terms of environmental acceptability or the provision of local and community benefits which clearly outweigh the likely impacts. The Government believe that these tests are sufficient to ensure that the environmental effects of opencast coal mining are properly considered in the planning process. There is no current intention to review policy in MPG3.</p>

In keeping with the brief, Barratt Developments Plc, the preferred bidders for the Hanham Hall site, have designed the homes to meet the requirements of the definition of net zero carbon in the Code for Sustainable Homes. We therefore envisage that all 195 homes will qualify for stamp duty tax relief in due course.</p>

The current fee for an application for conviction within the magistrates court is in three stages, costing a total of &#163;90. The consultation proposes a single fee of &#163;250.

The system allows a full remission or part remission of the court fee and is aimed at people who are in receipt of a specific means-tested benefit, whose income is below a prescribed limit and for some whose financial commitments leave them with little or no disposable income.</p>

 When an offender is convicted of murder, the courts must hand down a life sentence. Such a sentence will include a minimum tariff which must be served before the offender can be considered by the Parole Board for release. This tariff is set by the courts and is the minimum term required for retribution and deterrence, which is set in line with Section 269 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003.</p>

WAVES surveys victims and witnesses whose cases resulted in a charge being brought. The survey was introduced to give more detailed feedback about the experience of victims and witnesses. Unlike the BCS, WAVES gives both national and Local Criminal Justice Board-level data and contains many more questions about every aspect of the CJS.</p>

50,000 people, this includes only a relatively small proportion of victims whose cases have gone all the way through the CJS. WAVES focuses specifically on victims whose cases have got to the stage of a charge being brought or beyond, and interviews nearly 40,000 victims and witnesses. Hence the two surveys sample different groups. The BCS and WAVES also use different measures of satisfaction. The BCS defined satisfaction as the percentage of victims who were fairly or very satisfied with the contact they had with the CJS. WAVES gives victims the choice of three different levels of satisfaction defining overall satisfaction as the percentage of victims who were fairly, very or completely satisfied with the contact they had with the CJS. This is the standard scale now used by most customer satisfaction surveys and allows a more detailed breakdown of different levels of satisfaction.</p>
