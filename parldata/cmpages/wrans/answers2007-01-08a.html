<p><a name="st_6"><a name="0701097000059"><a name="70108w0001.htm_spnew2"><a name="0701097000280"><b>Mr. McCartney:</b> The Malaysian Federal Constitution guarantees freedom of religion. However, Muslims are subject to Shari'a law with respect to family matters which includes apostasy. Muslims can only change their religion with the permission of a Shari'a Court who will often not allow this, and may order periods of rehabilitation and other penalties for those who attempt to do it. In addition, the application of Shari'a is a state, rather than federal matter and so varies around the country&#151;the State of Negeri Sembilan allows apostasy. This complicated issue impacts on a minority of people who wish to leave Islam&#151;a recent survey by an academic found that there were only 100 applications to the Shari'a Courts to apostatise between 1994-2003. The majority of applicants are from people who had previously converted to Islam for the purpose of marriage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_12"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para2"><a name="0701097000060">There are no anti-conversion laws in Indonesian civil law. The constitution of Indonesia guarantees freedom of religion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_13"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para3"><a name="0701097000061">There are anti-conversion laws in India. However, to date, nobody has raised with us specific cases of abuse, where anti-conversion laws have been used to prevent someone from willingly changing their religion.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_14"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para4"><a name="0701097000062">There is no anti-conversion legislation in Pakistan, although converts from Islam to other religions are subject to various social pressures and harassment and the blasphemy laws are often abused in this context.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_15"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para5"><a name="0701097000063">The Government, along with our EU partners, follows closely developments in states where anti-conversion laws exist. We condemn all instances where individuals are persecuted because of their faith or belief, wherever they happen and whatever the religion of the individual or group concerned. We urge all states to pursue laws and practices which foster tolerance and mutual respect and to protect religious minorities from discrimination.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_16"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para6"><a name="0701097000064">The Malaysian Federal Constitution was amended in 2001 to provide against discrimination on grounds of gender.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_17"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para7"><a name="0701097000065">The Malaysian Government ratified Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) in 1995 and presented their first report to the CEDAW committee earlier this year. There are concerns that the rights of women in divorce and inheritance are not equal to those of men in the Shari'a Courts. There are also concerns that the proposed new Islamic Family Law Act will do little to alleviate this, with a widespread perception that it is even more detrimental to the status of Muslim women than existing laws, including making polygamy easier. However, the Government is re-examining the bill following concerns by non-governmental organisations and is consulting women's groups on the revision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_18"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para8"><a name="0701097000066">The Indonesian Government, through the Ministry of Women's Affairs, is actively working to increase the participation of women. In general, women play a significant and growing role in Indonesian society.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_19"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para9"><a name="0701097000067">In India, there is increasing awareness of women's rights issues. The Government are working with a number of organisations, including the National Commission for Women, to highlight and address these issues. One example includes a sponsored visit to the UK earlier this year by the chairperson of the National Commission for Women.</p>

To that end, Ministers raise WTO issues regularly in bilaterals with their Chinese counterparts, as indeed I did in July in my visit to China. Most recently, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry visited China from 26 to 30 November. He emphasised the need for China to play an active role in the current WTO round and to continue opening up its markets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_21"><a name="70108w0001.htm_para11"><a name="0701097000071">The WTO is an important pillar of the multilateral system and we encourage all WTO members to abide by their WTO obligations. At the EU General Affairs and External Relations Council on 11 to 12 December, EU Foreign Ministers adopted conclusions welcoming the Commission Communication "EU-China: Closer Partners, Growing Responsibilities" and the Commission working paper "Competition and Partnership". The Commission documents stress the mutual benefits of enhanced trade and economic relations between the EU and China, and the importance of China fully implementing its WTO obligations. The UK worked with other member states to ensure that the Conclusions reflect our position.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_176"><a name="70108w0012.htm_para28"><a name="07010915001002">In March 2006, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) published guidance on the use of drugs to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). NICE has estimated that around 5 per cent. of school-aged children meet the diagnostic criteria for ADHD, equivalent to 366,000 children and adolescents in England and Wales, but not all these children will require medication. In the year to 31 August 2006, 384,000 prescriptions for methylphenidate were dispensed in England to children aged 0 to 15 years and those aged 16 to 18 years in full time education.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_177"><a name="70108w0012.htm_para29"><a name="07010915001003">We have no evidence to suggest that inappropriate prescribing of methylphenidate is widespread. NICE has recommended that drug treatment for ADHD should only be initiated by an appropriately qualified healthcare professional with expertise in ADHD and should be based on a comprehensive assessment and diagnosis. Continued prescribing and monitoring of drug treatment may be performed by general practitioners, under shared care arrangements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_178"><a name="70108w0012.htm_para30"><a name="07010915001004">Methylphenidate is classified under the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 as a schedule two controlled drug. As such, it is subject to additional restrictions in its use, for example it must be kept in a secure place that meets the requirements of the Safe Custody Regulations 1973. Amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations in July 2006 brought in a standard prescription form for private prescribing of schedule two and three controlled drugs. Thus, the national data will now cover both national health service and private prescribing of methylphenidate by prescriber but not by patient.</p>

The bundle included money to fund workforce programmes, the quality and outcomes framework, clinical excellence awards as well as other miscellaneous programmes.

The Government require assurance that any prospective change of ownership of Devonport Royal Dockyard Ltd (DRDL) or any new influence or control should not adversely affect the essential security interests of the UK. On this basis the Government need to assess whether the planned separation of KBR from Halliburton would be acceptable. MOD is now in active discussion with KBR to ensure that the UK&#146;s essential security interests are protected. The ability for Devonport Management Ltd. to bid freely for defence contracts is a key element of these interests.</p>

When the provision of goods and services in Iraq reached the required standard, the decision was taken to end the scheme on 8 April 2004. It was later re-introduced for a period of one month before Christmas 2004, and subsequently confirmed by the then Secretary of State for Defence, prior to Christmas 2005, that the pre-Christmas free packet scheme was to become a standard element of the Operational Welfare Package.</p>

However, guidance to the police makes it clear that cases of criminal damage over &#163;300, and thefts over &#163;100, should normally be dealt with by the courts: PNDs should only be issued in exceptional circumstances with the agreement of the victim/retailer. The guidance also states that police should seek and record the victim's views and consult them about the potential issue of a PND, including the effect on the victim's claims for compensation.</p>

(Only 1 per cent. requested a court hearing.) 42 per cent. of PND recipients had a fine of one and a half times the penalty registered against them as they failed to pay the penalty or request a court hearing within the 21-day suspended enforcement period. Once registered, these fines fall into the HMCS fine enforcement and collection systems. The courts are currently achieving an overall payment rate for fines of 95 per cent.</p>

As a result of responses received during the six month consultation period, the Government announced their decision to introduce a scheme in &#147;Identity Cards: The Next Steps&#148;, published in November 2003. A draft Bill was then published and consulted on before the first Identity Cards Bill was introduced to Parliament in November 2004.

The notification requirements themselves have been strengthened by part 2 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003, and in 2001 we introduced statutory multi-agency public protection arrangements (MAPPA) across England and Wales to enhance risk assessment and management of serious sexual and violent offenders. Similar arrangements are being introduced in Scotland and Northern Ireland.</p>

ViSOR currently provides a national database of intelligence about the behaviour, residence and identity of sexual offenders and will include violent offenders by December 2007.</p>

1. Estimates of the number of pensioner households eligible for pension credit are the mid-points of projections taken from two separate micro-simulation models. Modelling of the reform proposals does not include any increase in private saving from the introduction of personal accounts, which would reduce the numbers eligible for pension credit.<br>
2. Care should be taken when interpreting these projections as they are subject to a margin of uncertainty. The projections are based on long run simulations of the incomes of individuals under a set of assumptions including life expectancy, partnership formation, earnings growth, employment rates, state and private pension accumulation.<br>
3. Projections of the number of pensioner households eligible for pension credit are derived from the projected proportions eligible and projections of the number of pensioner households in Great Britain.<br>
4. Estimates cover all those aged above women&#146;s state pension age in the private household population of Great Britain.<br>
5. Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. They also account for the proposed further increases in state pension age described in the White Paper. The estimates assume that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women&#146;s state pension age.<br>
6. Projections under the White Paper proposals assume: continued earnings uprooting of the standard guarantee credit; the savings credit maximum is uprated by earnings from 2008 and then by prices from 2015; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from 2012; and measures to improve coverage of state pensions described in the White Paper. Figures exclude the effect of Personal Accounts.<br>
7. Projections under the current system with guarantee credit earnings uprated assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard minimum guarantee; continued price uprating of the savings credit threshold and the basic state pension.<br>
