To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what research and developments have been made on in-vehicle technology to prevent law breaking.  [94508]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 There is a considerable quantity of research being undertaken both in Industry and Government to investigate the benefits that can be obtained from developments in in-vehicle technology to prevent law breaking. Advances in electronics and telematics promise to make measures for vehicle control (e.g. separation distance), identification and location both feasible and cost effective. One particular project sponsored by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is looking into a system of Intelligent Speed Adaptation which would be able to control the speed of vehicles automatically to prevent them exceeding speed limits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Prescott </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 October 1999]:</i> Immediately after the last election I asked for advice on all aspects of rail safety. This was received in June 1997 and included information on measures to stop signals being passed at danger. After discussions with the Health and Safety Commission I made it clear that they should bring forward any formal proposals on (inter alia) automatic train protection that they considered necessary. I signed the resulting regulations in July. In September the HSE announced the result of their audit of the increase in signals passed at danger and 22 specific actions that they required the industry to progress.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 1999]:</i> On 9 August the Chief Inspector of Railways informed Ministers of the provisional rail safety statistics for 1998-99, which included the 8 per cent. rise in signals passed at danger. HSE published the statistics on 12 August.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Research after the Cannon Street accident in 1991 and more recent research by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) confirms that train overcrowding is not primarily a safety issue but one of passenger discomfort. There is no evidence to suggest that train overcrowding is in itself dangerous, or actually causes accidents. HSE is determined to ensure that, safety is not compromised, as part of improving the railways for passengers. HSE gives high priority to minimising safety concerns in the design of trains arising from congestion at stations.

 <i>[holding answer 27 October 1999]:</i> Responsibility for providing railway safety statistics (including SPADs) rests with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE).
<P>

<a name="91102w01.htm_para0">The Chief Inspector of Railways at the HSE informed Ministers of the annual statistics for 1997-98 (which showed a fall in SPADs) on 7 December 1998. A departmental press notice was published on 9 December 1998 which stressed the need for the railway industry to 



<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 1999 : Column: 75</I><P>
improve the safety culture operating in the industry and looked to HSE to use their enforcement powers against companies which skimped on their safety obligations.
<P>

<a name="91102w01.htm_para1">On 9 August 1999 the Chief Inspector of Railways informed Ministers of the provisional rail safety statistics for 1998-99, which included an 8 per cent. rise in SPADs. The HSE statistics were published on 12 August. On 30 July the Deputy Prime Minister had signed regulations requiring the fitting of the train protection and warning system to cut the incidence of SPADs. The regulations were laid in the House on 10 August.

<P>
<a name="91102w01.htm_wqn8"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what reports he has received of safety issues concerning the 20.42 Connex train to Dartford via Greenwich on 21 October; and if he will make a statement.  [96852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The HSE is aware of the incident on 21 October where the driver of the 20.42 Connex train from Charing Cross to Dartford accepted the route set by the signaller which directed his train onto the line through New Cross instead of going to Greenwich. All the signals were clear and there was therefore no risk to passengers' safety. Implications for the competencies of safety critical staff are being examined.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w01.htm_wqn9"><B> Mr. Austin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what reports he has received that the lunar lights on the North Kent line at Charlton are obscured by foliage; and if he will make a statement;  [96854]
<P>
<UL>(2) what reports he has received regarding recent incidents where Connex trains from Dartford to Cannon Street have taken the wrong route; and if he will make a statement.  [96853]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Although no report has been made to HSE, I understand that on 7 October a Connex train took the wrong route at Charlton because the white route indication lights on the signal were reportedly obscured by foliage. On passing the junction, the driver realised the route had been wrongly set, and under instruction from the signaller, set the train back behind the signal to allow the route to be reset correctly. HSE will now take this matter up with the train operating company.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what arrangements he proposes to put in place in relation to his proposals for National Air Traffic Services to ensure that staff will be able to speak freely about issues relating to safety.  [96187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w01.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Staff of National Air Traffic Services Ltd. (NATS) are already given protection under the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. Pursuant to the Public Interest Disclosure (Prescribed Persons) Order (SI 1999-1549) the CAA is prescribed as a body to which a worker may make a protected disclosure in respect of aviation safety. The CAA has nominated its Secretary and Legal Adviser to be its point of contact. He will protect the complainer's anonymity, while ensuring that the complaint is passed to the relevant regulator. A trade union official who raised safety issues as part of his duties would also enjoy additional protection through the Employment Rights Act 1996.




<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 1999 : Column: 76</I><P>

<P>

<a name="91102w01.htm_para2">Two other avenues will continue to be available to NATS staff post partnership who may wish to make a disclosure in respect to aviation safety. First, the Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme, where an individual is required to report any occurrence which has, or if not corrected would have, endangered an aircraft, its occupants or any other person. The scheme includes an option for the reportee to submit an MOR direct to the safety regulatory authority, without involving local line management. Second is the UK Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme (CHIRP), which is an independent confidential reporting programme for people employed in the aviation industry to report safety-related incidents and events. In this scheme, the reportees' identities are kept confidential, personal details are not retained and are returned to the reportee.
<P>

<a name="91102w01.htm_para3">I have also held a meeting with the NATS unions and the Safety Regulator to discuss safety matters and further meetings are planned with interested parties on this important subject and on other issues related to the PPP.

<P>
<a name="91102w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 This Report provides a useful overview of the transport needs of visually impaired people. My Department has been working with blind and partially sighted people over many years to improve their independent mobility. It is clear that we are already tackling many of the issues which the Report highlights.




<P>

<P>

<a name="91102w02.htm_para0">For example, the regulations we are introducing under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 requiring access for disabled people to buses, trains and taxis, will include features to meet the needs of visually impaired people. The regulations covering access to trains were introduced from the beginning of this year and in the last few days we concluded the consultation on the draft accessibility regulations for buses and coaches.
<P>

<a name="91102w02.htm_para1">We will continue to work with visually impaired people and their organisations to ensure that these improvements, together with greater emphasis on driver training and information, enable blind and partially sighted people to travel with confidence.

<P>
<a name="91102w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 We have no plans at present to extend the scope of the proposed national minimum standard scheme for people of pensionable age. Local authorities already have powers to provide concessionary travel for people who are blind and partially sighted and many do so. The decision on whether to allow concessionary travel for that group of people will remain a matter for individual local authorities.

 Under the Civil Aviation (Investigation of Air Accidents and Incidents) Regulations any undertaking or authority to which a safety recommendation is addressed is required to take the recommendation into consideration without delay and, where appropriate, act upon it. They are also required to provide the Secretary of State with full details of how they intend to implement the recommendation or a full explanation of why they do not intend to implement it. The recommendations referred

 <i>[holding answer 1 November 1999]:</i> This is an operational matter for London Underground. However, London Underground carefully considers customer safety and discomfort from overcrowding in its assessment of investment priorities. Much investment and management effort is focused on reducing delays and improving reliability of the service, which helps reduce congestion both on trains and through stations and provides a safer, more comfortable environment. Examples of investment projects that will combat congestion are: the Jubilee Line Extension; increasing services on the Central and Northern lines; projects at Knightsbridge, Leicester Square, Brixton and Russell Square. In addition, London Underground is focusing on reducing station congestion through better signing and passenger flow management at the busiest stations.

 <i>[holding answer 1 November 1999]:</i> This is an operational matter for London Underground. However, I understand that as part of London Underground's safety management system, comprehensive crowd control plans and measures to implement them are regularly used by London Underground staff when the level of passengers using the system exceeds the system's capacity to deal with them. These safety risk controls are exercised by line controllers and station supervisors. They work in co-operation with each other to ensure that levels of crowding do not exceed safe levels. Staff involved in the implementation of these controls are fully trained. Safety plans are updated annually and regular emergency exercises are held to test the effectiveness of the arrangements.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate his Department has made of the annual financial impact on West Oxfordshire District Council of his changes to the negative housing subsidy regime.  [96619]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 My Department will be consulting later this Autumn on the detail of the proposals for changes in the Housing Revenue Account subsidy regime. Consideration of the outcome of that exercise will be required before any decisions are taken. It is too early to say what the financial impact of any changes will be. The financial implications for any authority will depend upon both the results of the consultation exercise and conditions pertaining nearer the time that any changes are made.

 The Department will apply, in the current financial year, the same method of depreciation as that applied in the 1998-99 financial year dry run resource accounts which is the straight line method. The method applied is commonly used in the private sector.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w03.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government have been consulted recently on two draft downlisting proposals under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), from Norway and Japan, relating respectively to the Northeast Atlantic and North Atlantic Central Stocks, and to the Southern Hemisphere Stocks of Minke Whale (<i>Balaenoptera acutorostrata</i>). We have replied to both countries making clear our objections and underscoring our opposition to any CITES downlisting proposals which might undermine the moratorium on commercial whaling under the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w03.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The decision to grant fifth freedom rights at Prestwick to US air cargo carriers will deliver a range of economic benefits to the airport and to the region. In granting these rights at a single UK airport we have made it clear to the US government that the granting of similar rights at other UK airports is contingent upon the adoption by the US of policies which would afford UK air cargo carriers new opportunities in the US.

<P>
<P>

 The provision of cycling facilities on trains and at stations is a matter for individual operators. Paragraph 31 of the Instructions and Guidance which we issued to the Franchising Director on 29 September requires him to promote the use of bicycles by seeking

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what representations he has made to the European Commission on his plans to retain UK responsibility for bilateral negotiations with third countries on civil aviation agreements; and if he will make a statement;  [97079]
<P>
<UL>(2) what increase in the EU responsibility for bilateral negotiations with third countries on civil aviation agreements the Government have agreed since 1 May 1997;  [97081]
<P>
(3) if it is the Government's policy to retain responsibility for bilateral negotiations with third countries on civil aviation agreements indefinitely;  [97080]
<P>
(4) what representations he has received from the European Commission concerning his Department's present responsibility for bilateral negotiations with third countries on civil aviation agreements; and if he will make a statement.  [97078]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w03.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The European Commission presented a proposal to open aviation negotiations with the US at Community level in 1997, but to date the Transport Council has not agreed to the proposal. The Commission has brought infraction proceedings in the European Court of Justice against the UK, alleging that the ownership and control clause contained in the UK's bilateral aviation agreement with the US (Bermuda II) breaches the EC Treaty. Similar proceedings have been brought against seven other member states. In common with these other member states, the UK is contesting the case.
<P>

<a name="91102w03.htm_para1">The Government believe that the benefits of a Community-wide approach to negotiating air service agreements with third countries need to be considered on a case by case basis and that any decision to grant the Commission a mandate should be justified by reference to the added value of a collective approach.
<P>

<a name="91102w03.htm_para2">To date, the Commission has obtained mandates from the Council for three sets of aviation negotiations with third countries: with Norway and Sweden (which were subsequently subsumed by the agreement establishing the European Economic Area and, in the case of Sweden, its accession to the Community); with Switzerland; and with ten Central and Eastern European countries (Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovenia and Slovakia). Each of these mandates was granted before 1 May 1997. The Commission has recently made a proposal for a Council decision authorising it to open negotiations with Cyprus.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent discussions his Department has held with its US counterparts concerning the future of US/UK civil aviation agreements; who was present at such meetings; what were the agendas and the conclusions of the meetings; and if he will make a statement.  [97076]<P>
<P>
<P>

 My officials held exploratory talks on 18 and 19 October with a delegation from the US State Department, the Department of Transportation, the US 



<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 1999 : Column: 84</I><P>
Embassy and the FAA. The Director of International Aviation Negotiations led the team of DETR and FCO officials. The primary focus of the meeting was the possible liberalisation of air cargo arrangements, although the delegations also renewed their dialogue on the overall liberalisation of the bilateral aviation relationship. In addition, the US delegation raised the subject of direct air links between Pittsburgh and London. The two sides agreed to consider how further progress may be made.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w03.htm_wqn15"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received from United Kingdom airlines concerning the future of UK/US civil aviation agreements.  [97077]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w03.htm_spnew15"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 I have received representations from a number of airlines and from other bodies concerning UK/US civil aviation agreements. These representations do not reveal a consensus as to the most appropriate way forward for our bilateral discussions, with the Government being pressed by different parties to adopt mutually inconsistent policies.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what resources he will make available to authorities that have been reorganised on 1 April 1997 and 1998 for reorganisation costs incurred by them in 1999-2000; and if he will make a statement.  [97208]<P>

<a name="91102w04.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 On 16 July I invited authorities that reorganised on 1 April 1997 and 1 April 1998 to submit estimates of the amount of expenditure they expect to incur on transitional costs of reorganisation in 1999-2000. On the basis of the information provided by authorities, I have decided the revised maximum amounts that it would be appropriate to allocate towards such costs in 1999-2000.

<P>
<a name="91102w04.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 October 1999]:</i> The MOD has a number of surveillance sensors that can be mounted on low-flying aircraft. These are designated to provide intelligence information on surface features and activities. They would, in some circumstances, be capable of detecting recently disturbed earth but they could not directly detect the likely presence of buried remains, arms of munitions. There is, however, ongoing research both in the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency and in the private sector into the development of ground penetrating radar for airborne applications.

 No assessment has been conducted into the practicality of integrating the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) into Type 22 Batch 2 frigates. The timescale of the PAAMS procurement programme means that it could not be ready for service on a type 22 (or any other vessel) before the Type 45's entry into service.

 An assessment was made of both the French SYLVER Vertical Launch System (VLS) and the Lockheed Martin Mk41 (Tactical length) VLS for the Principal Anti-Air Missile System (PAAMS) requirement. The French SYLVER was competitively selected, in preference to the Lockheed Martin Mk41. While the assessment concluded that both options would meet the PAAMS requirement and technically could be incorporated into the Type 45, the PAAMS package which offered the SYLVER launcher was chosen on the grounds of overall affordability and value for money.

 Divorce is considered to be a personal and private issue between the individuals concerned. It is not considered appropriate, therefore, that such costs should be borne by the public purse. However, Armed Forces personnel serving in Northern Ireland or overseas can obtain free legal advice on procedure from the Army Legal Service. Similarly, their spouses can receive free advice from the RAF Legal Service.

 The new ILO Convention 182 explicitly mentions the "forced or compulsory recruitment of children for use in armed conflict" at Article 3(a). Article 3(d) therefore has no application to military service in the UK. The recruitment practices referred to in ILO Convention 182 are an unacceptable form of child labour. The recruitment of genuine volunteers, as for example undertaken in the UK, is entirely different from the abusive, exploitative, forced or coercive involvement of children in armed conflict as members of militia or para-military forces around the world.

 The Government inherited a shortfall in Army manpower, and recognise that improved retention is key to realising the goal to full manning. In line with

<P><I>2 Nov 1999 : Column: 99</I><P>
the targets set in the SDR, they are committed to achieving that improvement and a number of initiatives are underway.
<P>

<a name="91102w07.htm_para0">In recognition of the increasingly expeditionary nature of our tasks the operational welfare package has been improved and the Service Families Task Force is addressing a variety of issues which create domestic difficulties for our personnel. The Army's Human Resources Strategy includes a six-month review of the effectiveness of present Army retention policies. This work, which is being conducted by external consultants will listen to a wide range of opinions and make recommendations for improvements in the Army's personnel management policies.
<P>

<a name="91102w07.htm_para1">We are also keeping operational commitments under close review. Our determination to ease the burden on the Army is demonstrated by the significant reduction in force levels in Bosnia announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 26 October 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>768</i>.
<P>

<a name="91102w07.htm_para2">In addition we have considered whether the minimum commitment for soldiers of only three years provides the best return for the Army and the best opportunities for the individual. We have concluded that it should be raised to four years. This will make a significant contribution to the Army's ability to fulfil its obligations and liabilities as set out in the SDR manning target. It will also allow more time for the individual to benefit from the excellent training and development opportunities in the Army, including the acquisition of new skills and recognised civilian and professional qualifications.

215 Iraqi aircraft have violated the No-fly Zones, and there have been over 500 other direct threats against our aircrew, including missile attacks and heavy anti-aircraft fire.

<P>
<a name="91102w08.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We do not set a specific amount aside for residential and nursing care for the elderly. This is for health authorities and local authorities to decide upon, from within their overall budgets. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced the total amount available to the National Health Service and to local authorities for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 in July 1998 when he published the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review. Copies are available in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to include <i>(a)</i> professional health groups and <i>(b)</i> pharmacists, radiographers and medical laboratory scientists on the NHS Pay Review Body.  [96275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w08.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 On 15 February 1999, the Health Departments published proposals for modernising the National Health Service pay system in "Agenda for Change." This included the possibility of moving some highly qualified health professionals into the remit of the Nurses, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine Review Body (NPRB).
<P>

<a name="91102w08.htm_para3">Initial discussions with NHS trade unions on pay modernisation were completed successfully on 5 October and resulted in a Joint Framework of Principles and Agreed Statement on the Way Forward which was published on 8 October, copies of which are available in the Library. Paragraph 7.2 of the Joint Framework identifies, as a starting point for more detailed discussions with trade unions, the qualifying criteria for groups of staff to come within the scope of the NPRB.
<P>

<a name="91102w08.htm_para4">The criteria are

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Professions with a minimum entry requirement of three years' educational study (or equivalent) to diploma level or higher, in a health specific area (other than medicine or dentistry) and which are state registered and have a substantial majority of members employed in healthcare."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="91102w08.htm_para6">Exceptions might be agreed for staff groups which meet the majority but not all of these conditions.
<P>

<a name="91102w08.htm_para7">Staff groups which support professions added to the NPRB remit, and who have a direct connection with the transferred groups similar to that between nursing auxiliaries and registered nurses would also need to be considered for transfer.
<P>

<a name="91102w08.htm_para8">No change will take place until all aspects of the new pay system are agreed. The joint target for agreement is summer 2000.
<P>

<a name="91102w08.htm_para9">Radiographers are already covered by the NPRB.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the differences between his policies in relation to the removal of assisted nutrition and hydration from <i>(a)</i> patients in persistent vegetative state and <i>(b)</i> other mentally incapacitated patients; what plans he has for changes to the law or practice in relation to such matters; and if he will make a statement.  [96518]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w08.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The removal of artificial nutrition and hydration is in all cases a matter of clinical judgment which is undertaken in accordance with professional advice provided by a responsible and recognised body of medical opinion and the general law. There are no plans to change the law in this respect.

<P>
<a name="91102w08.htm_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will estimate the numbers of mentally incapable adults in <i>(a)</i> Scotland and <i>(b)</i> the rest of the United Kingdom in each of the last three years whose death could have been brought about by the removal of artificial nutrition and hydration if such removal were legally sanctioned (i) without recourse to the courts for such patients not in persistent vegetative state and 



<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 1999 : Column: 104</I><P>
(ii) through recourse to the courts for such patients in persistent vegetative state; and if he will estimate how many and what percentage of those patients in each year would (1) have issued an advance directive requesting such a recourse of action and (2) have such nutrition and hydration removed without their own express request.  [96521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w08.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The information requested is not available centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the basis is for the distinction he makes between advance directives and advance refusals in respect of patients in persistent vegetative state or otherwise mentally incapacitated.  [96522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w08.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Advance Statements are anticipatory decisions made while a person is capable, which are intended to give effect to that person's wishes as to how he or she shall be treated or cared for after the loss of capacity. An advance statement can be concerned with the refusal of medical treatment and are then sometimes known as advance directives.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w08.htm_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to introduce legislation defining assisted food and fluid as treatment which may be withdrawn from patients with mental incapacities other than persistent vegetative state; and if he will make a statement.  [96519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w08.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have indicated that we intend to introduce a provision on Continuing Powers of Attorney (CPA) when parliamentary time allows such legislative changes.
<P>

<a name="91102w08.htm_para10">It is a general principle of law and medical practice that all adults have the right to consent to or refuse medical treatment. The CPA is a method by which adults can continue to ensure that their views are respected in decisions concerning their welfare when they can no longer take, or communicate, those decisions themselves. A CPA therefore would allow an attorney to make decisions on behalf of the person without capacity about the withdrawal of artificial nutrition and hydration but only if the person has specifically given authority to do this in the CPA. Where decisions need to be taken in such cases, the healthcare team and attorney should do so in the best interests of the individual concerned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w08.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Events to mark the 50th anniversary of the National Health Service were organised in accordance with the principles that activities should promote the core aims of the service and that money should not be diverted from patient care.
<P>

<a name="91102w08.htm_para11">Commemorative coins marking the anniversary were produced by the Royal Mint and involved no cost on the part of the Department.
<P>

<a name="91102w08.htm_para12">Central support for the NHS' special activities during its anniversary year were met within the Department's publicity and communications budget. The total for activity was &#163;1,673,000, spread across the financial years 1997-98 and 1998-99. This was offset by sponsorship support to the value of around &#163;1 million.

<a name="91102w08.htm_para13">The leaving arrangements for Mr. Uren, including his termination payment, were given independent approval by the District Auditor whose role is to ensure absolute propriety in such matters.

 The Government recognise the immense contribution that refugees have made to our culture and society.

<a name="91102w09.htm_spnew11"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The White Paper "Fairer, Faster and Firmer--a modern approach to immigration and asylum" set out our proposals to deliver a more effective asylum system, including deciding asylum applications within an average of two months and determining asylum appeals within an average of four months.

 The support arrangements in Part VI of the Immigration and Asylum Bill will be administered from within the Immigration and Nationality Directorate of the Home Office.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w09.htm_spnew14"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 When the new support arrangements take effect in April 2000, the first priority will be to deal with those claiming asylum and support after 1 April 2000. It is likely that those who are in receipt of social security benefits will remain on those benefits until they get a first negative decision. In the event that this is a refusal and the asylum seekers go on to appeal, they would need to transfer to the new support arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w10.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 &#163;34 million of Home Office funding has been invested in Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) in England and Wales over the last three years under the CCTV Challenge competition of the previous Administration. This Government plan to invest a further &#163;153 million over the next three years under the Crime Reduction Programme CCTV Initiative.
<P>

<a name="91102w10.htm_para0">Almost 750 applications for England and Wales were received under the first round of the Initiative, and crime reduction partnerships have been invited to prepare final proposals on 376 bids for new and extended CCTV schemes, mainly directed at tackling vehicle crime and crime problems in housing areas, at a potential capital cost of &#163;68 million. Partnerships and the private sector are contributing a further &#163;15 million. The earlier CCTV Challenge competition attracted &#163;51 million in funding from other sources.
<P>

<a name="91102w10.htm_para1">Over 580 CCTV systems have been established with assistance from Home Office funds, involving the installation of 5,802 cameras. The shortlisted schemes in the first round of the current initiative provide for a further 



<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 1999 : Column: 112</I><P>
3,879 cameras, including the upgrade and replacement of existing systems. Information on the number of police, public sector and private operators of CCTV systems currently in operation, and the number of cameras in use, is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="91102w10.htm_para2">We are concerned to ensure that CCTV is used effectively to achieve the maximum impact on crime and the fear of crime. Police operational experience and a number of research studies show that CCTV has considerable crime reduction and detection potential, particularly when used as part of a wider strategy. As with any crime reduction measure, there is a possibility of some displacement, but this is by no means inevitable. Schemes funded under the current initiative will be evaluated to build up the knowledge base of what works best in what context, as recommended in the Scottish Office report, "The Effect of CCTV on Recorded Crime Rates and Public Concern about Crime in Glasgow".
<P>

<a name="91102w10.htm_para3">To retain public confidence, CCTV must be used fairly and lawfully. All schemes funded by the Home Office are required to comply with codes of practice governing their control and operation. The requirements include the need to ensure that cameras are visible to the public and that attention is drawn to them by appropriate signage; and that the recorded material is properly safeguarded and controlled. CCTV systems are also required to meet the requirements of data protection legislation, and the Data Protection Act 1998 provides for the first time a framework for the statutory regulation of schemes. Controllers will be required to notify details of their processing of personal data to the Data Protection Commissioner and comply with a set of enforceable principles of good data handling practice. Our aim is to bring the Act into force on 1 March 2000.
<P>

<a name="91102w10.htm_para4">Proposals in our recent White Paper on the regulation of the private security industry, currently under consideration, would require operatives and employees involved in installing and monitoring CCTV systems, and managers and directors of companies, to be licensed.
<P>

<a name="91102w10.htm_para5">Images derived from CCTV systems are not routinely matched against digitised images used on passports and driving licences. I understand that in one London Borough CCTV images are scanned against digitised police photographs in order to help trace the movement of known offenders.
<P>

 Home Office guidance to chief officers covers a wide range of subjects. There is no single list of all the guidance which has been given, although the Home Office library does maintain a list of Home Office Circulars to chief officers. The list covers a good deal of the guidance which has been issued since 1969. The Home Office "Guidance to Chief Officers on Police Complaints and Discipline Procedures" was last amended in 1990 and placed in the Library in 1991. This guidance has now been largely replaced by the "Guidance on Police Unsatisfactory Performance, Complaints and Misconduct Procedures", which relates to the new procedures relating to police conduct introduced on 1 April 1999. This new guidance has also been placed in the Library. It is due to be revised shortly by the addition of a section dealing with senior officer conduct. The revised version will be placed in the Library, and published on the internet, along with any subsequent revisions.

 The needs of police forces with sparsely populated areas are already taken into account in the current police funding formula. The findings of a research study on policing areas of rural sparsity were considered by a Home Office chaired working group, which included representatives of police forces and police authorities. There was no single view within the working group on the conclusions of the research report. There was general agreement that a sparsity factor had been detected, but less agreement about how to include it appropriately in the police funding formula.
<P>

<a name="91102w12.htm_para0">I understand the wishes of rural police forces to see the research findings implemented. Before doing so the Government will need to be satisfied that the research has provided a final answer to this question, which is beyond dispute or challenge.
<P>

<a name="91102w12.htm_para1">For 2000-01, we propose to set considerable store by stability in the grant system to help police authorities plan ahead. In the July 1998 White Paper, "Modern Local Government--In Touch with the People", my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister said we would not expect to make fresh changes to the method of calculation of Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs). This includes police SSAs, as a common formula is used for distribution of police grant and SSA.
<P>

<a name="91102w12.htm_para2">Our present intention is that, subject to consultation and to approval by the House, we shall not make any changes to the method of police grant distribution, or revenue support grant distribution, generally for 2000-01. There will, therefore, be no substantive changes to the operation of the police funding formula for next year.

<a name="91102w12.htm_para3">We shall need to make some limited adjustments to accommodate changes arising from the alterations to the boundary of the Metropolitan Police area and the Essex, Hertfordshire and Surrey Police areas.

 United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244, which established the international presences in Kosovo, gives the NATO-led international military presence in Kosovo, KFOR, responsibility for conducting border monitoring duties as required. Assuring the security of Kosovo's border with Albania and Macedonia is also a task for the United Nations interim administration in Kosovo (UNMIK), which has general responsibility for maintaining civil law and order.
<P>

<a name="91102w12.htm_para4">Both KFOR and UNMIK recognise the importance of ensuring adequate control of Kosovo's borders. KFOR will continue to give border monitoring a high priority while the UN mission builds up the international police force in Kosovo, part of whose functions include border duties. UNMIK has also set up a customs service operating at border crossings. Negotiations are under way with the Macedonian Government to improve the efficiency of the major crossing point on the Kosovo/ Macedonia border.

 Our current estimate remains that at least 10,000 civilians were killed in Kosovo as a result of war crimes by the Serbs between June 1998 and June 1999. We do not have disaggregated figures for those killed during Operation Allied Force.

 Currently around 1,750 international police officers from 25 countries are deployed to Kosovo. The full contingent of officers originally required should be in place by the end of November.

<a name="91102w12.htm_spnew14"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Kosovo Transitional Council (KTC) was established by the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative in Kosovo as an inclusive, consultative body bringing together all major political parties and ethnic groups in Kosovo. Its members include two each from the three major Kosovo Albanian political groupings, two Kosovo Albanian independents, two Kosovo Serbs and two members representing Kosovo's other ethnic minorities.
<P>

<a name="91102w12.htm_para5">The Council has met sporadically since its inaugural meeting on 16 July. We are aware of six further meetings. Attendance has varied, depending on reactions by the various groupings to the situation on the ground or political developments at the time.

Ethnic violence is still a problem, but KFOR and the United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) are putting as many resources as possible into tackling this issue. The number of Serbs and other ethnic minorities leaving the province has fallen. Some are returning.
<P>

<a name="91102w12.htm_para9">Efforts are underway to control the borders more effectively for the purposes of security and revenue collection. A new customs service has been established and police are now posted at border crossings.

Water and power supplies are being rehabilitated--two out of the four electricity generating stations are now operational and health care facilities are vastly improved.

<P>

 Lead responsibility for formulating the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's advice to the Department of Trade and Industry on individual export licence applications generally rests with the relevant geographical departments, in consultation with the Non-Proliferation Department and other functional departments as appropriate, in particular the Human Rights Policy Department and the United Nations Department. In some cases geographical departments may also consult overseas posts, for example to seek more information on proposed end-uses or end-users.

<a name="91102w14.htm_para0">Against this background, it is not possible to give a precise figure for the number of officials involved. But a significant proportion of officials in geographical departments and in the relevant sections of the above-named functional departments have some degree of involvement in examining export licence applications. Nearly all such officials have other responsibilities which they fulfil alongside their role in export licence processing.

<a name="91102w17.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The Government are committed to ensuring that their policies are fair and inclusive, and focus on public service users, not providers. This aim is contained in guidance (published in 1998) which helps Departments consider the impact of their policies by gender, ethnicity and disability. In addition to considering impact, the guidance encourages consultation with women's groups and others where appropriate and action to deal with any differential impact if this appears appropriate. My Department applies the principles set out in the guidance in developing its policies. For example, a gender impact assessment was included in the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Employment Relations Bill. We are also making increasing use of consultation, research projects and disaggregated statistics to identify the likely impact of policy.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 1999]:</i> In the Comprehensive Spending Review the Medical Research Council was allocated &#163;12 million to develop collections of donated human tissue and biological samples for use in research. The approach is designed to take account of anticipated rapid developments in genetic technologies and the benefits that might ensue from the completion of the human genome project in 2003. The MRC is currently working with the Wellcome Trust, other charities, and industry to consider all the implications of these developments.

 The national minimum wage is in force and it must be paid by all employers. There is no hiding place for employers who act unlawfully and fail to pay it. I particularly welcome the recent employment tribunal decision, where a worker in a Bognor Regis sports shop became the first person to benefit from the enforcement officers' powers; that is, to take an employer to an employment tribunal and force them to pay the underpaid worker all the money that is owed them.
<P>

<a name="91102w17.htm_para3">This power is over and above the powers of officers to issue enforcement and penalty notices against employers. Ten enforcement notices were issued in September, and &#163;67,000 of back pay obtained for workers.

 <i>[holding answer 1 November 1999]:</i> Any estimate of the impact of the levy will depend on the final rates of tax which will be set by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>

<a name="91102w18.htm_para0">However, the Government have promised that there will be significantly lower rates of the levy for those energy intensive sectors, covered by the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, which are prepared to enter negotiated agreements with the Government to deliver energy efficiency improvement and/or emissions reductions targets. To this end, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions is leading discussions with a number of energy intensive sectors.

 The current International Olympic Committee requirements for staging an Olympic Games are for 75,000 seats for the opening and closing ceremonies. The British Olympic Association (BOA) has indicated that a capacity of 80,000 should be provided for an Olympic bid to be credible. The design of the national stadium chosen by Wembley National Stadium Limited (WNSL) envisages special conversion of the stadium for staging athletics events and can provide 80,000 seats in athletics mode. WNSL have recently refined their detailed proposals for the stadium in athletics mode and I have asked Sport England and UK Sport to commission further detailed technical assessments of these latest proposals.

 My hon. Friend the Minister for the Arts and I have already made a number of official visits to Cornwall this year. These have included official visits to Falmouth, Newquay, Penzance, Newlyn and St. Ives. Ministers' diaries for the next 12 months have yet to be finalised.

In addition, the event generated an extra &#163;51 million of visitor expenditure within the county.

 The West Country Tourist Board, which covers Cornwall, is receiving &#163;497,000 from the English Tourism Council this year for projects which contribute to the national tourism strategy. Cornwall, in common with parts of England, also benefits from the work of the British Tourist Authority (BTA) which promotes Britain as a visitor destination in overseas markets. The BTA is receiving &#163;36 million from my Department this year.
<P>

<a name="91102w19.htm_para1">The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy estimates that local authority expenditure on tourism promotion in Cornwall in 1997-98 was &#163;1.954 million. In addition, the European Regional Development Fund and local partners have funded the West Cornwall Leader Project, which aims to assist sectors of the West Cornwall economy, including tourism and Prosper, the Training and Enterprise Council for Devon and Cornwall which provides information, advice and training services to small businesses in the region.
<P>

<a name="91102w19.htm_para2">In addition, tourism in Cornwall has also benefited, both directly and indirectly, from the National Lottery (projects in the county have received awards totalling &#163;84.1 million according to DCMS's National Lottery Awards Database) and from other funding from the European Regional Development Fund. Tourism in Cornwall will benefit further from January next year, having been granted European Union Objective 1 status.

<a name="91102w19.htm_spnew12"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 A 1997 study by the UK, English and Scottish Sports Councils examined the economic impact of six major sporting events throughout the UK. It concluded that much of the additional expenditure earned by these events was contributed by tourists, in addition to the expenditure by competitors and officials themselves.
<P>

<a name="91102w19.htm_para3">The Government's tourism strategy, "Tomorrow's Tourism", pointed to the boost given by Euro '96 to UK tourism and underlined our commitment to bringing major international sporting events to this country. That is why I have agreed with my hon. Friend the Minister for Sport that the British Tourist Authority will produce a sports tourism strategy by the end of this year to complement the Government's forthcoming sports strategy and to help to maximise the tourism benefits accruing from major sporting events in the UK.

 The proposal in Com (99) 382 on closer dialogue with the fishing industry concerns financial matters arising from the European Commission's reorganisation of its Advisory Committee on Fisheries (ACF) so as to focus on communication and consultation with EC-level rather than national organisations. It will be for the European organisations represented on the ACF to consult as they consider necessary with national organisations in individual member states. Representations on the ACF cover fishermen, fish farmers, processors and wholesalers, trade unions, and consumer, environment and development non-governmental organisations.

 The latest available information published by the Commission was in its Annual Report to the Council and to the European Parliament on the results of the multi annual guidance programmes for the fishing fleet at the end of 1997. A copy is in the Library (ref. COM 175/1999). This showed that two countries (France and Netherlands) had failed to meet the objectives of the MAGP III by the end of 1997 and were not on target to meet their objectives for MAGP IV. The report also noted that the status for Italy could not be determined because of a major revision of their fleet register.

 <i>[holding answer 28 October 1999]:</i> Set-aside payments under the Arable Area Payments Scheme are made in respect of claims which may include one or more individual farms. Records therefore relate to claims paid rather than numbers of farms. The following is the information requested in respect of the set-aside element of each claim paid by MAFF in 1995-98 (with figures given on a cumulative basis--ie lines <i>(b)</i> to <i>(d)</i> are included in <i>(a)</i> etc.):

 The Government are seeking to assist UK agriculture to be more competitive in Europe on several fronts.
<P>

<a name="91102w24.htm_para3">The foundation of a competitive industry must be the macro-economic stability which the Government have achieved and which brings low levels of inflation and interest rates. We have built on this foundation by investing in research and development, pursuing the Government's policy of training, education and lifelong learning, establishing the Food Chain Group earlier this year whose aim is to bring the food chain close together, launching a joint campaign (with the National Farmers' Union (NFU)) to encourage more collaborative marketing, and launching a further joint initiative with the NFU to review regulatory burdens on the industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91102w24.htm_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 I am replying as the responsible Minister. The compliance of local authority systems has been independently assessed by the Audit Commission, with Government Offices in the Regions acting as responsible bodies. This took place as part of Action 2000's National Infrastructure Forum programme of independent assessment, reported on 21 October, when all but a very few UK infrastructure organisations were rated "blue", which means there is no identified risk of material disruption. All sectors are expected to be "blue" by mid November.
<P>

<a name="91102w24.htm_para5">I have placed a copy of the report of the Forum, which contains a full account of the assessment process for all these sectors, in the Libraries of the House. Local authorities in England were rated "blue" in this report, which means that as well as having completed their compliance programme, they also have business continuity plans to deal with any unexpected events. Under this assessment, payment of housing benefit should not be at risk.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The Court of Auditors uses ecu figures, the unit of account for the EC Budget.<P>

2. Gross contribution figures are after account has been taken of the UK's abatement (including corrections in respect of earlier years) and for adjustments to VAT and GNP-based contributions in respect of earlier years.<P>

3. Receipts figures include European Commission payments made direct to the member state's private sector.<P>

4. The Court of Auditors Report does not allocate all Community spending to the member states so that the receipts figures in the table may not represent the full amount of expenditure by the Commission in each member state. Consequently the figures for net contributions/net benefits in the table are likely only to be indicative of the amount of member states' net positions. For example, if all administrative expenditure were allocated to the country in which it is paid, the net position of Belgium and Luxembourg would be substantially improved.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 1 November 1999]:</i> The Millennium Gift Aid scheme was introduced in 1998 specifically to provide tax relief for donations to UK charities for educational and anti-poverty projects in the world's poorest countries. In April 1999, the scheme was extended to help refugees from Kosovo, but the Government has no plans to extend the scheme further. Some of the street children will be in countries eligible for MGA relief. UK charities working in other countries can benefit from other tax reliefs available for charitable giving, such as the Gift Aid scheme.

 Since the beginning of 1995, the international community has provided the following loan finance (net of repayments over the period) through the International Financial Institutions (IFIs): &#163;8.8 billion through the IMF, &#163;4.0 billion through the World Bank, and &#163;728 million through the EBRD; the IFIs have also provided technical assistance. In August, the Paris Club rescheduled $8.1 billion of Russia's Soviet-era debts. The EU has also provided technical assistance to Russia through its TACIS programme, and food aid.

<a name="91102w26.htm_para0">The UK has made no direct loans to Russia. Since the beginning of 1995, the UK has made &#163;592 million of export credit guarantees available to British firms doing business with Russia, on which Russia is current with repayments. The UK has made technical assistance and humanitarian aid available to Russia. Other countries have also provided bilateral assistance.

<a name="91102w26.htm_para1">There is no evidence that any IMF or World Bank funds have been misappropriated. An investigation by PricewaterhouseCoopers discovered that an overseas subsidiary of the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) had used some of its foreign reserves to guarantee loans to commercial banks and buy Russian Government debt in breach of IMF rules and without the IMF's knowledge. Given this misuse of IMF resources, and the seriousness

IMF financing will be disbursed into an SDR account for the purpose of repaying Russia's obligations to the Fund. Furthermore, we agreed that the CBR, prior to disbursement of the next tranche of the SBA, should take steps identified by the IMF to improve internal controls and to initiate quarterly audits of CBR reserve management . . . In the case of the World Bank, we welcomed the new safeguards, involving greater control and auditing of World Bank funds, introduced in June, and called on the World Bank to work with Russia on additional safeguards . . ."

<a name="91102w26.htm_para3">There is no evidence the EBRD funds were used for a purpose other than that intended at the time of disbursement. A portfolio review conducted by the EBRD, and further investigations carried out by its External Auditor, have satisfied the Bank that disbursements were applied as intended. One case of contract failure involving UK export credit guarantees is being investigated, on which I cannot comment at this stage.

The funds concerned are predominantly used to pay EU firms to provide technical expertise and advice for Russia. Only a very small proportion of the funds therefore goes to Russia . . . the Community food supply programme for Russia, that was launched earlier this year, is subject to very close monitoring which involves, amongst other things, checks on the use of the funds generated from the sale of relevant food products on local markets. Moreover, Russia does not currently receive Community loans, and the lending mandate of the European Investment Bank for countries outside the EU does not extend to Russia . . .<i>"</i>

<P>
<a name="91102w26.htm_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The London Stock Exchange, as Competent Authority, has in the last two years reviewed the statutory requirements to report provisions and disclose contingent liabilities and the accounting rules for disclosure of environmental risks. These do require companies to address, among other things, their environmental liabilities. But, in the absence of clear, recognised disclosure standards, it has not been considered appropriate to introduce a listing rule specifically covering environmental risks. The Financial Services Authority may wish to consider the position afresh when it becomes the Competent Authority, but this will be for the Financial Services Authority to decide.

<P>
<a name="91102w26.htm_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The tax changes brought in by the new Construction Industry Scheme do not affect whether a person is employed or self-employed within the industry. Both the old and the new scheme work in a broadly similar way. Where a contractor makes payments relating to construction operations to a self-employed worker, they must operate the scheme. This means that they must make deductions on account of tax and NICs when making payments to subcontractors who do not qualify under the rules to be paid gross. The changes to the scheme are to control tax evasion.
