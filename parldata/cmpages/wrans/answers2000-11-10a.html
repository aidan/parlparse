<a name="01110w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. William Ross: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he has taken to carry out an epidemiological study to determine the effect of organophosphorus sheep dips on <i>(a)</i> those persons who have been in contact with them when engaged in (i) dipping sheep and (ii) handling sheep dipped with such dips, <i>(b)</i> sheep dipped with such dips and <i>(c)</i> persons handling wool from such sheep; and how much his Department has spent in the last five years on such studies.

<a name="01110w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 In October 1995, the Institute of Occupational Health (IOM) in Edinburgh was asked to carry out a three-year epidemiological study into possible ill-health effects in sheep dippers from long-term, low-level exposure to OP sheep dips. This study cost around &#163;500,000 and was jointly funded by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department of Health and the Health and Safety Executive. The IOM published their report in May 1999. The Government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) was also asked in 1998 to consider whether long-term exposure to low levels of OPs causes ill-health effects. Their report was published in November 1999. Copies of both of these reports are available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="01110w01.html_para0">A contract has been awarded to the London School of Tropical Medicine to carry out a study involving individuals who have reported ill-health thought to be due to exposure to OPs to the OP Information Network, the Pesticides Action Network and the Northern Ireland OP Sufferers Association. The approximate cost of the study will be &#163;290,000. The Government are currently in the process of commissioning further research to determine the causes of dippers' flu, whether there is a small group of individuals who are susceptible to OPs, what OP mechanisms of toxicity might be causing ill-health due to low-dose exposure and a review of the scientific literature on the effects of OPs on children.

<P>
<a name="01110w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 A diagnostic test for the acute effects of exposure to organophosphates by testing for inhibition of the enzyme acetyl cholinesterase has been available for many years.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) if he will make a statement on the effect of the recent five tonne limit on bass fishing by pair-trawlers;  [136955]
<P>
<UL>(2) what recent evidence he has received and evaluated regarding bass stocks off the coast of the United Kingdom;  [136956]
<P>
(3) what further representations he has received on restricting the activities of pair-trawlers fishing for bass in European waters.  [136800]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01110w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The licence condition restricting landings of bass introduced from 1 January applied to all UK fishing vessels in 2000 and not just to pair-trawlers. With two months of the year to go, no catches by UK vessels have approached the five tonne limit.
<P>

<a name="01110w01.html_para2">I will be receiving from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science shortly their report on their monitoring of the 1999 and 2000 offshore fisheries. Information on a tagging exercise conducted during the summer in the inshore fishery is also due to be delivered and the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea has recently convened a Study Group to look at the status of North East Atlantic bass stocks. A preliminary report is expected next May.
<P>

<a name="01110w01.html_para3">I have received many letters and other representation from right hon. and hon. Members and their constituents requesting further restrictions or complete closure of the offshore fishery. I will consider what action is necessary in the light of CEFAS' reports and the ICES conclusions.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of Government initiatives in supporting integrated farm management.  [136792]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01110w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Integrated Farm Management (IFM) is an important priority for MAFF. As part of its commitment to developing more sustainable farming methods, the Department has put substantial resources into research and development relating to integrated farming systems, much of which has been in association with industry through LINK (a Government-wide scheme for joint funding R&D with industry to meet industry's needs).
<P>

<a name="01110w01.html_para4">My Department organised a seminar involving a wide range of interested organisations earlier this year to review the research results and to discuss the wider promotion of IFM. It was noted that the research results indicate that it is possible to reduce inputs of agrochemicals while maintaining profitability and that IFM can produce environmental benefits in the longer term such as improvements in bird numbers and biodiversity. As a result 



<P>
<P><I>10 Nov 2000 : Column: 409W</I><P>
an industry-led Working Group was set up to consider the options for future promotional activities. This will report back shortly.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01110w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My Department has received representations on fertiliser prices in the UK from the Fertiliser Manufacturers Association and the National Farmers Union.
<P>

<a name="01110w01.html_para5">My Department has also received representations from a number of interested parties since we announced on 30 March last, as part of the Government's Strategy for Agriculture, an independent review of dispensing of medicines by veterinary surgeons. The Review Group is currently examining the existing dispensing practices for veterinary medicines and their impact on the supply, availability and costs of veterinary medicines. The representations received by my Department have been forwarded to the Chairman of the Review Group for consideration along with all the other evidence it receives. The Review Group will complete its task and make its report by 31 March 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01110w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government response to the report, published on 27 October 1998, set out the reasons why we proposed no fundamental change in the present institutional arrangements for flood and coastal defence. Since then we have, however, worked with the operating authorities--the Environment Agency, internal drainage boards and local authorities--in ensuring the present arrangements work better and best practice is shared. In particular, in November 1999 we published high level targets for the operating authorities to follow and, complementary to this, the Agency has set out how it will apply its general supervisory duty in relation to the work done by the other operating authorities. The Government have also instituted a review of the funding arrangements for the flood and coastal defence which is expected to be completed by September 2001.

It was an oilseed rape modified for fungal tolerance. However, over the previous five years a number of different GM crop plants had been released under the interim arrangements which were in place before the Genetically Modified (Deliberate Release) regulations came into force on 1 February 1993.
<P>

<a name="01110w02.html_para2">The first GM crop to be planted in the United Kingdom under a part C consent was a herbicide tolerant oilseed rape. The consent was issued in February 1996 for seed production purposes only and not for general cultivation. The legislation does not require the location and time of sowing of crops covered by Part C consents to be notified to the authorities and we do not hold this information. However, we do have an assurance from Aventis, who hold this consent, that no plants have been grown in the UK under this consent since 1997.

 The European Community has imposed anti-dumping measures on imports of various types of fertiliser from a number of countries; these currently include provisional duties (lasting six months) on imports of ammonium nitrate from Poland and the Ukraine. The decision on whether to impose provisional measures rests with the European Commission after consulting member states; the decision whether to impose definitive (five-year) measures rests with the Council of Ministers, acting by a simple majority.

<a name="01110w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Office for National Statistics latest estimates of low pay for spring 2000 (combining New Earnings Survey and Labour Force Survey statistics) show that the national minimum wage is having a direct and beneficial impact on the pay of the lowest paid workers in England and Wales. The latest data also show that it has helped close the gap between the highest and lowest earners and helped reduce the differential between men's and women's pay. This has been achieved without any discernable adverse impact on the economy.

 I have given careful consideration to a number of ways in which the recognition of members of the armed forces who give their lives in the service of their country might be enhanced. In the light of discussion, I have concluded that the most appropriate would be the erection in central London of a memorial bearing the names of all those killed on duty and by terrorist attack since the end of the Second World War. In accordance with the long established custom for the erection of memorials, I would expect funds to be raised by public subscription. Further consultation will now take place with ex-Service organisations and other interested bodies.

 On 4 May 1982, during Operation Corporate, the British operation to re-take the Falkland Islands after the Argentine invasion, the Type 42 destroyer HMS Sheffield was attacked by Super Etendard aircraft carrying Exocet anti-ship missiles.
<P>

<a name="01110w02.html_para6">Some 13 minutes before the missile impact on Sheffield, which resulted in the tragic loss of HMS Sheffield and 20 of her crew, HMS Invincible had detected a contact initially at a range of approximately 180 miles from Invincible which would have been consistent with the Argentine aircraft. However, for the previous few days, the force had experienced a high incidence of spurious radar contacts. These contacts were also assessed as spurious. There were at the time no other indications of impending attack.
<P>

<a name="01110w02.html_para7">Some six minutes before the Exocet hit Sheffield, her sister ship Glasgow detected the radar transmissions of the Exocet carrying aircraft--the first certain indication of imminent attack--and alerted the rest of the force to the threat. The process of detection and assessment absorbed little time and Sheffield thus had five minutes warning of the imminent attack.

<a name="01110w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 When KFOR deployed to Kosovo in June 1999, the immediate requirement was to clear ordnance that would have posed a hazard to peacekeeping forces. This was KFOR's responsibility, and British service personnel were engaged in this activity. KFOR also took on the immediate task of making schools safe for the returning population of Kosovo. Two British servicemen tragically lost their lives in performing this vital task.
<P>

<a name="01110w03.html_para0">The United Nations Mine Action Service (MAS) is responsible for the longer term task of fully clearing Kosovo of unexploded ordnance, and has established a UN Mine Action Co-ordination Centre (MACC) in Pristina to this end. The Department for International Development (DfID) has supported the UNMACC with grants, specialist staff and equipment. DfID has also, since June 1999, contracted for five organisations to supply

<P>

<a name="01110w03.html_para2">The UNMACC state that 2,314 areas have been cleared to date, including minefields, bomblet strikes and other dangerous areas and that there are 1,085 sites remaining to be cleared.

 The Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel Argus has been re-deployed from helicopter training duties off the Iberian Peninsular to join the Amphibious Task Group which is providing a presence off Sierra Leone in support of UN and UK forces there this month. The decision to re-deploy RFA Argus, and her three embarked Sea King helicopters, with the Task Group, was taken after the flagship HMS Fearless experienced a fire in her aft engine room which necessitated her withdrawal from the deployment. Her training task will not be affected. Commander Amphibious Task Group continues to lead the Task Group embarked on HMS Ocean.
<P>

<a name="01110w03.html_para3">The integration of RFA Argus into the Task Group will give increased operational flexibility to operations of the Amphibious Ready Group by providing a second helicopter platform from which Chinook and Sea King helicopters can operate to replace the capability lost by the withdrawal of HMS Fearless. The re-deployment of Argus at short notice serves only to reinforce the flexibility of our maritime forces and of our rapid reaction capability.

<a name="01110w03.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Sulphur mustard (mustard gas) remains a significant chemical threat, both on the battlefield and from terrorists. The burns that result from contact with sulphur mustard heal extremely slowly and are prone to potentially life-threatening infection. Initial dermabrasion studies involving the use of hand-held abrasive material showed significantly enhanced rates of burn healing and reduced risk of infection. Later work which resulted in even more accurate removal of dead tissue and further improvements in the rate of healing were achieved by the use of a small (1 cm diameter) rotating disc of abrasive material powered by a hand-held, electric drill.
<P>

<a name="01110w03.html_para4">The technical details of the dermabrasion procedure are discussed in the open literature publication at the following reference:

<a name="01110w03.html_para6">Staff at Porton Down are now confident that dermabrasion will help save lives and reduce the suffering in any future casualties.
<P>

<a name="01110w03.html_para7">Although much of Porton Down's work involves the development and use of models, for these particular studies there are no valid alternatives to the use of anaesthetised pigs if the normal healing process is to be measured accurately.

 Reliable figures are not available for the number of rough sleepers in England prior to 1998. In 1998 a methodology was developed based on a series of single night street counts and estimates by local authorities to enable this information to be collected. It was estimated that as of June 1998 there were 1,850 people sleeping rough in England in any one night. These figures are updated annually and subsequent figures showed that the number of people sleeping rough fell to 1,633 in June 1999 and 1,180 in June 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> Kosovans and <i>(b)</i> Albanians were legally admitted to the United Kingdom in each month in (i) 1997, (ii) 1998, (iii) 1999 and (iv) 2000.  [136935]

 I regret that the available information on passengers given leave to enter the United Kingdom does not separately identify Kosovans (other than the 4,346 Kosovans, including dependants, who were evacuated to the United Kingdom under the Humanitarian Evacuation Programme in 1999). The information that is available for Albania is given in the table.

 Of the 4,346 Kosovan Albanians who were evacuated to the United Kingdom on the Humanitarian Evacuation Programme (HEP) between 25 April and 25 June 1999, 2,396 returned on the Kosovan voluntary assisted programme which ran from 26 July 1999 to 25 June 2000.

 The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) has now been in operation for seven months. Applications for support and therefore dispersals were lower than predicted. We have revised down the number of bed spaces required from 65,000 to 44,000 for this financial year. However, NASS has been able to extend the new support arrangements to all new destitute asylum seekers earlier than anticipated. The scheme has also been extended to those asylum seekers who prior to 3 April were in receipt of social security benefits but who on or after 25 September receive a first negative decision but who continue to be eligible for support. At the outset the accommodation requirements for NASS were supplied by the private sector and one housing association but NASS has now secured contracts with four local authority consortia and negotiations are at an advanced stage with three more. The dispersal process is bedding down as NASS, the Voluntary Sector and the Accommodation Providers settle into their new roles.

These figures include all agency staff and any staff not directly employed by individual trusts and health authorities. It also shows the same information for the London region. Prior to 1994-95 the London region was calculated using the former North East, North West, South East and South West Thames regional totals. Similarly for the years 1994-95 to 1997-98, the North and South Thames regional totals have been used. The information relating to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is a matter for the devolved Administrations.

<a name="01110w07.html_para0">Where National Health Service bodies make arrangements with private sector health care providers for the treatment of NHS patients by those providers, the patients are not transferred to the private health sector.

The NHS simply uses available private sector facilities. The treatment will continue to be NHS treatment and free to the patient. This will remain the case where the NHS makes arrangements with the private sector in accordance with the recently concluded Concordat between the Department and the Independent Healthcare Association.

Non-maintained special schools can bid directly for capital grant, but there are no such schools in Sutton. Until March 1999 grant maintained schools bid to the Funding Agency for Schools (FAS) for capital grants on a rolling programme.

They will also receive their Individual Learning Account within seven days of their completed application form being received at the Individual Learning Centre. 200,000 Individual Learning Accounts have been opened by the Individual Learning Account Centre since June. 80 per cent. of these people were sent applications and their accounts within two days.
<P>

<a name="01110w08.html_para1">As the Individual Learning Account Centre became fully operational at the same time as peak enrolment we have introduced a one-off measure to help people whose account did not arrive before they started their course. These special arrangements have been put in place with learning providers to enable those individuals to benefit from a discount. These arrangements apply to people who started their learning by 6 October.

<P>
<a name="01110w08.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We regard it as valuable that Members of Parliament and local councillors take an interest in education and look for opportunities to visit schools and meet pupils. From 2002 Citizenship will become a statutory subject in secondary schools, and this will require all pupils to be taught about parliamentary government and the democratic process. Open and informed debate about current issues is, of course, vital for a healthy democracy.
<P>

<a name="01110w08.html_para3">There are, however, legal safeguards in place to protect against attempts at political indoctrination. Section 407 of the Education Act 1996 requires teachers to take all reasonably practical steps to ensure that, where political or controversial issues are brought to pupils' attention, they are offered a balanced presentation of opposing views.

 The Zacchaeus Centre has been assessed by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Schools as a unique and successful provision for Key Stage 3 pupils at risk of exclusion from the 10 Roman Catholic secondary schools in Birmingham. The Centre does not cater for permanently excluded pupils. Rates of re-integration are high. That is why we included the Centre as an example of good practice in Circular 10/99 "Social Inclusions: Pupil Support". Unlike the previous Government, we have been supporting the Centre through the Standards Fund: &#163;53,600 in 1998-99 and &#163;94,000 in 1999-2000. The Centre is receiving a similar amount this year and will do so in 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="01110w08.html_para5">Our support for the Zacchaeus Centre complements the increased provision we are making for both in and out of school support. We are making resources available to establish over 1,000 on-site Learning Support Units by 2002. These take disruptive pupils out of the classroom quickly and ensure that they start to behave better. Where an exclusion is necessary, provision for excluded pupils is being greatly increased. There are 1,000 more places and 250 more teachers in Pupil Referral Units than in

I am holding back &#163;3 million of capital funding in 2002-03 and &#163;4 million in 2003-04 from which I shall invite bids for improvement projects and I am also holding back &#163;4 million of revenue funding in 2002-03 and &#163;10 million in 2003-04 to meet particular requirements as they arise.
<P>

<a name="01110w10.html_para8">The allocations made for 2001-02 to 2003-04 are set out in the table for comparison with the allocations for 1998-99 to 2000-01 and show the significant increase achieved. The table does not include the funding for work in the regions which I announced in the House on 25 July 2000.

 The Quality, Efficiency and Standards Team (QUEST) published the first phase of its review of Lottery application processes on 3 August. The report focuses on applications for grants of up to &#163;100,000 and includes recommendations for improving application and assessment procedures in order to ease the administrative burden for small organisations applying for grants. Copies of the report are available in the Library of the House. QUEST will shortly begin the second phase of its work, which will investigate the costs inherent in the application process for larger grants, both to applicants and Lottery distributors.

<a name="01110w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 No Exchequer funding has been committed to the development of the National Athletics Stadium at Picketts Lock. The English Sports Council have so far far made a grant of &#163;240,000 from the Sports Lottery Fund towards initial feasibility studies. On 6 November, the English Sports Council agreed to provide a further grant of &#163;1.3 million towards the costs of design, site investigation, and cost planning.

<P>
<a name="01110w11.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what recommendations the Better Regulation Task Force made in respect of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000.  [136448]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01110w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 The independent Better Regulation Task Force supported the overall aim of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000 to legislate to combat serious crime conducted on the internet. It was concerned that, like all other new Government regulation, it should meet the five principles of good regulation: transparency; accountability; consistency; proportionality; and targeting. The Bill was amended considerably during its passage and the Task Force's concerns were broadly met. The Task Force nevertheless hopes that the Home Office will review the effectiveness of the Act in time, taking account of its impact on UK e-businesses.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01110w11.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what estimate she has made of the amount the Better Regulation Task Force has saved business; and if she will make a statement.  [136449]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01110w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 The independent Better Regulation Task Force is an advisory body and can not itself directly reduce costs on business. It works by making recommendations, including to Government. To date, the majority have been accepted. Since its creation in 1997, the Task Force has influenced many changes in the regulatory environment. For example, all new regulation must be checked against the principles of good regulation developed by the Task Force.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01110w11.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if she will make a statement in respect of the administrative and running costs of the Better Regulations Task Force, including the autumn 2000 Task Force review.  [136606]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01110w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 The administrative and running costs of the independent Better Regulation Task Force for the six months of the financial year 2000-01 to September 2000 have totalled &#163;191,581. The printing costs of the Better Regulation Task Force's Annual Report 1999-2000, which was published in October 2000, were &#163;6,815.
