 The new rules for the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme 2011-12 were announced in March 2011. Under the new scheme, the available budget will be divided into quarterly budgets and then shared pro-rata between all claims received. Obviously we hope that the budget will cover the full rate of VAT for all claimants but, if it doesn't, an apportionment will be made and this will be announced on the Listed Places of Worship website. The first payments in this financial year are due to be made at the end of the second quarter.</p>

I will not be in a position to confirm whether claims can be paid in full until all claims for the first quarter of the year have been submitted and processed. The rate of payment will be published on the Listed Places of Worship website once this process is complete.</p>

 Open data can be transformative for public services, practitioners and users. We have already seen this in the health context where death rates in coronary artery surgery, for example, have fallen as a result of public reporting of outcomes. We have committed to release a wealth of new data on other public services which we hope will increase accountability and performance.</p>

 Responsibility for the regulations governing the licensing of charitable collections rests with the Cabinet Office. The Charities Act 2006 licensing provisions have not been implemented and will be considered as part of the review of the Charities Act 2006, due to begin later this year. Once the review has made its recommendations I will discuss them with ministerial colleagues. We want to make it easier for legitimate charities to fundraise responsibly, whilst deterring bogus collectors and preventing nuisance for members of the public. Local authorities, trading standards, and the police already have a range of powers to tackle bogus or unlicensed collections and nuisance.</p>

 To support the Government's mandate to centralise the procurement of common goods and services, the Efficiency and Reform Group in the Cabinet Office undertook an analysis of procurement spend for the 2009-10 financial year. It reviewed spend for specific procurement categories across central Government departments, in order to determine if it could be centralised. We will continue to review spend by Departments in categories that are centralised, in order to ensure the optimum supply strategy is in place for central Government.</p>

 On 1 November 2010 the Government reiterated their policy of paying 80% of undisputed invoices within five days and ensuring that prime contractors paid tier two suppliers within 30 days through use of a contract condition. On 19 July I made further announcements to improve payment performance. These included a requirement for Departments to actively contract manage the performance of prime contractors, the Crown Representatives encouraging key suppliers to pay more quickly than in 30 days and encouraging suppliers to report issues of late payment to Cabinet Office's Mystery Shopper service. Departments are not required to publish payment data on a central repository, though some Departments choose to publish performance on departmental websites.</p>
