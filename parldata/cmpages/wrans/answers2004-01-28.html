<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many reports of evidence of overseas bribery or suspected bribery by a UK company have been passed to the Inland Revenue's Special Compliance Officer by Inland Revenue staff since November 1997; and how many of these reports were passed on by Inland Revenue to the <i>(a)</i> prosecution and <i>(b)</i> law enforcement agencies.  [151442]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Section 19 of the Anti-Terrorism (Crime and Security) Act 2001 provides a gateway for the Revenue to pass information about a possible criminal offence of bribery to other agencies where the evidence warrants such a disclosure. No such gateway existed before.
<P>

<a name="40128w01.html_para0">The Inland Revenue does not keep central records of cases referred to other agencies, but does not believe that the section 19 gateway has been used to date to refer a case of suspected bribery.

<a name="40128w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Currency Speculation</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the implications of taxing currency speculation.  [150783]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w01.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government remain to be convinced that a tax on currency speculation would be particularly effective in stabilising international capital flows. Indeed, a report by the European Commission&#151;"Responses to the Challenges of Globalisation", February 2002&#151;concludes that a currency transaction tax may actually increase volatility, since trading volumes would be likely to fall significantly following its introduction.
<P>

<a name="40128w01.html_para1">There are also a number of practical issues concerning the coverage and enforcement of a currency speculation tax that would need to be resolved before, as is often suggested, it could become a feasible source of development finance. In particular, the Government are concerned that it would be almost impossible to achieve global coverage for such a tax, creating huge scope for evasion. Even if we could secure agreement among the 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2004 : Column 354W</I><P>
G7, without global application speculative foreign exchange transactions would gravitate to those jurisdictions which did not enforce the tax. This would make poorly regulated offshore financial centres more attractive to speculators, increasing the threat of instability in the financial system.
<P>

<a name="40128w01.html_para2">The Government are open to exploring the full range of options for raising finance for development and the Chancellor has proposed the International Finance Facility, a new mechanism which would raise significant additional resources. The Facility would be built on developed countries' long-term commitments to increased aid flows and, on this basis, would leverage additional resources from international capital markets. The Facility would seek to double aid from US$ 50 billion a year today to $100 billion a year in the years up to 2015&#151;the sum needed to meet the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many staff will be employed in each of the two new tax credit contact centres; where they will be located; and when they will become operational.  [147655]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 January 2004]:</i> The two new Tax Credit Contact Centres&#151;in Newcastle upon Tyne and Bathgate (West Lothian)&#151;will each employ the equivalent of 500 new full time staff dedicated to answering tax credits calls. The Bathgate Contact Centre will, in addition, house the equivalent of a further 300 existing full time staff.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 No, the habitual residence test does not apply to tax credits just as it has never applied to Child Benefit. However, to qualify for tax credits, a person must be both present and ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many times staff at the Inland Revenue have denied tax deductibility on payments, under section 577A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988, on the basis that the payment was <i>(a)</i> a suspected bribe and <i>(b)</i> business entertainment on an overseas contract, since November 1997.  [151441]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Section 577A of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 denies, for the purpose of computing business profits, a deduction on expenditure incurred on any payment, the making of which constitutes an offence in the UK, or would do so if the payment were made in the UK. The onus is upon the taxpayer not to claim a deduction on any such expenditure. The Inland Revenue does not keep central records of expenditure disallowed from deduction by its inspectors under this provision.

<a name="40128w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The driving instructor registration scheme involves periodic re-assessment of competence. We intend to use modern technology to assess instructor standards in an effective and efficient manner, as part of their supervision arrangements.
<P>

<a name="40128w01.html_para4">The new computer-based assessment will comprise a multiple-choice question test of knowledge and understanding of driving theory and instruction, plus a moving-image hazard perception test. The knowledge and understanding test draws on a bank of over 900 questions and is more comprehensive than when most instructors qualified.
<P>

<a name="40128w01.html_para5">Hazard perception testing has been a key part of the qualification process for learner car drivers, lorry drivers, bus drivers, motor cyclists, potential instructors and driving examiners since November 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether European nationals who are licensed to drive in other EU member states using bioptics are allowed to drive using bioptics in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement.  [151309]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 One of the principal themes of the second EC Directive on driving licences (Directive 91/439/EEC) is the mutual recognition of licences, and all entitlements gained, between member states. Drivers from other member states who become resident in the UK, however, are subject to UK legislation and procedures. Information provided to such drivers informs them of the requirement to notify the Secretary of State of any medical conditions, including visual defects, that may affect fitness to drive. A driver who notified a visual defect or condition and was found to be unable to meet the required standards in relation to vision would not be licensed to drive in the UK despite the use of bioptic lenses.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Heath: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what assessment he has made of whether the European Directive on Driver Licensing allows the use of bioptics for driving; and if he will make a statement;  [151310]

<UL>(2) what policy has been formulated by the Honorary Medical Advisory Panel on Driving and Visual Disorders regarding the use of bioptics for driving; and if he will make a statement.  [151311]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Any assessment as to the degree to which the use of bioptic lenses for driving complies with the second EC Directive on driving licences (Directive 91/439/EEC) requires the advice of my Department's Honorary Medical Advisory Panel on Vision and Driving.
<P>

<a name="40128w02.html_para1">The Medical Advisory Panel advises on, rather than formulates, policy in relation to vision and driving. It has considered the issue of bioptic lenses and driving but feels that it is important to gain an understanding of other European member states' views and experience of this aid to vision before definitive advice can be given. I expect to receive the panel's advice, therefore, when the expert medical working group recently established by the EC Committee on the Driving Licence has considered the issue and the results of its discussions are known. The working group is expected to meet three or four times during 2004 and to report its results in approximately 18 months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what estimate he has made of the number of households which will be subjected to <i>(a)</i> a noise level of (i) 63dBa Leq or more and (ii) 69dBa Leq or more and <i>(b)</i> an increase in noise level of 3dBa Leq or more directly as a result of the increased use of the existing runway at Edinburgh airport as outlined in the recent White Paper on Aviation.

 This information is set out in the Scottish Consultation Document and supporting technical reports. These estimate the number of people who would be affected by different levels of noise under a range of runway options at Edinburgh airport including maximum use of the existing main runway, greater use of the existing crosswind runway and development of a new close parallel runway. Our analysis suggests that by 2030, under the maximum use option, and assuming a 8dBA technology improvement, 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2004 : Column 359W</I><P>
there would be an increase of 300 people affected within the 63 dBA 16 hour Leq contour with no increase at the 69dBA 16 hour Leq contour. The equivalent figures with increased use of the crosswind runway are 800 and 200 respectively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many tonnes of <i>(a)</i> 1,3-butadiene, <i>(b)</i> benzene, <i>(c)</i> particulates and <i>(d)</i> sulphur dioxide emissions he estimates have been saved as a result of the liquid petroleum gas duty rebate.  [151037]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is not possible to give a precise estimate. Liquefied petroleum gas is a clean fuel which results in very low emissions of a number of key air pollutants. It can have particular benefits, for example, when it is used as a substitute for diesel fuel in polluted urban areas. The nature and scale of the emissions savings, however, will depend on a number of factors, including the type of vehicle and fuel which is being replaced by LPG, and how and where it is being driven.

 They cannot be used for this purpose. All fines resulting from speeding offences are paid to the courts. Funds returned to the safety camera partnerships (all these include the police) under the cost recovery scheme may only be used to cover the cost of purchasing, placing and operating speed and traffic light enforcement (safety) cameras.

<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_wqn1"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on Government strategy for decreasing the noise disturbances arising from main roads in residential areas, with particular reference to relevant measures in the Traffic Management Bill.  [148369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government recognise that traffic noise from main roads can be a significant nuisance, particularly where they run close to or through local communities. The Government are committed to reducing such noise and our strategy is to set vehicle construction standards that reduce noise at source wherever feasible and desirable on safety grounds. We also encourage the mitigation of noise with insulation, barriers, traffic management measures and low noise surfaces. The implementation of mitigation measures on the trunk road and motorway network, for which the Highways Agency is responsible, concentrates first on the most pressing locations. It is doing this by a variety of means, most importantly through a programme of re- surfacing all concrete roads with quieter materials by 31 March 2011 and re-surfacing blacktop roads with quieter materials as and when they require maintenance. In addition, the Government provides funds to local authorities to maintain local roads, though how much they spend and what they spend it on is their choice.
<P>

<a name="40128w03.html_para1">The primary aim of the Traffic Management Bill is to improve the smooth flow of traffic but there are a number of reasons for believing that it will also help with 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2004 : Column 361W</I><P>
noise problems. For example, better management of traffic incidents and street works will reduce the disruption caused to traffic and the noise created by slow-moving heavy traffic. It will also minimise the incentive for motorists to divert along adjacent residential roads.
<P>

<a name="40128w03.html_para2">The Government are also encouraging a substantial growth in investment in public transport. This will help reduce traffic noise by providing the public with a greater choice over how they travel.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The royal train plays an important role in enabling members of the royal family to carry out their extensive official engagements throughout the UK. It is principally used for overnight travel and provides secure accommodation and secure mobile office facilities. In 2002&#150;03, the train was used for 19 journeys; in 2001&#150;02, for 15 journeys and 17 journeys in 2000&#150;01. Full details of these journeys are provided in the appendices to the Annual Reports on the Grant-in-aid for Royal Travel by Air and Rail. Copies of these reports, which are prepared annually, are placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B>

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the roles and duties that the Traffic Management Bill will accord to traffic managers and local traffic authorities to <i>(a)</i> respond to and <i>(b)</i> prevent traffic gridlock.  [148371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Traffic Management Bill will require local authorities to appoint a Traffic Manager responsible for keeping traffic moving in their area. Neighbouring authorities will also have to work together to ensure traffic flows across the network as a whole.
<P>

<a name="40128w03.html_para3">Local authorities will need not only to manage existing problems but also to plan ahead, taking account of events they know about and making contingency arrangements for unforeseen incidents. They will have to do this in a way that does not compromise their other responsibilities such as for improving road safety.
<P>

<a name="40128w03.html_para4">The Bill will give authorities a number of additional powers to meet their new responsibilities. For example, they will be helped to deal with congestion caused by 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2004 : Column 362W</I><P>
poorly planned and lengthy street works by greater control over when and where utility companies carry out street works. These powers will include the ability to specify what day of the week works can be carried out and at what times. They will be able to prevent certain roads from being dug up repeatedly by banning works on that road until a specified date. Any utility company wanting to carry out street works could be required to apply for a permit to do so. Utility companies failing to repair a road properly will face fines of up to &#163;5,000.
<P>

<a name="40128w03.html_para5">Local authorities will also be given the ability to ensure that a number of moving traffic contraventions are enforced. This will include, for example, box junction and no right turn rules. These powers already exist in London. The Bill will extend them to cover the rest of England and Wales.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_wqn5"><B> Lembit &#214;pik: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what impact the Traffic Management Bill will have on motorcyclists; and if he will make a statement.  [150142]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Traffic Management Bill will give national and local highway authorities a number of additional powers and responsibilities to tackle congestion for the benefit of all road users. Authorities will be better able to manage their roads and the traffic using them. Motorcyclists, like other road users, will benefit from the reduced congestion and disruption. In particular, on local roads where much motorcycling takes place, local authorities will have a new network management duty aimed at keeping traffic moving in their area. Neighbouring authorities will also have to work together to ensure traffic flows effectively across the network as a whole. Again, motorcyclists will benefit from the better operation of the road network, along with other road users.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Donohoe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what is meant by serious traffic disruption in Part 4 of the Traffic Management Bill.  [150201]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Section 56 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 allows a street authority to direct an undertaker as to the times at which street works can be carried out, where they might otherwise cause serious disruption to traffic. Clause 42 of the Traffic Management Bill makes clear that this power includes the ability to direct not only the times but also the days on which works may or may not be carried out.
<P>

<a name="40128w03.html_para6">Whether or not there is likely to be serious disruption to traffic in the case of a particular proposed works must be determined by a street authority on the facts of the case. Guidance on the use of the current power is set out in the Code of Practice for the Co-ordination of Street Works and Works for Road Purposes and Related Matters, and we intend revising this guidance as part of producing regulations under the Bill. Ultimately, however, the interpretation of the law is a matter for the courts.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Donohoe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the impact of the streetwork provisions in the Traffic Management Bill on urban regeneration.  [150202]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The aim of the street works provisions in the Traffic Management Bill are twofold. Firstly to reduce the disruption that these works cause to road 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2004 : Column 363W</I><P>
users, businesses and local residents and secondly to ensure that works are carried out to a high standard and to minimise the negative impact they can have on the environment and the appearance of streets. While each of these is an issue for both urban and rural areas, we believe that minimising the negative effect of these works is particularly important in helping to regenerate our cities.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Donohoe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of the impact of the Traffic Management Bill on utilities infrastructure investment programmes, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> water and gas mains replacement and <i>(b)</i> electricity cable renewal and upgrading.  [150203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The detail of those parts of the Traffic Management Bill which relate directly to utility works will be set out in regulations. We will be consulting extensively with utilities and utility regulators as part of drawing up these regulations, so that the revised legislative regime takes proper account of their investment programmes and does not put any unnecessary obstacles in the way of their carrying out these necessary works.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans the Government have to consult Ofgem on the additional costs envisaged from the introduction of permit schemes, as set out in the Traffic Management Bill.  [150204]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Ofgem, together with Ofwat and Ofcom, are represented on the legislative working group set up by my Department which considered what provision should be included in the Bill, and which will continue to meet to consider the details of the secondary legislation which will underpin it. This will include

 The Surface Combatant Maritime Rotorcraft (SCMR) programme is currently nearing the end of its Assessment Phase. A Main Gate investment decision is expected later this year when, as with any other programme, the decision on Demonstration and Manufacture will be made, with the capability planned to be phased into service around the turn of the decade.
<P>

<a name="40128w06.html_para0">The Future Air to Surface Guided Weapon (FASGW) programme remains early in its concept phase. This includes studies into a range of solutions to provide a future Anti-Surface Warfare (ASuW) capability, superseding the Sea Skua missile currently carried by the Royal Navy Lynx helicopters. A final investment decision will be made at the programme Main Gate, currently planned for the second half of this decade, with the capability entering service during the first half of the next decade.

<a name="40128w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Between 1 January 2003 and 31 December 2003, personnel employed at MOD establishments reported 2,012 passes lost and 90 stolen. During the same period, personnel employed at establishments of MOD agencies reported 882 passes lost and 23 stolen. The passes carry a photograph of the holder and have other features that inhibit their fraudulent replication. Therefore, the loss of such passes, in isolation, is not assessed to pose an increased threat, although this is kept under constant review.

 The Government provides protective security advice to key sectors and installations that are critical to the country's economic and social well-being. Our experience of domestic terrorist attacks over the past 30 years has shown that these arrangements have made an effective contribution to the counter-terrorism effort.
<P>

Although indicative of the effect on cattle TB incidence that might be expected if a total badger clearance were achieved, the Thornbury badger removal was performed without contemporary control areas. This limits its usefulness as a basis for comparison with the impact of lesser percentage badger clearances achieved by other methods, since any change in the incidence of TB in cattle subsequent to culling could have resulted in whole or in part from some other cause.

 Infection with <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> most often causes lesions in the respiratory tract and the associated lymph nodes, which suggests that the most common route of infection in badgers and cattle is by inhalation, or ingestion followed by inhalation.

[150509]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 For the gassing strategy: where TB infection was found in badgers, an area of up to one kilometre from the farm boundary was surveyed, to include the full territories of badgers on the infected farm. Social groupings were identified and all infected social groups, and groups in contact with them, were gassed. The area gassed was determined by the location of infected farms, infected badgers, sett groupings and natural boundaries. (Krebs Report 1997, page 142)

<P>
<a name="40128w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Adult badgers can travel between a few metres and a few kilometres from their setts to their food sources dependent on the quality of the habitat. None of the Krebs reactive and proactive areas are completely circular, so no exact radii can be evaluated. Trial areas are initially described using a 5.64 km radius circle but this shape is distorted by natural features and survey data to end up with areas of around 100 sq km.

 There is no precise way of measuring badger populations pre- and post-culling operations and estimates are made in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial based on field signs at a sample number of setts. Culling success is affected by a range of factors including levels of access, anti-trial activity and the time of the year, and where proactive culling in a triplet has been carried out at a sub-optimal time the next cull, where possible, is planned for more optimal periods.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what precautions can be taken by farmers to guarantee freedom from TB in cattle bought into herds; and to what extent she advises that they can rely on a test or other certification attesting to freedom from TB infection.  [150495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There can be no guarantee of remaining free of bovine TB. However farmers are encouraged to take all practical disease prevention measures to reduce the risk of disease introduction when bringing in new stock, including arranging a tuberculin test of purchased cattle before they are brought into to the resident herd.
<P>

<a name="40128w09.html_para0">The Department provides advice in the form of a freely available booklet "TB in Cattle&#151;Reducing the Risk". A concise list of disease prevention measures which was developed with livestock industry representatives and vets, was sent to all livestock farmers in 2002; it can be found on the Defra website.
<P>

<a name="40128w09.html_para1">The comparative tuberculin skin test is used to certify that cattle herds are free from bovine tuberculosis, the comparative skin test at the standard interpretation, provides sensitivity in the range 68 per cent. to 95 per cent. and specificity in the range in the range 96 per cent. to 99 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40128w09.html_para2">Clearly a negative test result on individual animals brought into a herd will not guarantee their freedom from disease, although it will substantially reduce the risk.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to compensate herd owners for uninsurable losses arising from the event of a TB herd breakdown.  [150501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government currently pays compensation to farmers for the market value of all cattle slaughtered under the TB control programme. There are no plans to compensate for consequential losses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what inference she has drawn from the number of slaughterhouse cases of bovine TB as to the efficacy of the TB surveillance programme.  [150503]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The examination of carcases in the slaughterhouse complements surveillance through the periodic testing of cattle. Identification of infected carcases in slaughterhouses does not necessarily reflect a failure of the tuberculin test to detect the infection: given that infected cattle can develop grossly visible lesions within a relatively short time after infection with <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>, it would be expected that some animals will become infected and be presented for slaughter in the intervals between herd tests, which can last up to four years. In recent years, the proportion of TB incidents that are detected in the slaughterhouse is lower in parishes where herds are tested more frequently, in other words frequent tuberculin testing reduces the risk that diseased cattle are disclosed during slaughterhouse inspection.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action is taken in respect of slaughterhouse cases of bovine TB to trace the animals back to the farm of origin; what proportion of these cases were traced back to source in the last five years; and how many herds identified as a result of such action were subsequently confirmed as TB breakdowns.

 All suspects detected in the slaughterhouse are traced back to the farm of origin, movement restrictions are imposed and the herd is check tested.
<P>

<a name="40128w09.html_para4">Material from animals with lesions detected at slaughter is submitted for laboratory confirmation of the presence of the causative organism, <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>. Typically, about 35 per cent. to 50 per cent. of suspected cases of TB detected during routine meat inspection are eventually confirmed by culture of <i>M. bovis</i> in tissue samples, which automatically triggers a confirmed TB breakdown in the herd of origin whether or not reactors are found in the subsequent check test. Between 10 and 13 per cent. of all new TB breakdowns confirmed in a given year are started by a 'slaughterhouse case' and between 34 and 47 per cent. of such breakdowns will have reactors in the subsequent check test.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether she has identified a statistically significant correlation between the distribution of TB infection in badgers and the distribution of TB in cattle.  [150505]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
: The report from the Independent Scientific Review Group, chaired by Sir John Krebs, which reported in 1997, concluded that there was "strong evidence for an association between TB in cattle and badgers". This relationship will be investigated further using data collected in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial, which is currently underway.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs where slaughterhouse cases of bovine TB are identified as having originated in animals which have transited through livestock markets immediately prior to despatch for slaughter; what measures are taken in those markets to contain the spread of disease; and what action is taken to trace possible contact animals consequently confirmed as TB breakdowns.  [150506]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The transmission of the causative organism, <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>, between cattle requires in most cases for the animals to be in close proximity with each other. While there is a risk that the organism could be transmitted between cattle at a market, conditions are such that this is a relatively low risk. Thus tracings of cattle that have come into contact with infected animals do not take into account contacts that take place in markets.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what herd TB breakdowns have been recorded in the last 10 years in areas <i>(a)</i> where there have been no badgers detected and <i>(b)</i> following complete clearance of badgers.  [150511]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There is insufficient reliable data on the extent and varying density of the badger population of Great Britain to identify, with any certainty, areas where there is an absence of badgers. No area, in the last 10 years, has been completely cleared of badgers.

mechanisms of transmission; what the specific criteria are which make up the models; and which criteria remain to be satisfied before a firm association can be made between the presence of infection in the badger population and the presence of the disease in cattle.  [150517]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 To help to determine the cause of bovine TB and mechanisms of transmission, the Department has investigated spatially explicit GIS-based stochastic simulation badger/TB models. The models are complex and are described in detail in a range of scientific publications available from the Central Science Laboratory. The Randomised Badger Culling Trial is seeking to address the question of the contribution of the presence of infection in badgers to the presence of the disease in cattle, and results will be available in due course.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs with regard to the TB control operation in Thornbury, what the level was of cattle TB in the trial area prior to the removal of badgers; how many times, by what methods, and how thoroughly the removal was effected; whether these operations led to an elimination of badgers; how soon after the completion of operations badgers re-colonised the area; and at what level the re-colonisation was noted.  [150572]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The incidence of herds with visible lesion reactors in the Thornbury intervention area, prior to badger clearance starting, was 74 in 1,314 herd years or 5.6 per cent. No reliable record exists of the number of gassing operations, but the Zuckerman Report refers to gassing starting in December 1975 and continuing to August 1976. Many setts were re-colonised immediately and "a considerable amount of re-gassing was necessary". The gas used in Thornbury was hydrogen cyanide and the badger activity was reduced to a "low level by 1979&#150;80" (Zuckerman Report). The badger population at Thornbury took about 10 years to recover once action to prevent re-colonisation ceased.

<P>
<a name="40128w09.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B>

 The Secretary of State has had no formal meetings with representatives of supermarkets to discuss milk prices. However, retailers are represented on the Dairy Supply Chain Forum chaired by my noble Friend Lord Whitty, which has been looking at collaborative solutions to improve supply chain efficiency, as well as other issues. Retailers are also represented in the Dairy Supply Chain Forum's Industry Development's Cap Reform Sub-Groups which aim to facilitate the long term sustainable development of the dairy supply chain and help it adjust to the new environment created by the reformed CAP.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to prevent farmers from dumping effluent in rivers.  [148830]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The dumping of effluent in rivers is an offence under the Water Resources Act (WRA) 1991. The Environment Agency (the Agency) is responsible for regulating discharges of effluent to watercourses and issues discharge consents under Schedule 10 of the WRA. In all cases, consents are subject to strict conditions to ensure protection of the receiving water.
<P>

<a name="40128w10.html_para4">It is rare for a consent to be issued to a discharge of farm effluent because of the difficulty of achieving the standards necessary to protect the watercourse. It is accepted practice that slurry, manure and dirty water from farm buildings is contained and usually applied to land in accordance with the relevant sections of Defra's Code of Good Agricultural Practice for the Protection of Water.
<P>

<a name="40128w10.html_para5">The Control of Pollution (Silage, Slurry and Agricultural Fuel Oil) Regulations 1991 (and as amended in 1997) specify the size, design and construction standards that must be used for structures built since 1991 and used for storage of these specified materials. These Regulations also provide powers for the Agency to serve a notice, requiring action to avoid pollution, on a storage structure of any age where the Agency considers there is a serious risk of pollution.
<P>

<a name="40128w10.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Representations from the industry indicated, variously, a preference for some kind of spatial management. Technical conservation methods (such as selective gear) were also advocated by some as an option to be considered in parallel with spatial management as they are developed.
<P>

<a name="40128w10.html_para10">At the December Fisheries Council all the options to enable responsible exploitation of the North sea haddock stock were considered at some length, but the solution agreed was developed from the spatial management proposed by the industry. In order to secure additional quota for the UK, we negotiated the special licensing system to ensure protection of the cod stock.

 Information available on landings of and trade in cod in 2002 indicates that landings by UK registered vessels accounted for 15 per cent. of total cod consumed in the UK during the year. However, most of the cod imported into the UK has been processed to some extent. As such on a standardised live weight equivalent basis, the landings by UK registered vessels accounted for 5 per cent. of total cod consumed in the UK in 2002.

 The time at sea limits in 2003 provided for a separate allowance of days for steaming to and from the fishing grounds, for vessels using gear of over 100 mm mesh. No separate allowance exists for 2004, because the calculation of days at sea for 2004 takes account of the fleet's time at sea in the base period, including its steaming time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w10.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is not possible to estimate in advance the value of quota. Fish quota, held in the form of Fixed Quota Allocation Units, has no intrinsic value. Any value placed on uncaught quota used in quota transfers will depend on market conditions and each parties assessment of its value. The table shows the value at first point of sale of fish landed by the Scottish fleet from ICES areas IVa and IVb in the most recent year for which complete figures are available. It gives an indication of the value realised by landings of these quota species.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what factors affect the <i>(a)</i> seaworthiness and <i>(b)</i> ability to trawl in adverse weather conditions of fishing vessels; what effect these factors have on the ability of vessels to exploit fully allocations of days at sea.  [150479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w10.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The seaworthiness of fishing vessels, and their ability to trawl in adverse weather, depend on various factors, including their design and construction, the standard of maintenance, and the standard of operation of the vessels. It is the responsibility of the skipper to determine when it is safe to fish.
<P>

<a name="40128w10.html_para12">In any year fishing operations will be curtailed from time to time by adverse weather. The calculation of permitted days at sea for 2004 takes account of the time spent at sea in the base period, including when fishing was constrained by bad weather. It thus incorporates time for when fishing is not safe.

<a name="40128w10.html_spnew18"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Limits on time at sea applied in 2003 in the North sea and West of Scotland, to help conserve cod stocks. On the basis of experience with this measure the European Commission and the member states concluded that limits on time at sea should be continued in order to reduce fishing effort as part of a cod recovery plan. Experience in administering the various elements of controls in 2003 informed decisions by the Council of Ministers on the details of successor arrangements for 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will investigate the <i>(a)</i> adequacy of the grounds and <i>(b)</i> quality of decision-making in her Department in pursuing prosecutions of contractors for alleged fraudulent claims or other irregularities relating to the claims made for the work undertaken for or on behalf of her Department in respect of foot and mouth disease.  [150561]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The prosecution of contractors for alleged fraudulent claims is a criminal matter. In such cases, Defra would refer the matter to the appropriate authorities tasked with deciding whether to prosecute or not.




<P>

<P>

<a name="40128w11.html_para0">On the civil side, claims are initiated on the advice of Defra's lawyers. In the commercial disputes pertaining to the foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 this advice has been provided by external commercial law firms in conjunction with forensic accountants and quantity surveyors after detailed review of contractor accounts. In many cases Defra has been successful in resolving disputes through negotiation and/or alternative disputes resolution procedures. Other disputes are being pursued through the Courts.
<P>

<a name="40128w11.html_para1">Defra has a public law duty to protect the public purse. It will do so unfailingly in all circumstances where the evidence is sufficient to meet legal requirements in either a civil or criminal context.

[150566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Small Business Group has drawn the Department's attention to one case where a contractor has alleged intimidating and inappropriate communications from Defra.
<P>

<a name="40128w11.html_para2">To date, Defra has not received any evidence in support of the allegation that intimidation of contractors and their representatives has taken place.

 I take the terms "very low" and "unlikely" as used by the GM Science Review Panel to indicate sequences of events or risks that, while theoretically possible, do not occur with sufficient probability to be cause for concern. The precise level of probability associated with these terms with vary on a case-by-case basis, depending on the particular issue that is being discussed.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given on 14 January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 740W. As that answer explained, this year's review of national recycling targets will include consideration of whether to set further statutory recycling targets for local authorities for the years beyond 2005&#150;06. Although I cannot prejudge the outcome of that review, the Government's goal will remain to encourage local authorities to continue to move management of municipal waste up the waste hierarchy in order to meet their obligations under the Landfill Directive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w11.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government have charged the signatories to the Voluntary Initiative on pesticides with reducing the environmental impact of pesticide use and, in particular, effects on biodiversity and contamination of water. These environmental outcomes will be the ultimate measure of success for the Initiative.
<P>

<a name="40128w11.html_para4">However, measuring environmental outcomes is difficult because they are slow to emerge, hard to measure and hard to attribute reliably to a particular cause. Because of these difficulties, the Government also assesses progress with the Initiative in terms of uptake by farmers of the key components of the Initiative. Of 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2004 : Column 397W</I><P>
these, the most significant are the National Register of Sprayer Operators, the National Sprayer Testing Scheme and Crop Protection Management Plans.
<P>

<a name="40128w11.html_para5">To help test whether delivery of the Initiative will benefit the environment, the signatories are establishing an "Indicator Farms" project to examine the consequences of applying Initiative measures at a farm level. If the results of this project are positive, it will help provide assurance that national uptake of the Initiative could generate national environmental benefits.
<P>

<a name="40128w11.html_para6">Overall progress to date with the Initiative is encouraging. Uptake of Crop Protection Management Plans is ahead of schedule and, after a slow start, applications for the National Register of Sprayer Operators and National Sprayer Testing Scheme have accelerated with the backing of the crop assurance schemes. The Government will look to see this progress maintained and will also look for the most rapid possible progress with environmental outcomes. In particular, the Government will be monitoring the pilot water catchments and the Indicator Farms project.

 Defra actively promotes the better regulation agenda and the use of sunsetting where appropriate. The Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) guidance 'Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment' advises policy officials to consider sunsetting at an early stage of policy development and gives specific circumstances where sunsetting may be appropriate. Additional examples are included in the web-based version of the RIA guidance published in November 2003. No acts containing sunset clauses relevant to Defra have been passed since Defra was established in 2001.

<P>
<a name="40128w12.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 There have been substantial increases in the level of funding provided for social services in recent years and it will continue to increase in the period to 2005&#150;06. Councils can use these extra resources to increase local service provision taking into account the needs of the local population and the local supply of services.
<P>

<a name="40128w12.html_para4">We know that the majority of older people do not want to be in a care home and we are responding to this by investing in new models of provision such as extra-care housing schemes. It seems likely that the number of older people requiring residential care will not rise as fast as demographic pressures alone would suggest.

 The expected life of computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) scanners is approximately seven to ten years, dependent on the level of upgrade that is possible for that equipment during its lifetime. However, it is not unreasonable for equipment to remain in-situ and in working order after this period.

 No legislation introduced by my department during the period in question has contained sunset clauses. The Cabinet Office promotes the better regulation agenda and the use of sunsetting where appropriate. The Regulatory Impact Assessment(RIA) guidance 'Better Policy Making: A Guide to Regulatory Impact Assessment' advises policy officials to consider time limiting or sunsetting at an early stage of policy development and gives specific circumstances where sunsetting may be appropriate. In November 2003 we published web-based RIA guidance which contains additional examples of sunsetting.

The conflict severely hinders long-term development activities. The UK programme in the north has focused on humanitarian support and interventions to help resolve the conflict. We have provided &#163;7.3 million of humanitarian assistance over the last 12 months. We will be discussing the conflict with President Museveni during his UK visit this week.

 Heavy snowfalls on 15 and 16 January with high winds and avalanches forced a temporary closure of the Salang tunnel, the key route from Kabul to the country's northern provinces. However, this closure was fortunately short, and the Salang road and tunnel reopened to traffic on 18 January. Although all UN road missions were temporarily suspended during the closure period, there are no reports of any significant impact on humanitarian operations, as a result of this closure.

<P>
<a name="40128w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 There are two sets of measures in place to try to assist employees of garment factories in Central America. First, in a range of Central America countries governments have in place, national Competitiveness Programmes. In Nicaragua for example, this Programme is supported through the World Wide Response on Apparel Production (WRAP), and funded by the World Bank. It aims to put in place codes of conduct that include labour standards. 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2004 : Column 421W</I><P>
Second, US retailers, the main purchasers of garments from the Central American garment or "maquilla" industry, are under pressure from northern consumers to conform to these codes and many are including monitoring of such codes as part of contractual agreements with wholesale garment producers, as well as spot checks in factories. In such cases lack of compliance is subject to sanctions by the retail purchasers.

<a name="40128w18.html_para4">During 2003 DFID Central America supported a national level workshop in Nicaragua to enable government, private sector and civil society to discuss national codes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w18.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 During the crisis of 2002&#150;03, DFID was largely unable to provide food aid from local purchase. This was because of the severity of the overall national food shortage. Ethiopia required 1.8 million metric tonnes of food assistance, and at the request of the Ethiopian Government, this was mostly imported.
<P>

<a name="40128w18.html_para5">This year will provide better opportunities for local purchase of grains as production is up by 46 per cent. DFID is also considering providing cash instead of food to people in need.

 The Food and Agricultural Organisation (FAO) estimate national cereal and pulse production for the main harvest of 2003&#150;04 in Ethiopia to be just over 13 million metric tonnes.

<P>

<a name="40128w18.html_para6">Despite the good crop, about 7.2 million people will need food aid&#151;almost half that of last year. This equals an overall food requirement of 980,000 metric tonnes compared with 1.8 million metric tonnes in 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<a name="40128w19.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 There are a number of ways to measure malnutrition. Height for age (stunting) is the most common way of measuring chronic poverty and malnutrition by showing the percentage of children that have not reached an expected height at a given age. According to UNICEF and correct up to 2001, the stunting rates for Ethiopia, Malawi and Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are 52 per cent., 49 per cent., and 38 per cent. respectively.
<P>

<a name="40128w19.html_para0">Wasting is an indicator that better measures short-term changes in malnutrition during an emergency by showing the percentage of children that are underweight in relation to their height. It is more difficult to determine for a country because it varies according to the degree of emergency and tends to be area focused rather than reflect a national trend. For example, in Ethiopia, 2002&#150;03 figures for wasting rose as high as 32 per cent. in some areas. The same areas&#151;a few months later&#151;showed rates of 8 per cent. following the emergency operation.

 The area cost adjustment (ACA) is the element of the funding formula which takes account of the different costs of labour and non domestic rates between areas. The labour cost element of the ACA is calculated using hourly wage data for both the public and private sector from the New Earnings Survey (NES).
<P>

<a name="40128w20.html_para0">To use exclusively private sector pay in calculating the ACA would take little account of how any public sector employers, such as the NHS, affect pay in their local labour market. Private sector wages also vary more across the country than public sector wages because many public sector employees are paid according to national pay scales. To base the ACA on private sector wages alone would overstate the variability in staff costs for local authorities across the country.

 The area cost adjustment (ACA) is the element of the funding formula which takes account of the different costs of labour and non domestic rates between areas. The labour cost element of the ACA is calculated using hourly wage data excluding overtime from the New Earnings Survey (NES). The NES is a snapshot of the wages people earn in a given week in April each year.
<P>

<a name="40128w20.html_para2">In calculating the ACA the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister need to be able to compare wage costs in different areas on a consistent basis. This is why the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister looks at hourly rather than weekly wages, and why the wage data used is only taken from those on adult pay rates, whose weekly wage has not been affected by absence and excludes overtime. The availability of overtime to individual workers is erratic. Because the NES is a snapshot, it is impossible to tell whether an individual is working overtime as a routine part of their job, or because a colleague is sick and the firm needs cover. And overtime payments often depend on the time and day overtime is worked. All of which diminishes our ability to compare labour costs between areas on a like for like basis.

recovery of a motor vehicle from a motorway was last reviewed; and what the policy of the Government are in relation to variations of the fee.  [151248]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w21.html_spnew1"><B> Caroline Flint  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 27 January 2004]:</i> The statutory fees for the removal, storage and disposal of vehicles from motorways or other roads were last increased in 1993. Any charges outside these fees are non-statutory and a matter for resolution between the parties concerned.
<P>

<a name="40128w21.html_para0">The Government believe that the statutory charges should be set at a level which is fair to all parties, including the motorist and vehicle recovery operators.
<P>

<a name="40128w21.html_para1">We are currently considering the level of the fees and how they should be applied in different circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w21.html_wqn2"><B> Dr. Stoate: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what level of proof is required by magistrates courts before an application for an anti-social behaviour order can be granted.  [150996]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w21.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In the McCann case in October 2002 the Law Lords ruled that the equivalent of the criminal standard of proof, ie beyond reasonable doubt, should be applied in the interests of fairness and pragmatism to prove past acts of anti-social behaviour which are usually of a criminal or quasi-criminal nature. The necessity of a anti-social behaviour order (ASBO) for the protection of other persons from future anti-social acts remains an exercise of judgment not subject to a standard of proof.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the success to date of anti-social behaviour orders in Gloucestershire.  [150425]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w21.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) are one of a number of methods being used in Gloucestershire as part of their local strategy to tackle anti-social behaviour. Local practitioners report that ASBOs have been successfully used alongside other tools&#151;such as mediation and anti-social behaviour clauses in tenancy contracts&#151;to reduce anti-social behaviour in the area and transform the behaviour of several perpetrators. Nine ASBOs were granted in Gloucestershire between April 1999 and September 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many Anti-Social Behaviour Orders have been put in place, broken down by <i>(a)</i> police authority and <i>(b)</i> local authority; and how many people have been charged with breaking anti-social behaviour order provisions.  [151349]<P>

<P>

<a name="40128w21.html_para4">Information on the number of people charged is not collected centrally. From the Home Office Court Proceedings database, available information relating to breaches of ASBOs, covering the period 1 June 2000 to 31 December 2002, shows that the number of people who have been prosecuted for breaching an ASBO is 329, of which 305 were found guilty.

<P>

 Data on the number of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) made are reported to the Home Office on a quarterly basis by Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCC), and on a rolling basis by the Crown court (since 2 December 2002) and county courts (since 1 April 2003). Table A gives data on the number of ASBOs made, from 1 April 1999 up to 30 September 2003 (latest available), by MCC area, Crown court circuit, and county court group.

 I refer the hon. Member to the statement I made on 18 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 147WS.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to require police authorities to provide him with statistics each year on the level of business crime in each area; and if he will make a statement.  [150772]<P>

<P>
<a name="40128w22.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Home Office currently publishes annual total crime statistics recorded by the police in England and Wales for the following offences specifically relating to business crime: robbery of business property, theft by an employee, theft from shops and theft of an automatic machine or meter. Statistics for these offences have not been published at police force area level. The most recent volume of recorded crime statistics was published in July 2003, in Statistical Bulletin 7/03, "Crime in England and Wales 2002/03", which is available via the Research Development Statistics (RDS) website. A copy of the Bulletin has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="40128w22.html_para1">The business crime team within the Home Office has recently begun a process of examining how current information on business crime, including retail crime, can be enhanced. To this end, the Research, Development and Statistics Department have been approached to examine the feasibility of different options. This work is on-going.
<P>

<a name="40128w22.html_para2">However, in view of the complexity and range of crimes experienced by the business sector, it has rapidly become clear that no one single method of collecting data will provide a sufficiently complete picture. We are therefore considering how both police and survey data collection can be refined and extended to give us a more accurate and comprehensive overview of the crimes experienced by businesses.

 There are currently funds available for the installation of CCTV in all locations, including villages and rural railway stations, under the Building Safer Communities Fund. The Home Office allocates the Building Safer Communities Fund to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships to enable them to tackle local crime priorities through a number of interventions, including CCTV facilities. For 2003&#150;04, the Building Safer Communities Fund has provided Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships with &#163;72.3million.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will take steps to amend the rules on evidence relating to magistrates courts cases involving breaches of anti-social behaviour orders to allow hearsay evidence to be heard.  [150995]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w22.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Breach of an anti-social behaviour order is a criminal offence and rules relating to criminal evidence apply as they do for other criminal offences. The basic rule is that hearsay evidence is not admissible in criminal proceedings unless the maker of the statement is unavailable or where business documents are involved. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 will change the rules relating to hearsay evidence in criminal proceedings to make it admissible in specified circumstances such as where it is in the interests of justice.

 We are piloting the devolution of funding for the Witness Service to Local Criminal Justice Boards in four areas (Essex, Lancashire, Greater Manchester and Surrey) from April 2004. The aim of the pilots is to improve local responsiveness to the needs of witnesses and accountability for services. We are working closely with the National Association of Victim Support Schemes and the local Victim Support schemes which run the Witness Service in the four areas on the detailed arrangements for the pilots.
<P>

<a name="40128w22.html_para3">In November, my right hon. Friend, the Home Secretary met the Chief Executive of the National Association of Victim Support Schemes and the Chair of National Association's Board of Trustees to discuss their concerns about the proposal, and a similar meeting took place in July with Baroness Scotland of Asthal.

<a name="40128w22.html_para4">The Chief Executive of the National Association of Victim Support Schemes has also drawn these concerns to the attention of the Criminal Justice Council, which advises the National Criminal Justice Board.

<P>

<a name="40128w22.html_para6">There is a range of views among local Victim Support Schemes and other practitioners about the proposal to devolve funding to Local Boards. The purpose of the pilot is to test whether devolution of funding results in more effective support and services for witnesses.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what assessment he has made of the number of employers who have decided not to employ someone as a result of a Criminal Records Bureau disclosure in the last five years; and what guidance is given to employers to ensure that such decisions are based on a fair assessment of the relevance of disclosed offences;  [144963]

<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w22.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 18 December 2003]:</i> There are no records available to indicate the number of employees that have been turned down for jobs following a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) check. Recruitment decisions are entirely a matter for the employer and the CRB would not normally comment on a person's suitability for a position. However, an independent survey has shown that, since the CRB launched its Disclosure service in March 2002, an estimated 18 per cent. of employers that have used the service have decided not to employ an individual as a consequence of conviction information or another matter contained in a Disclosure.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jan 2004 : Column 441W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40128w22.html_para7">All recipients of Disclosure information issued by the CRB are subject to a Code of Practice, made under the Police Act 1997 and laid before Parliament. This makes it clear that no recipient of Disclosure information shall unfairly discriminate against the subject of the information on the basis of conviction or other details revealed. The ode requires job applicants to be advised that successful applicants will be required to request a Disclosure, but that a criminal record will not necessarily be a bar to obtaining employment. The CRB has also produced other guidance, and has collaborated with and endorsed guidance produced by other bodies designed to help employers to arrive at fair and balanced recruitment decisions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how he intends to sustain the planned increase in police numbers.  [150128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40128w23.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The number of police officers in England and Wales reached a record 136,386 on 31 August 2003. The major component in the rise in police numbers since March 2000 has been the use of the Crime Fighting Fund to fund additional recruits above that which forces were planning to train.
<P>

<a name="40128w23.html_para9">As announced in the provisional funding settlement for 2004&#150;05 on 19 November 2003, the Home Office will provide continuation funding for the 9,000 posts created by the Crime Fighting Fund from 2000&#150;03. In addition it is proposed to provide part funding of 60 per cent for the 650 additional Crime Fighting Fund recruits in 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="40128w23.html_para10">The Home Office is also promoting a number of initiatives to ensure the increasing effectiveness of the resources devoted to policing. Both workforce modernisation and reducing bureaucracy will release officers to do the job they were trained to do and help them undertake their duties in an increasingly effective way. We will this year be establishing a baseline measure for the amount of time officers spend on front line duties, which will enable forces and police authorities to plan for improvement. The National Intelligence Model developed by the police service will enable forces to deploy officers in a more strategic way.

<P>
<a name="40128w24.html_spnew0"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 An internal review of the strategic oversight and management of public sector prison industries in England and Wales was completed earlier this year. The report of the prison industries review was written for internal discussion, and contains proposals for improving the way in which prison industries are operated and managed. These proposals are now being implemented. A copy of the report has been placed in the Library.

 On 6 January a radical reform of the management of offenders was announced with the publication of the document 'Reducing Crime&#151;Changing Lives'. The overriding purpose of the reforms is to improve the management of offenders and reduce re-offending. Offenders for whom prison is the right penalty will continue to be sent to prison. But there are many offenders for whom tough non-custodial penalties will be more appropriate. Our proposals will provide sentencers with a full range of penalties and advice on what is most likely to be effective in reducing re-offending in particular circumstances.

 <i>[holding answer 27 January 2004]:</i> Currently, with the exception of a limited number of crime categories, such as 'theft from shops', which explicitly relate to retail crime&#151;police recorded crime figures provide only a very limited picture of crimes experienced by the retail sector.
<P>

<a name="40128w24.html_para0">However, surveys such as the recent Commercial Victimisation Survey 2002 (a survey of over 6,500 retail and manufacturing premises) provide a fuller and more accurate picture of business crime, measuring both reported and unreported crime.
<P>

<a name="40128w24.html_para1">This survey captures statistics on crime experienced by businesses in the previous year, the cost of crime, concerns about problems and crime in the local area, action taken by businesses to respond to criminal incidents and their crime prevention precautions.
<P>

<a name="40128w24.html_para2">Provisional headline findings were released on 13 August 2003. The main findings should be published this spring.
