 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2001]:</i> I have today placed in the Library of the House a copy of the letter of the Minister for Energy and Competitiveness in Europe, my right hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will introduce targets for reducing the number of regulations issued by her Department over the next four years and for consequent financial savings.  [14430]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The DTI keeps the regulations for which it is responsible under constant review and welcomes the comments of stakeholders on them. There are no plans to introduce numerical targets for the reduction of regulations.
<P>

<a name="11120w01.html_para0">The Government's policy is to regulate only when necessary, ensuring that regulations are fair and effective, so that they protect the vulnerable but do not stifle competitiveness or productivity. New processes including the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 give us powerful tools to help cut down over-complex, overlapping and over- burdensome regulatory regimes.
<P>

<a name="11120w01.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister has asked all Whitehall Departments to identify by the end of this year areas of legislation that are ripe for reform under the Act and other procedures. A Government-wide action plan will then be published containing firm commitments to specific reforms and initiatives which will aid both businesses and the public sector.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11120w01.html_para2">Of these 530 regulations, we estimate that 9 per cent. reduced costs borne by businesses, charities and voluntary bodies, while over 75 per cent. had little or no effect on costs for businesses, voluntary bodies, and charities. Over 30 per cent. of all the regulations introduced by DTI since May 1997 have been orders licensing firms to provide public telecommunications services, increasing consumer choice and competition in this sector.
<P>

<a name="11120w01.html_para3">Regulatory Impact Assessments (Compliance Cost Assessments for measures introduced before August 1998) have been completed in respect of all measures imposing or reducing costs and placed in the Libraries of the Houses.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what funds are available from the <i>(a)</i> EU and <i>(b)</i> UK Government to compensate the (i) industrial and (ii) service sector in Britain for losses caused by the weakness of the euro; and how much has been paid, by industry and service, for each of the last three periods for which figures are available.  [15402]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 No such funds are available from either Her Majesty's Government or the EU. No payments have therefore been made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w01.html_wqn5"><B> Barbara Follett: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action she has taken to encourage employers and trade unions to work in partnership to achieve equal pay.  [15727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w01.html_spnew5"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The pay gap is now 18 per cent. for full-time hourly earnings. This has halved from 37 per cent. since the introduction of the Equal Pay Act in 1970 and is the smallest gap recorded, but is still far too high.




<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2001 : Column: 163W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11120w01.html_para4">We have announced extra funding for the Equal Opportunities Commission to prepare a model for voluntary pay reviews and will encourage employers and trade unions to take up this and other tools. To encourage partnership working generally between employers and trade unions, the Government have several initiatives including the Partnership at Work Fund. Applications for grant are currently being sought and could include projects looking to use partnerships to achieve equal pay.
<P>

<a name="11120w01.html_para5">More generally, the Government are taking a range of actions to improve the operation of the labour market and, in doing so, the position of women. For example, about 900,000 women have benefited from the introduction of the national minimum wage in 1999, and this measure has helped to reduce the pay gap by over one percentage point. The Employment Bill placed before Parliament earlier this month provides for equal pay questionnaires and improved maternity rights, and the Government have accepted each of the recommendations made by the Work and Parents Taskforce on how a duty can be placed on employers to consider seriously requests from parents of young children to work flexibly.

This was followed in late 2000 by a Governance review (completed early 2001) of the NCC. This review recommended changes to the NCC board and as a result a new board was appointed as of 1 October.

<P>
<a name="11120w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Thin film photovoltaic technology (largely amorphous silicon) currently accounts for about 20 per cent. of total world shipments of all PV products but its market share is increasing. Several countries and companies are investing heavily in research into and development of existing and new thin film technologies. Although thin film modules and tiles tend to be less efficient than the more established crystalline silicon products, they have the potential to be much cheaper, because they are more suited to automated processing and use much less of the basic PV material, such as silicon.
<P>

<a name="11120w02.html_para9">In the UK, the Government have supported a number of research and development projects for thin film technologies, including several large projects with the UK's only thin film cell producer. The DTI is also supporting the deployment of thin film products under its Domestic Field Trials, and the recently announced Large Scale Field Trial for Public Buildings will be open to all PV technologies. Budgets for these trials amount to some &#163;8.4 million. In addition to this the Government have

Over 500 mist nets, nearly 300 limesticks and many other items of trapping equipment have been seized and will be destroyed. Nine people have been arrested and charged with trapping offences. They now face prosecution in the SBA Court, which can and does impose heavy fines for trapping offences.

 We have assisted the Government of Albania with the preparation of its recently completed poverty reduction strategy and with the complementary process of developing a Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF). The poverty reduction strategy includes targets to reduce infant mortality and improve school enrolment. The MTEF has already led to increased Government spending on health and education.

 States across the world expressed their sorrow and outrage at the dreadful events of 11 September and there has been widespread acceptance of the need for an international coalition to tackle terrorism. UN Security Council resolution 1373 was passed unanimously on 28 September. It is the first resolution to impose obligations on all states to respond to a global threat to international peace and security. It focuses on two key areas: to suppress the financing of terrorism and to deny terrorists a safe haven from which to operate. All UN member states are bound by UNSCR 1373 to take measures against international terrorism. The present military campaign directed at Osama bin Laden and the Taliban regime has the support of all NATO allies who agreed unanimously to invoke Article 5 (the collective self-defence commitment at the core of NATO). A wide range of other countries also back the military campaign. For operational reasons we cannot disclose details of that support.

 The oil for food programme is the UN's largest humanitarian programme ever, worth some $12.5 billion last year alone.

<a name="11120w07.html_para2">These achievements have been made despite the continuing efforts of the Iraqi regime to hamper the oil for food programme.

 Afghanistan has an immensely complex social tapestry. That complexity has been increased by the disruption of almost 20 years of continual warfare involving the movement of population both within and out of the country and whose effects are not yet properly documented. Traditionally, the main communities have been described as Pashtun (c. 38 per cent.), Tajik (c. 25 per cent.), Hazara (c. 19 per cent.), Uzbek (c. 6 per cent.) with the balance being made up of a patchwork of smaller groups.

 The Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) has done a good job in countering the proliferation of missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction through the co-ordination of the export controls of its 33 members. But it is not comprehensive in its membership or scope. The UK has therefore been active in the development of an International Code of Conduct (ICOC) against Ballistic Missile Proliferation. A draft text was agreed by MTCR members at their plenary meeting in Ottawa in September 2001, and will now be opened for wider negotiation. We hope the Code will become a universally accepted international agreement establishing global standards of practice in an area where currently there are none.

 My noble Friend Baroness Amos and the Commonwealth Committee visited Harare and toured two farms, one near Masvingo and one in Marondera in Mashonaland East. She met members of the Zimbabwe Government as well as groups and organisations representing chiefs, farmers, war veterans, ZANU(PF), the MDC, the churches, UNDP, NGOs, the media and the Electoral Supervisory Commission. Since the visit Baroness Amos has discussed Zimbabwe with Ministers from SADC countries and with senior US officials.

 The UK supported United Nations Security Council resolution 1359, which was passed unanimously on 29 June 2001. This reiterated full support for the on-going efforts of MINURSO to implement the settlement plan and the agreements by the parties to hold a free, fair and impartial referendum for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara.

<a name="11120w08.html_para0">The United Nations Security Council resolution made no provision for setting a date for the referendum and at this stage we do not know when it will be possible to set such a date.
<P>

<a name="11120w08.html_para1">The resolution does, however, reaffirm the UN's commitment to assist the parties in achieving a just and lasting solution to the question of the Western Sahara. The personal envoy of the Secretary-General is currently engaged in an attempt to resolve the dispute. The special envoy is discussing with the parties the draft framework agreement (as set out in the United Nations Secretary-General's report of June 2001) which may offer a mutually agreed political solution to the dispute. He has also discussed with the Polisario their proposals to overcome the obstacles faced in the settlement plan.

<i>Brussels process Ministerial meeting on Gibraltar, 20 November, Barcelona</i>
<BR>
Joint Press Communique
<BR>
Josep Pique i Camps, the Spanish Minister of Foreign Affairs and Jack Straw, the Foreign Secretary of the United Kingdom
<BR>
At our meeting today we confirmed our shared objective to continue our discussions about Gibraltar, in an atmosphere of trust and mutual co-operation, a commitment which Prime Minister Blair and Prime Minister Aznar endorsed when they met in London on 9 November. We are delighted that we are making good progress.
<BR>
We discussed the full range of issues set out in the November 1984 Brussels Communique. We did not want to draw conclusions today. Our aim is to conclude a comprehensive agreement by the summer of next year. This overall agreement will cover all outstanding issues, including those of co-operation and sovereignty.
<BR>
Our share objective is a future where Gibraltar enjoys greater self-government and the opportunity to reap the full benefits of normal co-existence with the wider region. The guiding principle is to build a secure, stable and prosperous future for Gibraltar and a modern sustainable status, consistent with our common membership of NATO and the EU. We also agreed on the need for rapid progress on key areas of co-operation. We asked officials to work up ideas and report to the next Ministerial meeting.
<BR>
While the British Government welcomed the Spanish decision to more than triple the number of telephone numbers for Gibraltar to 100,000, both Ministers agreed on the need for experts to continue discussions to resolve the other telecommunications issues. The British Government welcomed Spain's proposals to improve health care facilities in Spain for Gibraltarians, and both Ministers agreed that this should be followed up quickly. The Ministers also agreed that bilateral discussions would continue to address the pensions issue.
<BR>
We agreed that the Government of Gibraltar had a very important contribution to make to our discussions. Gibraltar's voice should be heard. We reiterated the invitation which we issued to the Chief Minister of Gibraltar when we met in London on 26 July to attend future Brussels Process Ministerial meetings. His role will be fully respected and he will have the opportunity to contribute fully to the discussion. The Process would benefit greatly from the direct views of the Government of Gibraltar, and through the Government of the House of Assembly and public opinion in Gibraltar as a whole.

 Our High Commission in Dhaka closely monitor reports of human rights abuses against minority groups and will continue to do so. They have raised the persecution of Hindus several times with the Bangladesh government, encouraging them to investigate allegations. High Commission staff recently visited regions where abuses were alleged to have taken place. The evidence suggests minorities have been caught up in inter-party clashes following the recent elections.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2001]:</i> Seaside resorts continue to represent a very important sector of our domestic holiday market, generating well over 15 per cent. of England's total domestic tourism income. The principal responsibility for supporting and promoting British seaside resorts lies with local government, working with other interested parties in the light of a clearly enunciated vision and strategy for tourism and other economic activity. The North East Regional Development Agency also has a key role to play at the regional level.
<P>

<a name="11120w10.html_para5">The north-east benefits, as does the rest of Britain, from British Tourist Authority (BTA) promotions overseas. Among BTA campaigns featuring coastal resorts in the north-east are Hidden Britain, due for launch next year, which suggests itineraries through less well known places, the Walking Britain map, due for launch in January and Harry Potter and Magical Britain, which will be launched on Monday 19 November. This is a guide to locations used in the recent film. Promotion of the Harry Potter guide includes a BTA press trip to Alnwick and Whitby, planned jointly with England's north-east.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w11.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 The Environment Agency's navigation responsibilities were considered during Stage 1 of the Financial, Management and Policy Review (FMPR) which has recently been completed. The review team considered a wide range of views on the subject, including responses to public consultation, reports such as that of the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Select Committee, and an independent consultant's study.
<P>

<a name="11120w11.html_para6">The Stage 1 report concluded that there were no compelling operational reasons for a transfer of functions from the Environment Agency to British Waterways, but nor were there insuperable barriers to such a transfer. The report also concluded that there was an underlying policy issue to be resolved, which was beyond the scope of the FMPR to address. Essentially, that was whether the institutional arrangements for the waterways should be structured to promote navigation and regeneration benefits, with flood defence and conservation accommodated within the structure, or vice versa. In this respect British Waterways and the Environment Agency offer different advantages.
<P>

<a name="11120w11.html_para7">I have considered carefully the FMPR report, and information and views provided subsequently by the Environment Agency and British Waterways. This has not been a straightforward decision. I am attracted by the potential regeneration benefits a transfer to British Waterways could bring, and I accept the FMPR report's conclusion that flood defence issues do not pose an insuperable barrier to transfer, given British Waterways' safety record on its own rivers. However, any change needs to be justified by clear and objective evidence. On 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2001 : Column: 199W</I><P>
balance I do not judge there is sufficiently robust evidence on which to justify a transfer. I have therefore decided that current responsibilities should continue.
<P>

<a name="11120w11.html_para8">The Environment Agency will be set challenging new targets to deliver the improved service on navigation and regeneration being developed through initiatives like "Thames Ahead", working with local authorities and other partners. I look forward to positive results from this exercise, and to renewed goodwill and partnership with British Waterways in serving our important inland waterways.

<P>

<a name="11120w12.html_para0">Early findings indicate that the tests carried out within the laboratory are more accurate as they are able to identify borderline positive samples. This has been crucial in the fight against this outbreak. The technology test itself is quicker than the laboratory by two hours, but in its current form it is not suitable for large scale testing in the field. This is because there are a number of practical considerations which might lead to contamination of samples which are tested in the field. Further work on the validation of the test, the assay procedures and "real time" comparisons with the laboratory system is being carried out. We are always keen to encourage new technology in this area and willing to co-operate in development and validation whenever we have the facility available and it is practical to do so.

<P>
<a name="11120w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2001]:</i> It is likely that fertile genetically modified (GM) fish released into the environment would interbreed with the local wild population of the same species. The environmental consequences would depend on the individual circumstances.

<P>

<a name="11120w13.html_para0">The likelihood of environmental consequences is the rationale behind the European Regulatory regime, which prohibits releases of genetically modified organisms into the environment. Directive 90/220 requires that anyone wanting to release genetically modified organisms in any country in the EU must have prior approval subject to a detailed risk assessment. Approval cannot be granted unless the applicant can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the regulatory authorities that all appropriate measures have been taken to avoid adverse effects on human health and the environment. Each application is considered on a case by case basis taking account of specific circumstances in each individual case; it is not possible to generalise.
<P>

<a name="11120w13.html_para1">In the case of a proposal to release GM salmon the likelihood of interbreeding with the wild population is one of the factors which would be assessed. It is difficult to envisage approval being granted where the possibility of interbreeding with wild stock exists.

 This Government deplore the illegal killing of badgers. The principal legislation protecting the welfare of badgers is the Protection of Badgers Act 1992. Under the 1992 Act it is an offence to kill, take or dig for a badger, or attempt to do so, except under licence or in certain particular circumstances, or to injure one or attempt to do so.

 Concessionary travel on buses and coaches at county level has been permitted since 1968. It was possible for authorities to arrange for the concession to apply outside the county by arrangement with adjoining local authorities. The statutory minimum standard that commenced in June 2001 ensures at least half-fare travel for pensioners on local buses. It does not apply at county level outside the metropolitan areas, although there is no reason why local authorities should not join together to run a county scheme, or a scheme beyond the county boundary, if they wish.

 There are no statutory provisions governing the rights of employees to information under the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Act 1969 ("the 1969 Act"). So far as the insurance that an employer takes out to comply with the 1969 Act is concerned, regulation 5 of the Employers' Liability (Compulsory Insurance) Regulations 1998 made under the 1969 Act requires the employer to display one or more copies of the certificate of insurance at each place of business at which he employs any relevant employee of the class or description to which the certificate relates.

Part III of the Act requires public transport infrastructure to be accessible to disabled people. From 2004 this will include the removal of physical barriers to access.

 Traveline currently is primarily a telephone service offering route and timetable information on all forms of public transport. A website is being developed to supplement the telephone service. The website can be seen at www.traveline.org.uk. and links to all currently available public transport journey planners in the UK. During 2002, journey planners for more regions will become available and will be linked from the site. As coverage of these services becomes more comprehensive the national Traveline website will be given more active promotion.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 My Department has researched the relative effectiveness of porous asphalt in reducing traffic noise levels from those generated by a conventional motorway asphalt surface for nearly 20 years. The specification for porous asphalt was developed using research into ways of increasing its durability, which was inevitably reduced by its porosity. One of the issues emerging from the longer- term research into porous asphalt has been the tendency for its performance to reduce as the pores become clogged.
<P>

<a name="11120w19.html_para3">Thin surface coating road surfaces have been researched since these surfacings first became available in the early 1990s. A wide range of proprietary materials covered by this description has been subjected to a range of tests developed by the British Board of Agreement under the Highway Authorities Product Approval Scheme. The test of relative acoustic performance included within this scheme was developed from the procedure used in the research programme.

<a name="11120w20.html_para0">The exercise by the Lord Chancellor of a power granted to him in primary legislation to make rules, regulations or other statutory instruments is often a necessary step for the expenditure of public funds, but is not in itself a sufficient step.

 A transcript of the hearing of and decision on the petition of J. W. Roberts Ltd., one of the 133 cases heard by Mr. Justice Hart, on 1 October, will not be placed in the Library as this is not normal procedure. Transcripts of court proceedings, or parts of proceedings, are not routinely arranged unless requested by a superior court for the consideration of an appeal. However, the parties to the action, or any interested party, with the judge's consent, can order it. The judge has given his consent and it is now open to anyone to place an order

There is a charge for this service, although in cases of financial hardship this may be met from public funds. The order may be placed with the Court Reporting Unit, Royal Court Justice, Strand, London WC2A 2LL. Before deciding whether to place an order for the transcript an estimate of the cost should be requested, as this may be considerable.

Summaries of progress reports submitted by each individual YOT form the basis of this report. It shows the substantial achievements to date including: the transition to multi-agency working; meeting the Pledge to halve the time from arrest to sentence of persistent offenders; successful implementation of a range of new sentences supported by programmes designed to tackle individuals' offending behaviour, and innovative crime prevention measures in deprived areas.

 The Home Office, in conjunction with the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) and the Northern Ireland Office, is currently reviewing, as a matter of priority, the range of "less lethal" technologies that might be appropriate for use by the police in situations of public disorder as alternatives to the baton round or, where the police are faced with an armed assailant, as an alternative to the use of firearms. In April we published a full account of the less lethal technologies available setting out the different kinds of equipment under examination. These include certain impact devices, long range chemical delivery devices, water cannon, electrical devices, disorientation devices, malodorants, and tranquillisers. Phase II of this work prioritising these less lethal technologies is nearing completion, and the results will be published shortly. Those alternatives selected for immediate further research will be subject to further testing and independent medical evaluation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> registered addicts and <i>(b)</i> non- registered addicts of (i) cocaine and (ii) heroin there were in the UK in each of the last 10 years.  [15538]<P>

<P>
<a name="11120w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The term 'registered addict' has no generally agreed definition in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="11120w23.html_para0">The Home Office previously collected and published information relating to individuals notified to the Addicts Index. Since the Addicts Index closed at the end of April 1997, there are no current figures from that source. However, the Department of Health publishes information on the number of persons presenting to drug misuse services for treatment in Great Britain who are reported to the Drug Misuse Databases; this includes persons with a main drug of misuse of heroin or cocaine. Figures are only available for the period April&#150;September 1993 onwards, and are given in Table 1.
<P>

<a name="11120w23.html_para1">The number of addicts (including those not in treatment) is unknown. Traditionally, a multiplier method was used based on the Addicts Index. However, a more robust approach has been developed recently by a group of researchers. The findings are given in Table 2.

 There has been close co-operation between law enforcement authorities in the United Kingdom and Russia in recent years, which has been valuable to both parties. The United Kingdom has two bilateral agreements with Russia, both inter-agency and intergovernmental. We have a joint fiscal, crime and drugs liaison officer based in Moscow who works closely with his counterparts in Russian law enforcement agencies. Senior United Kingdom law enforcement officials regularly visit to maintain links at the highest level. Both Russia and the United Kingdom are members of the G8 Lyon Group, which focuses on transnational serious and organised crime. The United Kingdom will continue to work closely with Russia through bilateral and

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which local authorities in the north- west of England have not received funding for both CCTV and street warden schemes.  [13648]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Home Office Crime Reduction Programme Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) initiative is funding public area CCTV schemes to a potential value of &#163;170 million across England and Wales. Bids have been assessed, using pre-formulated guidelines, to ensure they: meet national and local crime reduction priorities; are technically sound; have links to a wider package of crime reduction measures, and provide value for money. The table lists those local authority areas that submitted (as part of local crime and disorder reduction partnerships) unsuccessful bids. Some of these authorities also submitted successful bids.
<P>

<a name="11120w23.html_para2">The Street Warden Programme, funded by the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (DTLR) and run through the Neighbourhood and Street Wardens Programme (a joint Home Office/DTLR unit based in DTLR), is to provide &#163;25 million towards a pilot programme of Street Wardens schemes across England. The programme is funded solely by DTLR. The table lists those local authority areas that submitted (or from which another body such as a Housing Association submitted) unsuccessful bids. Again some of these authorities also submitted successful bids.

<P>
<a name="11120w23.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Until recently data on the number of registered sex offenders were collated bi-annually on a national basis from the police national computer (PNC). The most recent national statistics concerning sex offender registration are shown in the table. However, this arrangement has been overtaken by guidance issued by the Home Office in respect of the statutory provisions in Section 67 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000. The guidance requires information about the number of registered sex offenders in each police area to be published. This will take place from April 2002 and local systems are being put in place to deliver it. Until these systems are in place such information could only be obtained by a specific exercise by the particular police force concerned which would lead to disproportionate costs.
<P>

<a name="11120w23.html_para3">After April 2002 such figures will be available for each police authority area. However, this will not necessarily be the same as the Parliamentary constituency.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his estimate is of the percentage of heroin imported into Britain that originates from <i>(a)</i> Taliban controlled Afghanistan, <i>(b)</i> Northern Alliance controlled Afghanistan, <i>(c)</i> Burma and <i>(d)</i> other countries.  [13723]<P>

<P>
<a name="11120w24.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 In the years prior to the ban on opium production introduced by the Taliban in July 2000 about 95 per cent. of Afghanistan's annual opium production originated in Taliban controlled areas. We estimate that over 90 per cent. of heroin which was imported to the United Kingdom was made from opium produced in Afghanistan. The amounts originating from opium produced in other parts of the world in the same years was very small.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Police operational experience and various other research studies show that Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) has considerable crime reduction and detection potential, particularly when used as part of a wider strategy.
<P>

<a name="11120w24.html_para0">Under round one of the Crime Reduction Programme CCTV Initiative, the Home Office funded a CCTV scheme in Sedgley town centre costing &#163;25,450 and one in Stafford Street Car Park, Dudley town centre, costing &#163;46,342. These came into operation in December 2000 and January 2001 respectively.
<P>

<a name="11120w24.html_para1">The Home Office has made no formal evaluation of the effectiveness of CCTV in either of these areas. However analysis by the local police suggests that CCTV has contributed to the reduction in recorded crime of 13.6 per cent. in Dudley and 22.8 per cent. in Sedgley between June 2000 and June 2001. There will be a more detailed review of the effectiveness of the Home Office funded schemes after the first full year of operation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what <i>(a)</i> national and <i>(b)</i> international awareness events his Department has participated in since June 1997 in the form of (i) sponsorship, (ii) departmental attendance, (iii) similar departmental activities and (iv) a message of support.  [5045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 Home Office Ministers and officials participate in a wide range of national and international events in support of Home Office policies, both in the United Kingdom and internationally. Our aim is to build a safe, just and tolerant society and the Home Office is involved in a wide range of initiatives to support this. To set out a full list of all these events would incur disproportionate cost, so I am providing an overview of Home Office activity to show how we are seeking to achieve this aim.
<P>

<a name="11120w24.html_para5">Examples of Home Office initiatives include participation by Ministers and officials in crime reduction initiatives and conferences, such as the Neighbourhood Watch annual conference; participation in criminal justice and policing conferences, such as the annual conferences of the Association of Chief Police Officers, Police Superintendents' Association and the Police Federation. The Home Office, in conjunction with community and voluntary sector organisations, is also leading the way to promote active communities in the United Kingdom. The Home Office has sponsored and attended a range of voluntary sector activities, such as the annual Philip Lawrence Awards, and the launch of Parents' Week in October 2001. An important area is promoting race equality and ministerial colleagues and I have supported and attended a number of conferences and events to underline the Government's commitment to racial equality and effective race relations. The Home Office also supported the 1997 European Year against Racism and the United Nations' World Conference on Racism in 2001.
<P>

<a name="11120w24.html_para6">On the international front, Home Office Ministers and officials regularly attend European Union Councils, working groups and other activities in the conduct of justice and home affairs business and promoted a range of events during the United Kingdom presidency of the European Union in 1998. Officials and police representatives are also engaged in a wide range of co-operation and training with other countries.
<P>

<a name="11120w24.html_para7">A key objective for the United Kingdom is to ensure that the accession of new member states to the European Union does not adversely affect the safety of our citizens.

in partnership, sharing expertise and implementing the candidates' new European Union-compliant legislation. For example last year we successfully implemented a project to improve the quality of Poland's management of its eastern border and the effectiveness of its police force. Experts from the United Kingdom Forensic Science Service, National Criminal Intelligence Service and National Crime Squad worked with Dutch, French and German colleagues to deliver training and advice that will have a real and lasting effect.
<P>

<a name="11120w24.html_para8">The Home Office has led projects in the Czech Republic to improve relations with the Roma community and to help their authorities combat organised and financial crime. In conjunction with our law enforcement agencies, we are also leading projects in Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Lithuania.

<P>
<a name="11120w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government take the problem of card fraud very seriously and are currently working closely with the finance and retail sectors and the police to establish and promote best practice in protecting cards and introduce ways of preventing this type of fraud.
<P>

<a name="11120w25.html_para0">One major initiative is the planned introduction of microchips into payment cards to help authentication and the introduction of cardholder verification system using a Personal Identification Number (PIN) code in place of signatures to confirm the user is genuine. This commitment to phase in Chip and PIN was given at the third Home Office seminar on reducing cheque and credit card fraud in July. The banking industry anticipates that the phasing in of Chip and PIN technology by the end of 2004 will eliminate more than 80 per cent. of plastic card fraud.
<P>

<a name="11120w25.html_para1">Another initiative currently being considered is the setting up of a pilot dedicated joint police and industry national cheque and plastic card fraud squad.

<a name="11120w25.html_para2">In addition to this a working group of police and officials has been set up to consider ways of improving the response to all types of fraud.

 <i>[holding answer 15 November 2001]:</i> The Commissioner informs me that in 2000&#150;01 &#163;2,318,000 was paid by the Metropolitan Police Service as payments without prejudice in response to 220 civil actions or threatened actions against alleged police malpractice. As an action may involve more than one individual it is not possible to give the exact number of individuals that received payment. The highest payment was &#163;200,000 and the average payment was &#163;13,962.

<a name="11120w25.html_wqn4"><B> Ross Cranston: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the effect of the <i>(a)</i> Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 and <i>(b)</i> Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 on (i) under-age drinking and (ii) antisocial behaviour; and if he will make a statement.  [15330]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Confiscation of Alcohol (Young Persons) Act 1997 gives the police important powers to confiscate alcohol from under-age drinkers in public places. The view of the Association of Chief Police Officers is that these powers have proved to be effective in helping the police to combat disorder and nuisance arising from alcohol consumption by young people in public places. The law was further strengthened by the Licensing (Young Persons) Act 2000, which tightened the position relating to the sale and purchase of alcohol to or on behalf of persons under 18.
<P>

<a name="11120w25.html_para3">The Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 includes important new provisions relating to under-age drinking. It will place a duty on retailers to take positive steps to ensure that customers are 18 or over, and it will give the police and trading standards officers the power to undertake test purchasing, using minors, to enforce the 



<P>
<P><I>20 Nov 2001 : Column: 248W</I><P>
law against the sale of alcohol to under 18s. We expect these provisions, which we are planning to bring into effect on 1 December 2001, to go further in restricting young people's access to alcohol, which so often leads on to antisocial behaviour.
<P>

<a name="11120w25.html_para4">In addition, sections 12 to 16 of the 2001 Act, which came into effect on 1 September, provide local authorities with an adoptive power to designate public places where it will become an offence to continue to drink alcohol after being warned by a police officer not to do so. This adoptive power replaces, and builds on, the model Home Office byelaw which was adopted by 113 local authorities to restrict antisocial drinking in public places.

 <i>[holding answer 22 October 2001]:</i> The policy directorates of the national health service executive all had some interest in information technology management either for central data collection and processing or to support policy initiatives. The overall information management and technology policy was co-ordinated by the information policy unit and before that the information management group. The total expenditure however across the whole NHS executive was not separately collected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w25.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 October 2001]:</i> Information held centrally identifies 19 national health service trusts that have taken delivery of radiotherapy equipment (linear accelerators and simulators) over the past two years excluding those linear accelerators funded by the New Opportunities Fund. NHS trusts may purchase equipment through the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency; however it is not mandatory for NHS trusts to use NHS PASA and the relevant purchasing information in these instances would not be captured. In addition to this, some NHS trusts will have purchased other radiotherapy equipment for which comprehensive information is not available centrally.
<P>

<a name="11120w25.html_para6">Between 2000 and 2003 the Treasury Capital Modernisation Fund will fund at least 40 treatment planning systems and 24 simulators for radiotherapy provision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w26.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Air ambulances can have a role in delivering emergency care in rural areas and where road access is a problem. However, in 1995, the Department commissioned Sheffield university to report on air ambulances. The report failed to show clinical or cost benefits which would justify national health service investment. Currently, no air ambulance service receives public funding, although, in most cases the NHS continues to provide fully trained paramedics to crew these aircraft when they respond to emergencies. In recognition of growing public interest in this subject, further research has been commissioned into the contribution of air ambulances to the care and transportation of seriously ill patients in a modern NHS.

 Lord Moser's 1999 Report, "A Fresh Start", notes that perhaps as many as 7 million people (roughly one in five adults) in England have difficulties with functional literacy and numeracy. These adults have a wide range of needs, varying from those who cannot read and write or perform the simplest calculations, to those who simply need to brush up rusty skills. We are commissioning a new survey next year to provide an up-to-date assessment of the scale of basic skills need in England.

Our target is to improve the literacy and numeracy skills of 750,000 adults by 2004.

From 1999&#150;2000, students aged between 50 to 54 at the start of their course (this includes students who started their course after September 1998) can apply for a student loan as long as they can demonstrate to their awarding authority that they plan to return to employment after finishing their course.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. New student support arrangements were introduced from academic year 1998&#150;99. New students in 1998&#150;99 apart from certain specified exceptions received support for maintenance expenditure through means-tested grants (comprising about a quarter of the support available) and non income-assessed student loans (comprising about three quarters of the support available). In 1999&#150;2000 students who entered higher education from 1998&#150;99 onwards received support for maintenance expenditure entirely through loans, of which approximately three quarters of the value was non income-assessed. Loans made under these arrangements are repayable on an income contingent basis. The ratio of support for existing loans, ie those who entered higher education up to 1997&#150;98, was roughly 50 per cent. means-tested grant and 50 per cent. non means-tested loan repayable on a mortgage style basis.<P>

2. Mandatory awards are awarded by local education authorities (LEAs) in England and Wales to eligible students normally domiciled in their area.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what action she will take to ensure that those teachers who crossed the payment threshold as a result of threshold allowance awards in the financial year 2001&#150;02 will pay the same level of taxation on their increased salary as those who passed the payment threshold in the previous financial year.

<a name="11120w30.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Because the original timetable for threshold assessment was delayed by the judicial review initiated by the National Union of Teachers, some teachers did not receive their threshold pay rise before April 2001. These teachers will therefore receive both their 2000&#150;01 threshold back pay and their 2001&#150;02 threshold pay in the current financial year. In most cases this should not affect their tax position. However a minority might have to pay some higher rate tax as a result. For employees covered by PAYE income is taxable when it is received. This is a fundamental principle of the tax system that cannot be changed for teachers who might find themselves in this position. But we will do all we can to ensure that teachers who apply for threshold assessment this year receive their pay rise by March 2002.

 Key skills are important for everyone. They are an integral part of post-16 programmes in schools, colleges and the work-based route.

We are keen that all students have the opportunity to improve their key skills.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has been asked to ensure that its funding regime supports a more tailored use of key skills, reflecting individual students' goals and needs. In work-based learning, the funding of key skills is included in the overall funding of the Modern Apprenticeship programme. In colleges, the level of funding available for key skills and the entitlement package is not affected by this improved flexibility; it is no longer dependent upon a fixed pattern of key skills provision and achievement. The LSC will take over post-16 funding of schools from April 2002.

Around 50 per cent. of students are not required to make any contribution at all; 15 per cent. make a partial contribution, and 35 per cent. make the full contribution. The cost of higher education tuition is already heavily subsidised by the Government, both through the means testing system and because fees only meet a quarter of the average cost of a course. In these circumstances a further

Annual Schools Census in January for over 20 years. In order to provide a true representation of the sizes of classes experienced by children, each school is randomly allocated a specific time on the census day at which class sizes should be reported. The current collection asks for the number of pupils, teachers and teaching assistants in the class at the appropriate time and also for its Key Stage and National Curriculum Year Group. The activity in which the class is engaged is also requested.

<a name="11120w31.html_para2">The September Class Size Count is a separate collection started in 1998, introduced to monitor class sizes at Key Stage one. The statistical method used is the same as in the January Census, but, in order to lessen the burden on schools, information is only collected from primary schools and about classes where the majority of children will reach the appropriate age during the school year. The information required about each class in September 2001 was the number of pupils, teachers and teaching assistants and the activity in which the class was engaged and, for classes of 31 or more, the number of excepted pupils.

The available figures for Great Britain, showing the proportion of under 21 year olds who enter higher education for the first time, are given in the table. There was an increase in the index in 1997&#150;98 related partly to changes in the funding arrangements for higher education, with students choosing to enter HE rather than wait until 1998&#150;99. There was a corresponding reduction in 1998&#150;99 before the entry rates started to increase again in 1999&#150;2000. Between 1997&#150;98 and 2000&#150;01, total HE students in English universities and colleges rose by 83,000.

 HM Customs and Excise do not have estimates for the amount of fuel entering Northern Ireland as a result of cross-border smuggling.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician and Registrar General for England and Wales, I have been asked to reply to your recent questions to the Chancellor of the Exchequer asking:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. whether the Office for National Statistics authorised the case of government-held personal records held about (a) asylum seekers and (b) other categories of people during the compilation of the 2001 Census returns (16336);</FONT></UL>

<BR>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In response to the first question you will want to be aware that the Registrar General is authorised by the terms of the Census Act 1920 to conduct a census in England and Wales.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Census Order 2000 (Statutory Instrument 2000 no. 744) made under Section 1 of the Census Act, prescribes the persons by whom and in respect of whom the returns are to be made. Returns were required to be made in respect to all persons who are usually resident

</UL></FONT><P><I>20 Nov 2001 : Column: 274W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in England and Wales. For the purpose of the 2001 Census a person was regarded as being 'usually resident' in England and Wales if he or she was present at an address in England and Wales on census night and had no other usual address in England and Wales or elsewhere. This would, therefore, generally include asylum seekers, and thus the Census Act imposed a duty on me to collect returns from such people.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Census Regulations 2000 (Statutory Instrument 2000 no. 1473), made under section 3 of the Act, empowered the making of any such arrangements as the Registrar General thinks fit for the collection of the particulars prescribed by the Census Order to be stated in the returns.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For this purpose, the Registrar General was able to make arrangements where necessary to acquire information from official sources on the location of accommodation that housed asylum seekers and on other population sub-groups (such as rough sleepers), which would enable forms to be delivered and collected in respect of such people who might not otherwise be aware of their statutory duty to make a return or have access to the forms.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In all cases the provision of such information would have been a matter for the data custodian of that information. The subsequent uses of the information for Census purposes were within the terms of the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998, and the strict confidentiality provisions of the Census Act as amended by the Census (Confidentiality) Act 1991.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In answer to your second and third questions, there were no provisions or arrangements made in the conduct of the 2001 Census for access to any individual personal information held by Government departments or agencies by census enumerators, and consequently no guidance given to enumerators on any such access.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w33.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The treatment of this type of contract will depend on how it is classified by the Department's accountants and the National Audit Office. If it is classified as a finance lease, it is included in net investment and net worth. If it is classified as an operating lease, it will not be. The decision will depend on whether it is the private or public sector which bears most of the economic risks and rewards associated with the asset.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11120w33.html_spnew8"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Responsibility for the prudential regulation of banks and building societies now rests with the Financial Services Authority (FSA). In addition, the FSA is taking on responsibility for regulating mortgage lending. Both the Government and FSA consider it important that mortgage borrowers should not be exploited by lending in circumstances where they are self-evidently unable to repay through income but have no alternative repayment plans. The FSA is therefore setting rules in respect of responsible lending. Lenders will be required to show that they have taken account of a borrower's ability to repay the loan before entering into a regulated mortgage contract with him.

<P>
<a name="11120w33.html_spnew13"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is set up to provide compensation if an FSA regulated financial services firm&#151;bank, building society, investment firm or insurer&#151;collapses. The FSCS is funded by these firms. The FSCS does not, therefore, cover claims against insolvent employers who did not hold insurance with a regulated insurer.
