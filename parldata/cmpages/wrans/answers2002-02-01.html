<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 As First Secretary of State the Deputy Prime Minister continues to deputise for me as required, drawing on the resources of other parts of the Cabinet Office as necessary. He oversees the work of the Social Exclusion Unit, which reports to me through him. He is also responsible for the Regional Co-ordination Unit and the nine Government Offices for the Regions. I have also asked him to be responsible for a White Paper on Regional Governance, in close liaison with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and in co-operation with other Cabinet colleagues.
<P>

<a name="20201w01.html_para0">On international matters the Deputy Prime Minister supports me. He continues to play a role in international climate change discussions and negotiations on my behalf. More recently, I have also asked the Deputy Prime Minister to take on a similar role in preparation for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) to be held in Johannesburg in September 2002. In addition he sees visiting dignitaries and undertakes overseas visits on my behalf; and oversees the work of the International Public Service Group. He also carries ministerial responsibility for the British-Irish Council and will deputise for me as necessary at meetings of the Council.
<P>

<a name="20201w01.html_para1">The Deputy Prime Minister chairs Cabinet Committees on domestic affairs and on the nations and regions; and Sub-Committees on social exclusion and regeneration and on energy policy. He also chairs the newly established Ministerial Group (MISC18) on WSSD and continues to chair the Committee on the environment.

To ask the Prime Minister what criteria he uses to appoint <i>(a)</i> lords-lieutenant and <i>(b)</i> deputy lords-lieutenant; if he will list the names of deputy lords-lieutenant for each county; and what his estimate is of the average number of official engagements per week of (i) lords-lieutenant and (ii) deputy lords- lieutenant undertaken for each county.  [32581]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w01.html_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 In England, consultations which help to inform the appointment area are carried out by the Prime Minister's Secretary for Appointments. In Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland consultations are carried out by the relevant Administration or Department. Those appointed as lords-lieutenant are people of standing in their local communities, most frequently on account of their record of voluntary activity for the good of the community.
<P>

<a name="20201w01.html_para2">Deputy lieutenants are appointed by the lord-lieutenant at his or her discretion, subject only to Her Majesty not disapproving of the grant of the commission. As of July 2001 there were approximately 2,720 deputy lieutenants
<P>

<a name="20201w01.html_para3">It is not possible to estimate the number of official engagements for each lord-lieutenant or deputy lieutenant, which will reflect such matters as the size and population of the county or area concerned, the demand for such engagements, and the views and judgment of the lords- lieutenant themselves.

<P>
<a name="20201w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister how many lords-lieutenant he has appointed for each county since assuming this responsibility.  [32575]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w01.html_spmin5"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Lords-lieutenant are appointed under current legislation by Her Majesty the Queen on the advice of the Prime Minister of the day. In the case of Scotland and Wales the Prime Minister is himself advised by the relevant First Minister and in Northern Ireland by the Secretary of State. Since 2 May 1997 31 lords- lieutenant have been appointed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w01.html_spmin6"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I am pleased to be able to announce that Dame Rennie Fritchie has been reappointed for a further term of three years when her current appointment comes to an end on 28 February. Dame Rennie has fulfilled her role as regulator of the public appointments system in a resolute and distinguished manner over the last three years. She has made a major

<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w01.html_spmin7"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 I have asked the Performance and Innovation Unit (PIU) to carry out a joint study with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport examining long-term sports policy. The project team will consider the roles and responsibilities of Government, and the private and voluntary sectors in helping sport better achieve the objectives of increased grassroots participation in sport and elite sporting excellence. The project team will clarify the roles and responsibilities and interventions of Government to help sport better achieve its own objectives. They will develop an overall strategy for guiding Government's decisions on sports policy (including major events), and review the existing institutional and financial arrangements, in the context of Government's own wider objectives. The initial scoping note for the project is available on the PIU website http:///www.piu.gov.uk/2001/sport/scope.shtml. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport will be the Sponsor Minister for the project. The unit aims to complete its study by summer 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what the total external spend by his Department was on Private Finance Initiative consultants in each of the last four years; how many full-time equivalent consultants were employed over this period; how many billed consultancy days there were per year; what the implied average cost of each PFI consultant was; how many consultancy firms were used by his Department over this period; and if he will make a statement.  [31034]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Since the Wales Office came into being in July 1999 it has incurred no such expenditure.
<P>

<a name="20201w01.html_para4">In the period from April 1998 to July 1999 the former Welsh Office spent some &#163;770,000 on consultancies relating to the PFI aspect of the A55 road in North Wales; there were also two secondees into the Welsh Office during that period advising on PFI matters.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what proportion of the departmental expenditure limit in 2001&#150;02 will be accounted for by salary costs and pension contributions.  [32017]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 At present I estimate that some 42 per cent. of the Wales Office Departmental Expenditure Limit for 2001&#150;02 is being spent on pay and pensions.

[32412]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B>

 Until August 2000 the leave entitlement for Welsh Office or National Assembly for Wales staff (including those seconded to my Department) was a minimum of 22 days a year rising to a maximum of 30 days. Since August 2000 it has been a minimum of 25 days rising to the same maximum of 30 days.
<P>

<a name="20201w01.html_para5">My Department also contains a small number of secondees from other Government Departments and local government; these staff retain the leave entitlement of their parent organisation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w02.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what use is made of video recordings made on public transport vehicles in the prosecution of criminal offences including traffic offences by the Metropolitan police; if he plans an extension of such use; and if he will make statement.  [30329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Images from closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras on public transport vehicles are used primarily to tackle crime on the vehicles themselves. I understand from the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis that CCTV is a key element of Operation Seneca which is currently targeted at reducing crime on selected bus routes. It has led to a number of arrests for crimes such as robbery, disorder, drugs possession and weapons offences, and has also resulted in a considerable decrease in reported crime on the routes concerned.




<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 2002 : Column 571W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20201w02.html_para1">CCTV cameras are also used to identify bus lane infringements, although these are not criminal offences. Traffic offences are enforced by means of speeding and red light cameras.
<P>

<a name="20201w02.html_para2">Any plans to extend the use of CCTV on public transport vehicles in London would be an operational matter for the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what initiatives the Government have taken to <i>(a)</i> reorganise and <i>(b)</i> simplify access to state funded competitive grant schemes for (i) community and (ii) voluntary groups;  [29930]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether a particular Minister has been given specific responsibility for rationalising and simplifying access to state funding for voluntary and community organisations;  [29925]

<P>
(4) what research the Government have conducted into the administrative requirements on voluntary and community organisations making applications to the system of state funded competitive grant schemes.  [29926]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w02.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> In drawing up the Compact on Relations between Government and the voluntary and community sector in England, Funding Code, the Home Office took note of the report of the Commission on the future of the voluntary sector, published in June 1996, entitled "Meeting the challenge of change: voluntary action into the 21st Century", and provided funding to the National Council for Voluntary Organisations to conduct an extensive consultation with the voluntary and community sector and Government Departments.
<P>

<a name="20201w02.html_para3">The study currently being undertaken by the Regional Co-ordination Unit (RCU) into improving access to regeneration and community funding consulted over 100 bodies and individuals, examined examples of differing administrative requirements imposed on funded bodies; and considered relevant previous research.
<P>

<a name="20201w02.html_para4">The recommendations arising from the RCU's study of regeneration funding are designed directly to simplify access to state funded competitive grant schemes for voluntary and community groups. In addition, my hon. Friend the Minister of State, Cabinet Office, is also currently reviewing the scope for improving the co-ordination and delivery of state funded grant schemes for the community and voluntary sectors.
<P>

<a name="20201w02.html_para5">The success of these various initiatives will be measured by the numbers and quality of applications received for individual programmes, a reduction in the number of ineligible applications, success in reaching targeted groups, such as marginalised and minority ethnic groups, and in the use made of the website. Monitoring will be undertaken by the departments managing individual programmes. The Active Community Unit is currently devising a common evaluation framework by which the success of simplification of small grants will be measured.




<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 2002 : Column 572W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20201w02.html_para6">There is no one Minister with specific responsibility for the rationalising and simplification of access to state funding for the voluntary and community sector, although I have responsibility for the Active Community Unit and will be taking a particular interest in this issue.

<a name="20201w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Randall: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many antisocial behaviour orders have been issued in each London borough in each three month period since their introduction.  [29364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Antisocial Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) are community-based civil orders, which can be applied for by the police or local authority, in consultation with each other against an individual or several individuals whose behaviour is antisocial. Applications are to the magistrates court acting in its civil capacity.
<P>

<a name="20201w02.html_para7">Information held centrally on the number of Antisocial Behaviour Orders issued up to 31 May 2000 is by police force area. Up to that date there were nine ASBOs issued within the Metropolitan Police area (including City of London).
<P>

<a name="20201w02.html_para8">From 1 June 2000 official statistics on the number of ASBOs issued are based on quarterly returns from Magistrates Courts Committees (MCCs) and are presently designed not to give figures below MCC level. A review of these statistics identified an undercount and my Department therefore undertook an exercise with the police to obtain more reliable figures. As a result of this reconciliation exercise the total number of ASBOs issued within England and Wales up to the end of September this year was 466, 184 more than previously reported. Within this total the quarterly figures for the Greater London Magistrates' Courts Authority are:

<P>
<a name="20201w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will compel mobile telephony companies to register the user's home address, e-mail and landline telephone number on their SIM cards.  [28951]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 January 2002]:</i> The Government believe that valid registration can help combat mobile phone theft by identifying the customer with his or her phone in order to authorise the blacklisting of stolen SIM cards or, where technically possible, the disabling of the stolen handset itself. It is already the case that contract phone users are required by all mobile phone operators to register their details and that the Subscriber Identification Module (SIM) card inside each mobile phone identifies the user with a full name, address and landline number (if available).




<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 2002 : Column 573W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20201w02.html_para9">Registration of pre-pay mobile phones is not at present compulsory. This is partly due to the European Community Communications Data Protection Directive 97/66 which encourages the development of telecommunications service options which allow anonymous or strictly private access, and also because compulsory registration may disadvantage low income users, who may be of no fixed abode. Orange is the only operator to require registration details from its pre-pay customers. We are encouraging the other major operators, which all have voluntary registration schemes for pre-pay customers, to enhance take-up of these schemes. We will keep the need for legislation under review on this and other measures.

<a name="20201w03.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the proposed introduction of <i>(a)</i> threshold payments, <i>(b)</i> special priority payments and <i>(c)</i> bonus payments to police officers; and what representations he has received from the Police Federation about the additional payments element of the Police Reform Programme.  [30112]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Police Negotiating Board (PNB), on which both the Secretary of State and the Police Federation are represented, reached agreement in principle on 27 December 2001 on a package of changes to police pay and conditions of service. The changes are set out in the Heads of Agreement.
<P>

<a name="20201w03.html_para0">The changes include a new competence-related payment of &#163;1,002 at the top of each of the federated ranks' pay scales. It is expected that at least 75 per cent. of those eligible&#151;that is, those who have spent at least a year at the top of the scale&#151;will receive the payment.
<P>

<a name="20201w03.html_para1">Under the new special priority payments scheme, officers could qualify for one-off payments of between &#163;500 and &#163;5,000 a year. Chief officers and police authorities will draw up a local scheme of payments, in consultation with local staff associations, having regard to national criteria and to guidance from the Secretary of State. The national criteria are that posts carry a significantly higher responsibility than the norm for the rank; or are particularly difficult to fill; or have specially arduous working conditions. All parties in PNB recognise that there are a number of specialist posts where long hours are a necessary and integral part of the officers' role rather than due to management failure.
<P>

<a name="20201w03.html_para2">In addition, chief constables will be able to award bonuses of between &#163;50 and &#163;500 for occasional work of an outstandingly demanding, unpleasant or important nature, such as hostage negotiation, or fingerprinting and searching badly decomposed bodies.
<P>

<a name="20201w03.html_para3">The Police Federation was party to the negotiations in PNB when it had the opportunity to make representations on all the proposed new payments.
<P>

<a name="20201w03.html_para4">The Heads of Agreement have to be ratified by the end of February.

<P>

<a name="20201w03.html_para6">Not all fines and fixed penalties will have been paid.
<P>

<a name="20201w03.html_para7">All fixed penalty fine revenue is passed to Her Majesty's Treasury. However, in April 2000, eight partnership areas, comprising local police forces, local authorities, highways authorities and magistrates courts, piloted a new 'netting-off' scheme. This allows a proportion of the fixed penalty fine revenue from speed and red-light cameras to be re-invested to fund camera enforcement. Fine revenue is used to meet each of the partners' costs in relation to the administration, purchase, installation, operation and maintenance of the cameras.

For DLA, we have recently made significant improvements to the claim form, we are currently revising all the forms used to obtain relevant information from doctors, health care professionals and others involved in the care of claimants, and in consultation with organisations representing disabled people, are testing an alternative system for extra-costs disability benefits based on activities for managing life.

 The 6ft 6in width restriction imposed on Widford Bridge is required for safety reasons to prevent vehicles of over three tonnes in weight from using the bridge. The Highways Agency would not wish to see any increase in the width of the restriction, as it would increase the likelihood of over weight vehicles attempting to use the bridge.

<a name="20201w07.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Keetch: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many members of <i>(a)</i> the Army, <i>(b)</i> the Royal Air Force and <i>(c)</i> the Royal Navy have changed from Maristat One in (i) 1999&#150;2000, (ii) 2000&#150;01 and (iii) 2001&#150;02 into marital category (1) decree absolute, (2) separated and (3) annulled; what proportion of each service strength this represents in each year; what proportion of each service married strength this represents in each year; and if he will make a statement.  [27675]<P>

<P>
<a name="20201w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 January 2002]:</i> Information on marital status is held on a different system for each service. It is not possible to answer the question exactly as phrased, as the categories specified cannot be isolated in every case. The available information is as follows.

<P>
<a name="20201w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The decision to withdraw the Batch 2 Type 22 frigate HMS Coventry from service on 31 December 2001 was part of the reduction in overall numbers of frigates and destroyers presaged by the Strategic Defence Review. There are no plans for a direct replacement, but HMS St. Albans, the final Type 23 frigate, which has considerably superior general purpose capabilities, has been accepted from the builders and is currently conducting sea trials as she prepares for full operational service later this year.

<a name="20201w08.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not hold the information requested by the hon. Member as claims for compensation from service or ex-service personnel involving asbestos related diseases have not traditionally been recorded separately. The Ministry of Defence does produce a Claims Annual Report, a copy of which is placed in the Library of the House. This document contains additional information on all aspects of common-law compensation claims against the Ministry of Defence, including asbestos-related claims.

<P>
<a name="20201w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Those details which are available are set out in the following table. This shows the actual numbers who left during initial recruitment training and this number as a percentage of those who started training. The wastage rates quoted include voluntary withdrawal, medical discharge, discharge by purchase and discharge Services No Longer Required.
<P>

<a name="20201w08.html_para0">For the Royal Air Force, the IST wastage rates in the table refer to Officers in the ground branches and do not take into account pilots, navigators and aircrew. Training for these groups can take many years and so final wastage rates for these years are not readily available. I will write to the hon. Member with full details of RAF Officer IST wastage rates and I will place a copy in the Library of the House.

<sup>(10)</sup> All figures for 2001&#150;02 cover the period up to 31 December 2001.<P>

<P>

<i>Royal Navy</i><P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(11)</sup> RN recruits join the trained strength after completing Phase 1 and Phase 2 training. Phase 1 training is one year for officers and eight weeks for ratings. Phase 2 training averages around 18 months for officers (but up to five years for Aircrew), three years for Artificer Apprentices and eight months for non-technical ratings.<P>

<P>

<i>Royal Marines</i><P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(12)</sup> The figures for RM Officers show the wastage rates while undergoing Phase 1 training at CTCRM Lympstone. No figures are available for failures in Phase 2 training; failures during this nine months phase are rare.<P>

<P>

<sup>(13)</sup> The majority of the RM Other Ranks training wastage consists of those who voluntarily withdraw (historically approximately 65 per cent. of the wastage figure) the remainder being split between those who are unsuitable and those who are medically discharged.<P>

<P>

<i>Army</i><P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(14)</sup> Army Officers are considered to have joined the trained strength after leaving Sandhurst when they become part of the UK Trained Army Personnel. Consolidated figures are available only from 1998&#150;99. Soldiers join the trained strength on completion of their Phase 2 trade training. Full details of the number of soldiers who left during initial training are available only from 2000&#150;01.<P>

<P>

<i>Royal Air Force</i><P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(15)</sup> RAF Officers, on completion of Initial Officer Training (IOT) which last for 24 weeks, go on to Initial Specialist Training (IST). No IOT or IST wastage rates figures are available yet for 2001&#150;02.<P>

<P>

<sup>(16)</sup> The OST wastage rates in the table refer to Officers in the ground branches and do not take into account pilots, navigators and aircrew. Training for these groups can take many years and so final wastage rates for these years are not readily available.<P>

<P>

<sup>(17)</sup> Airmen/airwomen join the trained strength after completion of both recruit training (Phase 1) and trade training (Phase 2). Recruit training is seven weeks. Trade training averages around 40 weeks and can last anything up to two years for specific trades. The percentage figures quoted for trade training wastage in years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 give the position as at 31 December 2001; at this date there were still 755 to complete training started in 2000&#150;01 and 1,832 airmen/airwomen who have started in 2001&#150;02.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what studies have been carried out by his Department into alternatives to cluster munitions for replacement of the BL 755 when it reaches the end of its service life.  [31633]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w09.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence keeps under continuous review its capability requirements in this area. To date, studies have concluded that the roles currently met by BL 755 are likely to be carried out by a range of different weapons in the future. Some of the roles will be met by existing or planned systems such as Maverick and Brimstone. This work has also concluded that cluster bombs will still retain some utility, particularly against area targets such as storage depots and concentrations of lighter armoured vehicles. No other weapon is currently available to meet the same military objectives. To fulfil the same role as cluster bombs with unitary bombs would require a far greater weight of explosives, which would risk far greater damage than using cluster bombs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what extra expenditure has been incurred by his Department as a result of the failure of the advanced short-range air-to-air missile to achieve its original in-service date; and if he intends to claim back the extra expenditure from the manufacturer;  [31099]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the new in-service date for the advanced short-range air-to-air missile is; and if he will make a statement.  [31098]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w09.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2002]:</i> The Advanced Short Range Air-to-Air Missile (ASRAAM) entered service in January 2002. As a result of a delay in the In Service Date, the Ministry of Defence has incurred additional costs of approximately &#163;7 million. These include extra intramural expenditure and costs arising from the need to maintain Sidewinder missiles in service. 



<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 2002 : Column 597W</I><P>
During the period in question we have also been without the additional capability provided by the ASRAAM missile. Liquidated damages associated with the late delivery of the missiles are being claimed from the manufacturer. Overall, the total procurement cost of ASRAAM remains less than the original approved cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w09.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how much the series of improved software releases to enhance MBDA's advanced short-range air-to-air missile will cost; when the final improved software releases are expected to be completed; and if he will make a statement.  [32156]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w09.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The cost of the additional software releases to achieve ASRAAM's Full Operational Capability will be borne by the contractor, MBDA UK Ltd. (formerly Matra BAe Dynamics), and is a matter for them.
<P>

<a name="20201w09.html_para0">The company's aim is to deliver the required missile performance by the end of 2003. If that is not achieved, our agreement with MBDA Uk allows for a further software release.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 No. As the 1998 Strategic Defence Review (Cm 3999) made clear, Trident is our only nuclear weapons system.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w09.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what US nuclear weapons are in the United Kingdom.  [31708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Some US nuclear weapons remain based in the UK in accordance with long-standing NATO policy. Nuclear forces based in Europe and committed to NATO provide an essential political and military link between the European and North American members of the Alliance. I am withholding any further details under Exemption 1 (Defence, Security and International Relations) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of a replacement to the Trident deterrent when it goes out of service.  [31709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 We have no current plans for a replacement for Trident, and no decision on any possible successor system is yet needed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w09.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many SLBMs the UK owns; and how many warheads are contained in each missile.  [31705]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w09.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The 1998 Strategic Defence Review concluded that the 58 Trident missile bodies already purchased from the USA would be sufficient to maintain a credible nuclear deterrent posture. While I am withholding information on the number of warheads deployed on each missile under Exemption 1 (Defence, Security and International Relations) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, I can confirm that, when on deterrence patrol, Trident submarines carry 48 nuclear warheads.

It is administered on behalf of the Ministry of Defence by The Royal British Legion and the MOD contributes seven-eighths of the costs of a visit. Over the past 17 years, this scheme has enabled over 4,000 widows to make this very special journey and there are no plans to change the arrangements.

 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2002]:</i> On 24 January two Spanish Navy patrol vessels entered British Gibraltar territorial waters during an operation by the Royal Navy to tow a suspected unexploded World War 2 bomb into deep water, following its discovery by the Mine Countermeasures Vessel HMS Grimsby during a routine survey. One of the Spanish vessels withdrew once the operation had been completed. The second remained in Gibraltar waters overnight, closely monitoring HMS Grimsby which continued her survey operation. Following contacts between the British Embassy in Madrid and the Spanish Government, this vessel left Gibraltar waters the following morning.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the cost of transporting two Tornados to the Falklands by <i>(a)</i> Antonov 124 and <i>(b)</i> C-17; what assessment he has made of the cost of using the (i) Antonov 124 and (ii) C-17 in operations in Afghanistan; and how many times the Antonov 124 has been leased by the RAF since the operational use of C-17s began.  [32146]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A full assessment has been made of the transportation of Tornado aircraft from the UK to the Falkland Islands. This included options for air-to-air refuelling, airlift charter, ship and C-17. Given all of the constraints, the C-17 was deemed to be the most suitable operational option and the one that gave the best value for money and best value for effort.
<P>

<a name="20201w10.html_para2">Until mid-January 2002, the threat assessment presented by surface-to-air missiles, specifically to identifiable military aircraft, limited our use of RAF aircraft operating into Afghanistan. The use of civilian Antonovs was less restricted. We therefore, chartered Antonovs for the essential operational movement of vehicles, equipment and supplies. While the C-17 is now being used for airlift to Afghanistan, the size of the task necessitates the continued charter of Antonov aircraft.
<P>

<a name="20201w10.html_para3">The Antonov has been chartered by MOD on 35 occasions since the delivery of the C-17 in May 2001. All of the tasks have been in support of operations. The C-17 



<P>
<P><I>1 Feb 2002 : Column 601W</I><P>
has been used extensively for Operation Bessimer in Macedonia, Exercise Saif Sareea II and other operational tasks associated with Operation Veritas.
<P>

<a name="20201w10.html_para4">It is not, therefore, a question of a simple cost comparison between the use of C-17 or Antonovs. Both were needed to support operations.

 As part of the public-private partnership for the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), the DERA Trading Fund Agency was disestablished on 1 July 2001. From its constituent parts two new organisations were created: QinetiQ plc, a wholly Government owned company, and the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl), an agency of the MOD.
<P>

<a name="20201w10.html_para5">At 1 January 2002, Dstl employed 3,037 staff in total. Of these, 54 were employed in Scotland. Dstl's current staff budget is &#163;102.7 million of which &#163;1.2 million relates to Scotland. The total value of Dstl assets at end of January 2002 amounted to some &#163;257 million, with just over &#163;0.5 million of this in Scotland, which represents some 0.2 per cent. of the total Dstl assets.

 Figures for the amount the Ministry of Defence spends on defence equipment and non-equipment for the years 1998&#150;99 to 2001&#150;02 are published by the Defence Analytical Services Agency in UK Defence Statistics (available in the Library of the House). These data, which are given in the table, are broadly split by type ie whether it is air, land, sea or 'other' equipment for the years where this information is available. The 'other' category refers to equipment not specific to a particular environment. This division (air, land, sea and other) does not necessarily match the particular end destination of the equipment (ie RAF, Army and Navy). For example, not aerospace equipment is used by the RAF.
<P>

<a name="20201w10.html_para6">During 1999&#150;2000, we estimate that the MOD spent some &#163;600 million on defence equipment directly with contractors based in Scotland. A breakdown of this into air, land, sea and 'other' is not available.

<sup>(18)</sup> Over the last 20 years the coverage of the defence budget has changed in that:<P>

<P>

from 1983&#150;84, it has included accommodation (maintenance and rental) and home publicity;<P>

from 1990&#150;91, it has included rates on the Defence portion of the UK Civil Estate included in the defence budget;<P>

from 1991&#150;92, it has included services provided by the Treasury Solicitor and the Inland Revenue;<P>

from 1993&#150;94, it has included provision for charges for pension cover for currently serving service and civilian personnel but excluded pension payments to retired service personnel; and<P>

from 1994&#150;95, it has excluded provision for the Security and Intelligence Services.<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(19)</sup> All figures in table 1.1 and estimates in table 1.3 were derived from the Supply Estimates for each year. Estimates are 'latest agreed' at time of going to press.<P>

<P>

<sup>(20)</sup> Figures for 1999&#150;2000 onwards, do not include the air, land sea split for equipment expenditure due to a change in accounting practice.<P>

<P>

<sup>(21)</sup> From 1990&#150;91 to 1994&#150;95, includes financial assistance to pre-1973 war widows.<P>

<P>

<sup>(22)</sup> From 1995&#150;96, military aid to overseas countries has been excluded from the NATO definitions.<P>

<P>

<sup>(23)</sup> The 'Adjusted Defence Budget' takes account of major definitional changes in defence spending and of major transfers of responsibility to and from Government Departments. It therefore provides a more consistent and reliable guide to trends. This is the basis upon which defence spending figures are present in the MOD Departmental Report, the Statement on the Defence Estimates and certain Treasury publications. Totals for 1999&#150;2000 represent final outturn and for 2000&#150;01 estimated outturn. Figures in this line also exclude the element of receipts from the sale of the Married Quarters Estate that were appropriated onto Defence Votes.<P>

<P>

<sup>(24)</sup> These constant price totals have been calculated using the GDP deflator.<P>

<P>

<sup>(25)</sup> Percentage of total expenditure/budget.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Defence votes differed from defence budgets:<P>

by excluding the funding of major works on the Civilian Estate until 1988&#150;89;<P>

by Appropriations-in-Aid and expenditure not classified as public expenditure; and<P>

from 1993&#150;94 charges for pensions cover for serving service personnel are Appropriations-in-Aid of Defence Vote 4, (Defence Vote 2 from 1999&#150;2000) and reflected in the 'other adjustments' line of Table 1.1.<P>





2. Expenditure are based on current market prices; the Defence figure in 1990&#150;91 is net of contributions (about &#163;2.1 billion) from abroad in respect of UK defence activities in the Gulf war.<P>

3. Figures for 1996&#150;97 and 1997&#150;98 include the element of receipts (&#163;304 million and &#163;700 million respectively) from the sale of the Married Quarters Estate that were appropriated on to defence votes.<P>

 No arrangements exist for pensioners to receive benefits in cash under the Armed Forces Pension Scheme. From April 2002, however, the weekly Payable Order Book method of payment applicable to some 2 per cent. of all pensioners, will cease. Under the new arrangements they will have the option of having their pension credited to a bank of building society account, or by a voucher sent to their home address encashable through a bank or building society. Both options allow payments to be made on a weekly or monthly basis.

 Under the directive, producers are required to pay all or a significant part of the costs of take-back and treatment from 1 January 2007 onwards. A decision on who will pay before this date will be made shortly. The directive requires member states to take measures to ensure that economic operators attain certain reuse and recovery, including recycling, targets by specified dates, the first of which is 1 January 2006. Economic operators are defined in the directive as producers, distributors, collectors, motor vehicle insurance companies, dismantlers, shredders, recoverers, recyclers and other end-of-life vehicle treatment operators.

<a name="20201w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Policy Commission on the future of farming and food made ambitious recommendations for a significant increase in the rate of modulation as a vehicle to transfer further CAP moneys out of production subsidies to deliver broader land management and environmental outputs. The Government accept we should now consider this option very carefully indeed. We will also look to secure agreement in the CAP mid term reviews to broaden the scope of what funds generated by modulation can be spent on. Subject to discussions with the devolved Administrations and with European Commission, securing that increased flexibility on modulation will be the Government's objective.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the European Commission's decision to cut oilseed support commensurate with Agenda 2000; and if she will make a statement on her Department's policy on the levels of protein imported in the European Union.  [31519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The progressive alignment of EU area payment rates for oilseeds with those for cereals is provided for in Council Regulation 1251/99, which implements the decisions on CAP reform taken by the European Council in March 1999, as part of the Agenda 2000 agreement.
<P>

<a name="20201w15.html_para4">Article 10.2 of the regulation requires the European Commission to submit a report to the Council by 30 June 2002 on the development of the oilseeds market in the light of those decisions. This assessment will therefore form part of the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 later this year.
<P>

<a name="20201w15.html_para5">In addition, in response to a request from the Agriculture Council in December 2000, the European Commission has already produced a report on the options for increasing EU plant protein production following the Council's decision to ban meat and bone meal (MBM) from animal rations. The report notes that there is a plentiful supply of plant proteins on the world market and that EU is already the world's largest importer of oilmeals. In the light of this, it concludes that the most cost effective and least trade distorting solution is to look to the world market to make-up the gap left by the MBM ban, rather than to subsidise additional EU plant protein production. The Government agree with the Commission's analysis and fully supports the conclusions reached.

 <i>[holding answer 14 November 2001]:</i> The National Service Framework (NSF) for older people, published in March 2001, outlines a programme of action for the national health service to reduce the incidence of stroke in the population and to ensure that those who have had a stroke have prompt access to integrated care services. A programme of research to underpin the implementation of the NSF is currently being planned by the Department. Funders forums have been established in cardiovascular disease research and in older people's research; research into stroke is likely to be of interest to both.
<P>

<a name="20201w15.html_para6">The Department's main national programmes of research which includes the NHS research and development programmes and the policy research programme, are currently funding a number of research projects into stroke. These include many projects with forward commitments over the next three years. Details of projects are available on the national research register at www.doh.gov.uk/research/nrr.htm.
<P>

<a name="20201w15.html_para7">The NHS research and development programme on service delivery and organisation has recently funded a five-year project on "Continuity of care in stroke and its relation to outcomes". A call for proposals has recently been advertised for the NHS research and development programme on the new and emerging applications of technology, which includes stroke as one of the priority areas. Funding will be dependent on the quality of proposals.
<P>

<a name="20201w15.html_para8">In addition to funding specific projects, the Department also provides and will continue to provide support for research commissioned by charities and the research councils that takes place in the NHS. Much of this will include research on strokes.
<P>

<a name="20201w15.html_para9">The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. The MRC operates in response mode, and it is therefore difficult to predict expenditure over the coming years. However the MRC spent &#163;3.4 million on stroke research in 2000&#150;01 and does not anticipate a major change to this level of support.

work will be for a short timescale and with a minimum amount of funding as a major investment has already been made within the ERDIP programme. These sites have already received various amounts of funding over and above health authority allocations. The Department is currently considering a small number of sites that can do additional work linked to NHS Plan priorities that can be delivered by the 5 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="20201w16.html_para2">ERDIP is a national co-ordination programme, which seeks to develop solutions to national problems. The purpose of setting up the demonstrator communities was to: demonstrate the achievements in improving health and healthcare through making faster progress in their plans to modernise care, and demonstrating robust techniques and good practice reproducible on a national basis; act as a focus for the identification, definition and testing of standards and good practice; raise awareness of what is possible, and the health and healthcare benefits that can be achieved; and provide learning and feedback for the wider National Health Service community. The two patient access sites at Bury Knowle and Hadfield are an integral part of this programme.
<P>

<a name="20201w16.html_para3">A key element of the information management and technology strategy is to enable health communities to make decisions on procurement of software and hardware based on existing systems and reflecting local circumstances. The Government are supporting the NHS in this by ensuring that the additional money allocated for the implementation of the targets in 'Information for Health, Building the Information Core' and the NHS Plan reaches the level at which the decisions are taken. A majority of the money therefore goes out as part of health authority allocations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the problem of bed blocking in hospitals located in the Buckinghamshire health authority.  [30055]<P>

<P>
<a name="20201w17.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 On 9 October 2001 we announced additional funding of &#163;300 million to tackle delayed discharges this year and next. Buckinghamshire was recognised as a local authority in need of extra help and was allocated &#163;713,000 of additional funding this year and will receive &#163;1.5 million in 2002&#150;03.

<P>
<a name="20201w17.html_wqn3"><B> Tim Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what measures he is taking to increase the provision of speech therapists dealing with children and adults with autism;  [31884]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether he will consider introducing ring-fenced funding to promote the greater provision of speech therapists dealing with people with autism;  [31885]
<P>
(3) how many speech therapists are available to deal with people with autism in each health authority in England and Wales.  [31886]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Speech and language therapists have a broad range of responsibilities and autism is one of the many important disorders with which they can help. The proportion of their time devoted to treatment of people with autism varies according to local needs assessment. So it is not possible to quantify the amount of speech and language therapy that is used to specifically treat autism. As at September 2000 there were 5,343 (headcount) speech and language therapists working in the national health service with 4,070 whole-time equivalents.
<P>

<a name="20201w17.html_para2">Between 1997 and 2000 the number of speech and language therapists working in the national health service has increased by 560 (11 per cent.) and the number of training places available for students has increased by over a hundred since 1998. There will be further increases in the number of students entering training as a result of the NHS Plan commitment to provide 4,450 more training places each year for therapists and other health professionals by 2004. The increased investment in training, work to make the national health service a better employer and investment in return to practice initiatives will result in a continuing increase in the number of speech therapists available to work in the national health service.
<P>

<a name="20201w17.html_para3">It is for health authorities in partnership with primary care groups/trusts and other local stakeholders to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health, tackling health inequalities and modernising services.

 The latest Student Income and Expenditure Survey (SIES) showed that in 1998&#150;99 most students could meet all their essential expenditure from the student loan, which has since been raised annually in line with inflation. The SIES and other surveys suggest that students are meeting additional costs of entertainment and consumer goods from family income, commercial credit and part-time working.

 In order to acquire qualified teacher status (QTS), all trainee teachers must, as part of their initial teacher training, demonstrate that they can identify pupils with special educational needs (SEN). This includes those who may have autistic spectrum disorders.
<P>

<a name="20201w19.html_para0">The Government have made a significant investment in support of SEN. Through the Department's standards fund 2001&#150;02, we are supporting local expenditure of &#163;82 million on SEN. One of the expenditure headings is in-service training and development of teachers, and other staff, including learning support assistants. In 2002&#150;03, we are increasing this investment to &#163;91 million. Training will again be a major component, extended to cover training in disability, as well as SEN, in order to help schools and local education authorities prepare for their responsibilities under the Special Education Needs and Disability Act 2001, and the implementation of the new SEN Code of Practice.
<P>

<a name="20201w19.html_para1">In addition, the Department has also introduced in 2002&#150;03 two new funding streams specifically to support the creation of new training opportunities and resources for teachers, and other staff, linked to a number of key priorities. One of these is supporting those who work with pupils with learning difficulties, including pupils with autistic spectrum disorders. Competitive bids have been invited from voluntary organisations, as part of the Department's SEN small programmes fund, and from higher education institutions, under the new SEN training and development fund. &#163;2 million will able available under these initiatives.
<P>

<a name="20201w19.html_para2">With regard to advertising campaigns, the Government have introduced a significant number of recruitment measures to help schools to recruit the teachers they need.

 The Secretary of State welcomes initiatives which aim to improve our knowledge and understanding of autism and raise awareness of the condition. Better outcomes for children with autism are encouraged by early identification and intervention to meet their special educational needs. In 2002, the Department for Education and Skills will be publishing guidance for schools, local education authorities and others which will include pointers to good practice on provision for children with autism, including early identification. The Department will continue to work with

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the annual receipts derived from payment of income tax, capital gains tax, national insurance and VAT paid by the top <i>(a)</i> one per cent., <i>(b)</i> five per cent. and <i>(c)</i> 10 per cent. of earners and the bottom (i) one per cent., (ii) five per cent. and (iii) 10 per cent. of earners.

<a name="20201w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The available information is given in the table. The bottom 1 per cent., 5 per cent., and 10 per cent. of earners do not pay income tax on their earnings. The bottom decile of earners could be liable to capital gains tax and income tax (if they have significant investment income); however, it is not possible to provide reliable estimates. It is also not possible to estimate amounts of VAT paid by individuals in different parts of the earnings distribution.

<a name="20201w20.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Blunt: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much duty was raised at each Northern Ireland duty point in respect of all types of fuel and diesel in <i>(a)</i> 1998&#150;99, <i>(b)</i> 1999&#150;2000 and <i>(c)</i> 2000&#150;01; and how much duty was raised in the UK in respect of all types of fuel and diesel in the same three periods.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the impact on the manufacturers of added value aggregate products of the introduction of the Aggregates Levy.  [31573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The higher price of primary aggregate will provide an incentive to all users, including the producers of value added products, to make more efficient use of aggregates and better use of alternative materials. The impact on the actual costs to the end user will be dependent on the commercial decisions of aggregates suppliers.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of how many incorrect tax codes have been sent to company car drivers as a result of the introduction of the carbon dioxide emissions-based system; and if he will make a statement on the implications for the Exchequer.  [31961]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20201w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 For the majority of company car drivers the Inland Revenue have had to estimate the value of company car benefit for 2002&#150;03 because they do not hold the necessary information required to calculate the figure under the new rules. In about 280,000 cases the provisional amount of benefit included in the coding notices may not have been calculated on the basis of information already supplied by employers. In those cases the Inland Revenue have made it clear that revised coding notices will be issued before the start of the new tax year.

 Government Departments are responsible for their own contracts, however OGCbuying.solutions offer framework contracts that are available to the whole of central Government. There are three contracts in place with Esso covering heating oils and motor fuels.

<a name="20201w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The UK Government have been at the forefront internationally of pressing to ensure that savings on debt relief are linked to the development of comprehensive national poverty reduction strategies. Education is a key feature of these plans.

<a name="20201w20.html_para1">Countries receiving HIPC debt relief have benefited from increased social spending of $1.7 billion in 2001&#150;02, equivalent to 1.2 per cent. of their GDP. Education spending has accounted for 40 per cent. of the savings made on debt, equivalent to nearly $700 million in 2001&#150;02. The World bank and the IMF are currently preparing a report, to be presented to the board, to further track the spending of HIPC finance.

 It would not be appropriate to provide specific information on the extent and nature of discussions within Government on matters of policy, as Exemption 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information provides.

<a name="20201w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 This is a complex area of EC VAT law, centring on the interpretation and application of the rules that govern the 'place of taxation' of services. The Government currently have the treatment of internet access packages under review, and have held discussions with a range of interested bodies. The Government are also negotiating for relevant changes to be made to EC VAT law in order to provide lasting clarity and certainty in this area.
