<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="80714w0004.htm_para0"><a name="0807143000768">No records are kept of the amount and value of fish purchased that meet the Marine Stewardship Council's environmental standard for sustainable fishing. However, the current instructions issued to suppliers of fresh and frozen fish expressly stipulate that &#147;all fish supplied must come from approved sustainable sources&#148; and provide specific provenance requirements in the case of cod, haddock and other fish regarded as over-exploited by the Marine Stewardship  Council or Marine Conservation Society. Furthermore, the House is currently in the process of letting a new contract for the supply of fish. Both the Marine Stewardship Council and the Seafish Industry Authority had input into the specification of requirements regarding environmental sustainability standards, and the relevant clauses were developed using the toolkit provided by DEFRA under the Public Sector Food Procurement Initiative.</p>

 The total cost of the refurbishment of the e-Library to create the Members' Centre was &#163;38,100. The furnishings installed in the centre cost &#163;25,900 and the technological equipment cost &#163;12,200. The centre was established as a part of the response to Sir Kevin Tebbit&#146;s review of the management and services of the House. It is intended to help provide a more integrated and responsive service to hon. Members and to their staff across the range of the services provided by House Departments. Benefits were assessed against costs before the centre was commissioned, though no formal cost/benefit analysis was conducted. The extent of the centre's use, and the support it has received from hon. Members and their staff, albeit after just one week of operation, suggests that the centre will fully justify its costs.</p>

 The Administration Committee considered proposals prepared by the Parliamentary ICT (PICT) Directorate in June 2008 for improving support and services to Members and their staff while working away from the Parliamentary Estate, and specifically in their constituency offices. The proposals included:</p>
<a name="80714w0004.htm_brev3"><a name="0807143000815"><ul><p class="tabletext">1. Regionally based engineering services that can provide a face to face response to Members and their staffs' issues more quickly than can be achieved at present.</p>

 The contract with Demon, the third party service provider, is subject to regular review meetings with Demon. Some service issues have already been addressed. For example, through collaborative working between BT and Demon disruption to broadband services due to constituency office moves has been reduced considerably.

It will provide practitioners with training and materials to enable them to support children&#146;s speaking and listening skills more effectively and free up time for practitioners to spend working with parents to enrich the home environment and networking with each other to share good practice.

We are pressing for robust sustainability standards for all biomass fuels. Domestically, the renewable transport fuel obligation is designed to encourage the use of only the right sort of transport biofuels. Fuel suppliers have to report on the carbon savings of their biofuels and their wider environmental impacts. We are taking forward the key findings of the Gallagher review which looked at the indirect effects of biofuels on land use change and the consequences for greenhouse gas savings, and the effects on food prices.</p>

This amount is determined, in part, by the amount of packaging handled.

 The humanitarian situation in Sri Lanka is remains very serious. As a result of violence, long-term conflict and the 2006 tsunami, there are over 800,000 internally displaced persons. The continuous closure of the main A9 highway linking the Jaffna peninsula with the mainland has made land access impossible for the mainly Tamil speaking residents, severely compromised the local economy and led to the increase in the prices of essential items. Internally displaced people from the Jaffna district as well as parts of north-eastern Sri Lanka remain unable to return to their homes due to the demarcation of large areas as &#147;High Security Zones&#148;.</p>

In September 2007, the Department for International Development (DFID) contributed &#163;1 million to the UN and the International Committee of the Red Cross to help provide protection and humanitarian assistance to people affected by the violence. DFID has already contributed a further &#163;250,000 to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) 2008 Appeal.

 The revised Magistrates Courts Sentencing Guidelines are the responsibility of the independent Sentencing Guidelines Council, operating within the sentencing framework laid down by Parliament. The Court of Appeal, which has a crucial role in interpreting the law&#151;has recently made clear&#151;Sir Igor Judge&#146;s judgment in the case of R <i> v</i>. Povey and others&#151;that possession of a knife is &#147;a serious offence and it should be treated with the seriousness it deserves&#148;.

In addition, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced on 5 June an end to cautions for knife possession&#151;replacing it with a presumption to prosecute. Anyone over the age of 16 caught in possession of a knife can expect to be prosecuted on the first offence rather than cautioned.</p>

 The development of the carbon capture and storage industry is still in its very early stages and therefore it is difficult to estimate the number of jobs that would be created.

The main discussion was on the renewable energy directive, with the debate focused on the sustainability of biofuels and flexibilities required for the EU to achieve the 20 per cent. renewable energy target in a cost-effective way. There was also an exchange of national best practice on energy efficiency and a presentation on energy security in advance of the 2nd Strategic Energy Review, expected to be published later this year.

 The Department has been informed by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) that it expects to have to grant an indemnity against uninsurable claims arising from a nuclear incident that fall outside the protections offered by the Nuclear Installations Act and the Paris/Brussels Convention to whichever of the four bidders for the Sellafield contract is successful. The NDA is conducting the Sellafield parent body organisation competition under the EU Competitive Dialogue procedure, evaluating the four bids received against agreed evaluation criteria. Within that process bidders were invited to make proposals for a nuclear indemnity under competitive tension against an established framework. It would not be viable for any of the bidders to proceed without an indemnity because any fee earning benefits of the contract would be overwhelmed by the potential liabilities. The NDA has assessed that the benefits of engaging a new contractor far outweigh the remote risk that an indemnity might be called upon. The final form of the indemnity will reflect the specific terms proposed by the preferred bidder.</p>

The QCF is concerned with the outcomes of learning, rather than context, process or delivery institution. It can recognise achievements through any of these definitions. Provided the outcomes of learning are organised into a unit format, they can be given a level and a credit value and count towards a qualification irrespective of the process of learning that leads to these outcomes.</p>

All of the incidents were a result of errors made by either British Airways or the British Airports Authority staff. UKBA staff worked closely with the airport operator to redirect passengers to the appropriate area in order to complete all of the necessary immigration checks. This was successful on two occasions, although on the other three, a number of passengers had already left the domestic area.</p>

This Guidance asks companies to consider a risk assessment approach to their services and considering putting in place a range of potential safeguards where risks to children do occur.

 No; it was always our intention to apply the local housing allowance to all customers who move address.

<i> [holding answer 10 July 2008]:</i> The presence of UK and other ISAF troops has already contributed significantly in transforming Afghanistan from a pariah state that harboured international terrorists, into a functioning democracy with a legitimate Government and Parliament. Security conditions are broadly stable if fragile in places, particularly in the South and East of the country. Overall in 2007, 70 per cent. of security incidents were confined to 10 per cent. of Afghanistan&#146;s 398 districts, which together contain less than 6 per cent. of the Afghan population.</p>

 Over the past two years the Ministry of Defence has undertaken a series of actions to reduce the amount of waste it produces and sends to landfill. These include: conducting a series of site waste audits to determine the processes that generate waste; implementing site waste minimisation schemes; and commissioning a Waste Management Improvement Project. This examined waste management activities carried out throughout the defence estate and how these could be improved to reduce the amount of waste generated in the first instance and to increase the amount of waste that remained to recycling and recovery operations. The recommendations from this report are in the process of being actioned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="80714w0034.htm_para3"><a name="0807155000387">The Ministry of Defence is also working closely with not-for-profit organisations such as WRAP (Waste Resources Action Programme) to increase the amount of construction waste re-used on site and recycled off-site, and NISP (National Industrial Symbiosis Programme) which looks to create industrial synergies with local businesses and organisations so that the Department&#146;s waste is used as another&#146;s resource.</p>

The DTR contract is not yet let but Nord Anglia are envisaged as a lower-tier sub-contractor to Metrix. MOD will therefore be assuring itself that this change in ownership does not in any way preclude the inclusion of Nord Anglia under the terms of the proposed DTR contract, which includes specific provisions to protect the national interest. If these subcontracting conditions cannot be met, the requirements of the contract to provide the DTR services nonetheless persist and it will be for Metrix, as the prime contractor, to deliver against those requirements.</p>

<p><a name="st_437"><a name="0807158000186"><a name="80714w0037.htm_spnew1"><a name="0807158002228"><b>Mr. Ivan Lewis:</b>
 We have been informed by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) that The Commission for Social Care Inspection (Fees and Frequency of Inspections) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 require CSCI to make arrangements to inspect care homes, domiciliary care agencies and adult placement schemes at least in every three-year period. The Regulations permit CSCI to take a proportionate approach to inspection, based on an assessment of the quality, risk and outcomes for the people who use services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_457"><a name="80714w0037.htm_para6"><a name="0807158000187">In order to make these assessments, CSCI carries out key inspections of all registered services. Key inspections, which are usually unannounced, are a thorough examination of how well a service is performing. Inspections take into account information provided by the owner or manager, the views and experiences of people living there, their relatives, staff and visiting professionals, as well as information CSCI finds when it visits the service. CSCI also considers any relevant information it has received about the service since the last inspection, for example, concerns that may have been raised.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_458"><a name="80714w0037.htm_para7"><a name="0807158000188">CSCI uses all information collected to measure how far the experiences of people using a service meet their expectations in areas that are important to them. Inspecting in this way helps CSCI to put residents at the heart of how it judges the quality of services. From these judgments, CSCI awards quality ratings, which help it to plan how often the service should be inspected in future. The frequencies are:</p>
<a name="80714w0037.htm_brev0"><a name="0807158002164"><ul><p class="tabletext">a three star&#151;excellent&#151;service will receive at least one key inspection every three years;</p>
</ul><a name="80714w0037.htm_brev1"><a name="0807158002165"><ul><p class="tabletext">a two star&#151;good&#151;service will receive at least one key inspection every two years;</p>
</ul><a name="80714w0037.htm_brev2"><a name="0807158002166"><ul><p class="tabletext">a one star&#151;adequate&#151;service will receive at least one key inspection every year; and</p>
</ul><a name="80714w0037.htm_brev3"><a name="0807158002167"><ul><p class="tabletext">a zero star&#151;poor&#151;service will receive two key inspections every year.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_459"><a name="80714w0037.htm_para8"><a name="0807158000189">This does not mean that a service will not be inspected more often if necessary. CSCI also carries out shorter, targeted, random inspections. These are usually unannounced and can take place at any time of the day or night. CSCI may undertake a random inspection because it has received information that suggests people using the service might be at risk, or to check on improvements that should have been made.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_460"><a name="80714w0037.htm_para9"><a name="0807158000190">During each year in which services rated excellent or good are not inspected, CSCI carries out an annual service review. During a review, CSCI analyses all the information received about the service during the last 12 months, including any complaints or notifications. It also surveys people using the service and other interested parties. If, as a result of the review, CSCI considers the quality of the service may have changed, it may decide to bring forward the next key inspection or to carry out a random inspection visit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_461"><a name="80714w0037.htm_para10"><a name="0807158000191">To provide information on the standard of care in every care home inspected in each of the last three years would incur disproportionate cost. CSCI inspects homes against the National Minimum Standards (NMS) for Care Homes for Older People or the NMS for Care Homes for Adults. The decision as to which set of NMS should be used is made by the inspector at the time of the inspection and is based on the current age profile of the residents of the home. The following tables show the percentages of homes meeting or exceeding the individual NMS during the last three years for which information is available.</p>

 The new general practitioner (GP)-led health centres will provide the public with access to primary care services from 8 am to 8 pm seven days a week. Patients can either book an appointment or use the centres on a walk-in basis, and can do so while remaining registered with their existing GP practice.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_488"><a name="80714w0041.htm_para0"><a name="0807158001694">Analysis of NHS Choices data of practices currently delivering extended opening hours, shows that where a practice's closest neighbour is not currently open on evenings or weekends, there is only a one in five chance of a practice delivering extended opening. However, where the immediately neighbouring practice is delivering extended opening to their patients, a practice is twice as likely to also provide extended opening. Therefore, by securing a new GP-led health centre and new GP practices in poorly served areas, other patients will also directly benefit from extended opening and better access for patients from their own practice.</p>

 PCTs have been asked to follow a small number of core criteria for the general practitioner (GP)-led health centres, including that the centres should be situated in an easily accessible location, that they can be used by any member of the public, whether registered with the health centres or not by either a bookable appointment or on a walk-in basis, and that they are open from 8 am-8 pm, 365 days a year. It is, ultimately, for PCTs to identify the best location for these new services following consultation with patients, GPs and others to reflect local needs and preferences.</p>

Evidence from seasonal influenza and the 1957 pandemic suggest that of these between 50 per cent. and 67 per cent. will show clinical symptoms. This is consistent with a worst case clinical attack rate of around 50 per cent.</p>

There is thus much less chance that the dynamic targeting referred to will be needed. Flexibility in antiviral distribution via the Flu Line will be achieved by adjusting the clinical algorithm based on the clinical information obtained as the pandemic unfolds, as well as stock management and policy decisions.

 Commissioning for local health services in England is the core responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs). It is a complex process with responsibilities ranging from assessing population needs and prioritising health outcomes to procuring products and services, and managing service providers. As such, commissioners are required to possess a wide range of skills, including robust analysis, effective stakeholder engagement and communication, financial management, strategic planning and performance management skills. The joint Department of Health and Prime Minister's Delivery Unit review of commissioning capabilities in May 2007 suggested that some PCTs perform better in some areas than others. However, there is not yet any comprehensive evidence about commissioning strengths and weaknesses nationally.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_515"><a name="80714w0043.htm_para4"><a name="0807158001890">In June this year, a national commissioning assurance system was launched to hold commissioners to account through assessing their performance and rewarding development. PCTs will be assessed against commissioning skill sets, or competencies, organisational governance and health outcomes. By publishing and assessing against the competencies that make commissioning for health services world class, a clearer national picture will emerge. PCTs will also be better able to understand where their commissioning strengths and weaknesses lie and will be incentivised to access support and development resources in order to improve.</p>

 Regulatory impact assessments no longer exist as they have been superseded by impact assessments. The Department follows the criteria contained in guidance provided by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR). Impact assessments are required:</p>
<a name="80714w0043.htm_brev5"><a name="0807158002205"><ul><p class="tabletext">for all forms of intervention (including primary or secondary legislation as well as codes of practice or guidance) where the department or regulator considers that the effect will be to increase or decrease costs for business, the public sector, third sector organisations, regulators or consumers;</p>

 Pedaciel, Repevax, Infanrix-IPV and Menitorix have been put on an allocation system. The allocation system aims to ensure general practitioner contractors receive doses based on their historic vaccine requirements so every child should be immunised with no need to delay immunisations. Where surgeries are concerned that they may not have sufficient stocks for a clinic they have contacted the Department's vaccine supply team who are working to ensure additional doses have been made available.</p>
