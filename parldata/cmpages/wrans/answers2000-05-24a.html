 <i>[holding answer 18 May 2000]:</i> The information currently available relates to the 4,346 Kosovans who were evacuated to the United Kingdom under the Humanitarian Evacuation Programme. Since March 2000, 190 principal applicants have sought an extension of exceptional leave to enter, 45 have applied for asylum and 70 have applied for both exceptional leave and asylum.

 The current voluntary return programme from the United Kingdom began on 26 July 1999 and will end on 25 June 2000. The Programme is open both to Kosovans who arrived under the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) Humanitarian Evacuation Programme and those who arrived independently. It is open to Kosovans in all parts of the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="00524w01.html_para3">For humanitarian and economic reasons, it was decided to give a relocation grant of 720 Deutchmark (DM) per person (approximately &#163;250), payable on arrival in Kosovo, to all those who chose to go back under the return programme. That grant was increased to 1,300 DM 



<P>
<P><I>24 May 2000 : Column: 492W</I><P>
per person (approximately &#163;400) with effect from the flight on 5 May. Arrangements have also been made to transport larger possessions overland to Kosovo. This will enable Kosovans to take back, for example, household goods and building materials, which they have bought or been given, and which they cannot take on an aeroplane.
<P>

<a name="00524w01.html_para4">In order to benefit from the grant and the overland transport of goods, Kosovans must register for return by 10 June and leave the United Kingdom on one of the organised voluntary return flights by 25 June.

 I have today placed in the Library copies of the Annual Report of the British Board of Film Classification for 1999, which gives details of the Board's financial accounts and activities for the year ended 31 December 1999.
<P>

<a name="00524w02.html_para1">On 16 May, the High Court dismissed the Board's application for Judicial Review in respect of appeals against their decision not to classify seven sexually explicit videos in the restricted (R)18 category--which are available only in licensed sex shops to those aged 18 and above. The Board had focused their application for Judicial Review on the consideration which they should give, when classifying videos in the R18 category, to the potential harm to children which may result from their exposure to this material. I am very disappointed with the outcome of this case and have instructed my officials to consider whether any additional steps can be taken to protect children from exposure to these sexually explicit videos. I intend to issue a consultation paper on the matter shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the terms of reference are for the Law Commission's review of the law governing prosecution appeals in criminal proceedings.  [124079]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Law Commission published a consultation document on the law of double jeopardy on 12 October 1999 following my request to them of 2 July 1999 as part of the Government's response to the Stephen Lawrence report. The consultation period ended on 31 January 2000 and the Commission is considering the responses received before making its final recommendations to the Government. As the terms of reference intended, the consultation document did refer to prosecution rights of appeal but not in any detail as to how these might be achieved.
<P>

<a name="00524w02.html_para3">I have, therefore, today formally asked the Law Commission to undertake a review of the law governing prosecution appeals against judge directed acquittals in criminal proceedings and other adverse rulings by a judge which may lead to the premature ending of the trial.

(a) whether any, and if so, what additional rights of appeal or other remedies should be available to the prosecution from adverse rulings of a judge in a trial on indictment which the prosecution may wish to overturn and which may have resulted, whether directly or indirectly, in premature termination of the trial;
<BR>
(b) to what, if any, procedural restrictions such appeals would be subject and to make recommendations".




<P>
<P><I>24 May 2000 : Column: 496W</I><P>


<P>

<a name="00524w02.html_para6">I should emphasise that the issue here is the question of a prosecution right of appeal against adverse rulings made by the judge, which leads to the ending of the trial before the jury has considered the evidence. The question whether, and in what circumstances, a jury's decision on the evidence to acquit can be challenged is the subject of the double jeopardy consideration by the Commission. Both these issues are entirely separate from the prosecution's right of appeal against an unduly lenient sentence after a jury has convicted a defendant.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the current backlog is of cases being dealt with by the Criminal Cases Review Commission; and what the expected timescale is for considering the application in respect of Mr. Nasir Abbas Choudhary made on 5 April.  [123504]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 I understand that, at the end of April, the Criminal Cases Review Commission had 462 cases under review, and 921 awaiting review. The Commission screens all eligible new applications, in order to identify and review those cases where this will apparently require a total of five working days or fewer. Subject to any special factors that would justify giving them priority, cases that require a more extensive review then await allocation to a caseworker, on the basis of date order of receipt. The Commission hopes to screen Mr. Choudhary's application as soon as possible.

 No assurances were either sought from or given by Mr. Tyson, but it was made clear to him that the entry clearance was granted for a three-week visit strictly for the purposes of the boxing match.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on what date his Department first learned of Mike Tyson's proposed visit to Scotland.  [123567]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 My Department became aware in March from newspaper reports that Mr. Tyson was intending to make a visit. My hon. Friend the Member for Glasgow, Baillieston (Mr. Wray) wrote to me on 25 April requesting a meeting to discuss the proposed bout in Scotland. I met with my hon. Friend and his delegation, which included my hon. Friend the Member for Newcastle-under-Lyme (Mrs. Golding), Lord Brooks of Tremorfa and Stephen Davies, on 3 May.
<P>

<a name="00524w03.html_para1">Mr. Tyson's application for entry clearance was submitted to the British Consulate General in New York on Friday 12 May 2000. It was then passed to the Home Office who received it on the morning of Monday 15 May.

<P>
<a name="00524w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 As with all such matters, in making my decision I was concerned to ensure that it was in accordance with the general law and the relevant Immigration Rule. It would be for the courts to decide what grounds existed for judicial review of that decision.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w03.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what consultations he has had on the impact on police resources of Mike Tyson's proposed visit to the United Kingdom;  [123572]
<P>
<UL>(2) between which dates his Department carried out its assessment of the financial and commercial impact of a decision to refuse permission for Mike Tyson to enter the United Kingdom;  [123569]
<P>
(3) which persons and organisations he consulted about the financial consequences of a decision to refuse permission for Mike Tyson to enter the United Kingdom;  [123570]

(4) what estimate he made of <i>(a)</i> the financial cost to British business and <i>(b)</i> the number of companies which would have suffered financially, if he had refused Mike Tyson permission to enter the UK for his proposed boxing match.  [123565]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In reaching my decision, I considered all relevant factors and weighed them against the statutory criteria in the Immigration Rules. In doing so, I recognised the potential economic benefits to the United Kingdom, as well as the policing implications. I also took account of the fact that there would be strength of feeling both for and against this entry into the United Kingdom. There is no statutory requirement for further consultation or assessment, and I was able to reach a decision on the basis of the information before us.
<P>

<a name="00524w03.html_para2">I would also refer the hon. Member to the observations of the Minister of State, Home Office, on 23 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 191-98WH. As she told the House, both she and I sought information from the Deputy

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In support of Mr. Tyson's proposed visit to the United Kingdom, I received representations from Frank Warren on behalf of Sports Network Europe. On 18 May, I was sent a formal notification from the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament of two parliamentary motions opposing the entry of Mike Tyson, but I was in any event well aware of the strong views felt on both sides on this matter, particularly in Scotland.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will review the variation of the contract of employment of Metropolitan Police Security Officers stationed at the House in relation to their compulsory retirement age; what consultations took place prior to the change; and if he will make a statement.  [123274]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis tells me that the contractual age of retirement for all civilian staff remains 60, with any extension of service beyond that age being granted at his discretion. The criteria for extension are set out in the Civil Staff Personnel Manual.
<P>

<a name="00524w03.html_para3">In recent years, some extensions have been made, to help with recruitment difficulties. These have now been overcome and, in order to give staff the maximum opportunity to look for fresh employment after they reach 60, they have been given some six months' notice that no extensions will be expected to be granted from this October. The Security Officers' manager discussed this with their Trade Union representatives before they were notified.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is <i>(a)</i> the average national police precept and <i>(b)</i> the Humberside police precept; and how many additional police officers could be employed if the difference between the Humberside and the national average police precept were employed for that purpose.  [122798]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The average council tax precept (band D) for police authorities in England for 2000-01 is calculated at &#163;69.29. The average for police authorities in Wales for 2000-01 is &#163;79.84.
<P>

<a name="00524w03.html_para4">The council tax precept (band D) for Humberside police authority is &#163;60.30.
<P>

<a name="00524w03.html_para5">The effect of increasing Humberside's precept to the average for English forces would be subject to the impact of Council Tax Benefit Subsidy Limitation and cannot, therefore, readily be translated into additional officers.

 Figures are available only for the period 1 April to 31 March each year and, for 1997-98 and 1998-99, are given in the table. The only secondments for more than three months were those arising under the terms of a Public Private Partnership with CSL Managed Services for accounting, IT and payroll services. Returns for 1999-2000 have not yet been commissioned but are likely to reflect a significant reduction in numbers now that the seconded staff have either returned to work for the Department or opted to transfer permanently to CSL.

<P>
<a name="00524w05.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In his opening statement at the Council, Development Commissioner Nielson made clear that the past record of EC development efforts was poor and that major improvement was needed if the strategic goal of EC development policy should in future be to combat poverty. He was committed to increasing the proportion of EC aid going to the poorest countries and to the poor in Middle Income Countries, although he said that this was constrained by political priorities and the budget process. Mr. Nielson thought that EC aid should focus on a limited number of areas where it could add most value, and that compatibility with internationally agreed strategies was vital. He said that a focal point would be set up in DG Development to analyse coherence between EC development policy and other EC policies affecting developing countries. Mr. Nielson thought that the planned reform of EC aid management would increase the sense of responsibility within the Commission and improve the quality of programming.
<P>

<a name="00524w05.html_para1">I welcomed the focus on poverty, impact and effectiveness in EC aid. I said that ensuring coherent support for development across EC policy was vital and that it had improved since Seattle. I added that closer integration between development policy and the Common Foreign and Security Policy was needed, and that in a globalising world the EU could no longer be concerned only with the near abroad. I emphasised that reform needed to address issues such as the pressure which drove proposals for unjustified levels of EC funding for the Western Balkans. I said that a strategic and regularly updated Action Plan was now needed to implement the reform process.
<P>

<a name="00524w05.html_para2">Subsequent annual reports, if they showed significant improvements in line with this plan, would give member states the confidence to reduce their control of individual EC projects. The Presidency concluded that discussion would continue, leading to the adoption by the next Development Council of a joint statement on EC development policy from the Council and the Commission, with the European Parliament involved in the process.




<P>
<P><I>24 May 2000 : Column: 505W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00524w05.html_para3">At dinner, I led the discussion on Sierra Leone. I said that the international community needed to be more willing to take risks to provide security, which was a prerequisite for development. I added that the UN had the moral authority to promote conflict resolution, but lacked the necessary tools to do so effectively. France and Italy praised the UK's action in bolstering the UNAMSIL operation. There was general agreement that the UN's credibility was at stake in Sierra Leone, that more support should be given to UN peace-keeping forces, that the whole approach to peace-keeping needed reviewing urgently and that Commission funds for the Disarmament, Demobilisation and Reintegration programme should be released more quickly in future. Discussion turned to Guinea Bissau, which the Presidency (Portugal) said now merited EU financial support. Finally, France described recent events and the constitutional reform debate in Cote d'Ivoire. It was agreed that the decision on whether or not to suspend EC aid would depend on the forthcoming Heads of Mission report.
<P>

<a name="00524w05.html_para4">The Council adopted conclusions which recommended further improvements to Operational Co-ordination between the Commission and member states in developing countries. I stressed the importance of wider co-ordination around Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers led by the partner countries. The Council then adopted three items without discussion. The UK supported the resolution on Structural Adjustment (budget and sector support for developing countries), which makes poverty reduction its ultimate objective and incorporates many examples of best practice. The UK also supported the procedural conclusions on integrating the environment and sustainable development into EC development policy, and in particular the link with poverty reduction and reinforcement of the importance of policy coherence. We are now keen to help devise a comprehensive strategy to implement these conclusions. The UK also supported the conclusions on HIV/AIDS, Malaria and Tuberculosis, which call on the Commission to examine what else the EC could do to confront major poverty diseases.
<P>

<a name="00524w05.html_para5">The Council followed up last year's evaluation of humanitarian aid by adopting a resolution which seeks to guide the Commission without micromanaging them. The proposal that the EC Humanitarian Office should add to its funding role by developing an emergency response capacity was not adopted; the UK view is that the case for this is not proven. This was followed by a discussion of conflict and crisis situations introduced by the Presidency, during which I reinforced my message on Sierra Leone. It was concluded that discussions on more rapid and effective instruments for conflict management should continue under the French Presidency.
<P>

<a name="00524w05.html_para6">At lunch, Italy opened the discussion on Ethiopia and Eritrea. I, supported by most member states, observed that the moral low ground was alternating between the two countries and that we needed to act firmly now to help resolve the conflict. Belgium then argued for more assistance for Burundi. I said that we should back Nelson Mandela's efforts to facilitate the implementation of the Arusha Accords, including by holding a pledging conference, but added that it would be premature to consider budgetary assistance for Burundi at present. This line met with broad agreement. Denmark then underlined the importance of election monitoring in Zimbabwe. I noted that the land question was currently being used as a 



<P>
<P><I>24 May 2000 : Column: 506W</I><P>
smokescreen for terror tactics against the opposition. The Council agreed that the UNDP exercise on land reform should not offer money which was additional to the offers of finance which had been on the table since 1998. I supported the call from Germany and the Netherlands for the Commission to speed up implementation of the European Development Fund contribution to the HIPC trust fund. Ireland introduced the issue of HIV/AIDS, which France said would be a priority for its Presidency. I noted that the cost of anti-retroviral drugs would remain prohibitive, even after the announcement by a major pharmaceutical company of a price reduction for developing countries. The Commission said that this issue would be addressed at the EU-US Summit in Lisbon.
<P>

<a name="00524w05.html_para7">Under other business, the Presidency said that the outstanding differences between the Council and the European Parliament on the proposed environmental integration and tropical forest regulations would go to conciliation within the next few weeks. The Commission presented an information note on the Third UN Conference on Least Developed Countries in May 2001. Denmark presented a note on development aspects of the Sixth Conference of the Parties of the UN Convention on Climate Change in November.

 The pricing of sunscreens is a matter for manufacturers to decide and the Government have no direct influence in the price setting process for these items, which are a commercial product. We would encourage manufacturers and retailers to ensure that sunscreens are affordable for all. In May 1998, my hon. Friend the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Competition and Consumer Affairs (Mr. Griffiths) wrote to the Perfumery and Toiletries Association pointing out that sunscreens should not be regarded as a fashion product. We recommend the use of sunscreens as a back-up measure to other sun protection measures such as wearing protective clothing and staying in the shade in the midday sun.

 About 35,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year and of these between 6,000 and 9,000 will progress to advanced cancer. The National Institute of Clinical Excellence has been asked to review the evidence for the clinical and cost effectiveness of the two taxane drugs (Taxol and Taxotere) in advanced breast cancer, and it would be wrong to pre-empt its advice.

 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2000]:</i> The Post-Licensing Division of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) is responsible for monitoring the safety of all marketed medicines, including vaccines, licensed in the United Kingdom. Prior to licensing, all vaccines are thoroughly tested for safety, efficacy and quality. A manufacturer must demonstrate that the vaccine is safe and effective in preventing disease and that it is manufactured to appropriate standards before a Product Licence is given.
<P>

<a name="00524w06.html_para0">Suspected adverse reactions to vaccines, and other medicines, can be reported through the yellow card (YC) scheme by doctors, dentists, coroners, and pharmacists. In addition, vaccine manufacturers must submit details of all reports of suspected adverse drug reactions that are of a serious nature to the MCA. Reports received through the YC scheme and from companies are entered onto a specialised computer system called ADROIT (Adverse Drug Reactions On-line Information Tracking). This system allows rapid processing and detailed analysis of reports. Information collected through this system provides additional information on recognised reactions and can act as an early warning system for the identification of previously unrecognised reactions.
<P>

<a name="00524w06.html_para1">The YC scheme is well established and has been shown to be effective in identifying previously unrecognised adverse reactions. It is the key system for nation-wide surveillance in all age groups and can provide signals for very rare adverse events. The number and pattern of reports are regularly reviewed, and appropriate action initiated if there is indication of a problem.
<P>

<a name="00524w06.html_para2">Information from the YC scheme, together with information from other sources including published papers, large controlled trials, epidemiological studies, record linkage studies and screening of general practitioners and hospital databases provides comprehensive monitoring of the safety of childhood vaccines.
<P>

<a name="00524w06.html_para3">The question of vaccine safety is one that we take very seriously and is of the utmost importance. The benefits and risks of vaccination are always carefully considered and kept under constant review. Serious adverse reactions to vaccines are very rare. Reported suspected adverse reactions are carefully monitored both by the Committee on Safety of Medicines and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, independent expert groups which advise the UK health departments. Information on 



<P>
<P><I>24 May 2000 : Column: 508W</I><P>
safety issues is considered in detail by the MCA and the Department and by its independent expert advisers on a regular basis.
<P>

<a name="00524w06.html_para4">The National Institute for Biological Standards and Control tests each batch of vaccine for potency, safety and purity before it is issued for use. Only batches that reach the required standard are released for use. No vaccine is issued in the UK unless it passes the highest standards for quality. As a result, the childhood immunisation programme remains the safest way for parents to protect their children against disease.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w06.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice parents are given about the side-effects of the Meningitis C vaccine; whether the vaccine carries a risk of brain-damage or death; and whether all risks are made clear before parental consent is requested.  [122913]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w06.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 May 2000]:</i> A leaflet for parents--"Meningitis C. Reduce the risk. Your guide to the new meningitis C vaccine"--provides information on the possible side effects of the meningococcal Group C conjugate vaccine. The consent form for the meningococcal Group C immunisation tells parents to "Make sure you have read and understood the leaflet". It goes on to advise "Before you fill in the rest of the form, please make sure you have read this leaflet carefully" and then explicitly draws attention to "the possible side effects of the immunisation (read page 6)". Brain damage and death are not recognised risks.
<P>

<a name="00524w06.html_para5">About 26 million copies of the parents' leaflet have been printed and it has been mailed to general practitioners' surgeries, pharmacies and schools for every parent to receive and also made widely available though high street pharmacies and post offices. Copies of the leaflet and the consent form are available in the Library.

<a name="00524w06.html_para6">However a number of actions are being taken to increase compliance with registration. These include promoting awareness of the National Breast Implant Registry; guidance to be issued by the Royal College of Surgeons on clinical practice for breast surgery, and the Care Standards Bill.

 We are reforming the regulatory arrangements for residential care and nursing homes. The Care Standards Bill, which covers England and Wales, will establish a National Care Standards Commission for England to regulate all care homes to national minimum standards to ensure consistency and improve the quality of care and protection for vulnerable people. In Wales, the National Assembly will take on the same regulatory functions as the Commission.

 Whenever the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority or BNFL export United Kingdom plutonium under civil arrangements they keep certain records. These records include the total amount of plutonium exported and the United Kingdom owner of the plutonium. They do not include details of the particular reactor in which the plutonium was produced. This reflects the fact that spent fuel from different UK civil reactors and belonging to different owners may be reprocessed at the same time and that the plutonium arising from reprocessing ceases to have a separate reactor-specific identity. Plutonium is attributed to an owner based on an estimate of the fissile content of the irradiated fuel originally supplied, usually on an annual basis. The specific plutonium atoms allocated to an owner are not necessarily the same atoms that the owner originally supplied.
<P>

<a name="00524w07.html_para2">All exports of United Kingdom plutonium to the United States under civil arrangements have been subject to relevant bilateral and international arrangements to ensure that the material exported is used exclusively for peaceful, non-explosive purposes. The precise end use to which such exported plutonium has been put is however, a matter for the United States.
<P>

<a name="00524w07.html_para3">Information relating to the isotopic composition, point of departure and the mode of transport used for each export is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

These help manufacturers of measuring instruments to obtain approval for their products in OIML member countries. The UK participates in those areas of OIML's work where we have a specific interest.

 We have received representations from agencies, workers, unions and employers.

Some respondents have endorsed our suggested four week limit but others have advocated shorter and longer periods.

<a name="00524w08.html_para0">Employers wishing to recruit permanent staff will generally continue to do so from the outset, because they will wish to attract applicants who are looking for permanent work.

<a name="00524w08.html_para2">The data requirement is to count all businesses using Business Link services for non-trivial activity. The table shows that activity for periods 1997-98 and 1999-2000. A business which receives advice twice within a quarter is only counted once, but a business which receives assistance in two separate quarters will be counted in each quarter. It is not possible, because of the risk of double counting, to give precise total usage of businesses being assisted each year.

 As part of the Management Information requirement, Business Links provide SBS with usage data for the Information Society Initiative Centres (formally known as Local Support Centres).

<a name="00524w08.html_para3">We do not collect national records of the nature of every assistance given, in order to minimise the management requirement of Business Links. However, we do ask them to omit trivial activity. The table shows activity for the period 1999-2000. The figures given are the numbers of businesses assisted in each quarter. A business which receives advice twice within a quarter is only counted once, but a business which receives assistance in two separate quarters will be counted in each quarter. It is not possible, because of the risk of double counting, to give a precise total number of businesses being assisted each year.

 My Department's aim is to increase competitiveness and scientific excellence in order to generate higher levels of sustainable growth and productivity in a modern economy. To achieve that, we have set ourselves four over-arching national objectives: to promote enterprise, innovation and increased productivity; to make the most of the UK's science, engineering and technology; to create strong and competitive markets; and to develop a fair and effective legal and regulatory framework. Specific targets in pursuit of these objectives are set out in the DTI Public Service Agreement, which is in the Library of the House.

Invest in Britain Bureau
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w10.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Goggins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will make a statement on the relationship between British Trade International and the Invest in Britain Bureau.  [124030]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce, also on behalf of the Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon. Friend the Member for Leeds, West (Mr. Battle), that the Invest in Britain Bureau will move alongside Trade Partners UK (the new brand for the Government's trade services) under the British Trade International umbrella, with Sir David Wright as the single Group Chief Executive of British Trade International. The Board of British Trade International will remain under the chairmanship of DTI and FCO Ministers and its responsibilities will be enlarged to cover inward investment. This will lead to more coherent presentation--and, over time, management--of the Government's international trade and investment activities at home and overseas. It builds on an issue which was identified in the Cabinet Secretary's 1999 review of export promotion.
<P>

<a name="00524w10.html_para2">The Invest in Britain Bureau will retain a distinct identity within the enlarged organisation and will continue to have its own Chief Executive. We plan to review the IBB brand, building on work which has already been undertaken following the 1998 Competitiveness White Paper. The name of the umbrella organisation will also be reviewed in the light of these changes.
<P>

<a name="00524w10.html_para3">This announcement heralds important advantages for business. The new, combined organisation will focus on the single goal of developing business competitiveness in the UK, as it interfaces with the global marketplace. Working under one umbrella the two operations will 



<P>
<P><I>24 May 2000 : Column: 525W</I><P>
focus on investment into the UK from overseas, on opportunities for business growth from investments abroad and on the broad spectrum of trade development and support at national, regional and local levels.
<P>

<a name="00524w10.html_para4">The new arrangements will strengthen and better co-ordinate the relationship between investment and trade activities in central Government, devolved Administrations and Regional Development Agencies, each of which will continue to be represented on the Board of British Trade International. The enlarged responsibilities of British Trade International will further strengthen the close relationship between trade and investment work in the network of commercial offices in overseas posts, focusing them on economic advantage for the UK, whether through new opportunities for international trade or for investment in this country by overseas firms or partnerships.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w11.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) what the reasons are for the delay in the completion of the Review of the Petrol Undertakings; when the review will be completed; and if he will publish the results of the review;  [122942]
<P>
<UL>(2) what discussions he, his officials and the Office of Fair Trading have held with <i>(a)</i> the major oil suppliers, <i>(b)</i> the United Kingdom Oil Producers Association and <i>(c)</i> the Institute of Petroleum, to discuss the Review of the Petrol Undertakings since January 2000; and what the outcome of those meetings was.  [122943]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w11.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 DTI Ministers and officials have not held discussions with the parties mentioned regarding the Office of Fair Trading's review of the petrol undertakings. During the course of the review the Office of Fair Trading have had discussions with, or invited views from, all sides of the industry. This has included major oil companies and retailers associations. Industry views have helped to inform the Office of Fair Trading's review.
<P>

<a name="00524w11.html_para0">The completion of the review has been delayed because of consultations with the industry and because the Office of Fair Trading has had to allocate resources between several areas of high priority including the investigation of fuel prices in the Highlands and Islands.
<P>

<a name="00524w11.html_para1">The Office of Fair Trading expect to advise ministers shortly on whether the undertakings should be retained, removed or amended. Policy advice from the Director General of Fair Trading to Ministers is not published. However, Ministers will announce their decision on the matter in due course.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will identify on what basis, and in what numbers, those receiving working families tax credit <i>(a)</i> are and <i>(b)</i> are not, entitled to passported benefits; and what advice is given to those on working families tax credit on the category to which they belong.

 <i>[holding answer 18 April 2000]:</i> Working Families Tax Credit can be used as a "general passport" to various benefits so that those benefits are made available to everyone receiving Working Families Tax Credit. Other benefits, for example, help with NHS charges, are targeted on families receiving Working Families Tax Credit who have net incomes of &#163;11,370 per year or less. At the end of March around 900,000 families were passported this way.

 There are no statutory restrictions on the type of financial instruments that an insurer may invest in to provide funds to meet payments due to policy holders. The funds that are subject to the I-E treatment are those held to meet payments due to policy holders in respect of policies of life insurance, life annuity contracts and capital redemption policies other than those relating to pension business, overseas life assurance business, 



<P>

individual savings account business and life reinsurance business. The rates of tax payable on the income and profits from those investments broadly reflect the tax that policy holders might have paid had they held the underlying investments directly.
<P>

<a name="00524w11.html_para3">The tax paid by the insurer under I-E is treated as satisfying the basic rate tax liability of the policy holder. Policy holders will have no further tax to pay when they obtain the proceeds of their policies unless the policy is not a qualifying policy and they are themselves liable to tax at the higher rate. Qualifying policies are broadly those with regular premiums and a substantial death benefit that last for at least 10 years.
<P>

<a name="00524w11.html_para4">The rate of tax payable by the company on the underlying investments, so far as they are building up for the benefit of policy holders, for each of the last eight years is shown in the table:

<BR>
The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your recent question about men aged 16-24 who are economically inactive. I am replying in the Director's absence.
<BR>
The attached table shows non-seasonally adjusted estimates from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) which is the main source of labour market data on individuals. It gives the percentage of economically inactive men aged 16-24 by whether or not they are full-time students in the spring (March-May) quarter of each year since 1992.
<BR>
People aged 16 or over are classed as economically inactive by the LFS if they are not in employment and do not satisfy the criteria for International Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment. This includes those who want a job but who have not been seeking work in the last 4 weeks, those who are seeking work but are not available to start and those who do not want a job (for example, students not working or seeking work).
<BR>
The LFS classifies people as full-time students if they are at school, on a sandwich course or full time at university, polytechnic or college.

 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2000]:</i> The death of Jay Abatan in Brighton on 29 January 1999 is a tragedy. To his family, his widow and two young children, the criminal justice system appears to have let them down.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para5">I informed the hon. Member in a written answer on 16 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 80-81W, that I was making further inquiries about the criminal proceedings brought against those who were allegedly involved in the incident that resulted in Jay Abatan's death.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para6">I have now met with the Chief Crown Prosecutor for Sussex, the Branch Crown Prosecutor responsible for the prosecution team, and prosecuting counsel who had 



<P>
<P><I>24 May 2000 : Column: 531W</I><P>
the conduct of the case throughout. I am satisfied that everything that could have been done by them to secure a successful conclusion to the criminal proceedings was done.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para7">I know that the hon. Member attended parts of the trial, which lasted six days. It concluded on 9 May 2000 with the acquittal of two defendants.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para8">The history of the proceedings is this: two defendants were jointly charged on 1 February 1999 with manslaughter, affray and causing actual bodily harm.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para9">During the course of preparing the case for committal proceedings the Crown Prosecution Service took the unusual steps of obtaining reluctant witness summonses against two men in an attempt to clarify the sequence of events leading up to the assault on Jay Abatan. In the event they added nothing to the prosecution case and so were not used in evidence.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para10">The charges related to an incident which occurred in the early hours of Sunday 24 January 1999 when a dispute arose over a taxi outside a nightclub in Brighton. The dispute involved two groups of men. No witness actually saw Jay Abatan being punched. However, as a result of being struck he fell to the ground, sustained a fracture to his skull and died in hospital on 29 January 1999 without regaining consciousness. His death was the basis of the manslaughter charge against the two men.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para11">Prior to committal a conference was held with prosecuting counsel, the Crown Prosecution Service lawyer with conduct of the case and the police to discuss the evidence against both defendants. It was clear at the end of that conference that there was no evidence of joint enterprise and if both defendants were to be pursued for manslaughter then there was no prospect of a successful prosecution against either of them. Of the circumstantial evidence available the stronger evidence was against the first defendant, who on the evidence available was the closer of the two men to Jay Abatan at the crucial time and who had allegedly made a comment in the taxi after the incident was over: "I only hit him once". The second defendant was further away and had distanced himself from the argument at the time it was taking place in a comment to an independent witness. The decision was therefore made that the manslaughter case against the second defendant would be discontinued, unless the outstanding DNA evidence provided a link between him and Jay Abatan.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para12">On 24 June, the day of the committal proceedings, the results of the DNA evidence were obtained. The results added nothing to the prosecution case against the second defendant. Consequently, in accordance with the decision reached in conference, the Crown Prosecution Service withdrew the manslaughter charge against the second defendant. It pursued the manslaughter charges against the first defendant. However, the magistrate refused to commit the first defendant for manslaughter because of what he held was insufficient evidence.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para13">Notwithstanding this decision the prosecution, after taking counsel's advice, decided to pursue the charge of manslaughter at trial in the Crown Court. A draft indictment, which included the manslaughter charge, was therefore lodged at Lewes Crown Court on 22 July 1999.




<P>
<P><I>24 May 2000 : Column: 532W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para14">The prosecution wanted to continue with the manslaughter charge against the first defendant and made every effort to ensure that it remained on the indictment. The leader of the South Eastern Circuit, Mr. Michael Lawson QC, was instructed by the Crown Prosecution Service to appear and resist the defence application that the manslaughter count be struck from the indictment.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para15">However, on 30 September 1999, following legal argument, the resident judge at Lewes Crown Court granted the defence application to have the manslaughter count struck out. In the light of this ruling there was nothing further the Crown could do to pursue the manslaughter allegation.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para16">The trial of the defendants on the two remaining counts, affray and causing actual bodily harm to Michael Abatan (Jay's brother), commenced on 2 May 2000. During the course of the proceedings the defence applied to the judge that there should be no reference or mention of the fact that Jay Abatan had died in the incident. The Crown resisted this on the basis that the jury would raise questions as to why Jay Abatan was not giving evidence. However, the judge ruled that as the fact of his death could prejudice the jury and the fairness of the trial no reference should be made to it at trial. The judge also ruled that some other evidence obtained by the prosecution was inadmissible. On 9 May 2000 the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on both counts against each defendant.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para17">I think this case did contain some unusual features. One of these was the proactive course of action adopted by the Crown Prosecution Service in trying to get the count of manslaughter reinstated. As I have said the manslaughter charge against the second defendant was withdrawn because there was no evidence of a joint enterprise and no evidence that this second defendant had thrown the punch that led to Jay Abatan's death.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para18">Another feature, perhaps less unusual given the rules of evidence that apply in criminal trials, was the decision of the trial judge not to let the jury know that Jay Abatan had died in the course of the alleged affray and assault on his brother, Michael. Counsel for the Crown had argued that the jury should be told of his death because unless they were they would want to know why they were not hearing from Jay. In the event, I understand that the jury did ask to see the hospital notes but as the judge had already ruled that the fact of Jay's death could prejudice the jury and the fairness of the trial they were not told about that aspect of the case.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para19">The group containing the two defendants were all white. The other group were of white, black and other ethnic backgrounds. On the face of the statements available to the prosecution, many of them made on the day of the incident, nothing was said to indicate that Jay Abatan died as the result of a racist attack. Indeed one witness, who is not white, stated to the contrary. "I do not believe that this incident was a racially motivated attack". This did not mean that the Crown Prosecution Service treated the incident any less seriously. At all stages of the inquiry they were alert to the possibility that this was a racist attack but this has simply not been borne out by the evidence.




<P>
<P><I>24 May 2000 : Column: 533W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para20">I understand that the Chief Crown Prosecutor for Sussex will be happy to meet the hon. Member or his constituent to discuss the case in greater detail. As I am sure the hon. Member will appreciate, it would not have been appropriate for the Crown Prosecution Service to discuss the case with a prosecution witness, such as Michael Abatan, when the proceedings were still ongoing since the defence could have claimed that his evidence was tainted as a result.
<P>

<a name="00524w12.html_para21">The police have not closed the file and the appeal for witnesses and further evidence is continuing. An appeal is scheduled to be made on the Crimewatch UK programme this evening.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what communication he has received from the Commission on proposals to create a European common aviation area, an aviation safety agency, and amendments to regulation 95/93 concerning airport slot allocation, and proposals for strengthening the powers of Eurocontrol air traffic services; and when each of their numbered programme initiatives are due for consideration at <i>(a)</i> UKREP and <i>(b)</i> the Transport Council.

<P>
<a name="00524w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The initiatives are due for consideration at (<i>a</i>) UKREP and (<i>b</i>) the Transport Council. The European Commission was granted a mandate in 1996 to negotiate a European Common Aviation Area with 10 Central and Eastern European countries. The negotiation process is now largely completed and the Commission hopes that it will be able to present a final Agreement for signature at a Transport Council later this year.
<P>

<a name="00524w14.html_para0">With regard to communication on the establishment of a European aviation safety authority, I refer my hon. Friend to my answer given on 16 May 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 83W. At the Transport Council on 28 March 2000, the Council agreed that further analysis should be undertaken of the best legal form for the EASA, with the aim of taking a decision at its June meeting.

<a name="00524w14.html_para2">The Commission's Communication entitled "The creation of a single European sky", to which I also referred in my answer of 16 May 2000, did not include proposals for strengthening the legal powers of Eurocontrol air traffic services. Rather it envisaged measures to strengthen the provision of air traffic control services in Europe. To that extent, it is fully in line with the Government's proposals for a Public Private Partnership for NATS, which will enhance aviation safety through securing the investment needed for NATS' modernisation programme and the injection of key management skills to deliver that programme to time and budget.

The terms of Community accession to Eurocontrol are now effectively agreed, but the Commission cannot bring forward a proposal for the Council to authorise Community signature of the Protocol until the UK and Spain reach agreement on the inclusion of Gibraltar within the territorial scope of the Protocol.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w15.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Kaufman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will call for a report from London Underground on how long St John's Wood underground station has been without two functioning escalators; what the cost is of the replacement of the two escalators; what additional cost has been 



<P>
<P><I>24 May 2000 : Column: 541W</I><P>
incurred as a result of delays in the installation of the second escalator; how many dates have been announced for the completion of the work; for what reason London Underground supplied him with inaccurate information about the completion date for installation of the second escalator; and what action has been taken in respect of the London Underground employees responsible for this situation.  [123456]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2000]:</i> These are operational matters for London Underground, who have informed me that the escalator replacement project at St. John's Wood station started on 11 September 1998 and involves complete replacement of both machines. During the works, there has been one 'up' escalator and a staircase.
<P>

<a name="00524w15.html_para0">The total cost of the replacement of the two escalators is &#163;4,688 million, including the relevant publicity, policing and standby engineers etc. for the cricket matches. There have been extra costs of &#163;150,000 due to the overrun of the project.
<P>

<a name="00524w15.html_para1">Completion of the second escalator was originally announced for 18 May but has been put back to 21 June 2000. I understand the delay in completion of the project has been due to water entering the mechanism causing a build up of sediment on the steelwork; this meant that repairs had to be made to corroded steelwork and new drainage installed. London Underground's escalator replacement contractors were unable to work on the escalators while this work was taking place (19 January to 17 February 2000).

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2000]:</i> The UK Government have sponsored substantial research programmes to assess and monitor the levels of dioxins in the environment. Dioxin levels in air have been monitored as part of the DETR Hazardous Air Pollutants Programme since 1991. Work is under way to measure levels in sewage sludge and a new UK soil survey is due to begin shortly. The Food Standards Agency, and formerly MAFF, regularly monitor dioxin levels in a wide range of foodstuffs which are also useful indicators of environmental concentrations. Results from all monitoring programmes are available on the internet.

 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2000]:</i> Guidance on technical issues such as this is the responsibility of the Environment Agency.
<P>

<a name="00524w15.html_para2">The disposal of ash from incineration processes is controlled under the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994. Guidance on the regulations is contained in DETR circular C11/94 and Waste Management Papers 4 and 4a. Some incinerator ash will

All sectors of the economy are involved: Voluntary, Education, Health, Public and Private. Interchange is a key component of the reform agenda. The Modernising Government White Paper committed us to increasing interchange, in particular by bringing in more people on secondment and sending more of our people out.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to review the policies in the United Kingdom Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste.  [124080]
<P>

<P>

effect on 1 June 1996. These reflect the long-standing UK commitment to self-sufficiency in waste disposal and the well-established proximity principle, namely that waste should be disposed of in, or as close as possible to, the country of origin.
<P>

<a name="00524w15.html_para4">Since the Plan has been in force, there have been a number of changes at national and international level which have altered the arrangements for transfrontier shipments of waste. My Department will be issuing tomorrow for public consultation a revised draft of the United Kingdom Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste, copies of which will be placed in the Libraries of the House.
<P>

<a name="00524w15.html_para5">The main proposals for changes to existing UK policies are:
<P>

<a name="00524w15.html_para6"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to permit shipments between Northern Ireland and Ireland for local disposal, provided they are in accordance with waste management plans being drawn up by the Northern Ireland District Councils;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00524w15.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>to permit exports and imports for trial runs provided that strict criteria are met; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00524w15.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>further limited restrictions on imports of waste for disposal.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00524w15.html_para9">Furthermore, the Plan reiterates the UK's commitment to the self-sufficiency principle. The UK will allow wastes to be imported for disposal in the UK from developed countries only in extremely limited circumstances. Imports from developing countries are not quite so tightly restricted, but the expectation is still that such countries will as quickly as is feasible put in place the appropriate facilities to dispose of their own waste, as far as is compatible with environmentally sound and efficient management.
<P>

<a name="00524w15.html_para10">This Plan is separate from, but consistent with, the various domestic strategies in the UK, including the England and Wales Waste Strategy which will be launched tomorrow.

 The Government and the National Assembly for Wales will publish "Waste Strategy 2000--a Waste Strategy for England and Wales" tomorrow, and copies will be placed in the Libraries of the House. The strategy has two aims: to reduce the amount of waste we produce; and to get more value from that which we do produce--in particular through a substantial increase in household recycling.

 1. I represented the United Kingdom at the Agriculture Council in Brussels on 16 May.
<P>

<a name="00524w18.html_para1">2. The Council held a brief discussion of the Commission's proposal setting certain CAP prices and amounts for the 2000-01 marketing year, without reaching a conclusion. The Council will consider it further at its June meeting.
<P>

<a name="00524w18.html_para2">3. The Council discussed EU enlargement on the basis of a report from Commissioner Fischler on current preparations of the agriculture chapter. All Ministers stressed the importance they attached to making enlargement a success, recognising the key role of agriculture, including its veterinary, phytosanitary and food safety elements, in ensuring this. I welcomed the Commission's measured and methodical approach aimed at securing the opening of negotiations with the "Luxembourg Six" countries next month. Along with several other Ministers, I emphasised that a successful enlargement would require action not only by the applicant countries in aligning their legislation and administrative capacity with EU requirements, but also by the present EU in further adapting the CAP as provided for in the Agenda 2000 agreement of March 1999.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00524w18.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2000]:</i> Specified risk material (SRM) may not be fed to animals. EU-wide specified risk material controls are currently being considered in the Standing Veterinary Committee of the Commission. Any redefinition of SRM is unlikely to result in an exemption to enable SRM to be fed to hounds.

 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2000]:</i> In Great Britain the rules governing the feeding of animal by-products (which includes dead stock) to packs of hounds are laid down in the Animal By-Products Order 1999. The Order permits only certain categories of material to be fed to recognised packs of hounds in registered premises.

 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2000]:</i> We welcome the continuing narrowing trend in the gender pay gap, not least the full percentage point reduction from 20 per cent. to 19 per cent. in 1999. It is not possible to determine the precise extent to which the reduction in the last five years can be directly attributed to the Equal Pay Act but it is clear that a sensible statutory framework is an essential component. So too are our wider efforts to ensure improvements in education and skill levels and to help women stay in, or return to, the labour market after having children.

 My Department's principal websites--those of the central MOD and the three Services--are not sponsored by commercial companies. Where a major Service event has had external sponsorship and a related web page exists on a Ministry of Defence or Service website, the sponsor company's logo has on occasion been featured on that web page as an acknowledgment. In a few cases logos have been hyperlinked to the company's own website. The market value of the logo placements is assessed as negligible in comparison with the value of the overall sponsorship for the separate events, and taking into consideration the estimated number of visitors to the relevant pages and current market rates for website advertising on pages of this type.

 <i>[holding answer 19 May 2000]:</i> The Department regards the whole of its procurement budget as being at risk from fraud. The cost of detected fraud is, however, difficult to quantify. The process followed is to assume, once an investigation of a potential fraud begins, that the whole contract value is at risk. Values are then revised as the case progresses to completion. On this basis, the Department's estimates of the value of procurement fraud over the last five years are as follows:

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister on 3 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 143, to the hon. Member for Tatton (Mr. Bell). This matter is still being carefully considered in consultation with colleagues and no conclusions have yet been reached.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his letter D/Min(AF)/JS PQ2803J/99 of 18 December 1999, if he will list the <i>(a)</i> names, <i>(b)</i> date of commencement in position, <i>(c)</i> formal employer and line manager, <i>(d)</i> responsibilities of and <i>(e)</i> salary of the Families Association representatives based at (i) HMNB Portsmouth, (ii) HMNB Devonport, (iii) Faslane/Clyde, (iv) HMS Collingwood, (v) HMS Raleigh, (vi) BRNC Dartmouth, (vii) RMTC Lympstone, (viii) HMS Excellent and (ix) RNAS Culdrose; and if he will make a statement.

 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2000]:</i> The tables attached with my letter D/Min(AF)/JSPQ2803J/99/P provided data received from the relevant Establishments and Units about welfare and other facilities for which provision was made at the units concerned. I understand, however, that in relation to the list of Families Association Representatives, although the Association of Royal Naval and Royal Marine Families very much hopes in due course to establish local representatives in the bases listed, it has not yet done so. That is because the Association only came into being last year and has only just recruited its first local representative, who is based in Helston, Cornwall. The Association is an independent body, although it does receive some financial assistance from my Department and provision of some accommodation and facilities. The recruitment of local representatives, management arrangements and responsibilities are all matters for the Association.

<P>
<a name="00524w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2000]:</i> My right hon. and noble Friend the previous Secretary of State for Defence was first consulted about this matter on 11 August 1999. The current Secretary of State was consulted on 24 November.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the divorce rates for serving military personnel in <i>(a)</i> the Army, <i>(b)</i> the Royal Navy and <i>(c)</i> the Royal Air Force for the last 12 month period for which figures are available.  [120408]

 <i>[pursuant to his reply, 8 May 2000, c. 263-64W]:</i> I have to advise that due to an administrative error the figure for married strength for the Royal Air Force at 1 April (1998-99) was incorrectly given as 22,417--this was, however, correctly given as the figure for the Royal Navy. The correct figure for the Royal Air Force should have read 34,808.
