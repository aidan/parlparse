Emergency overflows are also provided at most sewage pumping stations to further protect the station from flooding in extreme wet weather events.

 The Multi-Purpose Sub-Munition variant of the CRV-7 (the CRV-7 MPSM), which is only fired from the UK Apache Helicopter, does not fall within the UK&#146;s understanding of a cluster munition primarily because of its direct fire capability and also because it has too few sub-munitions. The CRV-7 MPSM is not fired using a pre-programmed ripple.</p>

 The International Convention for the Suppression of Acts of Nuclear Terrorism entered into force on 7 July. The UK signed the Convention on 14 September 2005. The legislation required to implement the Convention is now in place in the UK, and the Government are currently preparing the necessary documents to be laid before Parliament prior to ratification. The Convention imposes an obligation on States Parties to report to the UN Secretary-General the final outcome of criminal proceedings undertaken in respect of the offences set out in the Convention. States Parties will also be expected to report to the committees of the UN Security Council that monitor implementation of States&#146; counter-terrorism and non-proliferation obligations, on the implementation of their obligations under the Convention in a more general sense. While the Overseas Territories will not be included at the time of the UK&#146;s ratification, there remains the possibility of extending the Convention to the Overseas Territories following consultation with them and the passing of any necessary legislation in each Territory. With our international partners, the UK has strongly encouraged all States to sign and ratify the Convention. Most recently, in a joint statement on counter-terrorism issued at the Heiligendamm Summit on 8 June, the leaders of the G8 called on all States to ratify the Convention.</p>

 The UK holds regular discussions with Arab governments on ways to reduce violence in the Middle East, including attacks against Israel. These are often focussed on efforts to implement UN Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs), including those aimed at preventing attacks on Israel. In May we lobbied a number of regional governments, drawing their attention to the provisions of UNSCR 1747 and seeking their support in implementing the provisions more effectively. Among other things, this resolution imposed a legally binding embargo on the export/transfer of all arms from Iran, including to Hezbollah and Palestinian rejectionist groups. We also regularly raise the implementation of UNSCR 1701, which brought an end to the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel in 2006. We enjoy the support of many Arab partners in our efforts to implement relevant UN Resolutions.</p>

 The British Film Institute (BFI) has a unique role in providing education and promoting knowledge and understanding of film. BFI also leads on the conservation of film and TV in the UK. In response to the challenges and opportunities faced by the moving image archive sector, the BFI, in partnership with the UK Film Council and film agencies across the UK, has developed a strategy to secure the UK's screen heritage and increase access to it.

As such, it is difficult to break down funding into discrete themes. However key projects since 2002 have been around assessing the impact of interventions to tackle the availability and problems caused by drugs, measuring the relationship between drugs and crime, estimating the trends in drug consumption and the number of problematic users, and the relationship between drug consumption and young people.

 The Department for Transport commissioned an independent four year evaluation of the National Safety Camera programme. This included, in its assessment, the success of cameras within the programme in reducing the number of accidents and casualties. The report, a copy of which is in the Library, did not distinguish between front and rear facing cameras. Photographs from front facing cameras may make it easier to identify the driver of a vehicle at the time it was detected committing a speeding offence, thereby making it possible to offer a fixed penalty to or bring a prosecution against that person. Guidance on the use of speed camera photographs is issued by the Association of Chief Police Officers.</p>

The guidance clearly states that the powers should only be used for searching for articles which could be used in connection with terrorism and that officers should have regard to the full range of other stop and search powers which may be more appropriate.</p>

 By their nature the total cost of military operations are difficult to estimate from the outset. Pre-Budget report 2002 set aside &#163;1 billion for the cost of operations in Iraq. On the basis of MOD forecasts this was increased to &#163;3 billion at Budget 2003 as a prudent contingency.</p>

At the Madrid Conference in October 2003, the UK pledged $900 million (&#163;544 million) for reconstruction in Iraq over the period 2003-04 to 2005-06. The 2004 Spending Review allocated funds to enable this commitment to be fulfilled. At the launch of the International Compact for Iraq in Sharm El Sheikh on 3 May 2007, the Foreign Secretary announced that the UK will spend at least &#163;200 million over and above the Madrid pledge, to be disbursed over the next three years.</p>

The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a baby born in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those born in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.<br>

For this purpose, all wards in England and Wales (not only the wards in these boroughs) were divided into six groups which are numbered from 0 to five:<br>
&#145;0&#146; means that none of the over-65 population lived in medical and care communal establishments;<br>
&#145;1&#146; means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the lowest fifth of all wards;<br>
&#145;5&#146; means that the proportion of the over-65 population in such establishments was in the highest fifth of all wards.<br>

Milton Keynes was considered for, but has not received, an initial payment. We will be making allocations in due course of the remaining funding, and are encouraging all affected local authorities to work closely with their Government Office on assessing the impact of the recent flooding.

 Building Schools for the Future (BSF) is a hugely ambitious programme. Just three years into the programme, 49 local authorities, one third of all authorities in England, are now firmly engaged with BSF. Eight local authorities have now reached financial close, covering 65 schools and &#163;1.1 billion worth of capital investment. There are currently 51 schools in construction, and it is anticipated that by the end of the year, a further 70 will be under way. Beyond 2010-11, we expect that around 200 new or remodelled schools will open each year.</p>

This estimate is subject to a margin of statistical sampling error as the figures were derived from a sample of individual child records submitted by each local authority.

However, schools designated as having a religious character under section 69 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 are exempt from this prohibition by virtue of section 50 of the Equality Act 2006 and may, therefore, give priority, when oversubscribed, to children on the basis that they are members of or practise their faith.</p>

 The performance of local authorities and their partners in improving outcomes for children and young people is assessed by Ofsted and other inspectorates. Since 2005, they have made an annual performance assessment of children's services in each local authority, and have been undertaking a programme of joint area reviews which will include every local authority area in England once between 2005 and 2008. Ofsted's April 2007 publication "Narrowing the Gap: The Inspection of Children's Services" found an improving picture, with children's services in 107 out of the 139 authorities covered by the report making a good or excellent contribution towards delivering better outcomes for children and young people.</p>

Where a local authority is failing to perform functions to an adequate standard, the Secretary of State will, as a last resort, consider use of his statutory powers to secure the proper performance of functions. This can include directing that functions are performed in a particular way or by a specified person on behalf of the authority.</p>

 Since October 1998 the Secretary of State has approved 187 applications that involve the sale of an area of land capable of forming a sports pitch of at least 0.2 hectares at schools in England. Of these 89 were in respect of closed schools. The number of these at schools in the north-west is 34 (16 of these at closed schools). There have not been any applications approved that involve the sale of a sports pitch at a school in Ribble Valley.

1. The combined LA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). A sector breakdown for combined LA and school based expenditure is not available from 2002-03 and consequently this table shows the total LA recurrent expenditure (except youth and community) per pupil by LA since 1995-96.<br>
2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the R01 form collected by the ODPM to the section 52 outturn forms collected by the DfES. 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of consistent financial reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The change in sources is shown by the line.<br>
3. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under-fives funded by the LA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained mainstream schools and other LA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES annual schools census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under-five pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only included for 1999-2000 onwards. For 1998-99 onwards other LA maintained pupils are included in the pupil count. This includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by the authority for whom the authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the authority drawn from form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also included as other LA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained school drawn from the DfES annual school census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
4. Figures are rounded to the nearest 10 and are subject to change by the LA.<br>

 The Department does not maintain records centrally of capital spending in schools.

 Officials from across the DCSF have met with officers from Cumbria county council on a number of occasions to discuss the planned city wide secondary school reorganisation in Carlisle. There have been ongoing discussions relating to the capital investment in Carlisle in response to the January 2005 floods and how it will be used to raise standards in education across the city. This includes working with the council on the academy proposal to replace St. Aidan's school and about finding sponsorship for a possible second academy in Carlisle, based on the Morton school which is currently in special measures.</p>

It assumes that all newly-qualified classroom teachers started on the lowest point of the pay scale, though until September 2002 all newly-qualified teachers would have started above the minimum point if they had a good honours degree. In addition, those with relevant previous experience may receive one or more additional points. The figures are based on the pay rates for England and Wales. Pay rates are higher for the London area.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Children, Schools and Families pursuant to the answer of 4 July 2007, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1099W, on teachers: science, what steps he is taking to ensure that there is a sufficient number of new teachers with a specialism in <i> (a)</i> physics and <i> (b)</i> chemistry.

 We are providing a bursary of &#163;9,000 to PGCE trainee teachers in the sciences and a golden hello of &#163;5,000 after their first year of teaching. As a further incentive, providers of teacher training receive an additional &#145;bounty&#146; of &#163;1,000 for every place on a science course which is taken up by a physics or chemistry graduate.</p>

These courses have enabled over 1,000 additional people to qualify to teach in these subjects.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_276"><a name="70716w0030.htm_para1"><a name="0707174002268">Over the last five years we have been running the Student Associate Scheme which focuses on physics and chemistry and places high quality undergraduates in schools for up to 20 days to provide curriculum support for teachers and to carry out project work with pupils. It also gives participants a taste of teaching as a career. The Secretary of State for Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills (DIUS) has just announced that participation in the scheme is to be doubled.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_277"><a name="70716w0030.htm_para2"><a name="0707174002269">The TDA&#146;s highly successful advertising campaign has also contributed significantly to increases in teacher recruitment, and is now concentrating on attracting teachers to priority subjects, including mathematics, physics and chemistry.</p>

 Before March 2003, the UK Government, together with United Nations agencies, international NGOs and Coalition partners such as the United States and Australia, prepared contingency plans that included the possibility of prolonged urban warfare, large population movements, or the widespread destruction of essential infrastructure. The cost of reconstruction was considered substantial. Iraq had suffered more than 20 years of conflict, mismanagement and underinvestment by the Saddam regime.</p>

It was expected that oil revenues would make a significant contribution to this reconstruction. Against this, the international community pledged an initial US$32 billion for the reconstruction of Iraq at the Madrid Donors&#146; Conference in October 2003 to which the UK pledged an initial &#163;544 million. Iraq has plenty of resources in its own budget, with forecast oil revenues of $33 billion in 2007.

 Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, those sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or more are eligible for parole halfway through their sentence. If parole is not granted then release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence (or at a subsequent parole review if earlier). Numbers of prisoners recommended for parole are shown at table 10.4 of the offender management caseload statistics 2005, a copy of which can be found in the Library. Prisoners sentenced to determinate terms of under four years under the 1991 Act are generally released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence. The Home Detention Curfew scheme (HDC) has been in operation since January 1999. Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and passing a careful risk assessment, prisoners serving sentences of between three months and less than four years may be released up to four-and-a-half months (135 days) early from prison subject to an electronically monitored curfew normally between 7pm and 7am.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many applicants to the family courts were referred for <i> (a)</i> mediation, <i> (b)</i> early intervention and <i> (c)</i> reports in public law in the 2006-07 financial year; and at what cost to the public purse. [149750]</p>

 The Government believe that mediation can have considerable advantages over going to court in the settling of family disputes, especially where children are involved. There are already 10 in-court referral schemes, where family mediators work together with CAFCASS and the courts to refer appropriate cases for mediation. These have developed locally. The number of referrals is not collected centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost by analysing court files.</p>

In about 60 per cent. of publicly funded cases, mediation results in a resolution of all the issues. Figures for 2006-07 will be published shortly and are broadly similar. Provisional figures show the success rate rising to 66 per cent. Expenditure on publicly funded mediation where family proceedings were commenced cannot be identified separately by the LSC.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_313"><a name="70716w0031.htm_para20"><a name="07071712000111">In terms of early intervention, CAFCASS and CAFCASS Cymru are providing an in-court conciliation service for cases brought under section 8 of the Children Act 1989. These are most commonly applications made to the courts as a result of parental disputes about a contact or residence matter. The service is available in every county court at the first hearing. The Family Court Adviser assists and encourages the parties to reach agreement themselves rather than proceed to a contested hearing and judicial adjudication. Research into various models of in-court conciliation shows that 76 per cent. of parents reported a full or partial agreement. CAFCASS is now piloting earlier conciliation meetings that take place away from court.</p>

 Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, those sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or more are eligible for parole halfway through their sentence. If parole is not granted then release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence (or at a subsequent parole review if earlier). Numbers of prisoners recommended for parole are shown at table 10.4 of the offender management caseload statistics 2005, a copy of which can be found in the Library of the House. Prisoners sentenced to determinate terms of under four years under the 1991 Act are generally released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence. The home detention curfew scheme has been in operation since January 1999. Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and passing a careful risk assessment, prisoners serving sentences of between three months and less than four years may be released up to four and a half months (135 days) early from prison subject to an electronically monitored curfew normally between  7 pm and 7 am. Information on the numbers of prisoners released under home detention curfew (HDC), can be found in tables 10.3 in the offender management caseload statistics 2005.</p>

 The Department does not allocate fixed quotas of units of dental activity (UDAs) for each primary care trust (PCT). When providing PCTs with their net resource allocations for primary dental services, the Department provides, as a guide, indicative figures for the equivalent gross resources and levels of patient charge revenue a PCT might receive based on indicative assumptions about the annual level of UDAs commissioned and the mix between charge-paying and exempt patients. However it is for PCTs to decide locally what types of service they should commission and what levels of units of dental activity they should seek from those services. Although UDAs (which are a weighted measure of courses of treatment) are the main contract currency under the new local commissioning arrangements, they are only one of a range of indicators that PCTs may wish to use to monitor and manage dental services.</p>

 The Conference of Post Graduate Medical Deans Steering Group for Recruitment and Selection for Specialty Training was created to establish the rules and criteria for entry to specialty training in 2007. Its membership included post-graduate deans for medical education, representatives of employers, deanery recruitment teams, royal colleges, trainee doctors and the Department. The steering group agreed that all eligibility criteria including for example General Medical Council registration, Royal College exams, English language proficiency and the right to work in the United Kingdom, would be assessed on the last date on which applications to the 2007 recruitment could be submitted.

4 February. When the application period was extended until 5 February the date for assessing eligibility criteria was also extended. The decision to set the assessment of eligibility criteria on 5 February was a practical one, designed to ensure that all doctors would be subject to the same criteria, and that eligibility was fixed at the start of the process rather than being subject to change at any time, creating operational difficulties.</p>

 There is no specific waiting list for dialysis. Dialysis is often an emergency treatment and patients with no kidney function will die in a matter of weeks if they do not receive dialysis. For patients whose disease has been identified well in advance of end-stage renal failure, dialysis begins at a time when the individual and his or her consultant feel is appropriate. Part 1 of the National Service Framework for Renal Services recommends starting to prepare people for dialysis about a year before it will be needed, as such preparation leads to better outcomes for the patient.</p>

 The National Service Framework (NSF) for Renal Services recommended that, when kidney function is assessed and monitored, the most sensitive way to detect kidney disease is by use of a formula-based estimation of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). To support the introduction of eGFR reporting, in 2006 the Department issued an information pack to the national health service. This consists of fact sheets which were sent to all general practitioners practices and pathology laboratories, explaining how to calculate and interpret eGFR, together with a note on frequently asked questions.</p>

 This information is not collected centrally on a regular basis.

 2. A still birth is a child that has issued forth from its mother after the 24th week of pregnancy, and that did not at any time after being completely expelled from its mother breathe or show any signs of life. Loss of the foetus before 24 weeks is not recorded as a still birth, but as a miscarriage.<br>

 The Department has commissioned and funded two research studies on fluoridation and health. &#147;A Systematic Review of Public Water Fluoridation&#148;, published by the University of York in 2000, identified two studies, which found no significant association between thyroid disorders, water fluoridation, and one study with a positive association. However, the positive study looked at combined fluoride/iodine intakes and has not been published in a peer review journal. &#147;Water Fluoridation and Health&#148;, published by the Medical Research Council (MRC) in 2002 endorsed York's recommendation on the need for further research into fluoridation, but awarded low priority to further research on thyroid disorders. This was because the MRC judged the scientific plausibility of an association between water fluoridation and thyroid disease to be low.</p>

The West Midland Public Health Observatory is leading on the compilation of a set of standard indicators which will enable comparisons to be made between the findings of different SHAs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="70716w0039.htm_para15"><a name="07071726001127">It is important that children develop a healthy diet, and a school plays an important role in helping to introduce and reinforce these behaviours. Through the national Healthy Schools programme run jointly between the Department, and the Department for Children, Schools and Families, schools are doing a lot of work to improve diet which, for example by phasing out items which are low in nutritional value such as fizzy drinks. Teachers tell us that improved diet has had both health and other benefits such as calmer children that are better behaved and a ready to learn. Good hydration helps to reduce tiredness, irritability, and increases concentration. It also contributes to a more settled and productive learning environment.</p>
