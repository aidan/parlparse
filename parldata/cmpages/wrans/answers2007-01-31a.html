<p><a name="stpa_391"><a name="70131w0001.htm_para12"><a name="07013191000079">In March 2003, to help international preparedness, DFID allocated &#163;32 million to the Red Cross/Red Crescent Movement, and &#163;13 million to United Nations agencies (World Food Programme, UNICEF, United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, World Health Organisation, Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the Office of the UN Security Coordinator). This funding contributed to the costs of pre- positioning food, medical and nutrition supplies, shelter kits and other relief supplies; establishing logistical support systems; and deploying staff in readiness for the crisis. As a result, United Nations agencies were able to return to Iraq very quickly in order to begin implementation of substantial humanitarian and recovery operations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="70131w0001.htm_para13"><a name="07013191000080">Decades of under investment and mismanagement by Saddams' brutal regime have left the Iraqis with a huge challenge. The new Iraqi Government is firmly in the lead in the reconstruction effort and has the resources to fund much of the improvements and public services itself. It also has massive international support. The UK is one of the first major donors to Iraq to fully disburse its Madrid pledge of &#163;544 million since 2003. This contribution is helping build the capacity of the Iraqi Government, at provincial and national levels, plan to deliver investment in basic services, improve oil production levels, generate jobs and manage its own significant resources more effectively.</p>

we estimate that between 1 to 1.5 million hectares of land would be required depending on a range of factors including crop yields, fuel extraction rates, the technologies employed and the market split between petrol and diesel. However, this does not take into account the utilisation of co-products from biofuel production, for example in animal feed, which will reduce the overall land requirement. In the longer term, advanced technologies for processing feedstocks should also help to reduce the land requirements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_458"><a name="70131w0006.htm_para19"><a name="070131102000350">The review included an examination by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) of the science underpinning the NSP, and an assessment of the benefits gained from the RGS over the last five years. SEAC concluded that the RGS approach of selective breeding for scrapie resistance remained a scientifically valid approach for eradicating classical scrapie. They concluded however that the prevalence of BSE in the UK sheep population is most likely zero, or very low if present at all, and consequently the current RGS would have little impact on public health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_460"><a name="70131w0006.htm_para21"><a name="070131102000352">Ministers have also agreed that the consultation should take place in the summer in the light of progress on wider work on responsibility and cost sharing which is already under way.

The report included a number of recommendations to sustain and strengthen services. With regard to the capacity of current services, the report indicated that an additional two neonatal cots would help meet the service demands more effectively. Other recommendations included the development of a neonatal intensive care network, improved information systems on neonatal cot usage and availability, and measures to increase the complement of appropriately trained neonatal nurses.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"><a name="70131w0011.htm_para3"><a name="070131107000724">These measures to increase capacity within neonatology will also be supported by the development of a neonatal and paediatric critical care transport service.

2. Some individuals may have received more than one type of bonus payment in any given year, which is why the information has been presented separately, and not as an aggregated total.<br>
3. The performance bonus is paid in the financial year following the performance year of 1 April to 31 March.<br>
4. The largest payments shown in Table 1 column 5 represent the highest performance bonus paid in the senior civil service (SCS). The largest performance bonus below the SCS was &#163;1,750, and the largest special bonus &#163;5,282. Both were paid in 2006-07.<br>
5. The numbers of employees receiving a team bonus are approximations. No team bonus schemes have run since 2004-05.<br>

3. Figures in this response are based upon periods of employment measured from the WPLS, which is based on data from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The figures given can only be taken as a minimum for the following (not necessarily comprehensive) reasons:<br>
(i) Some records show that a person started or ended employment at some point in the year, but the exact date on when they started or left their job is unknown, and therefore we do not know if they were employed at the points in time specified in this query.<br>
(ii) If a person's earnings are sufficiently low that they fall below the lower income tax threshold and so are not required to pay PAYE income tax on their earnings then there is no requirement to inform HMRC of their employment (although some employers declare these jobs anyway).<br>
(iii) These data do not include the self-employed.<br>
(iv) Poor quality personal data may lead to missed matches with benefits data.<br>
(v) No &#145;HMRC sensitive and secure&#146; information is supplied by HMRC (for example, HMRC employees, members of the security services).<br>
