 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 21 and 22 December 2004; what the Government&#039;s stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement.

<p><a name="50124w01.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Beckett: </b> 
 My hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary (Commons) and I represented the UK at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 21&#150;22 December 2004. Fisheries Ministers from Scotland and Northern Ireland were also present.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para0">
The main items for decision were on fisheries. The Council agreed on Total Allowable Catches and quotas for 2005 and on related measures. Much of the discussion at Council centred on the need for further measures to protect depleted cod stocks.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para1">
The Commission had proposed a series of closed areas in the North Sea. Ministers, however, were not convinced of the case for the Commission&#039;s proposal which would have significant impact on the fishing industry but without clear benefit for the North Sea cod stock. The UK believes that closed areas have a part to play in fisheries management and we indicated at the Council that we would be willing to consider more radical measures, including closed areas, if the scientific advice on the state of stocks justified such an approach.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para2">
The Council agreed a general reduction in fishing days within the North Sea, west of Scotland, and Eastern Channel to protect cod stocks. However, in recognition of the role that large mesh gear plays in reducing catches of juvenile fish, the Council agreed that fishermen using mesh of 120 mm mesh should receive an extra day, subject to administrative sanctions for infringements. The UK&#039;s mixed cod/haddock/whiting fleet already uses 120 mm and will, therefore continue to be able to fish for 15 days per month as soon as the new arrangements are in place.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para3">
The Council also agreed to implement UK proposals for improved controls to ensure that illegal landings do not undermine cod recovery and for scientific monitoring of discarding. The European Commission will present detailed proposals to improve control and enforcement in early 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para4">
The Council agreed to apply days at sea limits to the western Channel to protect the sole stock. Fishermen fishing with beam trawls or fixed nets will be restricted to 20 days fishing in the area per month.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2005 : Column 2W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para5">
Ministers agreed that the closure to demersal fishing of an area to the West of Scotland (the &#039;windsock&#039; closure) should continue in the same form as in 2004. For the sixth successive year, there will be a closure on the western Irish Sea in the spring to protect the spawning stock. The UK reached a bilateral agreement with Ireland to take forward a review of the Irish Sea closure with industry participation. Fishermen who spend most of their time in the Irish Sea will receive one additional fishing day (instead of two in 2004) in recognition of the reduction in effort as a result of the closure. The Council also agreed to implement a proposal from the UK, French and Irish industries for a cod spawning closure in the area between south west England and Ireland from January to March. However at the request of Belgium, there will be a derogation for beam trawlers in January.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para6">
The UK (TACs) secured at the Council a number of increases in Total Allowable Catches in commercially important stocks where there was scientific evidence that previous TACs were out of line with the real abundance of the stocks. This meant that fishermen were having to unnecessarily discard catches with no conservation benefit. The stocks concerned were:

</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para7">
The Council also reached agreement on cuts in fishing effort and quotas on deep sea stocks. A closed area will be introduced to protect orange roughy which is thought to be particularly at risk. There will be a review of management arrangements for deep sea stocks in 2005.

The European Commission presented a Communication on simplification of the Common Fisheries Policy and this will be followed by an action plan next year.

<a name="50124w01.html_para9">
On agriculture, the Presidency reported on two conferences that had considered the handling of animal disease outbreaks, including zoonoses (animal diseases transmissible to humans), from both the financial and disease control angles. The Commission indicated that it would be taking forward work in this area with a view to developing a more strategic approach to animal health. I strongly supported this initiative.

The Council held an orientation debate on measures to deal with illegally logged timber imports. I joined a number of delegations in welcoming progress in this area while noting that further work to counter attempts at circumvention of EU controls was needed. I also welcomed the Commission&#039;s intention to work closely with interested NGOs on this subject.

<p><a name="50124w01.html_wqn1"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she has received suggesting a relationship between cancer in under-16s and air pollution.  [210203]</p>




<p><a name="50124w01.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Department has not received any representations on this subject in the recent past.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para16">
However, we are aware that a report has recently been published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health suggesting such a relationship. The report evaluated childhood cancer by linking residence and migration of children who had fatal tumours (who died 1966&#150;80) with emission data from the UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI) data for 2001.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para17">
The Department of Health has advised as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;The Committee on Carcinogenicity (COG) set up a review of cancer in children at its November 2004 meeting. The Committee has recommended a number of follow-up pieces of work which includes a review of published papers on environmental exposures and childhood leukaemia. The new paper from Professor Knox on childhood leukaemia and air pollutants will be considered as part of this review.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w01.html_para18">
One of the issues the COC will need to consider is the validity of the assessment of exposure for children who died in 1966&#150;80 based on emission maps for the year 2001. The magnitude and location of pollution sources is likely to have changed dramatically between these two periods. For instance, emissions of the two pollutants suggested as posing the greatest risk, 1,3-butadiene and carbon monoxide, declined by 64 per cent. and 50 per cent. respectively between 1990 and 2001.

 The 1999 landfill directive sets challenging targets to reduce the amount of biodegradable municipal waste sent to landfill. These significant reductions need to be properly planned and managed and experience suggests that a steady reduction over a period of years is likely to be the most effective way to achieve the reductions needed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w04.html_para3">
To help local authorities meet their landfill directive targets the Government will introduce a Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme in England on 1 April 2005.

The scheme is not intended to inflict major new costs on local authorities not provided for in spending reviews, either by imposing unnecessary penalties or forcing them to take part in trading against their will.

Since April 2003, the UK has allocated &#163;118.5 million on humanitarian operations in Sudan and its Darfur region, as well as &#163;14 million in support of the AU monitoring mission.

<p><a name="50124w05.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Recording accurate expenditure on HIV and AIDS is difficult because of the cross-cutting nature of many HIV and AIDS initiatives and of the range of methods used to channel development assistance, including direct budget support to governments and via multilateral organisations. DFID is currently working on ways to better account for expenditure in this area and revised figures may be issued later in the year. The following are estimated figures for bilateral and multilateral independently.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w05.html_para17">
In 2003&#150;04, DFID&#039;s bilateral expenditure on projects that targeted HIV and AIDS, was &#163;297 million. This figure reflects all projects that were recorded as having a primary or significant focus on HIV and AIDS or reproductive health. It should be noted that some of these projects will also have had a primary or significant focus on other sectoral areas such as education or health systems development.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w05.html_para18">
In addition, expenditure which focused on AIDS through multilateral organisations was estimated at &#163;48 million. This is based on the share of spending which multilateral organisations, supported by DFID, said they directed towards AIDS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w05.html_para19">
The overall spend is likely to be in excess of &#163;345 million, as further money has been spent on AIDS directly by partner governments receiving &#039;Poverty Reduction Budget Support&#039; (PRBS) from the UK. DFID is currently in the process of developing a methodology for estimating the proportion likely to be spent on HIV and AIDS activities, though this exercise is not yet complete.

 Displaced people are among the poorest and most marginalised people in Burma and are often located in areas where DFID or international agencies have little or no access. Therefore reliable statistics on Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) from the Karen and Karenni States are unavailable. DFID cannot access these areas freely and have not made an independent assessment on the number of people displaced.

A UNICEF survey conducted in 2000 found that 6.4 per cent. of children of the same age group were acutely malnourished. Another survey was subsequently conducted in 2002 but it was not nationally representative, and therefore direct comparisons are not valid.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w07.html_para4">
All surveys are subject to a certain amount of imprecision and it is not possible to state whether the apparent increase from 6.4 per cent. to 7.5 per cent. reflects a real trend. General child malnutrition&#151;defined as weight for age&#151;showed a marked improvement over the same period, falling from 17.3 per cent. to 11.7 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w07.html_para5">
Reducing levels of acute malnutrition means ensuring that adequate supplies of food reach the poorest families whilst also working to tackle poverty and ensure equitable distribution of wealth in the long term. DFID helped to ensure that Iraq&#039;s Public Distribution System (PDS) for food was re-established quickly after the conflict in 2003. DFID is now supporting the Iraqi Interim Government (IIG) in the development of economic policies which will protect the poorest in Iraq who are dependent on the PDS, whilst reducing the economic distortions created by distributing food, virtually free, to the entire population. The PDS currently accounts for 12.5 per cent. of Iraqi Government expenditure. DFID is also developing a programme aimed at strengthening Iraqi Government capacity to implement pro-poor employment and social protection policies. In addition, DFID programmes in employment generation and political participation are aimed at reducing poverty and ensuring that the needs of the most vulnerable in Iraq are addressed in Government policies.

<p><a name="50124w07.html_spnew6"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The most recent research focusing on health and mortality in Iraq has been published by Medact, a non-governmental organisation, and by The Lancet.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w07.html_para6">
The Medact report, published in November 2004, was critical of the Iraqi health system, but recognised that the institutional weaknesses were longstanding and pre-date the 2003 conflict and that the Iraqi Ministry of Health (MoH) was addressing these. Medact also acknowledged that health data on Iraq are patchy, often unreliable and that their consultants were unable to visit Iraq to collect field data due to the security situation. The Iraqi MoH has issued a swift and strong rebuttal of the Medact report.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w07.html_para7">
Improving health services presents major challenges and will take time. Despite security constraints, steady progress is being made, and many more hospitals are now functioning and have better access to medicines. Since the Medact survey was conducted the MoH have produced Planning Guidelines for 2005, with support from donors, to meet these challenges. The UN and World Bank managed multi-donor trust funds provide support to the health sector, focusing on the improvement of emergency and primary health care services, which affect the poorest and most vulnerable. DFID has contributed &#163;70 million to the multi-donor trust funds and has also provided technical assistance to the MoH.

The Lancet article of 29 October 2004, looked at mortality in Iraq.

We reported progress towards this target in the second annual report on the delivery of the PFV Strategy, published in October 2004. The percentage of new vehicles sold in 2003 emitting less than 100 g/km CO <sub>2</sub>  was less than 0.1 per cent., although 3 per cent. of new cars sold emitted less than 120 g/km CO <sub>2</sub> &#151;a significant increase on the previous year.

The rate of progress in future years will depend, among other things, on how quickly new technologies are developed and introduced, and on the nature of any further EU-wide targets on new car fuel efficiency.

The scope for new measures will be considered carefully as part of the Review of the Climate Change Programme which is currently under way.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what definition the Export Credits Guarantee Department uses of the phrase, &quot;sufficient evidence&quot;, used in the OECD Action Statement on Bribery and Officially Supported Export Credits.  [202924]</p>




<p><a name="50124w10.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Alexander: </b> 
 The reference is to a provision in the OECD Action Statement on Bribery and Corruption and Officially Supported Export Credits which records an agreement that Export Credit Agencies shall not provide cover or support if they discover before doing so sufficient evidence that bribery has been involved in the award of the export contract. The best evidence that such is the case would be an unappealable conviction in a court of law. Short of that, ECGD would have to consider, taking into account all material matters and all the evidence available to it whether it would be reasonable for ECGD to conclude that bribery had been so involved.

 The export controls on objects of cultural interest apply only to objects manufactured or produced more than 50 years before the date of exportation.

 Most of the matters for which the Department is responsible in England have been devolved in Wales to the National Assembly for Wales. However, there are some reserved areas in which the Government has introduced initiatives which affect the Clwyd, South constituency.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w12.html_para1">
The Licensing Act 2003 (Commencement) Order 2003 repealed those parts of the Licensing Act 1964 which allowed the local government electorate in the counties and county boroughs of Wales to requisition polls to decide whether licensed premises should be allowed to open on Sundays. This has removed the uncertainty which businesses in Wales, including those in Clwyd South, faced, allowing them to exercise long-term planning. It also removes a costly administrative burden on local authorities and an artificial difference in licensing controls between Wales and England, which prevented businesses and customers exercising freedom of choice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w12.html_para2">
The Gambling Bill will, when implemented, transfer responsibility for licensing gambling premises to local authorities. Local people and businesses will be able to make representations about applications for licenses and local authorities will be able to decide not to issue licenses for casino premises. These changes will give local communities, including those in Clwyd South, a greater say in the regulation of gambling in their area.

<p><a name="50124w13.html_spnew8"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 Access by children to films in video/DVD format and computer games is controlled by the Video Recordings Act 1984, under which supplying videos, DVDs or games classified by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to those who do not meet the age requirements is punishable by a fine of up to &#163;5,000, a prison sentence of up to six months, or both. The Cinemas Act 1985, provides for the licensing of cinemas by local authorities, and under these arrangements controls on access by children to cinemas can be stipulated. In 2003, only 32 (or 2 per cent.) of the 1,484 computer games published depicted &#039;gross violence&#039; and therefore required legal classification by the BBFC. Of these, just seven were considered to be suitable for only those aged over 18.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) whether Sandhurst Officer Cadets will be able to apply for the individual battalions rather than the new regiments when the new Infantry Future Army Structure is in place;  [208291]
</p>



<p>(2) whether the individual battalions in the new regiments within the Prince of Wales, Kings and Scottish Divisions will be allowed to recruit officers in the new Infantry Future Army Structure.  [208292]</p>




<p><a name="50124w15.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 Recruitment of officer cadets under the Infantry Future Army Structure will be by regiment, rather than individual battalion. Recruits will remain entitled to state their interests and preferences, and, although every effort will be made to accommodate each recruit, there can be no guarantee that these will be met.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2005 : Column 51W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50124w15.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The Army is implementing, under Future Army Structures, a strategy to deliver both training and commitments known as the Force Operations and Readiness Mechanism (FORM); a replacement for the Formation Readiness Cycle. All Army units, including Infantry battalions, will programme their training and operational commitment activities according to the principles of FORM.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w15.html_para0">
FORM enables the Army to meet its outputs (force elements ready for both programmed operations and contingent operations) from within the force structure. The sequence of activity for any one force element, such as an Infantry battalion, is in five separate six month phases: recuperation; unit and battlegroup training; formation training; high readiness; and an operational deployment.

 A project is in place to provide a new facility at RAF Northolt for the British Forces Post Office. It is planned that this facility will be occupied during 2007, at which time Inglis Barracks will be vacated.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether the future Royal Regiment of Scotland will be able to maintain the establishment for five battalions under present recruiting levels.  [208293]</p>




<p><a name="50124w15.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The ability to man the five battalions of the Royal Regiment of Scotland will depend on a number of factors. It is not possible to predict its establishment until it is clear what roles the battalions of the regiment will be assigned. Recruitment to the Scottish Division has recently been slightly depressed not least by coverage of &#039;Save the Regiment&#039; campaigns. However, assuming that the establishment of the future battalions remains broadly similar to current levels and a return to the recruiting levels achieved in recent years, levels of enlistment to the Royal Regiment of Scotland should be sufficient to sustain five battalions.

The permitted work rules allow people with health conditions and disabilities to try out paid work while remaining on benefits, as a stepping stone to full-time work.

<p><a name="50124w19.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Paul Murphy: </b> 
 As I said in this House on 9 December, the Agreement was not set in stone when first signed and it was clearly always the intention that certain elements would be open to change; the commitment to review and report on its operation, which was written into the Agreement itself, would have made no sense otherwise. Equally, certain fundamental aspects of the Agreement have always been regarded by the Governments and the other parties who supported it as fundamental, and not open to change.

<p>
<a name="50124w19.html_para0">
We do not envisage any textual amendment of the Agreement at all. But, as the hon. Lady will have seen, our proposals would involve a number of changes in the way the Agreement operates.

<i>Letter from Mrs. Katharine Bryan to Mr. Eddie McGrady, dated 20 January 2005:</i>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You recently asked the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland a parliamentary Question about the condition of Northern Ireland&#039;s water infrastructure and the main cause of the failure of that infrastructure to meet EU Directive standards (208414). I have been asked to reply as the issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Water Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Water Service&#039;s second Asset Management Plan (NIAMP2), which was completed in 2003, identified that &#163;2.9 billion needs to be invested over the next 20 years to modernise the existing water and sewerage infrastructure. NIAMP2 assessed the condition of the Water Service&#039;s above ground assets including treatment works, pumping stations, etc. and less than 5 per cent. were considered to be in poor condition or functionally unsound. While the condition of the above ground assets is generally good, many of the current treatment works were not designed to meet the more stringent standards associated with current EU Directives. The upgrading of water and wastewater treatment works accounts for &#163;1 billion of the total investment required. It is much more difficult to define the condition of below ground assets, but use of an industry recognised statistical model identified an investment need for this asset group of almost double that required for above ground assets. Over two-thirds of this below ground investment is attributable to keeping the networks in a serviceable condition over the 20 year period.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The failure of the water and sewerage infrastructure to meet current EU Directives relates mainly to the fact that many of the current treatment works need to be upgraded. New treatment processes associated with new technology are often needed to meet the quality standards associated with current EU Directives. Priority is at present being given to upgrading water and wastewater treatment works and it is planned to accelerate spending on network refurbishment within the next few years as the treatment works upgrading programme nears completion.</p>

 The Government are committed to supporting the provision of child care in schools as part of the wider extended schools initiative in England. Decisions about the provision of child care in Northern Ireland are made by the Northern Ireland Assembly. In the financial year 2005&#150;06 my Department will be making available just over &#163;107 million to support the development of extended schools, including school based child care. In later years we will provide further funding to support the development of school based child care. An announcement will be made in due course.

In addition to this &#163;14 million from the Young People&#039;s Fund element of the Big Lottery Fund has been made available to 78 local authorities over three years from 2004&#150;05 to support the development of extended schools across their areas.

 The 10-year strategy for child care &quot;Choice for parents, the best possible start for children&quot; published on 2 December included the commitment to legislate to place a new duty on local authorities so that over time they will secure sufficient supply of child care places to meet the needs of local families. Local authorities are already key agents for co-ordinating, supporting and delivering child care services and there is a need to confirm the important role they play and clarify their responsibilities in this area. Consultation on the 10 year strategy is due to conclude on 24 February and discussions will be held with local authorities and other stakeholders on the new duty during 2005, with a view to introducing legislation in a future parliamentary session.

My Department is providing financial support for the development of extended schools, including the school age child care offer through local authorities. Funding will be used to provide support at school level to enable the delivery of a set of core services including school age child care. We realise that schools cannot deliver the child care offer on their own and we are encouraging them to work in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers and other schools to deliver child care. Local authorities will be able to advise schools of wider groups, agencies and services that are willing to work in partnership to develop extended services.

My Department is also providing logistical support. The Extended Schools Prospectus, which is due to be launched shortly will set out the vision for extended schools, including child care to schools, local authorities, key stakeholders and the private and voluntary sector. It will draw on the practical experience of schools already delivering services, providing &#039;how to&#039; advice and case studies on a range of issues, including working with local partners. The prospectus will be available on the teachernet website, so that it can be updated with new issues as they emerge (www. teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools).

<p><a name="50124w22.html_spnew7"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s 10-year strategy Choice for Parents, the Best Start for Children, published on 2 December, sets out our commitment to give every child the best start in life and to ensure that parents have real choice about how to balance work and family life. Our long term investment includes a guarantee of child care being available from 8 am to 6 pm, all year round, for all parents of children aged five to 11. The guarantee will help the very varied needs of children and families. Obviously we do not expect most children to spend all their time in school when schools are open for longer, but parents will be able to choose hours which meet their needs and the needs of their children. We expect at least half of parents to benefit from this offer by 2008, and all by 2010. By 2008, at least a third of all secondary schools will be open from 8 am to 6 pm, all year round offering a range of activities for 11 to14 year olds. By 2010, all secondary schools will be part of a network offering this provision. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers, including local childminders.

A new Childcare Approval Scheme was announced on 8 December. This will allow for the approval of child care provided in the child&#039;s home or, for children over the age of seven, on other domestic premises. Carers will be able to apply for approval since 4 January 2005. By using an approved carer parents have been able to access financial support through the child care element of the working tax credit or through employer supported child care. Parents who are eligible will be able to claim financial support from 6 April 2005. The new scheme will provide parents with more flexible, affordable, opportunities for home based care.

<p><a name="50124w23.html_spnew4"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s aim is that all vulnerable children should be able to access good quality education. The Standards Fund Vulnerable Children Grant was introduced in the 2003&#150;04 financial year to help local education authorities (LEAs) to achieve this aim.

<p>
<a name="50124w23.html_para2">
The key groups whose needs the Vulnerable Children Grant is designed to address are: looked after children; children who are unable to attend school because of medical needs; gypsy/traveller children; asylum seekers, young carers, school refusers, teenage parents and young offenders. This list is not prescriptive or exclusive. Many of these children will face multiple challenges, sometimes including homelessness. The grant may be used by LEAs to meet the needs of any vulnerable children identified by them as needing support, including those who are homeless. This discretionary approach allows local needs to be addressed more flexibly and responsively than would be possible using central direction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w23.html_para3">
In November last year the Department published an evaluation of the Vulnerable Children Grant undertaken by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NFER). One of the key findings of the report was that the grant had enabled LEAs to provide support for a variety of vulnerable groups. The NFER reported that in some LEAs surveyed the grant had been used to support children who are socially vulnerable, for example children living in vulnerable accommodation such as women&#039;s refuges, or children who were the subject of family breakdown or changes in home circumstances.

We are in talks with the NASUWT regarding their long-standing concerns about out of classroom safety. In particular, we are investigating with them what else we could do to help local authorities and schools ensure that investigations following pupil accidents are fair to school staff, as well as to pupils and their parents. The National Curriculum has statutory requirements in PE and geography for all pupils to experience learning outside the classroom. We are developing further practical steps to encourage schools to expand provision for all pupils, across and beyond the National Curriculum, including trips and visits.

<p><a name="50124w25.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
The Further Education funding system is different to schools. Funding is paid for learning aims as well as an entitlement per 16 to 18 payment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w25.html_para4">
Under the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s (LSC&#039;s) funding formula the basic cost to the public purse of delivering three A-levels in a sixth form college and a further education college to a student in the 2004/05 academic year will be &#163;3,045. This figure comprises &#163;766 for the delivery of each A-level learning aim, and &#163;747 for each student for the entitlement element of their learning programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w25.html_para5">
Under the LSC&#039;s funding formula the basic cost to the public purse of delivering three A-levels to a student at an English maintained secondary school will be &#163;3,212. This figure comprises &#163;785 for the delivery of each A-level learning aim, &#163;750 for each student for the entitlement element of their learning programme, and &#163;107 for each student to meet additional employers&#039; contributions to teachers&#039; pensions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w25.html_para6">
These figures do not represent all funding that colleges and school sixth forms receive and are not directly comparable. For example the further education funding rates include consolidated funds for pay and staff training that are not reflected in the school sixth form rates. Also, in each case additional funding may also be available to take account of the higher costs of delivering learning in particular geographical areas, in higher cost subjects, or to students with particular disadvantages or individual needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w25.html_para7">
It is expected that base funding rates per qualification will be increased by 4 per cent. for school sixth forms and by 5 per cent. for further education colleges, on a broadly comparable basis, in 2005/06. LSC will decide funding rates for each academic year nearer the time in light of the funding it has available and where priorities lie.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w25.html_para8">
The Department is discussing with the LSC how to take forward the next stage of the Skills Strategy from 2006/07, including the roll out of a National Employer Training Programme, and more broadly how the increases in funding from the 2004 Spending Review are applied, and until those discussions are concluded it will not be possible to set out precise forecasts of FE funding per learner.

<p><a name="50124w26.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The majority of funding for schools is distributed according to a locally agreed formula which will include factors for SEN and deprivation. Most pupils with SEN are in mainstream schools and are funded through their authority&#039;s local funding formula. This enables schools to intervene early and make good arrangements to meet children&#039;s needs while ensuring that these pupils are fully included. It is for local authorities to decide how best to distribute their funding.

Up to 2003&#150;04 a grant for special educational needs was paid to all local education authorities through the Standards Fund; North Yorkshire&#039;s allocation was &#163;788,153; of which 50 per cent. was government grant and 50 per cent. contributed by the local authority.

 There are no plans to adopt a single system of general support based on intensity of study. However, changes we are introducing for the 2005/06 academic year will pro-rate the amount of fee support that a part-time student receives to the intensity of their part-time study. This Government are the only one to have provided support for part-time students. Prior to academic year 1998/99 no financial support of any kind was available to them. Since then we have introduced schemes which have enabled some part-time students to have their tuition fees met, to qualify for disabled students&#039; allowances and to take out loans to cover course costs.

 Sure Start Local Programmes are area-based programmes bringing together health and family support services with play, learning and child care opportunities to give young children living in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged communities the best possible start in life. Some programmes with large numbers of homeless families in their catchment areas have specifically targeted the needs of homeless families, for example by providing play and advice sessions for children living in temporary accommodation.

The experience of local programmes and other services has shown that Sure Start, with its combination of universal and targeted services and focus on outreach, has been effective in reaching groups such as homeless families who often fall through the service network. By providing them with information and support, services encourage such groups to access services. Many Sure Start services have also supported mainstream services to reach out to and be more responsive to the particular needs of homeless families.

 Antisocial behaviour is defined in the Part 1 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 for the purposes of seeking Anti-social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) as behaviour that is likely to cause alarm, harassment or distress.

 I regret that the original copy of the letter of 25 November appears to have gone astray, which is why there has been no reply until now.

There is nothing in the Sectors Based Scheme itself that requires a person to sign on with the police.

<i>[holding answer 20 December 2004]:</i> We recognise that advocacy services are an important element in supporting victims of domestic violence, both in and outside the criminal justice system. It is important that there is a range of services for all victims of domestic violence locally, including advocacy provision, which is the responsibility of local partnerships.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w32.html_para0">
Each partnership is required to produce a strategy every three years for reducing crime and disorder in their area, following an audit to establish need. These audits were undertaken earlier this year, and partnerships should now be identifying what the needs of their local communities are, including for services addressing domestic violence. They will then set out how these needs will be met in their three year strategies, bearing in mind their budgets, which come from a range of sources. There is no ring fenced funding for domestic violence advocacy services from the Home Office, though the Department allocated those local partnerships with responsibility for crime and disorder &#163;74 million in 2004&#150;05 through the Building Safer Communities Fund. Among a variety of interventions, this could be spent on domestic violence services.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the impact of the introduction of Chip and PIN technology on levels of fraud.  [202992]</p>




<p><a name="50124w33.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 Chip and PIN is a finance and retail industry initiative that aims to reduce plastic card fraud by requiring card transactions to be authorised by the customer keying in a PIN rather than signing a receipt. At the same time the introduction of microchips into cards will help prevent the production of counterfeit cards (skimming). The public trial of Chip and PIN was a success and national roll out has now started, with a view to the majority of card transactions being Chip and PIN by 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w33.html_para3">
The Association for Payment Clearing Services (APACS) estimates that without Chip and PIN card fraud might have risen to &#163;1 billion by the end of the decade. APACS forecasts that in 2007 total card fraud losses on UK issued cards currently looks set to fall to approximately &#163;330 million.

<p><a name="50124w33.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 No decisions have been taken on the number and location of centres where biometric information may be recorded. Not all centres would

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the facial biometric planned for <i>(a)</i> passports and <i>(b)</i> identity cards will (i) constitute a scan of a photograph provided by the applicant and (ii) involve the use of special technology which will require the individual to attend a processing centre.  [208269]</p>




<p><a name="50124w33.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The facial biometric planned for the ePassport will be presented as a photographic image within the passport, as is currently the case, and will additionally be held as data within the new passport&#039;s biometric chip. Data will continue to be captured by scanning a photograph submitted by the applicant. The photograph must conform to the recently agreed and issued standards. Image capture and its reproduction in the two forms required by the new passports will not require an applicant&#039;s presence at a processing centre or elsewhere.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w33.html_para4">
The biometric requirements for the identity card are not yet complete. However, it is expected that the applicant will be required to attend an enrolment centre in order to have images of other biometrics, such as fingerprints and irises recorded. Therefore it is likely that a facial image will be recorded at same time, allowing more control over the lighting and the size and quality of the image than might be the case if a photograph supplied by the applicant were used.

<p><a name="50124w33.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) has helped the identity cards programme team to identify the uses which the police might make of the identity cards scheme and the requirements which it will be necessary for the scheme to support in order to deliver benefits to the police. PITO&#039;s advice has helped to ensure that the possible uses the police might make of the scheme are feasible within the context of existing and planned police systems and that technological compatibility has been considered at all stages. Additionally, they have shared their experience of the procurement and implementation of automated fingerprint identification systems.

[209052]</p>




<p><a name="50124w33.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The number of PA consultants working on the identity cards programme varies from day-to-day according to the needs of the programme. In December the full time equivalent of 32.5 staff were employed at an average daily cost of &#163;1,093 each. Total expenditure on PA Consulting Group from May to December 2004 was &#163;5,632,553.

<p><a name="50124w33.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 In the early years of the scheme, the large majority of ID cards will be issued as people renew or apply for passports. As the case for upgrading the security of passports is well understood and supported by the general public, the Government does not anticipate any significant public resistance.

When the Government announced its policy to proceed with a scheme in November 2003, it stated that in considering any decision to move to compulsion it would want to be confident that roll out during the first phase had delivered significant coverage of the population and that there was clear public acceptance for the principle of a compulsory ID card which would be used to access free public services.

<p><a name="50124w34.html_spnew9"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 As I made clear in the statement I made on 20 July 2004, we are developing the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) within the framework of the existing probation board structure. The measures in the Bill will make small and sensible adjustments to existing legislation. These include setting out the aims of NOMS and establishing sentence planning and review as a core offender management function and a duty of local probation boards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w34.html_para4">
Although we have started to explore what longer term organisational change might be needed to deliver NOMS in its final state, detailed feasibility work and further consultation will be needed before decisions are made. Creating a &#039;central spine&#039; of accountability from offender managers to the National Offender Manager is crucial to implementing the Carter reforms and we are now looking at organisational models which will deliver this. We are discussing with the Probation Boards Association the changes to the role of Boards which it is likely will be involved, and will continue to be open in planning the &quot;end state&quot; for NOMS.

[209631]</p>




<p><a name="50124w34.html_spnew10"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Contestability within the National Offender Management Service includes both competition and cooperation between sectors. We are keen to encourage all sectors to compete for the delivery of the full range of services for offenders and to increase the number of private companies and voluntary and community bodies involved. The case for cooperation between sectors, for instance through a consortium rests on value for money. When the contestability model is in full operation, we expect to see probation services and prisons within a given region combining to procure services in a way that will improve value for money, drive up quality and achieve consistency of service for offenders in custody and the community.

The Home Office funded 25 per cent. of the unit&#039;s costs (&#163;1.4 million over two years) during the pilot with the remainder being met by the card industry. An independent evaluation of the unit showed that it had been successful in detecting or preventing a significant amount of cheque and credit card fraud. Government

We have been encouraging financial and retail sectors to work towards early implementation of more secure systems to combat fraud. This includes Chip and PIN, a finance and retail industry initiative that aims to reduce plastic card fraud by requiring card transactions to be authorised by the customer keying in a PIN rather than signing a receipt. At the same time the introduction of microchips into cards will help prevent the production of counterfeit cards (skimming).

This strategy builds on the three-year safer custody strategy that ran from April 2001 and has a close relationship with issues of resettlement, detoxification, health, purposeful activity, as well as staff attitudes, leadership and training. Key achievements were the setting up of suicide prevention co-ordinators or equivalents in all prisons across the estate, an investment of over &#163;21 million at six &#039;safer local&#039; pilot sites and the development of a safer prison design, including &quot;safer cells&quot;.

To accompany the three-year safer custody strategy, a target was set for reducing the rate of self- inflicted deaths per 100,000 prisoners from the 1999&#150;2000 figure of 141 to 112.8 by 2004&#150;05. A rate of about 130 deaths per 100,000 is projected for 2004&#150;05. The prisoner targets are being reconsidered in the light of experience.

On 31 March 2004, I announced the outline suicide prevention strategy that would be developed over the coming year. It can be summarised as, &quot;Reducing distress and promoting the well-being of all who live and work in prisons&quot;. It has a close relationship with issues of resettlement, detoxification, health, purposeful activity and staff training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w36.html_para10">
The strategy recognises that prisoners are at particular risk of harming themselves in their early period in custody, when they are coping with issues of fear of imprisonment, detoxification or the impact of arrest on their family. Equally such risk is heightened when a prisoner&#039;s custodial status changes, for example when convicted or sentenced.

<p>
<a name="50124w36.html_para11">
Remand prisoners form a large proportion of the prisoners in early custody and are therefore subject to a number of assessments and policies designed to enhance their safety. Any new prisoner or one whose status has changed has an interview with a reception healthcare screener, who looks for signs that a prisoner may self-harm. Induction sessions for new prisoners emphasise the support that is available, from staff, health care and

The Prison Service and the Youth Justice Board (YJB) are working closely together to prevent the suicides of young people held in their care.

 The issue of appropriate accommodation is addressed prior to an offender&#039;s release as part of his licence conditions; this could include consideration for approved premises. For offenders who potentially pose a risk of harm to the public, this is managed under the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA), which include local housing authorities and registered social landlords as part of the duty to co-operate.

<p><a name="50124w37.html_spnew14"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The main risk created by overcrowding is that prisoners do not complete offending behaviour programmes to which they have been assigned because they are transferred to another establishment before the programme is completed. It is well understood in the Prison Service that prisoners who have started an offending behaviour programme should not be moved before the programme is completed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w37.html_para7">
The Prison Service monitors the delivery of all offending behaviour programmes for the proportion of prisoners who do not complete. The number of prisoners who start but do not complete the Sex Offender Treatment Programme is small and reasons include illness, breach of group rules and the offender voluntarily withdrawing. We believe that the number who do not complete because of overcrowding is negligible.

<p><a name="50124w38.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Ratifying the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families would require a number of changes to UK legislation. The Convention would give migrants the same access to public funds and services as British citizens, regardless of their length of stay in the UK. Changes would be required to enable these migrant workers to access benefits, housing, education and social services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w38.html_para1">
Overseas nationals who are granted settlement in the UK are entitled to claim income-related benefits and non-contributory benefits and to access social housing in the same way as a British citizen. Individuals coming to the UK for employment have to support themselves and any dependants without recourse to public funds. However, state school education and treatment under the NHS do not qualify as public funds under the Immigration Rules. So migrant workers without settlement do have access to state education services and, as long as they remain in employment, NHS services. We believe that to extend this access to all benefits before these workers are settled in the UK would act as an unnecessary &quot;pull factor&quot; and undermine immigration controls.
</p>

We have no plans to ratify the UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families.

<a name="50124w41.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Legal Aid</h3>


<p><a name="50124w41.html_wqn0"><b> John Mann: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the legal aid bill for defending drug addicts in court was in <i>(a)</i> 2002, <i>(b)</i> 2003 and <i>(c)</i> 2004.  [210145]</p>




<p><a name="50124w41.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The information requested is not available. A defendant charged with murder or robbery for example may well be a drug addict but that information is not recorded centrally.
</p>




<a name="50124w41.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Mental Capacity Bill</h3>


<p><a name="50124w41.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Burstow: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the purposes will be of the Government amendments to the Mental Capacity Bill which he has indicated will be tabled in the other House.  [209802]</p>




<p><a name="50124w41.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 At Report Stage of the Mental Capacity Bill the Government undertook to amend the Bill in two key areas. The amendments fulfilling these commitments have now been tabled for debate at Committee in the House of Lords. They provide additional reassurance sought by the House in two key areas. The first amendment relates to decisions about life-sustaining treatment in the context of best interests determinations for people who lack capacity. It provides that when someone is making a decision about whether the provision of life-sustaining treatment is in the best interests of a person lacking capacity, he cannot be motivated by any desire that the person lacking capacity 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2005 : Column 144W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
should die&#151;for whatever reason. The amendment tabled in the House of Lords on 18 January will replace the existing clause 4(5). It states:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Where the determination relates to life-sustaining treatment he must not, in considering whether the treatment is in the best interests of the person concerned, be motivated by a desire to bring about his death.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w41.html_para0">
This emphasises that the person assessing best interests must look only at the treatment which might be given, for example its possible benefits and burdens. He must not bring into the process any wish or desire to end the person&#039;s life. This should lay to rest any lingering doubt that the Bill will permit euthanasia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w41.html_para1">
The second area of amendments concerns advance decisions to refuse treatment. The amendments tabled on 18 January mean that an advance decision will have no application to any treatment which a doctor considers necessary to sustain life unless strict formalities have been complied with. These are that the decision must be in writing, signed and witnessed. In addition, there must be an express statement that the decision stands &quot;even if life is at risk&quot;. These amendments build on the already significant safeguards in the Bill surrounding advance decisions, and respond in particular to points raised by the Joint Committee on Human Rights.
</p>




<a name="50124w41.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Ministerial Engagements</h3>


<p><a name="50124w41.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Gummer: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will list the ministerial engagements <i>(a)</i> out of London and <i>(b)</i> in London that the Secretary of State has cancelled since 1 January 2004.  [209227]</p>




<p><a name="50124w41.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 There is no full record kept of cancelled engagements in the Lord Chancellor&#039;s diary. When engagements have had to be cancelled, wherever possible we try to re-instate them at a later date. All engagements are subject to Ministerial and Parliamentary business.
</p>




<a name="50124w41.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Sir Mark Thatcher</h3>


<p><a name="50124w41.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will recommend to Her Majesty the Queen the removal of the hereditary baronetcy from Sir Mark Thatcher.  [210680]</p>




<p><a name="50124w41.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 It would require primary legislation to remove a Baronet&#039;s title and the Government have no plans to introduce such legislation.
</p>




<a name="50124w41.html_sbhd4"><h3 align=center>Voting Eligibility</h3>


<p><a name="50124w41.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Heald: </b> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the UK residency requirements are to vote in general elections; and if he will make a statement on the eligibility of <i>(a)</i> citizens from the European Union who are not UK or Irish citizens and <i>(b)</i> non-EU migrants with a right to remain to vote in general elections in the UK.  [210348]</p>




<p><a name="50124w41.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 Residence for the purpose of eligibility to be included in electoral registers entitling electors to vote at UK general elections is not defined in law but has been ruled by the courts to entail a considerable degree of permanence. Electoral Registration Officers decide in the light of the relevant circumstances whether a person 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2005 : Column 145W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
may be said to be resident at a particular address. Eligibility to vote in general elections in the UK does not extend to <i>(a)</i> citizens of European Union States who are not UK or Irish citizens, unless they are also resident qualifying Commonwealth citizens (Cypriot or Maltese) and <i>(b)</i> non-EU migrants with a right to remain unless they also are resident Commonwealth citizens whose right is still extant.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what further measures are planned to help combat opium production in Afghanistan.  [209290]</p>




<p><a name="50124w41.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The UK, as lead nation, remains committed to supporting the Afghan Government in the implementation of their comprehensive National Drug Control Strategy. We are working with the Afghan Government and others to increase activity in all areas of their strategy over the coming year&#151;the principles of which were underlined by President Karzai during the first Afghan Counter Narcotics National Conference held at the beginning of December shortly after his inauguration. As well as coordinating the activity of international partners, we are providing substantial financial and practical support&#151;spending more than &#163;100 million over the period 2003&#150;06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w41.html_para2">
I refer my hon. Friend to the written statement I made on Afghanistan: Counter Narcotics on 29 November 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 17&#150;18WS. Since then, we have already seen a number of developments, such as the start of the Criminal Justice Task Force training programme in December, which will help to bring about the successful prosecution of drugs traffickers. So far over the last financial year, we have run seven training courses on intelligence and investigation techniques for the Afghan Counter-Narcotics Police; supported over five major seizures; provided a mobile forensic laboratory; and helped to establish regional law enforcement offices in seven provincial centres outside Kabul.
</p>


<p>

In addition, the UK works closely with Afghanistan&#039;s neighbours, including providing assistance, to help their efforts to counter the flow of opiates from Afghanistan.

<p><a name="50124w41.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 HM Customs and Excise estimate that approximately 25&#150;30 tonnes of heroin is smuggled into the UK each year and that over 95 per cent. originates from Afghanistan. This represents less than 10 per cent. of Afghanistan&#039;s potential heroin production in 2004.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether he makes an evaluation of the human rights performance of recipient countries in decisions on their eligibility to purchase British armaments.  [209942]</p>




<p><a name="50124w41.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. MacShane </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 January 2005]:</i> The United Kingdom has one of the strictest and most transparent arms export licensing systems of any country. All export licence applications are rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria, taking account of the circumstances prevailing at the time and other announced Government policies. The criteria include our commitment not to issue an export licence if there is a clear risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression. The Government will also exercise special caution and vigilance in issuing licences to countries where serious violations of human rights have been established by the competent bodies of the UN, the Council of Europe or by the EU.
</p>





<p><a name="50124w41.html_wqn9"><b> Mr. Wilkinson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions he has had with the governments of China&#039;s neighbouring countries on the lifting of the EU&#039;s embargo on the sale of armaments to the People&#039;s Republic of China.  [209945]</p>




<p><a name="50124w41.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Rammell </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 January 2005]:</i> The review of the EU Arms Embargo on China and any decisions arising from it are to be undertaken by the EU only. But in discussions, China and other countries in the region have expressed an interest in the issue. The EU will take all relevant factors into account in the review.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w41.html_para5">
The European Council in December 2004 discussed the embargo and invited the Luxembourg Presidency of the EU to take forward work on the review. The Council underlined that the result of any decision should not be an increase of arms exports from EU member states to China, neither in quantitative terms nor in qualitative terms. The European Council also recalled the importance of the criteria of the EU Code of Conduct on arms exports, including criteria regarding stability and security in the region.

 Burma has been largely spared the destructive forces of the earthquake and subsequent tsunami. The initial emergency needs have been met by the Burmese regime and by the aid community. The assessment of the scale of impact by the Tsunami Assistance Co-ordination Group (chaired by the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) and made up of representatives of the UN organisations and various other international NGOs) is in line with the Burmese Government&#039;s own findings with a death toll of approximately 60&#150;80 people.

 Free trade unions can have a vital role to play in the development of democracy, human rights and economic prosperity. The Foreign arid Commonwealth Office (FCO) has sought to promote the development of free trade unions in many parts of the world. For example, the FCO has supported the development of better labour market practices through programmes within the Global Opportunities Fund. These countries have included China, Serbia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. The delivery of the programmes has often involved close working between the FCO and the UK trade unions. The FCO has also provided logistical support and briefing to UK trade unions in their own work in seeking to promote the development of free trade unions in various countries. These have included Iraq, China, Zimbabwe, the Occupied Territories and Israel. The FCO has established a strong partnership with the Trades Union Congress in Britain in support of many of these activities and initiatives. For example, the FCO set up a conference for regional trades unionists in Antigua in 2004 in close consultation with the TUC.

[209379]</p>




<p><a name="50124w42.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 The UK plays a key role in international efforts to combat illegal logging and to encourage sustainable forest management. This will be an objective for our presidencies of the G8 and EU in 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w42.html_para2">
The UK is working with EU partners on the development of the EU Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Action Plan. This includes the development of EU legislation to prevent illegal timber from entering into the European market and negotiation of Voluntary Partnership Agreements with key timber producing countries. These agreements will require partner countries to establish schemes to licence legally produced timber. Timber originating in FLEGT partner countries will not be permitted to be imported into the EU without such licences. The UK also supports Forest Law Enforcement and Governance regional initiatives in Africa and Asia to help developing countries strengthen their forest governance and trade.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w42.html_para3">
As part of this overall approach, the UK Government have been seeking, since July 2000, to purchase their timber from legal and sustainable sources and have been promoting the benefits of this policy to other countries, particularly those that import significant quantities of timber.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w42.html_para4">
The UK works through key multilateral environment agreements and other international fora, including the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species, Convention on Biological Diversity and the United Nations Forum on Forests, to encourage sustainable use of forest products and protection and conservation of endangered species.

 The Government take very seriously all allegations of corruption surrounding the UN&#039;s Oil for Food (OFF) programme in Iraq.

The Government are co-operating fully with the Independent Inquiry Committee appointed by the UN in April 2004 to investigate these allegations. It would be inappropriate to comment on any specific allegations of wrongdoing until the inquiry is completed.

There has been significant progress in recent years, with the agreement in 2003 of new IMF guidelines which presume publication of all surveillance, programme and policy documents. Programmes which involve exceptional access to fund resources will not normally be approved unless authorities agree to publish programme documents. In addition, the IMF board&#039;s agenda is made public in advance, and decisions are published through Public Information Notices. Discussions are ongoing at the World Bank on the extension of their transparency policy. The Treasury&#039;s Annual Report to Parliament on the UK and the IMF, and DFID&#039;s Report on the UK and the World Bank, will set out in greater detail the UK&#039;s position on transparency in these two institutions.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the value of competency frameworks for health professionals working in dermatology; and what action he will take to ensure that they are rolled out across the NHS.  [209019]</p>




<p><a name="50124w48.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Competency frameworks and national occupational standards are already being used in the national health service to design services that are more flexible and relate directly to patient choices and needs. The aim is to enable individuals to develop career pathways in accordance with local needs and their own abilities, enabling them to progress or gain access to other areas of work based on the competences that they have achieved.

Skills for Health (SFH), the sector skills council for health, is currently considering the development of a competence framework that will cover all health professionals working in dermatology as part of its 2005&#150;06 programme of work.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w48.html_para1">
SFH is very much aware that the competency frameworks it produces need to be backed up with plans to spread their use. It is developing networks and other mechanisms to spread best practice in the use of competencies.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what role the long-term conditions care group workforce team dermatology group has in the development of NHS dermatology services; and if he will make a statement.  [209020]</p>




<p><a name="50124w48.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The dermatology sub-group of the long-term conditions care group workforce team was established in May 2003, with a remit including assessing the make-up of the dermatology workforce, informing national planning processes and sharing good and innovative practice on a national and local level. The dermatology sub-group has worked with the British Dermatological Nursing Group to conduct a survey of dermatology nurses working in both primary and secondary care and analysis of the findings is now underway.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w48.html_para2">
The sub-group has also helped develop a primary care nursing skin care course in conjunction with the university of Southampton. Further, the group is currently in the process of identifying a range of service models, that cover all levels of the patient pathway and include examples of good practice.

<p><a name="50124w48.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 The Choose and Book service is available to be rolled-out to all clinics that receive outpatient referrals from general practitioners. This includes dermatology clinics run by specialist nurses and non-consultant career grade doctors. The implementation of Choose and Book in clinics that do not provide consultant outpatient services is a matter for providers, primary care trusts and strategic health authorities, to decide on locally.

<p><a name="50124w48.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Electronic booking through the choose and book service is expected to have a positive impact on secondary care working practices and has significant potential to reduce consultant workload.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w48.html_para3">
An independent report produced by Yorkshire Institute for Clinical and Health Informatics (December 2003) found that electronic booking reduced did not attend rates and offers substantial benefits to patients who were able to choose convenient appointments that fitted in with their other commitments at work and home.

<p><a name="50124w49.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 Key components of the national health service care records service were delivered in July 2004 to support electronic booking of appointments. These included support for secure access using smartcards and user authentication, patient demographic information and the protocols for secure messaging, data storage and retrieval. Alongside these elements of the NHS care record, the application for electronic appointment booking for patients went live in early adopter sites in July 2004. Work is now well advanced to introduce electronic prescriptions during early 2005, with the core application delivered for integration testing by the end of 2004 as planned. The new national network is now on track to deliver, and probably exceed, contracted broadband connections by the end of March 2005. Progress has also been made on other national programme for information technology (NPfIT) services, particularly the roll out of the quality management and analysis system (QMAS) application to support the general medical service contract and the implementation of the new contract with Cable and Wireless to deliver the &quot;Contact&quot; e-mail service.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) develops its guidance after careful consideration of the available evidence, and in close consultation with patient groups, professional organisations and the pharmaceutical industry. Where new drugs are referred to NICE for appraisal, it monitors the licensing position closely and schedules the appraisal so that guidance follows as soon as possible after the granting of a licence. Other sources of advice are available in advance of publication of full NICE guidance, including Medicines Resource Centre publications produced by the National Prescribing Centre and funded by NICE.

 There are more qualified nurses working in the national health service than ever before, as at March 2004 there were 396,359 NHS nurses, an increase of 77,500 since 1997.
</p>


<p>

There are a wide range of programmes in place to support nurses in the NHS to fulfil their aspirations, to drive forward new ways of working, and to value and respect their contribution to improving patient care.

</p>


<p>

&quot;Agenda for Change&quot;, the new pay system for non-medical staff in the NHS, provides a unique opportunity for improved career opportunities for NHS staff working across the range of clinical and managerial roles, which in turn will support service redesign and a modernised work force able to deliver a 21st century service for patients. An integral part of &quot;Agenda for Change&quot; is the NHS knowledge and skills framework, which defines and describes the knowledge and skills which individuals need to apply in their work in order to deliver quality services. It provides a single, consistent, comprehensive and explicit framework on which to base the review and career development of all staff.
</p>


<p>

 The NHS Plan announced that the Department would provide an additional &#163;20 million per year to establish a national cancer research network. The National Cancer Research Network (NCRN) and the National Translational Cancer Research Network were established as a result. The NCRN is currently providing NHS infrastructural support for 11 trials in ovarian cancer.
</p>


<p>

The research costs of these trials are being met by public, private and charity sector funders. The Medical Research Council (MRC) is meeting some or all of the costs of five, including the &#163;8.7 million United Kingdom collaborative trial of ovarian cancer screening.

The Department funds research to support policy and to provide the evidence needed to underpin quality, improvement, and service development in the NHS.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether a police cell is deemed to be a place of safety for individuals with mental illness; and if he will make a statement.  [208738]</p>




<p><a name="50124w52.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 In certain circumstances, people who are believed to be suffering from mental disorder may be removed to a place of safety under Part 10 of the Mental Health Act 1983. The Act defines a place of safety for these purposes as including a police station. The identification of a preferred place of safety is a matter for local agreement, but the Mental Health Act Code of Practice states that, as a general rule, it is preferable for a person thought to be suffering from mental disorder to be detained in a hospital rather than a police station.

<p><a name="50124w52.html_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 On 1 April 2003, funding responsibility for health services in the publicly run prisons in England was transferred from the Home Office to the Department. From 1 April 2004, at the beginning of a staged process, 18 national health service primary care trusts (PCTs) assumed commissioning responsibility for 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2005 : Column 188W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
health services in 34 prisons. By April 2006, that commissioning responsibility will be fully devolved to PCTs and, in some cases, the PCT will also be the health care provider. Prisons and their NHS partners are now expected to work together to determine how best to meet prisoners&#039; health needs. The Government are committing significant additional resources to facilitate the transfer of commissioning responsibility to the NHS. Revenue investment will have risen by over &#163;40 million a year by 2005&#150;06, an increase of more than a third over the 2002&#150;03 baseline. The Prison Service is investing around &#163;20 million a year over the same period to rebuild and refurbish prison health care facilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para0">
Policy development advice and support is available from the central prison health team and also the regional prison health leads, whose roles will become integrated in strategic health authorities after 2006. Additionally, there is a learning network, facilitated by the university of Birmingham, where health care staff and PCT commissioners are encouraged to share good practice and participate in learning sets and themed workshops. National and local guidance documents are available on the internet and distributed through local channels.

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2005 : Column 189W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50124w52.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The national health service prostate cancer programme was launched in September 2000 and set out the Government&#039;s commitment to improve early detection of prostate cancer, to improve treatment and care for prostate cancer patients and to enhance research into prostate cancer. Since the launch, significant progress has been made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para1">
The prostate cancer risk management programme (PCRMP) has been set up to ensure that all men considering a test for prostate cancer are given information on the benefits, limitations and risks associated with having a prostate specific antigen (PSA) test.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para2">
We have issued clinical best practice so that PSA testing is performed to an explicit quality standard and that there is a systematic and standardised follow-up for those men with a high PSA level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para3">
Raising public awareness of prostate cancer is one of the key challenges for the future. We want men to know what their prostate is, what is does and what can go wrong with it. However, we have to raise public awareness in a responsible way so as not to cause undue anxiety and worry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para4">
Thanks to the work of the prostate cancer advisory group we now have, for the first time, a definitive set of key messages for the general public, which include prostate cancer and in such a way as not to cause unnecessary anxiety.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para5">
The key messages have been agreed by 20 organisations, including charities, patient groups and professional bodies, as well as the Department and can be fed into existing and future communications vehicles or as stand alone messages.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para6">
We have provided funding for the following organisations to increase public awareness of prostate cancer:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In 2003&#150;04 we provided &#163;30,000 to the Men&#039;s Health Forum to help fund its publication, the Men and Cancer manual.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">We have provided &#163;135,000 to the Prostate Cancer Charity to increase available information about prostate cancer.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">We are providing &#163;105,000 to the Prostate Cancer Charity to improve awareness of the risks and symptoms of prostate cancer in African and Afro-Caribbean men in Britain.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">We are working with the voluntary sector to develop a national prostate cancer website and have provided &#163;100,000 of funding. It is expected that the website will be launched this summer.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para7">
We are also working to both increase and improve clinical knowledge of prostate cancer. In April 2000, we published referral guidelines for suspected cancer to help general practitioners identify those patients who are most likely to have cancer and who therefore require urgent assessment by a specialist. The guidelines included a section on prostate cancer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para8">
The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently reviewing this guidance and an update is due to be published in 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para9">
The PCRMP has produced a booklet, called, The PSA test and prostate cancer: Information for primary care. This booklet provides GPs with an easy reference source on prostate cancer, from risk factors to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2005 : Column 190W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
treatment. The booklet was produced after consultation with GPs, primary care cancer leads and an expert advisory group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para10">
In September 2002, NICE published guidance on urological cancers, including prostate cancer. This guidance covers all aspects of cancer care for urological cancer patients and is aimed at helping all of those involved in planning, commissioning, organising and providing cancer services to ensure high quality services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para11">
As well as this guidance NICE is developing guidelines for the clinical management of prostate cancer and an overview of brachytherapy as an interventional procedure for prostate cancer. NICE is also appraising two prostate cancer drugs, Docetaxel and Atrasentan.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para12">
The cancer services collaborative has been working with urology teams across the country to improve access to care and to streamline the delivery of care.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para13">
We have also increased twenty-fold research funding for prostate cancer since 1999&#150;2000; from &#163;200,000 to &#163;4.2million for 2003&#150;04. This level of funding will be maintained, subject to the quality of research proposals.
</p>




<a name="50124w52.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Smoking</h3>


<p><a name="50124w52.html_wqn4"><b> David Taylor: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if he will list the organisations and individuals from whom representations on the displacement of smoking from public places to homes as a result of legislation restricting smoking in public places were received during the preparation of the Public Health White Paper;  [201951]
</p>



<p>(2) what research his Department has collated on the possible displacement of smoking from public places to homes, as a result of legislation restricting smoking in public places;  [201952]
</p>



<p>(3) what research he has commissioned on the possible displacement of smoking from public places and workplaces as a result of legislation restricting smoking in such places;  [201982]
</p>



<p>(4) what assessment has been made of the effect of exempting from restrictions on smoking in public places/pubs which do not serve prepared food would have on displacing smoking from public places to homes.  [201995]</p>




<p><a name="50124w52.html_spnew3"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The proposals for legislation set out in the White Paper &quot;Choosing Health&#151;Making Healthy choices easier&quot; to shift the balance in favour of smoke-free enclosed public places and workplaces were based on the scientific evidence of harm from second hand smoke and the views from the public. In preparation of the proposals, we took full account of the latest scientific and medical evidence of the risk to health from exposure to second hand smoke, as set out in the report from the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, which was published alongside the White Paper. Many of the studies covered look at the effects on non-smokers of living with smokers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para14">
We took full account of the views of the public, as expressed in over 150,000 responses to the public consultation on public health, in preparing our proposals. While protecting the right of the majority to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>24 Jan 2005 : Column 191W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
go out for a meal or a drink without damage, inconvenience or pollution from second hand smoke, the proposals also provide a degree of choice for the minority. We believe that this is a sensible solution that balances the protection of the majority with the personal freedom of the minority in England.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w52.html_para15">
We have made an assessment of the impact that smoking in public places would have in a reduction in smoking prevalence, which would thereby have a beneficial impact of reducing smoke at home. We will continue to act on the issue of second hand smoke in the home and have already taken action through the hard hitting campaign launched last year depicting the dangers of smoking around babies and children.

<p><a name="50124w53.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The social work degree is a generic degree based on a prescribed curriculum. Training providers must ensure that students undertake specific learning in a number of key areas. As part of their learning and assessment, students receive training on mental health matters in the human growth and development element of their degree. This forms a key element of the prescribed curriculum, which is also based on the National Occupation Standards for Social Work, in England, developed by Topss England. Mental health matters are covered in some detail in these standards.

<p><a name="50124w55.html_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 The Coal Producers Federation (COALPRO) has made representations to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister about Minerals Planning Guidance Note 3 &quot;Coal mining and colliery spoil disposal&quot;. It suggested that the test of the circumstances within which it is appropriate to permit opencast coal applications in paragraph 8 of MPG3 has sometimes been misinterpreted and that this has contributed to the significant decrease in new planning permissions for open cast coal extraction in England in recent years. It also considered that policies in some draft Regional Planning Guidance and local planning documents prepared by Minerals Planning Authorities do not accord with that national guidance, for example by applying a double test of environmental acceptability and local community benefits whereas these are specified as alternatives in MPG3. On careful reading, the meaning of this paragraph should be clear, and at present there are no plans to review MPG3. However officials in the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, together with those in the relevant Government Offices, will continue to examine and comment on regional and local planning documents to help ensure that these conform to national policy on this and other matters dealt with in MPG3.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">extends the period after sale during which landlords may require owners to repay some or all of their discount on early resale, from three years to five years</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">makes it clear that landlords have discretion to waive repayment of discount, to address cases where repayment could involve genuine hardship (the Government will issue guidance on this)</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">requires the amount of discount repaid to be a percentage of the resale value of the property (less the value of any improvements made by the owner since exercising their Right to Buy) rather than the current flat rate basis</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">shortens from 12 months to three months the period after which a landlord may serve on a tenant a &#039;first notice to complete&#039;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">allows landlords to suspend the Right to Buy for up to five years on dwellings scheduled for demolition, or to exempt such dwellings from the Right to Buy altogether if they are due to be demolished within two years</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">requires tenants who agree to resell their homes to companies within the discount repayment period (a &#039;deferred resale agreement&#039;) to repay some or all of their Right to Buy discount</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">requires owners who wish to resell properties within 10 years of their being sold under the Right to Buy to offer them back to a local social landlord (the local authority or a registered social landlord) at market value. Landlords have always been able to do this for properties in national parks, areas of outstanding natural beauty, and areas designated as &#039;rural&#039; for this purpose, of which there are now 35. The Act extends this power to other areas. The Government will specify procedures and timescales in regulations, which will be laid before Parliament as soon as possible</p>

The changes automatically apply to the Preserved Right to Buy (available to tenants transferred with their homes from local authorities to registered social landlords, mainly under large-scale voluntary transfer arrangements) (see section 171C of the Housing Act 1985), also and, with the exception of the last two, to the Right to Acquire scheme (see section 17 of the Housing Act 1996). Provision has to be made to continue orders suspending the Right to Buy because of antisocial behaviour in cases where the tenant ceases to be a secure tenant, but has a Preserved Right to Buy or the Right to Acquire, so that their right to purchase their home is still suspended.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50124w56.html_para10">
The Preserved Right to Buy regulations and to the Right to Acquire regulations will be replaced with new regulations which reflect these changes. These will be made and laid before Parliament as soon as possible.

 Registered Social Landlords (RSLs) can spend or commit recycled capital grant to projects that would be eligible for Social Housing Grant (SHG) within three years of the receipts being received or repay the grant to the Housing Corporation. For example, the recycled grant can be used to fund new dwellings and major repairs.

 Supporting People grant allocations in 2005&#150;06 have been informed by the use of a needs based distribution formula which aims to ensure that funding better reflects relative need.

The new Supporting People distribution formula was specifically developed for the Supporting People programme and takes into account levels of deprivation, population and social economic factors within an authority.
