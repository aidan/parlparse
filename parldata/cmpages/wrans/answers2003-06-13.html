<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on progress on the reform of the Warsaw Convention, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> the cap on compensation awards, <i>(b)</i> compensation for psychiatric injury and <i>(c)</i> ratification of the Montreal Convention.  [118695]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The 1999 Montreal Convention is intended to consolidate, update and eventually replace all previous international agreements on air carrier liability, including the 1929 Warsaw Convention. The Warsaw Convention will be subject to no further amendment or reform. The Montreal Convention removes liability limits in relation to claims for death and injury to passengers, but retains limits in relation to delay and baggage claims. The Montreal Convention does not acknowledge psychiatric injury as a separate head of claims. The UK is ready to ratify the Montreal Convention but since it contains issues that are subject to Community competence we are waiting until all 15 members of the EU are in a position simultaneously to deposit their instruments of ratification.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Peter Robinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans he has <i>(a)</i> to classify rock salt and its flow agent ferrocyanide as hazardous substances and <i>(b)</i> to restrict their use in highway winter maintenance operations.  [118091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Sodium hexacyanoferrate(II), rather than ferrocyanide, is the most common anti-caking (or "flow") agent used by the salt industry with rock salt for highway winter maintenance operations.
<P>

<a name="30613w01.html_para0">There are no plans to classify rock salt and its anti-caking agent as hazardous substances nor are there plans to further restrict their use in highway winter maintenance operations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assistance has been given to the merchant shipping industry to increase maritime security in non-UK waters since 11 September 2001; and if he will make a statement.  [118277]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department regularly issues advice to the United Kingdom merchant shipping industry. This includes information about the prevailing threat around the world, and appropriate security responses and enhancements. The advice is either issued directly or through representative trade associations.

<P>

<a name="30613w01.html_para1">Detailed security guidance is issued to UK flagged cruise ships operating from overseas ports. This guidance is kept under review and has been enhanced since the events of September 2001. Measures contained in the guidance are appropriate to the level of threat, and implementation is monitored by my officials during regular overseas inspection visits.
<P>

<a name="30613w01.html_para2">In November 2002 my Department published a Marine Guidance Note containing security advice on measures to counter attacks against merchant shipping. This was issued to every UK seafarer.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In the light of the outbreak of Avian Influenza in the Netherlands we have checked all elements of the Department's preparedness and are keeping the position under review in consultation with the industry. Veterinary field instructions were reviewed and amended in early March and are being further reviewed to reflect lessons learned in the Netherlands. Other elements of emergency preparedness including laboratory capacity, slaughter methods and disposal options have all been checked and updated as necessary. The supporting structures, systems and arrangements set out in the FMD Contingency Plan are ready to be employed. In the light of information on the Dutch outbreak and our experience with FMD in 2001, we would impose national movement controls immediately, unless there was very good evidence not to do so, in order to assess the source and contain any further spread of disease. We are liaising with the industry about arrangements allowing licensed movements.
<P>

<a name="30613w01.html_para4">We will be checking our emergency preparedness by holding an Avian influenza exercise later this month.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her forecast funding of the Countryside Agency is for <i>(a)</i> 2003&#150;04 and <i>(b)</i> 2004&#150;05; and if she will make a statement.  [118602]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Countryside Agency has been allocated &#163;98 million grant in aid for 2003&#150;04 compared with &#163;92 million in 2002&#150;03. Decisions on future years have not been made but we have indicated to the Agency that it may provisionally plan on receiving a similar amount in 2004&#150;05.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the implications for property owners faced by environment charges for access resulting from changes in the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000.  [117553]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_spnew8"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Regulations under section 68 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, relating to vehicular access over common and other land, prescribe the compensation sums that property owners have to pay to landowners in connection with a statutory easement under the regulations. The compensation is 0.25 per cent.&#150;2 per cent. of the value of the property served by the vehicular access, depending on its age. In addition, property owners may face other costs, such as getting their property valued.
<P>

<a name="30613w01.html_para5">These costs will not arise unless the property owner chooses to make an application under the regulations. They compare very favourably with the sums that property owners might have to pay if they were to negotiate the grant of an easement with the landowner outside the terms of section 68.

<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_wqn9"><B> Gregory Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her departmental expenditure was for each year since 1997; and what administration costs limits were set for 2003&#150;04.  [117536]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_spnew9"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to Chapter 5 of the 2003 Departmental Report. Defra did not come into existence until June 2001, but information about Defra's predecessor departments can be found in their annual Departmental Reports for 2001 and earlier years, copies of which are available in the Library of the House of Commons.

<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much financial grant her Department has given to EnCams for its Eco Schools programme in each year since 1997.  [118692]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_spnew10"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Defra does not provide EnCams Ltd. with a specific grant for its Eco Schools programme, which is funded by SITA Environmental Trust. Annual grant to EnCams from Defra incorporates a funding element for management and administration costs. This enables EnCams to deliver on a wider range of campaigns and programmes, including its Eco Schools programme. Management and administration costs include salaries and employers' costs for EnCams staff, conference and workshop costs, and office costs.

<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. David Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many jobs are dependent on the Eco Schools programme in England.  [118693]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_spnew11"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Defra funds the environmental charity EnCams, which is the parent organisation of the Tidy Britain Group, for work on litter, waste and local community initiatives in England. The Eco Schools initiative is a European Environmental award scheme funded by SITA Environmental Trust. The work of EnCams in this field has been welcomed by Ministers at Defra, as well as DfES but is in addition to the work that we fund. I understand that the work is currently undertaken by a central team but that EnCams may devolve the work to its regional teams in future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what arrangements her Department makes to distribute information on sustainable development to Eco Schools in England.  [118694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w01.html_spnew12"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Officials from the Department and DfES are regularly in contact with EnCams Ltd, the environmental charity that runs the Eco Schools programme in England, about a range of sustainable development information that may be suitable for

<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w02.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 As set out in the Environment Act 1995, the purposes of National Parks are to conserve and enhance their natural beauty, wildlife and cultural heritage; and to promote the public understanding and enjoyment of their special qualities. In pursuing these purposes National Park Authorities have a duty to seek to foster the economic and social well being of communities within the National Park.
<P>

<a name="30613w02.html_para2">Candidates for membership of a National Park Authority are welcomed from all backgrounds. We expect those appointed by the Secretary of State to represent the national interest, including the views of people not living in or near the Parks; to work to achieve both the Parks' purposes; we encourage them bring experience of wider issues, such as an interest in outdoor recreation or sport or business conservation. In making appointments, we seek to ensure members collectively have a range of interests which cover all the Authority's activities.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what proportion of the funds raised by the Aggregates Levy has been paid <i>(a)</i> directly by the Government and <i>(b)</i> via another party in respect of work carried out for the Government.  [118643]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w02.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The aggregates levy is payable by anyone who commercially exploits virgin aggregate. Whether the cost is passed on to the end user is a commercial decision for these suppliers; therefore, it is not possible to establish the proportion of revenue raised by the levy which is paid by, or on behalf of, Government.

<P>
(4) what consultation has been undertaken with groups representing blind and partially sighted people on the effectiveness of measures to enable them to distinguish between banknotes.  [118647]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w02.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The production of most UK banknotes is the responsibility of the Bank of England. The Bank is very conscious of the problems experienced by visually impaired people in identifying banknotes. Each denomination has a unique colour theme and there is a symbol to aid the partially sighted incorporated into the front design. The new design &#163;5, &#163;10 and &#163;20 notes have large and clear denomination numbers. In addition, differentials in size allow some visually impaired people to distinguish between the denominations.
<P>

<a name="30613w02.html_para3">On occasions the Treasury and the Bank receive suggestions from members of the public with a view to enabling visually impaired people to distinguish banknotes more readily. Suggestions are considered and where appropriate incorporated into the finished note. An example of this is the use of larger denomination figures on the new style &#163;5, &#163;10 and &#163;20 notes. The 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jun 2003 : Column 1091W</I><P>
incorporation of Braille into the design of the notes has also been suggested. However, it was felt that this (and any other kind of raised markings) would wear rapidly once the notes were in active circulation, and so would cease to be reliable.
<P>

<a name="30613w02.html_para4">There are no plans to make any further changes to the current series of banknotes to assist visually impaired people in distinguishing between the different denominations.
<P>

<a name="30613w02.html_para5">The Bank of England regularly consults a number of organisations, including the Royal National Institute for the Blind, during the design phase of all new banknotes.
<P>

<a name="30613w02.html_para6">When changes are made to banknotes, information is available from the Bank of England in Braille and large print. I also understand that visually impaired people can obtain banknote guides from commercial banks and the RNIB.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many independent financial advisers are working across the UK; how many have been unable to source professional indemnity insurance; and what action has been taken by the Financial Services Agency to address the situation within the professional indemnity insurance market.  [118062]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The Financial Services Authority (the FSA) advise that there are approximately 4,000 directly authorised firms of independent financial advisers (IFAs) in the UK. Between September 2002 and April 2003 just under 2,800 of these were due to renew their professional indemnity (PI) cover, over 1,950 have done so or been granted a waiver of the requirement to have PI.

<a name="30613w02.html_para8">IFAs may be reluctant to confirm that they have PI cover until they have a policy document, even if they have agreed terms. This means that the reported position can appear less positive than it is.

<a name="30613w04.html_para1">The Government has invested some &#163;72 million in 2002&#150;03, and is spending a further &#163;50 million this year, on tourism, including &#163;47 million to VisitBritain to encourage people in Britain and abroad to take their holiday here. I am sure that VisitBritain's campaigns, such as 'Outdoor Britain' which leads on the Peak District National Park, will, alongside the good work done by Visit Heart of England Tourist Board, be of enormous benefit to tourism in Staffordshire.
<P>

<a name="30613w04.html_para2">Government support for tourism is not limited to supporting a tourist board. DCMS alone spends some &#163;1 billion per year, for example, on the arts, royal parks and palaces, museums and galleries, much of which directly benefits tourism.

 DFID have commissioned a number of studies looking at the impact of different aspects of agricultural liberalisation by developed countries. Some studies have analysed the effect of reforming certain commodity market regimes in the EU, such as the sugar and dairy regimes. These have shown that reducing support in the EU for these commodities will have a positive impact on world prices, thus benefiting exporting developing countries. It will also lead to reduced dumping on developing country markets which is currently harming local production and trade. But there will also be losers as some countries may see their highly profitable preferential access to the EU market eroded.
<P>

<a name="30613w04.html_para3">A recent study on wider liberalisation in agriculture by all developed countries shows similar results. It also stresses the need for complementary policies in helping developing countries reap the full benefits of agricultural trade. Support will need to be provided to those who lose their preferential access to EU markets in order to identify alternative market opportunities. This will need to be taken carefully into consideration within individual countries' development strategies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the Government's position is on the proposed EU Directive on Consumer Credit (Draft September 2002); and if she will make a statement.  [114381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w06.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Government supports the Commission's overall objective of creating an internal market that provides a high level of consumer protection enabling consumers to shop cross border with confidence and lenders to trade with legal certainty. However, we have serious concerns about the current draft delivering this objective and believe it needs substantial change.
<P>

<a name="30613w06.html_para0">We aim to secure recognition that mortgages require significantly different regulation than other forms of consumer credit and therefore should be outside the scope of the Directive. We also recognise that the Directive would prove a significant burden on credit unions and are therefore seeking to exclude them from the scope of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="30613w06.html_para1">We are fighting hard to ensure that we maintain the joint and several liability protections that currently govern credit card use in the UK and are highly valued by consumers.

 In May 1999 the Government commissioned a review of compliance by quoted companies with the Greenbury Code of Best Practice and the Combined Code. Subsequently, a consultation document "Directors' Remuneration" was issued in July 1999 setting out proposals for strengthening the legislative framework. In December 2001 the Government issued a consultation document which sought views on draft legislation. This legislation (The Directors' Remuneration Report Regulations 2002) came into force on 1 August 2002 and applies to quoted 



<P>
<P><I>13 Jun 2003 : Column 1105W</I><P>
companies with financial years ending on or after 31 December 2002. The regulations significantly enhance requirements relating to disclosure of directors' remuneration, particularly with regard to policy matters, and provide for an annual shareholder vote on the Directors' Remuneration Report.
<P>

<a name="30613w06.html_para2">Most recently, on 2 June this year, the Government issued a consultation document entitled "Directors' Remuneration&#151;Contracts, Performance and Severance", seeking views on a range of options to improve the linkage between compensation and performance when contracts are terminated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w06.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 ECGD requires as a minimum that all projects, goods or services comply with host country legislation, regulations and standards. In addition, ECGD normally expects the projects it supports to comply with World Bank Group environmental guidelines and relevant safeguard policies.
<P>

<a name="30613w06.html_para3">Alternatively, ECGD may accept other relevant internationally recognised standards including those of the UK, EU, WHO, World Bank, IFC and relevant regional development banks.
<P>

<a name="30613w06.html_para4">Host country or project standards that are below international standards would normally be unacceptable and, in line with the World Bank Guidelines, would need site specific justification.
<P>

<a name="30613w06.html_para5">UK Government policy is that ECGD should use the environmental guidelines and standards developed by the international financial institutions identified above rather than developing its own standards.

 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2003]:</i> My Department's contributions to progress on the commitments agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) range across a number of areas, as set out in the Annex to the Government's Memorandum to the Environmental Audit Committee on WSSD follow-up (12 February 2003). They are reflected in the Department's current business plans and will be further incorporated and refined in the light of future developments, for example on the Doha Development Round, work on a UK Sustainable Consumption and Production Strategy and an independent report commissioned by the Department on options for action at the international level to follow up the WSSD outcomes on Corporate Social Responsibility. Where appropriate and relevant the commitments will be taken into account in setting my Department's next Public Service Agreement as part of the 2004 Spending Review.

 Regulations to implement the new Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications will introduce stricter rules on the use of SMS messages for the purposes of direct marketing, and these Regulations are currently open for public consultation closing on 19 June. The consultation paper is available in the House of Commons Library, or on the DTI website at the following URL:
http://www.dti.gov.uk/industries/ecommunications/directive on privacy electronic communications 200258ec.html
<P>

<a name="30613w07.html_para0">As part of the consultation, some 1,200 interested parties were contacted direct in March 2003, including most mobile network providers, the DMA and the ASA. In addition, there have been a number of meetings between my officials and major stakeholders, including a joint DTI/DMA open meeting on 29 May.
<P>

<a name="30613w07.html_para1">The present rules are set out in the Telecommunications (Data Protection and Privacy) Regulations 1999, which introduced a statutory opt-out scheme, the Telephone Preference Service (TPS), through which individuals can register to avoid the receipt of unsolicited direct marketing calls. Direct marketers must not contact numbers listed on the TPS without the prior consent of the recipient of the call. The body responsible for the enforcement of the Regulations, the Information Commissioner's Office, treats an SMS message to a mobile as a "call" for the purposes of the current Regulations. Until the new Regulations are in force, individuals can therefore best protect themselves from unsolicited direct marketing SMS and voicemail messages to their mobile telephone by registering their number with the TPS. Details of how to register are available on the TPS website at www.tpsonline.org.uk

 The Air Training Corps' (ATC's) role as a national youth organisation is to encourage a practical interest in aviation and the RAF and also to develop the personal qualities of its members. The Sea Cadet Corps (SCC) is an independent charitable body that provides an opportunity for youths to learn seamanship skills and to develop their personal qualities also. Both organisations foster the spirit of adventure and develop qualities of leadership, encouraging a sense of community and good citizenship that is highly valued by both military and civilian employers. They also encourage membership of schemes such as the Duke of

The cadets themselves carry out all these community activities. However, there are also occasional joint ventures with the serving military community, such as the support provided at the Southport Air Show and the recent 60th anniversary of the Battle of the Atlantic.

The Strategic Defence Review in 1998 confirmed the need for a robust capability to underwrite the safety and reliability of Trident, in the absence of nuclear testing. Sub-critical experiments do not produce nuclear yield and are fully consistent with our obligations under the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty.

 Information is not collected centrally on cancer care spell delays. A cancer care spell delay is defined as a delay in either an out-patient appointment or treatment for suspected cancer after a referral has been received. A cancer care spell delay should be recorded locally for each delay. Information on cancer care spell delays will be used locally for performance management of cancer services.

 Guidance on eligibility for accessing the quality protects (QP) programme funding has been issued and is available on the Department's website at http://www.doh.gov.uk/qualityprotects/workpro/project 6.htm . For the Carers Grant funding, guidance is available on the Government carers website www.carers.gov.uk which explains that 20 per cent. is available for children's services.
<P>

<a name="30613w11.html_para0">Disabled children are a priority area in the QP programme. From 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 &#163;60 million for the children's services special grant has been earmarked for services for disabled children and their families, with &#163;15 million in 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 and &#163;30 million in 2003&#150;04. One of the areas local authorities have been told that expenditure should be targeted on is increased provision of family support services including short term breaks.
<P>

<a name="30613w11.html_para1">Last year's QP management action plans show that authorities are beginning to improve the services they provide to disabled children. More family support services are being provided, particularly home based respite care and sitting services. Many are developing proposals in collaboration with partners from other agencies and sectors, such as the national health service and voluntary sector.
<P>

<a name="30613w11.html_para2">The Department of Health does not collect centrally information on children's hospice bed numbers nor do we monitor which service providers local authorities consider or use to provide short term breaks. Local councils may use other service providers than hospices (sitting services, residential homes) and they may fund opportunities for families with disabled children to go on holiday together.
<P>

<a name="30613w11.html_para3">The Department does not give advice and guidance to primary care trusts on the levels of Government funding that should be made available to adult and children's hospices. Primary care trusts have a pivotal role in assessing the extent of health care needs within their catchment area and funding service provision, including adult hospice and children's hospice services. The level of funding agreed is a matter for local discussion and decision.
<P>

<a name="30613w11.html_para4">A central budget of an additional &#163;50 million per annum for adult specialist palliative care, including hospices, has been set up for the three years beginning 2003&#150;04. This funding is specifically to meet the commitments and aims set out in the NHS Cancer Plan. The extra &#163;50 million represents an increase of about 38 per cent. in the amount of NHS funding being put into adult specialist palliative care over 2000 levels and means that the pledge in the NHS Cancer Plan will be more than met. Allocation from this &#163;50 million to local cancer networks will be made once network investment plans have been approved by the joint NHS/voluntary sector group, the National Partnership Group. The current NHS funding levels for adult hospices average 28 per cent. of running costs, although this varies across the country.

<P>

<a name="30613w11.html_para6">Children's hospices are a very distinct and emerging area of provision for children with life threatening illness.

In May 2003 the MRC announced funding for two trials that will look at the effectiveness of various treatments for CFS/ME. The results of these trials will help patients and their doctors to choose the best treatment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w12.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 A review by the University of York into the fluoridation of water listed three studies in which the incidence of thyroid (goitre) disease was the outcome of interest. Two of these studies (Gedalia and Brand (1963), "The relationship of fluoride and iodine in drinking water in the occurrence of goiter, Arch Int Pharmacodyn, 142, 312&#150;315)"; Jooste et al. (1999) "Endemic goiter in the absence of iodine deficiency in schoolchildren of the Northern Cape Province of South Africa, Eur J Clin Nutr, 53(1), 8&#150;12)" found no significant association with water fluoride level. The third (Lin et al. (1991) "The relationship of a low iodine and high fluoride environment to subclinical cretinism in Xinjiang," Xinjiang Institute for Endemic Disease Control and Research, Office of Leading Group for Endemic Disease Control of Hetian Prefectural Committee of the Communist Party of China and County Health and Endemic Prevention Station, Yutian, Xinjiang&#151;unpublished report submitted through national health service centre for Reviews and Dissemination website) found a significant positive association between combined high fluoride/low iodine levels and goitre.
<P>

<a name="30613w12.html_para1">The Department of Health asked the Medical Research Council (MRC) to suggest where it might be possible to strengthen the evidence currently available. In their report, MRC concluded that, because the 1991 study looked at combined fluoride/iodine uptakes and has not been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the findings should be treated cautiously. The MRC reported in September 2002 and on their recommendation, we have commissioned a study to investigate the effect of water hardness and source of fluoride ion on bio-availability of fluoride in drinking water. The study is due for completion in autumn 2003.

centre for Reviews and Dissemination at the University of York. The report of the review was published in October 2000. The review found that the evidence showed that fluoridating water helps to reduce tooth decay. In areas of comparable social mix, dental health is much higher if the water is fluoridated.
<P>

<a name="30613w12.html_para3">The review found no clear evidence of other adverse effects on general health associated with water fluoridation, other than the increased risk of dental fluorosis&#151;mottling of the teeth, which, in its more extreme forms, will leave some people concerned about the appearance of their teeth. Nevertheless, the strength of the teeth is not affected, they are still endowed with extra resistance to decay and, where it is cosmetically unacceptable, the effect can often be removed by routine dental treatment.

The Department, however, is seeking to make health advice and treatment available to address men's specific needs through a variety of means including the effective use of modern technologies, innovative approaches and more flexible services.
<P>

<a name="30613w13.html_para0">Telephone helplines and websites are playing an increasing role in providing information and advice to men. New services such as NHS walk in centres have contributed to improvements in the accessibility of advice and treatment for men. We run promotion campaigns, such as the Sex Lottery, which raises awareness of sexually transmitted diseases and includes material that targets young men in particular.
<P>

<a name="30613w13.html_para1">We also work in collaboration with other organisations such as Cancer Research UK with whom we have produced a self awareness leaflet on testicular cancer.
<P>

<a name="30613w13.html_para2">The Department works closely with Men's Health Forum, the leading organisation in this field, which has an active information and publications service. We are currently helping to fund the core activities of the Forum and we also fund it to undertake specific projects on men's health.
<P>

<a name="30613w13.html_para3">For the future we are undertaking research to inform policy development on access to advice and treatment for men.

<P>
<a name="30613w13.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Single mumps vaccines being prescribed and administered, as part of single measles, mumps and rubella vaccination programmes are unlicensed imported medicines. The number of doses of mumps vaccines allowed into the United Kingdom varies according to the number of notifications submitted per day by importers of unlicensed medicines, who are licensed by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). Every importer must notify the MHRA on each occasion they intend importing an unlicensed medicine and there is a legal restriction on the maximum quantity they may import per notification (a maximum of 25 single administrations). This applies to all imported unlicensed medicines. The MHRA received an average of 172 notifications to import unlicensed mumps vaccines per month during the first quarter of 2003. This is the number of notifications submitted to the MHRA for importation and does not necessarily relate to the number of doses actually imported. Consequently the MHRA does not have data on the actual number of doses imported or on the stocks held in the UK.

<a name="30613w13.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Government are committed to tackling the rising trend in obesity. The Department of Health is working with other Government Departments and a range of other partners at national, regional and local levels, on programmes to improve diet and increase physical activity levels.
<P>

<a name="30613w13.html_para4">Action to improve diet includes the Food in Schools Programme, the Five-A-Day programme to increase fruit and vegetable consumption and work with industry to address the overall balance of diet including fat, sugar and salt, working with the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The Department of Health, Sport England and the Countryside Agency are funding local exercise action pilots (LEAP), based in the nine English regions. The Department of Health is also working with other Government Departments, such as the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the Department for Transport (DfT), to establish a sport and physical activity board (SPAB) to begin raising levels of mass participation for young people and adults, particularly women and the elderly.
<P>

<a name="30613w13.html_para5">Significant funding is also being provided to support the physical education (PE) and school sport and club links programme, which will implement the joint DfES/DCMS public service agreement target to provide two hours of high-quality PE and school sport to 70 per cent. of pupils by 2006. The New Opportunities Fund are also funding improvements to sports facilities in schools.
<P>

<a name="30613w13.html_para6">The Food and Health Action Plan will also pull together all the issues that influence what we eat and will address healthy eating at all stages of the life course. The

The Department of Health funds the national health service research and development programme, which aims to identify NHS needs for research and to commission research to meet those needs. Commissioning is undertaken through national programmes of research such as the health technology assessment (HTA) programme. There have been two recent projects on cystic fibrosis, "Information needs for health planning; screening for cystic fibrosis" and "A comparative study of hypertonic saline, daily and alternate day rhDNase in cystic fibrosis". The cost of these projects totalled &#163;177,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many applicants there were for <i>(a)</i> undergraduate and <i>(b)</i> postgraduate secondary teacher training courses, (i) in total and (ii) broken down by subject, in each year since 1991.  [118188]<P>

<a name="30613w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The tables show, the number of applications to undergraduate and postgraduate secondary teacher training courses in England and Wales that were processed by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service and the Graduate Teacher Training Registry respectively. Some applications are made independently of these bodies. Since 2001/02 it has also been possible to report the number of applications for England only as shown in the tables.
<P>

<a name="30613w15.html_para1">The number of postgraduate applications reflects the number of applicants to courses. Undergraduate applicants are allowed to make up to six applications per person. Data on applications for undergraduate teacher training courses for years before 1996/97 are not available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many qualified entrants to full-time or part-time service there were in the maintained nursery/primary and secondary sector in England in each year since 1997, broken down by <i>(a)</i> newly qualified entrants, <i>(b)</i> deferred entrants, <i>(c)</i> re-entrants and <i>(d)</i> subject in the case of secondary school teachers.  [118117]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30613w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The tables show qualified entrants to full-time or part-time regular service in the maintained nursery/primary or secondary sector in England.
<P>

<a name="30613w16.html_para0">The tables showing entrants to the secondary phase show the main subjects of teacher training. A teacher can appear under two different subject rows, reflecting the fact that some teachers qualify in more than one subject. The figures shown in the first table are not based on subject and therefore exclude any double counting. Teachers with 'other' subjects or 'subjects not known' are included in the secondary totals but not shown separately.
<P>

<a name="30613w16.html_para1">Around 10 per cent. to 20 per cent. of part-timers may not be included.

We, and other UN partners co-sponsored the recent UNCHR resolution on Burma on 16 April 2003. We also remain in close contact with the UN Secretary General's Special Envoy to Burma, Razali Ismail. We welcome that he was able to meet with Aung San Suu Kyi on his recent visit to Burma and that she was unharmed. However, we still remain deeply concerned over the situation in Burma and call for the immediate release of Aung San Suu Kyi and members of the NLD.

 As stated in the Sustainable Communities Plan, local authorities should separate their landlord function from their strategic housing responsibilities. Best Value reports show that landlords' concerns often dominate local authorities thinking on housing when they should be considering strategies for whole local housing markets. Separation helps ensure that proper attention is given to both the strategic and landlord functions.

 Castle Point covers an area of 44.75 square km and the borough council holds 4.7 per cent. of the total housing stock, some 35,700 properties.
<P>

<a name="30613w19.html_para3">The borough lies within the Thames Gateway growth area, and as such, will benefit from the &#163;446 million that the "Sustainable Communities: Building for the Future" (SCP) documents, published in February of this year, have made available for this area over the next three years. This growth area has the potential to provide a significant portion of the 200,000 additional homes, for the south-east, mentioned in the SCP.
<P>

<a name="30613w19.html_para4">Further provision of social housing will be in collaboration with a number of RSLs in the area, providing housing for rent and affordable housing for ownership through shared ownership and Homebuy schemes.
<P>

<a name="30613w19.html_para5">For the period 2003&#150;04, the Housing Corporation has allocated some &#163;1.237 billion for 20,645 new homes nationally. The east of England will receive &#163;116.06 million, providing 3,707 homes with the challenge fund providing an additional &#163;23.94 million and 429 homes. Castle Point itself will receive in the region of &#163;70,000.
<P>

<a name="30613w19.html_para6">The forthcoming Regional Housing Strategy, produced by the Regional Housing Forum and accepted by the Regional Housing Board, will prove instrumental in the allocation of funding to the areas of greatest housing need. This level of funding in the region coupled with the strategic priorities of the council of providing housing and housing services to the public will enable Castle Point to increase provision of affordable housing in the borough and offer vital housing services to the public, which in turn, will have effect on the numbers of households on the waiting list for accommodation.
