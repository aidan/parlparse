<p><a name="41201w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Article 23 of Directive 2001/18 provides member states with the right to take safeguard action to restrict or prohibit the use and/or sale of a GMO in their territory if new or additional scientific information becomes available, after the date of consent, that indicates that the GMO constitutes a risk to human health or the environment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41201w01.html_para0">
Additional scientific evidence in support of the actions being discussed at Regulatory Committee on 29&nbsp;November was provided by Greece and Austria earlier this year. The European Food Safety Authority has considered the information provided and concluded that there is no new, scientific evidence, in terms of risk to human health and the environment that would invalidate the original risk assessments. The Advisory Committee on Release to the Environment has also assessed the further information provided and agrees with the EFSA opinion. Defra officials will therefore be voting in support of the Commission Decisions requesting the countries concerned to repeal these measures.

For those sites, such as Wingmoor Farm, that choose to be designated as hazardous waste landfills, operators had to apply to the Environment Agency for a permit that contained the operating conditions for the site. The agency had to then decide whether a permit should be issued and, if so, what operating conditions would be applied. The Environment Agency is unable to issue a permit unless the necessary planning permissions are in place. I understand that a permit has been issued for Wingmoor Farm.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many positive reactor cattle subsequently proved to be free of tuberculosis in each of the last five years; how their carcase was subsequently disposed of; and how many of them entered the human food chain. [199572]</p>




<p><a name="41201w01.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Cattle which react to the tuberculin test are considered to be affected by bovine tuberculosis (TB), regardless of culture results. Bacteriological tests on samples taken from reactor animals are not carried out to validate the skin test results but to identify, for epidemiological purposes, the strain of &quot;Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis)&quot; responsible for the infection.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41201w01.html_para6">
Carcases and their associated offal are inspected by the Meat Hygiene Service at slaughter and those with generalised infection are fully condemned and declared unfit for human consumption. Where localised TB lesions are found in more than one organ or area of a carcase the whole carcase is condemned. Carcases with lesions in a single organ or part of the carcase and associated lymph nodes are only passed fit for human consumption once the affected part of the carcase has been cut out and condemned. If no TB lesions are found the carcase is passed fit for human consumption. Any remaining &quot;M. bovis&quot; would be de-activated by thorough cooking.

[199439]</p>




<p><a name="41201w02.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 None; under Section 9(2) of the Waste and Emissions Trading Act 2003 a waste disposal authority (WDA) automatically becomes liable for a (financial) penalty if the amount of biodegradable municipal waste it sends to landfill in any one scheme year exceeds the amount authorised by the number of landfill allowances it holds for that year. Before that position is reached, however, a WDA will be able to trade or borrow allowances in a six month reconciliation period that follow the end of a scheme year, in order to balance its books. Alternatively, a WDA can make a case to the Secretary of State for her to use her powers to waive a penalty if the reason for the breach was beyond its control.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the robustness of the estimates made for carbon emissions for road transport by the National Environmental Technology Centre. [200897]</p>




<p><a name="41201w02.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The figures that the National Environmental Technology Centre publish on carbon emissions from road transport are based on internationally agreed emission reporting guidelines which require them to be based on national statistics on fuel consumption. Thus, the figures are as robust as DTI&#039;s energy statistics on petrol and diesel consumption in the UK. A very small correction is made for the amount of these fuels used for off-road machinery, for example, lawn mowers, but the relative amounts used for these machines are very small. The allocation of the carbon emissions between different vehicle classes is based on vehicle km data from DfT&#039;s national traffic survey and speed-related CO <sub>2</sub>  factors for different vehicle types.

<p><a name="41201w03.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) propose to redevelop their existing site at Dun Laoghaire to become their combined headquarters building and operational base. The project, with an estimated total cost of &#163;14&nbsp;million, would bring substantial efficiency gains from co-location, and realise some &#163;7&nbsp;million from the sale of the CIL&#039;s current HQ building in central Dublin. CIL has submitted an application for planning permission to the relevant authorities. Detailed design work is not yet complete and so no schedule of costs is available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41201w03.html_para1">
The Irish Government confirmed on 26&nbsp;November that they are ready to contribute 35&nbsp;per cent. of the cost of the project, starting in 2005. We are now considering the case for sanctioning expenditure from the General Lighthouse Fund for the balance of the costs.

<p>(4) whether he plans to seek a rebate from the Irish Government for the sums contributed for the Irish Lights from the General Lighthouse Fund in the last financial year. [200459]</p>




<p><a name="41201w03.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The provision of aids to navigation around the British Isles as a whole is funded by light dues levied on shipping using ports in Britain and Ireland. Because light dues revenue at ports in Ireland is much less than at ports in the UK, there is effectively a subsidy from the UK to Ireland. This can only be calculated retrospectively; and it cannot be estimated until the annual expenditure plans of the Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) are agreed. We expect the subsidy will amount to &#163;6.1&nbsp;million in respect of 2003&#150;04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41201w03.html_para2">
This figure is after allowing for the contribution the Irish Government already make to bring receipts from Ireland up to 35&nbsp;per cent. of the operating costs of CIL, in accordance with a 1985 agreement between the British and Irish Governments. We are working with the Irish Government to renegotiate the 1985 agreement, but cannot set a date when the subsidy might cease. There have been two meetings in 2004, on 26&nbsp;April and 14&nbsp;October, between officials of the Department for Transport and of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (DCMNR). The issue was also raised at a meeting in June between HM ambassador to Ireland and the secretary-general of the DCMNR. We are pressing for more substantive negotiations, involving additionally officials from the Foreign Office and the Northern Ireland Office, to begin in the new year.

 Initial estimates suggest that, for domestic customers, prices at the end of 2004 are likely to be 18&nbsp;per cent. higher for gas and 13&nbsp;per cent. higher for electricity than they were at the start of the year. The impacts of these increases will be greatest for lower income customers. They can be minimised by taking a range of actions. Switching from &quot;home&quot; gas and electricity suppliers can save an average of &#163;50 a year; switching payment method to direct debit can save a further &#163;25.

The attacks on people from minority communities are unacceptable and to be deplored. They are an issue for all sections of society in Northern Ireland. Some of the recent media headlines would lead observers to the conclusion that Northern Ireland has become a hotbed of racial intolerance. However, this is not the case. It is frequently only the bad news that is reported, not the work going on behind the scenes to promote integration and tolerance. And while crimes have increased significantly over a number of years, I am pleased to report that the rate of increase in the number of attacks appears to be slowing down.

<i>[holding answer 30&nbsp;November 2004]:</i> The Department of International Development (DFID) works with partner governments, respecting choices made at the country level, including priorities set within poverty reduction strategies. Where these do not include sectors or issues that DFID regards as high priority, DFID addresses this through reviews of poverty reduction strategies, and through support to strengthen policy analysis and dialogue. Opportunities for monitoring arise in particular during annual reviews of Poverty Reduction Strategies, World Bank and International Monetary Fund reviews, budget and public expenditure reviews, and during the preparation of subsequent Poverty Reduction Strategies.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what estimate his Department has made of the amount of funds in US dollars which originated from <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;United Kingdom bilateral aid and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;aid from the European Union held by the estate of the late Yasser Arafat; and if he will make a statement.

<p><a name="41201w13.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 There is no evidence which indicates that either UK bilateral or European funds are held by the estate of President Arafat. Until this year the majority of DFID&#039;s bilateral programme expenditure has been technical assistance, channelled directly through international and local managing agents, not the Palestinian Authority (PA). In 2004 DFID contributed bilaterally to the PA budget through the World Bank Public Financial Management Reform Trust Fund. Since 2000, the European Commission has provided budget assistance to the PA in addition to its technical assistance programme. This money has been managed directly by the Ministry of Finance with no involvement of the President&#039;s Office.

<p>
<a name="41201w13.html_para6">
The International Monetary Fund reported last year that during the period 1995 to 2000, there was a diversion of &#163;560&nbsp;million of revenue from the Palestinian Authority budget to a special bank account controlled by President Arafat. There was no suggestion that this money had been &quot;misused&quot;&#151;and that the large majority of these funds had been invested in assets that are still within the public domain. The IMF report highlighted the significant progress that has been made

The Ministry of Defence does not hold records of flying hours lost owing to bad weather. The following table presents the total number of lost flying hours by month since January 2001 at RAF Waddington, RAF Lyneham and RAF Brize Norton when conditions were assessed as red. Red conditions are defined as when visibility is less than 800 metres or the cloud base is less than 200 ft above ground level. In these conditions, flying is unlikely to take place. Other weather conditions, for example high winds and turbulence, might also preclude flying but their incidence is not recorded.

The review concluded that the choice of Windows 2000 presented the lowest risk of the available options. The contractor considered that there were only two credible choices of accredited operating system: Windows 2000 from Microsoft and a Unix based solution, Solaris from Sun. While the Unix option was considered technically viable, the decision to use Windows 2000 was taken as it was considered to minimise the risks for long-term support.

 It is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the number of people in the constituency of Weston-Super-Mare who were eligible to receive a winter fuel payment as DWP administrative data does not contain complete information on household circumstances, and payments are based on household composition.

 The provision of magistrates courthouses is a matter for the 42 Magistrates Courts Committees (MCCs).

MCCs are not required by statute to inform my Department of magistrates court closures that are not subject to an appeal, although the Department does keep a complete record of county court closures.

 The latest estimates are that there are approximately 1,900 magistrates courts staff working on criminal enforcement (including fines).
