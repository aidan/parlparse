 The planned level of programme resources for the Environmental Action Fund (EAF) was &#163;4.19 million per year for the three financial years from 2002&#150;03 to 2004&#150;05. In 2002&#150;03 a total of &#163;4.48 million was actually offered to groups, but this included some funding for groups in their third and final year of funding from a previous grant round. Groups were then required to reapply for funding at the start of each financial year. Following those applications, &#163;4.26 million was offered to groups in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;4.12 million in 2004&#150;05.
</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_0">The planned level of EAF programme resources for projects relating to sustainable consumption and production is &#163;2.25 million per year for the financial years from 2005&#150;06 to 2007&#150;08. Offers of grant totalling &#163;2.25 million have been made for 2005&#150;06, with 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>2 Feb 2005 : Column 896W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
provisional offers of &#163;2.4 million for both 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 (reflecting the likelihood of some slippage or scaling-down of projects as they develop their work plans in the first year and then reapply for funding for the second and third years).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">In addition, &#163;1.95 million of EAF grant is being rolled over in 2005&#150;06 to existing recipients undertaking biodiversity projects.

[211409]</p>








<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50202w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 We received 250 bids for funding from the Environmental Action Fund (EAF) in 2005&#150;08. I have announced today that 36 projects were successful in the competition and are being offered grant funding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w01.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_2">The large majority of bids, both successful and unsuccessful, included elements of increasing awareness and understanding of sustainable development. It is not possible to quantify these elements, as the criteria for the 2005&#150;08 grant competition sought applications for projects that would focus on moving beyond raising awareness and towards action for influencing and delivering more sustainable consumption behaviours.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on funding for environmental education projects following the wind-up of the landfill tax credit scheme; and what steps she is taking to ensure that there is no shortfall in funding.  [211398]</p>








<p><a name="st_4"><a name="50202w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Landfill Tax Credit Scheme was reformed in 2003, as a result of which waste projects with an education component (categories C and CC) are no longer eligible for funding. Only a small proportion of that funding was used to support projects with a formal education basis. Certain environmental educational projects remain eligible for funding under the current scheme, for example in the biodiversity category. There was no direct replacement of the LTCS funding stream to support projects that might previously have been eligible. Projects with an environmental education component are supported by the Environmental Action Fund. Several other Defra programmes contribute to more informal modes of environmental education and awareness raising, for example &#163;30 million over three years has been allocated to the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) for national and local waste awareness campaigns.

The Legal Services Commission may from time to time prepare a revised version of the code which must be subject to appropriate consultation. The Funding Code is in two parts: Part I contains the Criteria, and Part II contains the Procedures. Amendments to both Parts must be approved by the Lord Chancellor before the relevant Parliamentary process. Revised Funding Code Criteria must normally be approved by a resolution of each House of Parliament before coming into force, although the Act allows urgent amendments to come into force in certain circumstances in advance of that approval. Revised Funding Code Procedures must be laid before Parliament.

 DFID supports disaster prone countries around the world with disaster risk reduction programmes at the regional, country and community level and is always ready to provide immediate humanitarian assistance when disasters strike, and support subsequent recovery and reconstruction efforts. Many UK communities have existing links with communities in disaster prone areas, and in such cases it makes good sense to build on that relationship by offering support to the overseas community. Where no such relationship exists, there may well be further scope for developing twinning arrangements with the aim of providing practical support. A first step for those wishing to establish such community links would be to consult the relevant UK embassies and high commissions, and UK-based community organisations of the relevant countries.

<p><a name="st_54"><a name="50202w07.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Over the past year the international community in Angola has steadily reduced food aid contributions in line with the country&#039;s decreasing humanitarian needs and increasing crop production. As most donors provide cash funding to the World Food Programme (WFP), there has been no direct link between the reduction of food aid and the new law banning the introduction of genetically modified (GM) foods. When the new law was announced in March 2004, the USA replaced a food aid shipment of 19,000 tonnes of GM maize with 14,000 tonnes of non-GM sorghum. WFP uses donor funds to buy non-GM maize, beans and other food items in the southern Africa region. WFP has sufficient food in its warehouses to help Angola&#039;s 900,000 most vulnerable people until the end of March.

<a name="stpa_37">In the short term it is estimated that developing countries that are net importers of food may see price rises when export subsidies are removed.

<a name="stpa_38">However, in the long term producers should benefit from higher prices and take advantage of lower tariffs to increase their exports.

Also, following liberalisation, higher exports have boosted the agricultural component of economic growth in countries like Vietnam and Uganda at 4.6 per cent. and 4.4 per cent. per year respectively. This has also led to an increase in agricultural incomes and significant reductions in rural poverty.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment his Department has made of the impact of microenterprises on the economic development of developing countries; and if he will make a statement.  [212161]</p>








<p><a name="st_66"><a name="50202w08.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 A very large proportion of poor households own or work in microenterprises in the informal economy. In Africa, informal work is estimated to have accounted for almost 80 per cent. of non-agricultural employment and over 90 per cent. of new jobs. For women in Sub-Saharan Africa, the informal economy represents 92 per cent. of job opportunities outside agriculture.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w08.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_45">DFID has supported microenterprise development directly through financial services, skills, technology and buyers, and indirectly through an improved policy and legal operating environment for microenterprises. DFID&#039;s current commitments to microfinance development projects in Asia and Africa total approximately &#163;50 million. DFID supports country investment climate assessments, and contributed to the World Development Report 2005: A Better Investment Climate for Everyone&quot; that highlights how governments can promote investment, productivity and job growth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w08.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_46">Most microenterprises operate informally, making collecting reliable data on their impact very difficult. However, microenterprises clearly play an important role in developing economies. The average share of the informal enterprise sector in non-agricultural official GDP varies from 27 per cent. in Northern Africa to 41 per cent. in Sub-Saharan Africa. We do know however that many poor individuals would much prefer less risky employment in larger enterprises or the public sector, than self employment in microenterprises.

In April 2001, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) assumed funding responsibility for both LEA-secured adult and community learning and for former Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) funded provision. For 2003/04, the LSC introduced a new approach to collecting data on adult and community learning. The new data collection is more harmonised with other LSC funded learning (for example further education) and allows more flexible analysis. However, it is not possible to form a consistent historical series from the old and new data collections. Using the new data and methods, in 2003/04, a total of 842,000 learners were enrolled on Adult and Community Learning programmes.

The WEEE directive specifies that producers of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE), sold on a business to business (B2B) basis, should be responsible for the costs relating to its collection, treatment, recovery and environmentally sound disposal. Producers will finance B2B EEE they place on the market, although they will be free to agree alternative contractual arrangements with their customers. Business end users will have responsibility for disposing of EEE, placed on the market before 13 August 2005, which is not being replaced on a like for like basis.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w12.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_74">There are obvious technical reasons for a certain distance between each turbine. It needs to be compact enough to minimise the capital cost, and big enough for adequate separations to lessen energy loss through wind shadowing from upstream machines. It is usual for there to be a distance between the turbines of around 3&#150;10 rotor diameters The issue of wind farms and their proximity to dwellings and roads should be considered at the planning stage of individual developments and will be subject to policies in the local authority&#039;s development plan and the national policies set out in Planning Policy Statement 22 (PPS22).

Since 2001&#150;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18 years old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&#150;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings.

<a name="stpa_123">For example, between March 1997 and March 2004, the number of police officers in the Dorset police force increased by 169, from 1,284 to 1,453. The Government&#039;s introduction of Community Support Officers (CSOs) in 2002 has put 33 CSOs on Dorset streets to tackle crime and antisocial behaviour. Between 1997 and 2003&#150;04, Dorset has seen a reduction in recorded domestic burglary crimes of 27per cent. and in recorded vehicle crimes of 25 per cent.

Dorset benefits from the decision to provide a funding floor of 3.75 per cent. If the funding formula had been strictly applied, the force would have received &#163;4.2 million less. General grants funding to Dorset police has increased by 22 per cent. between 1997&#150;98 and 2005&#150;06. In addition to general grants, Dorset will also receive around &#163;5 million in specific grants funding for targeted initiatives in 2005&#150;06.

<a name="stpa_125">As crime prevention requires action across communities, every area has had a local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership (CDRP) since 1998 which brings together the police, health services, drugs agencies and council and community representatives to decide how to prevent and deter crime and anti-social behaviour.

Two CCTV projects in the Weymouth and Portland CDRP area received a total of &#163;691,489 from the CRP.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50202w18.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_127">Since 2001, successive initiatives have provided direct funding to each of the 376 Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships in England and Wales.

Since 2001, a total of &#163;380,488 has been allocated to Weymouth and Portland CDRP and &#163;295,714 to Purbeck CDRP under these initiatives. A further &#163;1.98 million has been provided over the two years 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 to the Home Office Regional Director in the South West for CDRP capacity building across the region.

<p><a name="st_161"><a name="50202w19.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 By definition, the scale of illegal migrant working is difficult to measure because illegal immigrants fall outside of the United Kingdom official statistics. Consequently, there is no official estimate for the number of illegal immigrants working in the United Kingdom. The experience of workplace enforcement officials indicates that illegal migrant working tends to feature in commercial sectors characterised by low skilled, temporary employment in which labour is often supplied via sub-contractual arrangements. The Immigration Service has detected illegal migrant workers employed in various sectors, including hospitality (including hotels and restaurants), car washes and repair garages, the sex trade, horticulture and agriculture, food production, contract cleaning, manufacturing and the care home sector. The Government take seriously the harm caused by illegal working, including the risk to our immigration control and the exploitative treatment often experienced by workers. We have strengthened the law preventing illegal working and are examining how best to improve compliance and enforcement.

Following that meeting, in March 2003, a suspect was arrested and interviewed, which subsequently led to papers being passed to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for advice in May 2003.</p>

Secondly, the remaining points raised about the re-investigation did not amount to complaints about the conduct of individual police officers, but related to operational matters all of which were subsequently addressed by the restructuring of the force approach to critical incidents. The Secretary of State has no powers to review a Chief Constable&#039;s decision not to record a complaint under Section 69(1) of the Police Act 1996.</p>

These are typically commanded by police officers of superintendent or chief superintendent rank with responsibility for the delivery of policing, the management of officers and other police staff and a number of police stations in their area.

Notes:<br>

1.A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the datayear. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2.The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

3.The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects.<br>

4.Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

This included a number of measures to assess preparedness for commissioning services from a range of providers to support patient choice. The tool also enables the national choose and book team to target support to local health communities on the basis of their relative preparedness.

 It is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs) to provide or arrange targeted support for patients to help them make their choice of hospital. This support needs to be appropriate to the needs of the PCT&#039;s local population. The range of services PCTs should consider includes direct support from general practitioners and practice staff and support from the patient advice and liaison service.

<p>
<a name="50202w27.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_205">Where PCTs identify particular needs for support, they may need to consider additional investment to support choice through use of voluntary sector organisations and/or specialist patient care advisers.

<a name="stpa_206">To support this, the Department is developing guidelines for PCTs wishing to contract with voluntary and community sector organisations to provide advocacy and support to patients to help them make a choice of hospital. We are also working with a range of stakeholders to better understand the information and support needs of patients at risk of exclusion. The results of this work will allow us both to develop appropriate information at national level and to support the national health service in implementing choice equitably for their local populations.

It is also hoped to commence further widening schemes at A37 Gortcorbies (Limavady to Coleraine) and A6 Kilcattan (extension of Burntollet West&#151;towards Belfast) and Mulderg (to balance Munreery) over the next couple of years.</p>
