To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps he is taking to ensure that British haulage operators do not face unfair competition as a result of tax increases proposed on vehicles running at an 11.5 tonne drive axle weight on roads in Britain.  [70103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in his pre-Budget statement on 3 November 1998, <i>Official Report, </i>columns 681-702, vehicle excise duty rates for goods vehicles with 11.5 tonne axle weights will be set to discourage strongly the use of such vehicles, in view of the additional road damage that they cause. The Integrated Transport White Paper stated that the Government would seek to encourage the use of goods vehicles with a maximum weight of 41 tonnes on 6 axles, which have the same payload as 40 tonnes on 5 axles but cause significantly less road wear.
<P>

<a name="90216w01.html_para9">The Government firmly believe that the best way to help industry, including hauliers, is to create a climate of sustainable economic growth and long-term investment in business. The last Budget included a number of general measures from which hauliers could benefit: main corporation tax will be reduced to 30 per cent. from 1 April 1999, and small companies' corporation tax rate will be cut to 20 per cent. from 1 April 1999.

Certificates are required to enable the sale or commercial use of species listed in Annex A of the Regulation and to allow the movement of wild taken specimens of these species. Certificates are also required to enable the re-export of CITES specimens by other EU Member States and owners of CITES specimens may at any time be required to provide evidence to confirm that these were lawfully imported or acquired.

 While recognising that Railtrack is a private sector company and must make a profit, the Government have made it clear that they are not convinced that enough of Railtrack's profits are being invested back into the network. Railtrack receives substantial public subsidy through the access charging regime. We need to be sure that the taxpayer is getting proper value for money.

 In the White Paper "A Mayor and Assembly for London" published on 25 March 1998, we estimated that the annual costs of the Mayor, Assembly, their support staff and some central services would be about &#163;20 million a year.

<a name="90216w03.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government believe that the tax on aviation fuel, introduced by Norway on 1 January 1999, is in breach of the UK/Norway Air Services Agreement, signed in Oslo on 26 January 1979, which exempts aviation fuel for international flights from tax. Officials wrote to the Norwegian authorities on 4 January drawing attention to this apparent breach and asking them to rescind the tax. I understand that the Norwegian Government are currently reviewing the position, in the light of this and other similar representations received.
<P>

<a name="90216w03.html_para0">In principle, the Government are in favour of an aviation fuel tax, but we believe this should be agreed at international level. Action by individual states or by groups of states would infringe existing international agreements, distort airline competition and could have environmental disbenefits.

 We have received very few representations on this matter. Bus services specifically designed to convey only pupils to school, rather than the general public, are not eligible for fuel duty rebate.

<P>

<a name="90216w03.html_para8">We believe that all ports should be publicly accountable for their statutory powers and duties. Accountability must become a much more open process than at present, and shared with all stakeholders, not just users.
<P>

<a name="90216w03.html_para9">Safety cannot be left to chance. Lives and property must be protected. So, too, must port environments because many port facilities are close to important and sensitive habitats.

<a name="90216w03.html_para10">We must ensure that trust ports fulfil their obligations to all the interests entrusted to them.

<P>

<a name="90216w04.html_para0">The running costs limit increase is partially due to initial early retirement costs (&#163;350,000) associated with the closure of the Government Property Lawyers' Agency which was announced to Parliament on 11 November 1998. This will be met from end year flexibility provision as announced by the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 14 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>131-36</i>. The increase is also due to the residual costs of the Crown Prosecution Service Review (&#163;227,000) and the costs associated with the extension of powers relating to Unduly Lenient Sentences (&#163;7,000) falling on this Vote. These will be offset by PES transfers from the Crown Prosecution Service and the Home Office respectively. A further increase in running costs is due to classification changes of European Fast Streamers income and VAT refunds.
<P>

<a name="90216w04.html_para1">The reduction in the cash limit is due to the increase in running costs being more than offset by lower VAT payment to Customs and Excise (&#163;900,000), greater than expected VAT refunds on contracted out services (&#163;55,000) and receipts from various Government Departments for services provided by the Lawyers' Management Unit (&#163;40,000).

 Coalition patrols of the Northern and Southern no-fly zones in Iraq are in support of UNSCR 688. They are justified under international law on the basis of overwhelming humanitarian necessity. They prevent Saddam Hussein from using his air force against the Iraqi people in the north and south and enable us to monitor the actions of his forces on the ground. In responding to the threat from Iraqi air-defence systems, coalition aircraft have responded in self defence in a proportionate manner. This action is justified under international law on the basis of self defence.

 To date, there have been 241 prisoners released under the terms of the Northern Ireland (Sentences) Act 1998, with a further 150 prisoners who have successfully applied to the Sentence Review Commission and who have received Substantive Determinations with a release date in the future. This gives a total of 391 eligible prisoners. This is drawn from information received by the Secretary of State as at 9 February 1999 from the Sentence Review Commissioners to whom prisoners apply for early release.

 The possibility of using EU development funds to finance security projects is a difficult issue from a legal point of view. The Commission enjoys competence in the field of development co-operation under the EU's first pillar, competence on conflict prevention and resolution

We are making progress, however, in advancing the principle that wherever possible, development assistance should contribute to the prevention of conflict; the November 1998 Development Council agreed conclusions to this affect.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if her Department has provided or offered assistance <i>(a)</i> bilaterally and <i>(b)</i> through Operation Lifeline Sudan, to (i) the Government of Sudan, (ii) the rebel movement in Sudan and (iii) non- Governmental organisations active in Sudan, for de-mining projects in Sudan.

 While a state of civil war continues to exist, we will not offer assistance for de-mining projects in Sudan.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w09.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development when the facilities at Malakal, El-Obeid and Khartoum airports were first offered by the Government of Sudan as air transport centres for Operation Lifeline Sudan humanitarian relief flights; when Sudanese airport facilities started to be used by Operation Lifeline Sudan; for what reasons these internal Sudanese facilities were not used earlier by Operation Lifeline Sudan; and what are the estimated savings to Operation Lifeline Sudan of using El-Obeid and Khartoum airports.  [71686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w09.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Government of Sudan have offered for some years the use of airports in the north of the country for relief flights to the south, but donors have preferred to operate from an independent base in Kenya. Northern Sudanese air strips were used last year for the first time because of the greatly increased need due to the crisis. The difference in cost is not yet known, but a major independent study of Operation Lifeline Sudan, undertaken in 1996, concluded that it would be marginal.
<P>

<a name="90216w09.html_para0">The cost of delivering food by air in Sudan last year was approximately 15 times the World Food Programme's average world wide food delivery cost. Real savings for the relief effort will come from maximising land routes, including rail, for delivery of humanitarian assistance to vulnerable areas of southern Sudan. We are pressing the UN to make progress on this.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will list the non- Governmental organisations working in Sudan which have received funding from her Department, or its predecessor, over the past eight years; and what the level of funding for each was in those years.  [71765]<P>

<a name="90216w09.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Operation Lifeline Sudan itself does not procure food. This is the responsibility of the UN World Food Programme, international agencies and non- governmental organisations operating in Sudan who have a full range of policies and procedures for the procurement of food and related services. Food is purchased from within Sudan when this represents the most cost effective option.

 Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) monitors food aid diversions. We regularly raise this and other humanitarian issues with the SPLA both bilaterally and in concert with OLS. It was discussed most recently on 25 January in London with SPLA's UK representatives and on 26 January in Nairobi at a joint OLS/Donor

 No definitive figures are available and the scale of diversions by the Sudan People's Liberation Army (SPLA) and government supported militias vary with location. During November and December, the UN World Food Programme estimated that 3.47 per cent. of food aid delivered was diverted overall. It is suspected that further losses occur after the food has been distributed.
<P>

<a name="90216w09.html_para1">The Task Force report on a mission carried out jointly by Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), the Sudan Relief and Rehabilitation Association (SRRA) and the SPLA in August 1998 identified a number of cases of diversion.

<P>
<a name="90216w09.html_spnew8"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Many thousands of people were adversely affected by the floods in Sudan last year. We contributed &#163;250,000 towards the flood relief efforts of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies which were timely and well targeted. We have made no assessment of the response by the Government of Sudan or the rest of the international community.

 No definitive figures are available on the amount of food aid diversions in southern Sudan. It is important that the peace process is pursued vigorously in parallel with humanitarian relief to minimise the danger of such assistance feeding the war economy. We and the international community are supporting the efforts of the Inter Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) to broker a long-term agreement and are pressing both sides of the conflict to undertake serious negotiation towards a lasting and just peace.

 Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS) expanded its response in 1998 in very difficult circumstances as the crisis in southern Sudan unfolded. The UN and donors have learned several lessons from the experience. We are in close touch with the UN to improve the effectiveness of the operation and are working with them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w09.html_spnew15"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The role of the World Food Programme (WFP) food monitors is to oversee food distribution. They are effective at ensuring that food aid is allocated fairly at distribution points, but less so in preventing some of the food from being diverted between distribution and its eventual delivery to vulnerable households. Since the recent crisis, we have been pressing for firmer action on diversion. WFP has increased the number of food aid monitors to 125. Monitors shift from location to location, depending where food aid deliveries are to be made.

 Discussions with development and foreign ministers have focused on the main cause of the suffering in Sudan, the civil war, and on how to work with the Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) and the IGAD Partners Forum to achieve a long-term and just peace settlement. Action on food aid diversion needs to be led by the UN System. I have discussed the problem with the appropriate agencies.

 I am today releasing the findings of a review of the Office for National Statistics (ONS), copies of which have been placed in the Libraries of the House. 



<P>
<P><I>16 Feb 1999 : Column: 636</I><P>
This has concluded that there is scope within ONS to achieve efficiency savings rising to around &#163;20 million per year. The review has been guided by a Steering Group under the Chairmanship of Peter Ellwood, Group Chief Executive of Lloyds TSB, and draws on work carried out by the consultants KPMG.
<P>

<a name="90216w10.html_para2">ONS has achieved significant efficiency savings since its creation three years ago. The review identified ways of building on its forward efficiency plans through further streamlining of activities within ONS and the development of closer working arrangements with appropriate private sector organisations. The proposed changes would allow ONS to focus professional resources and management attention where they can add most value.
<P>

<a name="90216w10.html_para3">These findings will be made available to staff in the ONS. I will invite the trade unions to give me their reactions to the findings before making any decisions on the way forward.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on progress in the review of personal pensions mis-selling.  [71946]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w10.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Personal Investment Authority (PIA) has confirmed that it is satisfied that all 41 major firms are devoting sufficient energy and resources to the review of personal pension mis-selling. It judged that all the firms monitored by the Treasury have made sufficient progress towards their priority review targets to be removed from the published list. The Treasury has acted on the PIA advice and suspended publication of figures.
<P>

<a name="90216w10.html_para6">However, firms will still be monitored and expected to conclude the priority review, and make swift progress with phase 2. The Treasury reserves the right to resume publication of information about firms' progress should it prove necessary.
<P>

<a name="90216w10.html_para7">The regulators' advertising campaign for phase 2 of the pension review is now well under way. Younger people should take the opportunity of finding out whether they might be due redress for mis-selling. Anyone who receives a letter from their pension firm should read it carefully and decide whether they wish to put their case forward for review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what assessment he has made of changes in the last five years in the <i>(a)</i> number and <i>(b)</i> proportion of cases that are going to the Sheriff Court as a result of changes in administrative practice.  [70343]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 The long-term trend has been for growth in business in the Sheriff Courts. In the past 5 years, the general trend in summary and solemn business and in civil business has been for a small reduction in the number of cases and for a small increase in the average of length of cases going to trial or proof. Many factors influence trends in court business but there is no evidence that administrative practice in the courts has significantly affected the national picture.

An over-arching aim is to tackle health inequalities. There is a specific focus on measures to improve the health of children and on new initiatives against Scotland's 2 major killing diseases--cancer and coronary heart disease. Particular emphasis is placed on the development of a concerted approach to health improvement across Government, and involving the National Health Service, local authorities, voluntary and other bodies whose policies and actions impact on health.

<P>
<a name="90216w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 ISA has been present in Norway since the mid-1980s, and new outbreaks of the disease have persisted in recent years. The Norwegian authorities require fish to be withdrawn from sea cages when a specified level of mortality has been reached. In other respects their controls are similar to those applied in the UK, notably the requirement for infected farms to be fallowed for up to 6 months. The Secretary of State continues to believe that the eradication of the current outbreak of ISA in Scottish waters is a realistic and desirable objective, and current measures are directed to that end, in line with EU legislation. The Norwegian authorities have been very helpful in offering information and advice, and regular contact is being maintained.

 No towns or cities have been identified at this stage. Asylum seekers will be dispersed to cluster areas.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the impact which delays to the development of the new casework system are having on the processing of asylum claims and other services provided by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.  [70908]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate caseworking operation is at present being reorganised and new ways of working are being introduced as part of the business change and modernisation initiative. The disruption has caused a temporary reduction in service standards and in numbers of casework decisions.
<P>

<a name="90216w14.html_para3">Under the privately financed contract for the Casework Programme the financial risk of late delivery of elements of the Programme is carried by Siemens Business Services. There is no reason to believe the delay in delivery of the full casework information technology application will reduce casework decisions or service standards over the contract period.

 Precise figures to reflect the use of a sham marriage to obtain settlement in this country are not readily available and could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost. The perception of some agencies most involved in tackling this abuse is that it is considerable and widespread.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prosecutions have been brought under the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998 regarding conspiracy in this country to commit terrorist attacks abroad.  [70750]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Section 5 of the Criminal Justice (Terrorism and Conspiracy) Act 1998--Conspiracy to commit offences outside the United Kingdom came into effect on 4 September 1998. Information on prosecutions from the Home Office Court Proceedings Database will begin to become available in the Spring of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list those police forces which have mounted sections; how many horses there are in each case; and what plans he has to ensure that present numbers are maintained.  [71042]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Information on police mounted sections is not collected centrally. Under the Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994, the allocation of resources within a force is decided locally by the chief constable. The decision whether to maintain a mounted section is an operational matter for the chief constable to decide.

 In 1998-99, estimated expenditure on specific programmes to tackle the misuse of drugs represented about 0.65 per cent. of total central expenditure in the Home Office. Following the Comprehensive Spending Review settlement this figure will rise to over 1.5 per cent. in 1999-2000 with the allocation of an additional &#163;34 million.

 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> The Department of Trade and Industry, in conjunction with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development (DfID), consistently work together with the Governments of South Asia to promote sustainable development in the region through both international trade and overseas investment.
<P>

<a name="90216w17.html_para4">Trade liberalisation and increased international trade have also enabled developing countries such as those in South Asia to derive more benefit from access to overseas markets and from inward investment. This in turn increases prosperity and enables developing countries to raise their standards of environmental and social

<P>

<a name="90216w17.html_para5">The UK is a major trading and investment partner for the countries of South Asia. An area critical to sustainable development is that of infrastructure. In this regard the Department works closely with the private sector and other bodies, such as DfID, the Export Credits Guarantee Department and the Commonwealth Development Corporation, to maximise the UK's contribution to the development of South Asia.

 The estimates provided assume that the basic State Pension and State Second Pension are indexed in line with prices when in payment, and that the Minimum Income Guarantee is indexed in line with the growth in average earnings (assumed to be 1.5 per cent. per year above the growth in prices).

The Department did not receive a cash sum but will be charged rentals at a reduced rate for the period of the contract. On 1 April 1998 the remainder of the Department's estate was transferred as part of the Private Sector Resource Initiative for Management of the Estate (PRIME). The Department received cash consideration of &#163;250 million. The National Audit Office have performed Value For Money studies on both of the contracts.

Research is also conducted to monitor Charter standards.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am pleased to have the opportunity to give you an update on progress with our Nine Point Plan for Parents at Work. It may be helpful if I briefly outline the actions we have taken so far.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our main objective has been to set up a comprehensive network of Childcare Champion posts that have now been filled, with the last Champion taking up post in December last year. We know from the major review of childcare provision which we undertook in the BA in 1997 that there is a significant demand from staff for childcare but not enough holiday playschemes in operation.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>16 Feb 1999 : Column: 681</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The first task of the Childcare Champions is to establish the areas of greatest need for playschemes. Approximately thirty possible schemes have already been identified and we expect ten of these to be up and running by Summer 1999. East new scheme will receive initial funding of up to &#163;3000. We aim to have a further forty schemes established by March 2001. The Childcare Champions will also consider whether any of the holiday playschemes can be extended to provide after-school clubs but we expect the scope for this to be fairly limited.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Participation on management committees for the Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships has been secured by some of the Childcare Champions. This will help the Agency play an active part in local childcare planning alongside Local Education Authorities and Training Enterprise Councils etc. We will also be looking to encourage other employers from the public, private and voluntary sector, to join us in partnership with the aim of improving childcare provision for all working parents in the community.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As you will be aware, the Nine Point Plan also highlighted areas for improvement of the BA's Family Friendly policies. There has been considerable progress in this area with provision made to allow staff paid leave to sit on local Out of School Development Committees. A "Family Friendly" booklet has been produced and distributed to staff setting out the range of family friendly and childcare policies available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To ensure that managers and staff fully understand the real business benefits of effective family friendly policies, a further booklet "The Business Benefits of Family Friendly Policies" with examples of good practice for all line managers has also been produced and distributed. Also an article entitled "Parents at Work" has been published in the Agencies "BA Newsletter" and seminars have been held country wide to launch the initiative positively and gain the understanding and support of managers at all levels.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency already has family friendly policies, providing 325 nursery and 1,350 holiday playscheme places for staff, which compares favourably with external organisations. Our commitment to full implementation of our Nine Point Plan will go even further towards helping all our staff balance more effectively their work and family lives.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Neither the Social Fund Officer, Social Fund Review Officer or Social Fund Inspector made any contact with Walsall Social Services prior to making their respective decisions to refuse a Social Fund payment to Miss McNulty for a mobility scooter. It is not the practice of the BA to approach Social Services without the express permission of the customer. The application form which Miss McNulty completed asked if there was anyone she would like contacted in connection with the application, but the offer was declined.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Miss McNulty was refused a Community Care Grant for a mobility scooter on the grounds of insufficient priority. Although the eligibility and qualification criteria for a Community Care Grant [Social Fund directions 25 and 4 (a) (ii)] were met, the demands on the district grants budget are such that only high priority grant applications can be met. The Social Fund Officer, Social Fund Review Officer, and Social Fund Inspector decided that Miss McNulty's need for a mobility scooter was not of high priority in her circumstances.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The eligibility and qualification criteria for a Budgeting Loan [Social Fund directions 8 and 2] were also met. Again, the demands on the district loans budget are such that only high priority loan applications can be met. The Social Fund Officer, Social Fund Review Officer, and Social Fund Inspector decided that Miss McNulty's need for a mobility scooter was not of high priority in her circumstances, so a Budgeting Loan was refused.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A Crisis Loan was refused because the Secretary of State has excluded mobility needs from consideration for a Crisis Loan [Social Fund direction 23].</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The mobility scooter was not considered to be a medical item as it does not treat, cure, alleviate, prevent, or diagnose a medical condition. [Medical items are excluded by the Secretary of State from Social Fund payments].</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Miss McNulty was not seen by officials of the Benefits Agency or Social Fund Inspectorate prior to the decision to refuse her a Social Fund payment. However she received copies of all papers relating to her application and replied to these papers with her own comments.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no provision in the Social Fund scheme for the local office to reconsider the application after it has been subject of a decision by a Social Fund Inspector, therefore there is currently no intent to visit Miss McNulty in connection with the application in question.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I empathise with the difficulties faced by many of our customers, particularly our vulnerable and disabled customers such as Miss McNulty. I am satisfied that my staff have given full consideration of the facts but accept a home visit could have been carried out.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are two possible ways forward: Miss McNulty could either make another application for a payment from the Social Fund for a mobility scooter, but an immediate repeat application would be excluded by Direction 7 (if this was made within 26 weeks of her former application); or she could apply for a judicial review of the first decision if she thinks that there was an error in law in the processing of the application.</FONT></UL>

 In Wales, standard spending assessments (SSAs) are not identified against specific service blocks as in England. Nor is there an equivalent of special transitional grant. Instead, each year since 1993, the Secretary of State has identified for each authority the additional indicative amount attributed to care in the community in its total SSA. The final tranche of &#163;21 million was included in the 1998-99 general revenue settlement. Details are given in the following table.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 When the DCMS issues a public consultation paper it will, in line with central guidance issued by the Cabinet Office, either publish a summary of the views collected or make the results available on request (in each case subject to respecting confidentiality requested by those responding).

<P>
<a name="90216w26.html_spnew1"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 The current review of the future of the BBC licence fee after 2002 will include a consideration of the structure of the existing concessionary television licence scheme and whether a suitable alternative structure could be available. The independent review panel will report to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State by the

 There are no grants available from the English Tourist Board (ETB) for this purpose.
<P>

<a name="90216w26.html_para0">The North West, like all parts of the country, benefits from the work of the British Tourist Authority and of the ETB. A significant part of the grant to the ETB is passed on to the ten regional tourist boards for local programmes and marketing.
<P>

<a name="90216w26.html_para1">New support structures announced on 14 December, as part of the results of the DCMS Departmental Spending Review, will ensure that in future more effective use is made of public spending on tourism in England, with a greater proportion going to the regions.

<P>
<a name="90216w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Banks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 February 1999]:</i> The Government expect bids to bring international events to this country to be pursued with openness and integrity. I take a close interest in ensuring this is so, and following controversy about Olympic bids have received assurances from the Football Association that the bid for the 2006 World Cup naturally will comply fully with the published guidelines, and will certainly be free from recourse to bribery. I accept those assurances and will continue vigorously to assist with the FA campaign for the 2006 bid, whose strength and viability rest on its quality against bidding criteria.

<a name="90216w26.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to his answer of 11 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>31</i>, what specific policies his Department intends to bring forward to improve the level of subtitling on cable and satellite television following the meetings his officials have held with broadcasters and subtitle providers.  [69645]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w26.html_spnew5"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> My officials have had a useful series of meetings with the cable and satellite broadcasters, those representing viewers with sensory disabilities and subtitling providers. I met the RNID on 20 January. We are now considering in the light of the information from those meetings how we can encourage the cable and satellite broadcasters to improve on a voluntary basis the current provision of subtitling on their services.

<a name="90216w26.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what estimates his Department has made of how long it will be before digital set top boxes are able to support subtitling.  [69644]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w26.html_spnew6"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> I understand from the Independent Television Commission that all services within the six digital terrestrial multiplexes are providing subtitles with the exception of a small number of ITV companies within the Channel 3/4 multiplex who expect to commence very shortly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w26.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if his Department intends to make recommendations to the ITC about how its annual targets for subtitling for deaf and hard of hearing people should be calculated, with particular reference to digital television.  [69643]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w26.html_spnew7"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> The Broadcasting Act 1996 requires the Independent Television Commission (ITC) to draw up a code on promoting the understanding and enjoyment of programmes by persons who are deaf and hard of hearing. The code must include specified minimum targets which are laid down in the 1996 Act, which also gives the Commission the power to set interim targets. Under the provisions of the Act, it is solely a matter for the ITC to draw up the code. The Act places a statutory duty on the Commission to consult those bodies or persons who represent the interests of people with sensory disabilities, before drawing up their code.

hard of hearing viewers <i>(a)</i> at present and <i>(b)</i> in five years time for (i) digital terrestrial, (ii) satellite, digital and analogue and (iii) cable television.  [69642]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w26.html_spnew8"><B> Janet Anderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> For digital terrestrial services, the Broadcasting Act 1996 requires that by the tenth anniversary of the introduction of any digital terrestrial television programme service, not less than 50 per cent. of non-excluded programme hours broadcast in any service should be subtitled. The Act gives the Independent Television Commission the power to set interim targets and the Commission has set an interim requirement of 5 per cent. for the first year and 25 per cent. for the fifth year and no programmes are to be excluded. Existing broadcasters obligations on subtitling under the Broadcasting Act 1990 will of course apply to their simulcast digital services. The Commission will monitor broadcasters' progress towards meeting those requirements.
<P>

<a name="90216w26.html_para5">There are no similar statutory requirements on cable and satellite broadcasters to provide subtitling on their analogue or digital services. My officials have asked cable and satellite broadcasters their plans for provision of subtitling on their digital services and those who responded have indicated a willingness to transmit the subtitling commissioned for digital terrestrial television on other delivery platforms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Banks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 1999]:</i> As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport said in his reply to the hon. Member for East Surrey (Mr. Ainsworth) on 16 November 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>350,</i> no specific amount has been earmarked for providing children with sporting opportunities at after-school clubs, but activities offered may include sporting and outdoor learning activities, and structured, learning-oriented play. The amount allocated for these activities will be determined by the New Opportunities Fund in response to the applications received.
<P>

<a name="90216w26.html_para6">The New Opportunities Fund will commit &#163;400 million to out of school hours activities during the current licence period to September 2001. Of this, &#163;180 million will be committed to education activities, &#163;200 million to child care, and &#163;20 million to projects combining child care and education.
<P>

<a name="90216w26.html_para7">Out of school hours education projects should involve at least half of all secondary schools, at least a quarter of all primary schools, and at least half of all special schools by 2001. Out of school child care projects should provide places for 865,000 children by 2003.
<P>

<a name="90216w26.html_para8">The Prime Minister also announced an extra &#163;400 million for the New Opportunities Fund between now and 2001. We have consulted on how this money

<a name="90216w26.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 Through the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) we have committed &#163;400 million of National Lottery money to out of school hours activities during the current licence period to September 2001. Of this, &#163;180 million has been committed to education activities, &#163;200 million to child care, and &#163;20 million to projects combining child care and education. Out of school hours education projects should involve at least half of all secondary schools, at least a quarter of all primary schools, and at least half of all special schools by 2001.

We have consulted on how this money should be spent and have proposed that part of the additional amount should be committed to an expansion of the existing out of school hours initiative, to enhance the contribution made by summer schools not only to literacy, numeracy and opportunities for arts, but also to sport.
<P>

<a name="90216w26.html_para10">The Policy Directions issued to NOF ensure that it takes into account relevant national and local strategies in relation to each initiative. For out of school hours learning this includes Extending Opportunity: a national framework for study support (In England) and any similar guidance produced elsewhere. Study support is learning activity outside normal lessons and embraces many activities, including sports, games and adventurous outdoor activities.
<P>

<a name="90216w26.html_para11">The National Lottery Act 1998 required NOF to draw up a strategic plan containing its assessment of needs and its priorities in dealing with them, on which it must consult the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. This ensures that there is a proper strategy for distributing Lottery proceeds. No specific targets have been allocated to NOF for providing physical exercise opportunities at after-school clubs, but in reviewing NOF's strategic plan we shall ensure that the projects it supports promote young people's well-being through a range of activities, including sport and creative activities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> Provision for labelling novel foods is described in article 8 of Regulation 258/97. This requires that the consumer is informed of any characteristic or property of the food, such as composition, nutritional value or intended food use, which renders a novel food or food ingredient no longer equivalent to an existing food or food ingredient. In addition, the food must be labelled if it could have health implications for certain population sectors, contains ingredients that raise ethical concerns or contains a genetically modified organism.
<P>

<a name="90216w27.html_para4">Finally, Regulation 1139/98 on labelling genetically modified (GM) soya and maize sets a precedent for the labelling of all food ingredients containing or produced from genetically modified organisms where they contain GM material (protein or DNA).

<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w29.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mudie: </B> 
 Someone with caring responsibilities who is in full-time higher education is, subject to personal eligibility, entitled to support towards tuition fees and living costs on the same basis as other students. For students entering before 1998-99, 50 per cent. of that support was available as grant and 50 per cent. as student loan, and students were not required to contribute to their

tuition fees. From 1998-99 most new entrants are liable for a contribution to their tuition costs, according to their ability to pay. From 1999-2000, the support available to new entrants will be in the form of 100 per cent. loans.
<P>

<a name="90216w29.html_para7">Currently, the first &#163;3,030 of any Invalid Care Allowance is disregarded in assessing the support available. If the person being cared for is financially dependent on the student, the student may also be eligible for a Dependants Allowance of up to &#163;2,025. Additional support may be available through the Access Funds and the Hardship Loans.
<P>

<a name="90216w29.html_para8">The maximum maintenance support available to full-time students in higher education will depend upon the student's personal circumstances. For most students living away from the parental home, the maximum support available through grant and loan is currently &#163;3,545. Disabled students are eligible for additional grants as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
(a) in respect of a non-medical personal helper, up to &#163;10,000 annually

(c) in respect of any other expenditure, up to &#163;1,315 annually.

<P>

<a name="90216w29.html_para9">Someone who is a carer wishing to enter further education will be eligible for the range of support available to all students in that sector. This support has been transformed from September 1999 so that it is more evenly distributed across the country and better targeted on those most in need. Provision will be mostly through an expanded access fund administered by colleges, which will provide assistance for such expenditure items as travel, fees, books and equipment. There will be additional support available for child care and for those need to study away from home. Colleges when considering individual applications for access funds will take account of other sources of support, including benefits and allowances. It is up to each college to determine the level of payment appropriate to the individual circumstances of the student concerned. Most students over age 18 will be liable to pay tuition fees, but students no in employment are generally exempt and there is further discretion to assist other groups.

 <i>[holding answer 11 February 1999]:</i> The Government are aware of this system which, with other relevant products available for educational use, is being kept under review by the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency. Their recent publication, "Connecting Schools, Networking People", offered guidance to schools on good practice in the purchasing and deployment of advanced technologies. It will be updated in future to ensure that it remains relevant to schools.

<P>
<a name="90216w31.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 February 1999]:</i> The Department has recently consulted widely on the criteria against which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will consider applications for his consent to sell, or change the use, of school playing fields. 



<P>
<P><I>16 Feb 1999 : Column: 714</I><P>
Although it is for applicants to decide the details of any local consultation, they should bear in mind that it was local concerns that prompted legislation to protect school playing fields. Draft procedures published on 1 October 1998 set out my right hon. Friend's expectation that applicants should consult locally and inform him of the responses they receive. The Department expects that local consultation should include the direct views of parents of pupils attending the school, as well as any other school which uses the field for school purposes. A minimum consultation period of 8 term-time weeks is recommended to allow sufficient opportunity for objections to be made known.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the procedures that schools have to pursue before selling school playing fields under the regulations governing such sales.  [70361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w31.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 February 1999]:</i> I assume in the light of the hon. Member's previous questions that this question concerns the sale of playing fields by school governing bodies that own their playing fields, as is generally the case for grant- maintained schools, rather than the sale of school playing fields by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="90216w31.html_para0">The governing body of a grant-maintained school must obtain the written consent of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State before selling any land, including

<P><I>16 Feb 1999 : Column: 715</I><P>
buildings and playing fields. Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act, which came into force on 1 October 1998, requires the governing bodies of other maintained schools of obtain the consent of my right hon. Friend before selling, or changing the use of, any school playing field that they own. The procedures to be followed are set out in the Department's consultation document. These include completion of an application form and local consultation.
<P>

<a name="90216w31.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State examines any application to dispose of school playing fields carefully, bearing in mind the provision of playing field space at the school and any shortage of playing fields at other local schools. It is necessary to ensure that following a disposal, there would be sufficient playing field area to meet the requirements of the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999, and also that there is sufficient land retained to accommodate the possibility of reasonable future expansion of the school.
<P>

<a name="90216w31.html_para2">Where land has transferred to a grant-maintained school from a local authority, my right hon. Friend has power under section 298(2) of the Education Act 1996 to direct that all or part of such land should be returned to the local education authority, or its successor. The return of such land is subject to the payment to the grant-maintained school of whatever consideration, if any, is considered appropriate. Alternatively, my right hon. Friend may direct that some or all of the proceeds of sale should be paid to the local education authority. Each application is considered on its merits.

 In the current academic year (1998-99) &#163;9 million was allocated to general Further Education Access Funds and &#163;44 million to general Higher Education Access Funds. We have allocated a further &#163;2.8 million this year for fee remission for further and higher education students on part-time courses who have lost their job since beginning their course. The criteria for issue of funds are general and take no account of course subject.

<P>
<a name="90216w31.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Literacy Hour began in infant, junior and primary schools in September 1998. The vast majority of teachers are teaching the daily hour, which has had a considerable impact on teaching methods and organisation of lessons. Evaluations of the pilot National Literacy Project, published in December 1998 by OFSTED and the NFER, confirm that the Literacy Hour is based on teaching methods that will raise standards. Children who started some way below the national average in their reading scores made 8 to 12 months progress above what would normally be expected, in less than two years.

 The latest available figures from UCAS show that 18,960 UK domiciled students deferred entry to full-time and sandwich undergraduates courses from 1997 to 1998.

The gap year concession applies only to those students who, by 1 August 1997, had received a firm offer of a place on a course deferred until 1998-99, or a conditional offer which was then confirmed when the student met the terms of that offer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w33.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Winnick: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on the reason for Judge Willis being removed from hearing the case of R. <i>v.</i> Sparkes at the Bristol Crown Court in 1996-97; what advice was afterwards given by the Lord Chancellor to those responsible for the removal; if an apology was given to Judge Willis; and if he will make a statement.  [71666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w33.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The circumstances of this matter have so far as possible been fully investigated by the Lord Chancellor. Following a series of related cases being heard by Judge Willis in late 1996, an allegation of bias was made by the prosecution, who proposed to make application to the senior Presiding Judge of the Western Circuit in open court for the appointment of another judge to hear the case of R. <i>v.</i> Sparkes which Judge Willis was due to try. The Presiding Judge was then engaged in a highly publicised trial attracting much press interest. He was of the opinion that no matter how fanciful the substance of the allegation it was undesirable that the application should be made. With (as he understood) the concurrence of the Recorder of Bristol and Judge Willis, he accordingly arranged for another judge to conduct the trial in R. <i>v.</i> Sparkes. He did so knowing that, if the Defence objected, they could apply to have Judge Willis reassigned to the original case. This is what, in the event, happened.
<P>

<a name="90216w33.html_para6">The Lord Chancellor has informed the then Presiding Judge that he does not believe the matter was dealt with as it should have been. An allegation of bias should in his judgment be addressed in open court, or at least with all the parties present in chambers. In some circumstances, such an application might be made to the judge against whom bias is alleged.
<P>

<a name="90216w33.html_para7">Unfortunately, Judge Willis died before the Lord Chancellor had completed his investigations and before any question of any apology could be considered. The Lord Chancellor would however wish to make plain that there was never any ground to question the integrity of the late Judge Willis, which remains wholly untarnished and the Presiding Judge never for a moment thought otherwise.

Plans are in place to meet the requirements under the Act both in October 1999 and those parts of the Act due to come into force in 2004. Access to information and the training and awareness of staff have been identified as the key areas where changes will need to be made before October 1999.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department how many of the post- 1920 census returns have been transferred to the Public Record Office; and what would be the impact on staffing and accommodation at the Public Record Office of the transfer of all decennial census returns to the Office 30 years after their creation.  [70993]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w34.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 None of the post-1920 census returns has been transferred to the Public Record Office.
<P>

<a name="90216w34.html_para5">The post-1920 decennial census returns which were created more than 30 years ago occupy about 50 linear kilometres of storage space. If they were transferred to the Public Record Office they would fill up all storage space available now and require the provision of substantial additional accommodation. They would also require an estimated three additional members of staff for maintenance and security.
<P>

<a name="90216w34.html_para6">Substantial additional storage space would also be required for the statutory transfers of records over the next decade or so which they would displace.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement about the failure of Registrars General, during the period 1969 to 1985, to transfer census returns to the Public Record Office not later than 30 years after their creation; and <i>(a)</i> when and <i>(b)</i> by whom this failure was first brought to the attention of a Lord Chancellor.  [70995]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w34.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The census returns in question were not transferred during the period 1969 to 1985 because at that time the advice was that the existence of a statutory bar to disclosure, established by the Census Act 1920, overcame the obligation on departments to transfer their records by the time they were 30 years old. However, the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys wished its retention of the returns to be covered by the Lord Chancellor's approval and this was given in 1985.
<P>

<a name="90216w34.html_para7">This matter was not brought to the attention of a Lord Chancellor since the fact that the records had not been transferred was not then considered to be non- compliance with the provisions of the Public Record Acts.

[70909]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w34.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Methylphenidate hydrochloride (Ritalin) has been assessed by the normal procedures for authorisation of a medicinal product in the United Kingdom to ensure its quality, safety and efficacy in the indication for use; in this case, the treatment of children over 6 years with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, where remedial measures alone have failed. The marketing authorisation states that it should be part of a comprehensive treatment programme including psychological, educational and social measures, under the supervision of a specialist in childhood behavioural disorders.
<P>

<a name="90216w34.html_para9">As for all medicines, the safety of methylphenidate continues to be monitored by the Medicines Control Agency after it has been marketed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w36.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Diet is a matter of personal choice. However, we recognise that it is important that people have the information they need to decide what they want to eat. Our aim, therefore, is to provide clear, consistent and understandable advice to help them make healthy eating choices. For these reasons we fund the Health Education Authority to produce information and advice to increase the knowledge and skills of key professional groups to promote the principles of healthy eating and also to improve consumers' understanding of a healthy diet. "The Balance of Good Health" has been instrumental 



<P>
<P><I>16 Feb 1999 : Column: 733</I><P>
in improving awareness of a healthy and balanced diet as it illustrates in a simple way, by using a picture of a plate, the proportions of the balance of foods recommended by independent experts.
<P>

<a name="90216w36.html_para1">As part of the work which the Health Education Authority undertakes on promoting healthy eating, it has established, in partnership with the National Food Alliance, a food and low income database. This provides information about projects which have been established in response to difficulties which some communities have experienced in accessing fruit and vegetables. On my recent visit to Coventry, I saw one good example of such an initiative. Also using funding provided by the Department of Health, the National Food Alliance and the Health Education Authority together ran a series of regional seminars to bring together those working in the food and low income field to exchange best practice in planning, developing and carrying out community food initiatives and help others new to the field.
<P>

<a name="90216w36.html_para2">More generally, I am the lead Minister for the policy action team which is charged with developing a strategy for improving shopping access for people living in deprived neighbourhoods. This is one of eighteen policy action teams which have been established following the publication of the Social Exclusion Unit's report on neighbourhood renewal last September. The policy action team aims to develop integrated and sustainable approaches on improving shopping access for those living in deprived neighbourhoods.

<P>
<a name="90216w36.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 There is a large body of authoritative opinion that the amount of salt in the national diet is unnecessarily high, and we have therefore asked officials in the Department to explore with the food industry the scope for reducing the levels of salt in processed foods. Pending these discussions, we have no plans to require this from manufacturers.

We co-funded, with DfID, a successful Caribbean marine biodiversity workshop co-chaired with Jamaica in October 1998. We have contributed to the leading role the British Government have been able to take in international environmental negotiations, for example the climate change conference in Buenos Aires in November 1998.

<a name="90216w39.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The Commission representation in the United Kingdom attends party political conferences as an international visitor, on the same basis as other international organisations and representatives of other countries. Invitations to attend these conferences are a matter for the political party concerned. No specific Treaty base is required.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer to the right hon. and learned Member for Folkestone and Hythe (Mr. Howard) of 4 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>703</i>, if he will make a statement on the border delays which have occurred at Gibraltar since the agreement between the Government of Gibraltar and Spanish fishermen.

<a name="90216w39.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Since 3 February there have been delays at the border between Gibraltar and Spain which have, on occasion, reached up to five hours. Such delays are unjustifiable and unacceptable. The Embassy in Madrid has raised this issue on several occasions recently with the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We have made it clear to the Spanish authorities that we look to them to allow movement across the border in conformity with EU obligations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on anti-semitism in Russia.  [70949]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w40.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Her Majesty's Government share the wide public and parliamentary concern about recent anti-semitic statements in Russia. We have told the Russian authorities that racial intolerance and extremist political activities are wholly unacceptable and most recently last week I raised this with the Chairman of President Yeltsin's Commission on Human Rights. We look to the Russian government and the regional administrations to take firm action to deal with anti-semitism, and we welcome the strong condemnation of racial intolerance by President Yeltsin in November last year.

<a name="90216w40.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The British Ambassador in Moscow and, at our instigation, the EU Presidency, have made strong representations about the anti-semitism in Russia, but have not specifically referred to these attacks. We and our EU partners made clear to the Presidential Administration, the Communist leadership and the Duma that anti- semitism is wholly unacceptable. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary will reinforce these messages personally when he visits Russia. We welcome President Yeltsin's condemnation of the attack on the Marina synagogue.

 The British Ambassador in Moscow raised our concerns about anti-semitism in Russia with both the Presidential Administration and Mr. Zyuganov himself before the Communist leader's statement of 23 December. At our instigation, the EU Presidency in Moscow expressed EU concerns to Deputy Foreign Minister Gussarov on 28 January, and will follow up shortly with Mr. Zyuganov.

 The British Ambassador made representations to the Presidential Administration on 3 December; the leader of the Communist Party, Gennady Zyuganov on 4 December; and Deputy Foreign Minister Avdeev on 15 January. At our instigation, the EU Presidency formally raised it with Deputy Prime Minister Gussarov on 28 January. I also expressed our concerns to President Yeltsin's Human Rights adviser, Professor Kartashkin, on 11 February. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary will raise this issue during his forthcoming visit to Russia.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what action he is taking to encourage the Thai Government to increase the security of refugee camps along the Burmese border during the current dry season Burmese military offensive.  [70748]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w40.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 Following rumours of a possible Burmese attack on the Thai-Burma border, the British Embassy in Bangkok last week raised with the Thai authorities our concern for the security of refugees in the area. The Thais assured us that they were alive to the risk of dry season attacks and were taking measures to ensure the protection of refugees.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what action he is taking to put pressure on the Burmese military regime to cease ethnic cleansing actions against ethnic minorities in Burma.  [70749]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w40.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We have repeatedly made clear to the Burmese regime our deep concern at their human rights violations, particularly those of ethnic minorities. In December 1998, we co-sponsored a UN General Assembly resolution which strongly urges the SPDC to ensure full respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. We, and our EU Partners, are also working towards a tough resolution at the forthcoming session of the UN Commission on Human Rights. We will continue to take every opportunity to raise our concerns with the regime.

<P>
<P>

 We have had preliminary technical discussions with the Government of Gibraltar about their ideas for constitutional change. No formal proposals have yet been made.

<P>
<a name="90216w41.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has not breached the understanding agreed with the Spanish Foreign Minister in October 1998. There were difficulties in making the understanding work at the local level. We now hope that the local agreement reached between the Chief Minister of Gibraltar and the fishermen, building on the October understanding, will continue to work satisfactorily.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w41.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 On 5 October 1998, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary reached an understanding with the Spanish Foreign Minister on the situation that prevailed in British waters around Gibraltar from 1991-97, when fishing took place in moderation and the fishermen respected the authority of the Gibraltar law enforcement agencies. They agreed that we should revert to that situation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w41.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The UK Permanent Representative to the European Union in Brussels wrote both to the President of the European Commission and to his Chef de Cabinet on 11 February about recent developments concerning Gibraltar. His staff had briefed the cabinet of the Commissioner Gradin and other relevant cabinets in early February concerning the closure of the border by Spanish fishermen.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w41.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 We are monitoring the Spanish approach to Gibraltar-issued driving licences. Driving licences issued in Gibraltar are EU licences. EU driving licences must be mutually recognised by member states under the requirements of the EU Second Driving Licence Directive. We look to the Spanish authorities to recognise these documents in conformity with EU obligations.

 We welcome the agreement reached on 3 February between the Chief Minister of Gibraltar and representatives of local Spanish fishermen, which builds on the understanding agreed by my right hon.

<a name="90216w41.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Spanish Foreign Minister has not informed us of any present intention to refuse Gibraltar-bound civil aircraft the right to overfly Spanish airspace. It would be extraordinary and unprecedented for an EU Member State to impose an overflight ban on civil aircraft of a European partner.

 In our discussion of Gibraltar with the Spanish government, we have always emphasised that border restrictions going beyond those compatible with EU norms for a light passport check and customs control (Gibraltar is outside the Community customs territory) are unjustified and counter-productive. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary spoke on the telephone to the Spanish Foreign Minister on this subject on 11 February. The Embassy in Madrid has also raised it on several occasions with the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs and I have raised it with my counterpart, Senor de Miguel. We again made it clear to the Spanish authorities that we look to them to allow movement across the border in conformity with EU obligations. We have also drawn the current situation at the Gibraltar/Spain border to the attention of the President of the European Commission.

British visitors spent a total of &#163;2.825 billion during the year. The figure for 1998 will be higher as the number of British tourists to Spain last year rose significantly over preceding years.

<P>
<a name="90216w42.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B>

 We cannot of course predict the population or GDP of the candidates or the 15 current EU member states at the time of the first accessions. However recent figures indicate that enlargement to include the six candidates currently in accession negotiations would

<P><I>16 Feb 1999 : Column: 754</I><P>
increase the EU's population by some 17 per cent. (based on figures in Agenda 2000 published by the European Commission in July 1997) and GDP (Purchasing Power Parity) by about 8 per cent. (based on figures released by Eurostat on 11 September 1998).

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has received from the Belgium Ministry of Foreign Affairs concerning the seizure at Antwerp on 7 February of consignments of weapons destined for Eritrea, being transported by a British company.  [71384]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w42.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We received no representations from the Belgium Ministry of Foreign Affairs about seizures at Antwerp on 7 February.
<P>

<a name="90216w42.html_para0">We did, however, receive a letter from the Belgian Embassy in London on 6 November 1998 informing us that Belgian Customs had stopped, in August, a shipment of goods originating in Germany destined for Eritrea. They informed us that a British company was involved in organising the shipment. The matter is before the Belgian courts. We will continue to monitor developments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what reports he has received on the numbers of Serbs displaced from their homes in Krajina; how many have since been permitted to return; what representations he has made to the Croatian authorities about the problem; and if he will make a statement.  [71321]<P>

<P>
<a name="90216w42.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We receive regular reports on the refugee situation in the former Yugoslavia from organisations such as United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), and the European Community Monitoring Mission (ECMM).
<P>

<a name="90216w42.html_para1">According to UNHCR figures, there remain 220,000 Croatian Serb refugees outside Croatia. There are also some 8,000 Serb refugees in the Creation region of Eastern Slavonia who were displaced from their homes. Up until 4 February 1999, 28,000 Croatian Serb refugees are reported to have returned to Croatia.
<P>

<a name="90216w42.html_para2">We take every opportunity to impress on the states of the former Yugoslavia the importance we place on refugee return. I most recently raised this issue with the Croatian Assistant Foreign Minister when he called on me in London on 8 February.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent reports he has received in respect of the massacre at Bosanski Brod in 1992; if any persons have been indicted and brought before The Hague International War Crimes Tribunal for their involvement; and if he will make a statement. [71322]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w42.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We have received no recent reports in respect of a massacre at Bosanski Brod in 1992 and are not aware of any indictments released by the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia relating to such a massacre. However, the destruction of property in Bosanski Brod in 1992 is mentioned briefly in an

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the institutional changes within the EU, with particular reference to relations between national parliaments, following the coming into effect of the Amsterdam Treaty.  [69432]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90216w42.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Protocol on national parliaments attached to the Treaty of Amsterdam provides for a consultative role for COSAC--the representatives of European Affairs Committees from national parliaments in the European Union. We welcome this development. The Protocol also provides for greater involvement of national parliaments in EU business through the six-week minimum scrutiny period. This will reinforce the changes to our national scrutiny system introduced last November.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer on 30 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>96</i>, if Her Majesty's Government have supported resolutions or draft resolutions calling for an independent United Nations investigation of the Al-Shifa factory site in Khartoum.

<a name="90216w42.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 A draft resolution on this issue is still on the table at the UN Security Council but has not been put to the vote.
<P>

<a name="90216w42.html_para3">Bilateral US/Sudan dialogue on the issue continues. Meanwhile we encourage Sudan to become a party to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the acquisition, development, production, stockpiling and use of chemical weapons. It is supported by a verification regime consisting of data declarations and on-site inspections.

 Her Majesty's Ambassador to Khartoum visited the Al-Shifa factory only once; for the official opening ceremony in July 1997. He did not report that it was a heavily guarded military installation.
