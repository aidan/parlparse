 The approval of silencers for civil aircraft is in most cases the responsibility of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). For aircraft not covered by EASA, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) would only become involved where they have not previously approved the modification to the aircraft type. In those cases the CAA will need to investigate the proposed modification as part of the approval process. The applicant will be charged for modification investigation in accordance with the CAA&#146;s published Airworthiness Scheme of Charges. The CAA charging schemes are reviewed annually in consultation with the Secretary of State for Transport.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 October 2009]: </i>Foreign-registered vehicles represent around 3.5 per cent. of all heavy goods vehicle (HGV) traffic on Britain&#146;s roads. In 2008-09, the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency (VOSA) checked 61,000 foreign-registered HGVs and found roadworthiness related concerns with 40 per cent. of them. This compares with 64,800 spot checks on UK registered HGVs where 32.6 per cent. were found to have roadworthiness related concerns.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_23"><a name="91019w0001.htm_para3"><a name="0910197000207">We have also introduced a new scheme to allow the police and VOSA to take on the spot financial deposits from offending drivers with no satisfactory address in the United Kingdom. In the first three months of operation, almost &#163;700,000 has been collected from such drivers.</p>

6. DEFRA has invested in encryption technology in the laptop and BlackBerry services for all new issues. Over 95 per cent. of the current devices are encrypted.<br>
7. The total PC/laptop kit has reduced overall within DEFRA. The increase in laptop volumes above is due to &#145;single device&#146; policy that has removed a significant number of desktop PCs in exchange for one corporate laptop per user in order to drive out environmental and mobile working benefits.<br>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="91019w0002.htm_para2"><a name="0910197000301">The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) was commissioned by the Interdepartmental Ministerial Group on biodiversity (IDMGb) to draft a Government Strategy for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity in the UK Overseas Territories. This was done with the express intention of improving the effectiveness of co-ordination of the UK Government&#146;s support for biodiversity in the Overseas Territories. The strategy was announced at a reception on Collaboration on Environmental and Biodiversity Issues in the Overseas Territories, hosted by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) at the end of June.</p>

It is intended to pay for up to 10 projects relating to biodiversity in the Overseas Territories, each costing up to &#163;25,000. These will be comparable to existing Darwin scoping projects, aiming towards main-round projects, but for longer periods and involving some initial implementation work. The cost of Challenge Fund payments will come from a sum of up to &#163;1.5 million, which I announced at the same event will be earmarked within the Darwin Initiative this year for Overseas Territories projects.</p>

 The Defence Medical Services manage a widespread armed forces rehabilitation network that has some 180 Primary Care Rehabilitation Facilities and 15 Regional Rehabilitation Units (RRUs) as well as the flagship Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre at Headley Court in Surrey. Patients from all the armed services requiring rehabilitation are treated at the facility and location that is most appropriate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="91019w0003.htm_para8"><a name="0910197000473">The annual running costs of Headley Court are approximately &#163;13.5 million. Responsibility for the individual management of the primary care and RRU facilities is shared between the single service commands, with oversight from the Joint Medical Command. However, each service funds its respective RRUs differently. Owing to the number of different internal budgets to which costs would be attributable, any detailed analysis of local rehabilitation expenditure would therefore incur disproportionate costs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="91019w0003.htm_para9"><a name="0910197000474">Where an individual requires specialist rehabilitation services or equipment that can best be provided by a non-MOD organisation (such as some aspects of neurological rehabilitation and specialised prosthetics) this will be arranged at additional cost. In the financial year 2008-09, about &#163;1.6 million was spent on such services by the Joint Medical Command.</p>

Within the contracts system, an SME is defined as a company with less than 250 employees.

 When nuclear submarines leave the naval service, they will be subject to a process known as Defuel, De-equip and Lay-up Preparation, which will involve spent nuclear materials being removed for storage at Sellafield, and any remaining irradiated material being secured within the reactor compartment. In line with current practice for other submarines now leaving service, the submarines themselves will then be stored afloat at either Devonport or Rosyth, pending final disposal.</p>

 The Youth Justice Board (YJB) announced its intention to stop contracting for places at Orchard Lodge Secure Children's Home on 26 March 2009.

Nevertheless, the overall security in Iraq continues to improve as the capability of the Iraqi security forces grows. Importantly, the Iraqi people in provincial and Kurdish regional elections this year chose leaders who promote democracy, human rights and the rule of law over those who offer nothing but violence.

<i> [holding answer 15 October 2009]:</i> The majority of significant UK attack plots in this decade have had considerable links abroad, with a substantial proportion of these terrorist attacks and threats being associated with al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda and those groups and individuals affiliated to and influenced by them undoubtedly represent the greatest current terrorist threat to the UK. Al-Qaeda regards the UK as a key target, and as a potential source of recruits. As a result of international military action in Afghanistan, Al-Qaeda has largely been forced out of its 'safe havens' and is now mainly based on the Pakistan/Afghanistan border.</p>

 Heritage provides a vital contribution to the national economy and contributes to the success of a range of industries including tourism, retail, entertainment and construction. Although no aggregate figure is available, several studies of which English Heritage is aware have sought to identify the contribution within a particular context. In the north-west alone it is estimated that Heritage and its ancillaries contribute &#163;1.6 billion in gross value added (GVA) to the economy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_138"><a name="91019w0010.htm_para7"><a name="0910197001321">A Heritage Lottery Fund study of major projects they completed in 2007 estimates them to have created &#163;33 million in local GVA and to support the equivalent of 1,277 full-time equivalent jobs. Tourism, one of the largest industries in the UK, was estimated to be worth approximately &#163;86 billion in 2007. Evidence from VisitBritain shows England's historic buildings are key motivators for those considering a visit to the country and they also top the table of activities undertaken by those who actually do visit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_139"><a name="91019w0010.htm_para8"><a name="0910197001322">Privately owned historic houses generate an economic contribution of over &#163;1.6 billion; while England's cathedrals generate around &#163;150 million per annum of benefits for the local and national economies.</p>

 The Legal Deposit Libraries Act 2003 commenced on 1 February 2004. It was always the intention that the Act would be implemented progressively, as it is enabling legislation in a complex and challenging area. The Act made provision for the establishment of an advisory panel which was created in 2005. The panel produced its first set of recommendations in Autumn 2008, and a further set in spring 2009. Draft regulations which may result from those recommendations would be subject to full public consultation and to affirmative resolution in both Houses.

 In 2008-09, national health service organisations were asked to assess themselves against a core standard that incorporates compliance with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence's (NICE) technology appraisals. These self-assessments were independently validated by the Care Quality Commission and showed that 95.2 per cent, of NHS organisations could provide evidence of compliance with this standard.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="91019w0012.htm_para7"><a name="0910197001476">Clinical guidelines relate to a whole pathway of care and can make a large number of recommendations spanning all stages of care from diagnosis to treatment of a condition. In view of their complexity and because of the different states of readiness for implementation in the NHS, clinical guidelines are not subject to the same performance management assessment as NICE'S technology appraisals. Compliance with NICE'S clinical guidelines is a developmental standard for NHS organisations and the Government expect NHS organisations to implement them over time using available resources.</p>

 We have no current plans to change the criteria for EMA eligibility. For most young people, eligibility for education maintenance allowance (EMA) is subject to an assessment of their household income based on the financial year prior to the academic year in which they start their course. A successful assessment provides a young person with a guaranteed entitlement of up to three years of EMA on the same rate regardless of whether their income increases. If there is a drop in income from one year to the next then a young person may apply to be reassessed for the subsequent academic year. They could be assessed as eligible for EMA where they were not previously, or an increased rate of it. They would receive the EMA guarantee based on the rate awarded following the most recent assessment.</p>

 EMA was introduced as an incentive to encourage more young people from lower income households to stay on in post compulsory learning, and to address the issue that the UK had one of the lowest post-16 participation rates in OECD countries. The scheme was piloted from 1999 and rolled out nationally, to consecutive cohorts of learners in full-time education, from September 2004. It was extended to trainees in unwaged training provision in 2006.</p>

We have not estimated the cost for 2009/10 and do not plan to do so. We believe that, to be effective, state support needs to be targeted where there is most need.</p>

1. The reported expenses include the cost of all travel, accommodation and other support services for board members, the chief executive and directors. The variation in travel and accommodation expenses between board members reflects their respective time commitments and duties, the range of activities they undertake, the location of their homes and other individual factors. All board members, directors and the chief executive are required to travel around the UK to some extent.<br>
2. The Commission has four offices in England and Wales: London, Liverpool, Newport (Gwent) and Taunton. With the probable exception of the chair and chief executive, the majority of board members&#146; and directors&#146; travel is between these offices.<br>
3. Rail travel and accommodation are mainly booked through central agencies rather than by individuals who then claim the expense back. The costs shown, therefore, are those incurred by individuals rather than &#145;expenses claimed&#146;.<br>
4. &#145;Subsistence&#146; covers the allowances payable for significant time out of the office and for overnight stays, at rates agreed with HMRC.<br>
5. Where the board and directors attend key events that are organised centrally and through a &#145;block booking&#146; by the Commission, e.g. where open board meetings are held away from the London office, the accommodation and food costs are not included as, retrospectively, this would involve disproportionate resource and expense. Events of this type held in 2008-09 were open board meetings in Liverpool and Swansea, the Charity Commission&#146;s Annual Public Meeting in London and the board&#146;s away day in Hertfordshire. The cost of these would add around &#163;500 in total to each individual&#146;s accommodation/food costs.<br>

 To date, 27 interim empty dwelling management orders (EDMOs) have been approved by the Residential Property Tribunal Service (RPTS) since the legislation came into effect in April 2006.

EDMOs provide this compulsion and should therefore be a key component of a comprehensive empty property strategy.</p>

 Since its launch on 1 December, the Homes and Communities Agency (HCA) has operated a single accounting policy, which harmonised the policies of its various predecessor bodies, namely: English Partnerships (EP consisting of the Commission for New Towns (CNT) and the Urban Regeneration Agency (URA)), the investment arm of the Housing Corporation, and the Academy for Sustainable Communities.</p>

 The aim of the Kickstart programme is to unlock stalled sites in England for the development of high-quality, mixed tenure homes. Local authorities are note eligible to apply for funding from the Kickstart Housing Delivery fund as there is a separate funding pot available to authorities to deliver new social housing on land they already own and that can be developed only by them. Where a local authority has appointed a delivery partner, for example through a disposal or development agreement to bring forward a site for housing development, the delivery partner can apply. The successful projects from round one of the local authority new build programme were announced in September. 49 local authorities, covering every region of the country, will receive a share of &#163;130 million Government funding to build over 2,000 homes.</p>
