To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the Government's policy on the provision of export credits for military equipment.  [18608]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Export credits for the sale of all goods and technology controlled for strategic reasons are subject to an export licence being issued by the Department of Trade and Industry's Export Control Organisation. All export licence applications are scrutinised rigorously and considered on a case-by-case basis against the Consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria.
<P>

<a name="11204w01.html_para0">Export credit support for defence sales to 63 of the poorest developing countries is not generally available. New export credits extended by ECGD to these countries have been restricted to "productive expenditure" that would benefit economic and social development. The OECD Statement of Principles on Official Export Credit Support to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries limits the productive expenditure criteria to the 41 HIPC's.

 The responsibilities of the Office of Science and Technology (OST), which are cross- Government, will remain largely unchanged.

 I am pleased today to announce the outcome of the second stage of the Quinquennial Review of the six grant-awarding Research Councils. I shall be placing a copy of the stage 2 report in the Libraries of both Houses.




<P>
<P><I>4 Dec 2001 : Column 148W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11204w01.html_para3">Quinquennial reviews are conducted in two stages. I announced the outcome of stage 1 on 19 July. It concluded that the six grant-awarding Research Councils should continue to be executive non-departmental public bodies.
<P>

<a name="11204w01.html_para4">I welcome the thrust of the stage 2 report and its recommendations and accept the review's main conclusions that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Research Council system is working reasonably well;
<P>
<BR>
to deal with the increasing pace of scientific change and complexity of national and international arrangements, the Councils need to be capable of acting and speaking as one, and of promoting new and increasingly multidisciplinary science;
<P>
<BR>
they also need to do business with their key stakeholders in more convergent ways and in line with modernising Government principles;
<P>
<BR>
there should be a new strategy group comprising the Council chief executives and the Director General of the Research Councils to achieve these aims, and to provide a framework for cross-Council working at all levels;
<P>
<BR>
with a clearer identity and mission, the Councils as a group will be able to develop closer links with the other major science funders, including the Funding Councils, Government Departments and the major charities;
<P>
<BR>
they will also be able to work more closely with other key stakeholders, including the universities and the business and public service organisations which use their research and trained people;
<P>
<BR>
to capitalise on these stronger relationships and closer working, and to ensure delivery of key objectives, the Research Councils and DTI need to develop a stronger strategic framework for science and a long term strategic 'road map' towards which the full range of players in science can direct their efforts.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11204w01.html_para5">It will be for the Research Councils, working closely with my Department, to implement the review's detailed recommendations. Once this is completed, I am confident that the effectiveness of science budget expenditure will be enhanced.
<P>

<a name="11204w01.html_para6">I am grateful to all those who contributed to this Quinquennial Review, in particular the members of the review steering group, working groups, and Research Council staff.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w02.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 A detailed breakdown for the private recruitment industry by particular specialist areas is not available, since many agencies and employment businesses provide work-finding services for a number of occupations. However, we estimate that there are about 20,000 employment agencies establishments, of which around 900 are licensed nurse agencies and some 2,000 specialise in IT.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what information she has collated on the private sector companies that have carried out gender pay audits as recommended by the Code of Practice on Equal Pay 1997 to assess their compliance with the Equal Pay Act since 1997.  [16140]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 November 2001]:</i> The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) Code of Practice on Equal Pay aims to provide practical guidance and to recommend good practice to employers. There is no legal obligation on employers to carry out gender pay audits under the Equal Pay Act.
<P>

<a name="11204w02.html_para0">Many employers have stated publicly that they have carried out, or are planning to carry out a pay review while others prefer to keep this information confidential. Information has not therefore been collated on private sector companies that have carried out gender pay audits.
<P>

<a name="11204w02.html_para1">A programme of action is under way to promote the practice of pay reviews in line with the EOC code of practice. We are funding the EOC to prepare a model for voluntary pay reviews which will offer a technical example for employers in how to review the pay of their male and female employees. Extra funding has been made available to trade unions for training representatives in equal pay issues in the workplace.

 <i>[holding answer 21 November 2001]:</i> No proposal to amend the Equal Pay Directive (75/117/EEC) has been made by the Commission nor are we aware that the Commission has laid down any firm timetable for doing so. If a proposal to amend the Equal Pay Directive is forthcoming, the Government will consider it very carefully, in the light of case law since the Directive came into force in 1975 and the results from the current process of amending the Equal Treatment Directive (76/207/EEC).

<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 November 2001]:</i> Two proposals outlined in the consultation document "Towards Equal Pay for Women" have been implemented already. These are: simplifying multiple cases by requiring just one application (IT1 form) and one response from the employer (IT3 form) which has been given effect in the Employment Tribunals (Constitution and Rules of Procedure) Regulations 2001 that came into force in July 2001; and the Burden of Proof Regulations, which implement the Burden of Proof Directive 97/80/EC, which were laid 20 July and came into force on 12 October. The proposal to introduce a questionnaire procedure into the Equal Pay Act has been included in the Employment Bill that was introduced on 7 November 2001. The Government intend to implement those changes

<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Jodrell Bank Observatory is owned and operated by the University of Manchester, who are responsible for its funding and operation. It has successfully applied for and received a rolling grant from the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) for a number of years for astronomical research. That grant was last reassessed in September 2001, and PPARC awarded Jodrell Bank Observatory just over &#163;2 million for the four years until September 2005. The grant will next come up for reassessment in September 2003. Jodrell Bank Observatory also co-ordinates the MERLIN network of radio telescopes, for which it receives a separate grant from PPARC of approximately &#163;2.2 million per year. This grant is due to expire in 2003. It is currently being reassessed.

<a name="11204w02.html_para2">Many of the Department's programmes are not sector specific and we do not keep centrally information on involvement with particular sectors. This information cannot be obtained except at disproportionate cost. However, my Department does supply funding to the National Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux (NACAB) and Citizens Advice Scotland (CAS) to support the work of the Citizens Advice Service and its volunteers. This financial year my Department provided NACAB with &#163;16.9 million grant in aid (&#163;16.4 million for 2000&#150;01) and CAS with &#163;2.8 million (&#163;2.225 million in 2000&#150;01).

 We agree that trade rules must help to eliminate poverty, and that poor countries need a fair and effective rules-based international trading system. We agree on the need for capacity building, and for an approach that recognises more explicitly that WTO members are at different stages of development. However, we disagree with some NGOs on some WTO issues. For example, we believe that the recent campaigning against the GATS has been very misleading. Our position on all these issues is set out in a series of Background Briefing Notes on Trade and Development which I am placing in the Library.

 The provision for the Government indemnity scheme is made by the National Heritage Act 1980. The scheme facilitates public access to loans of works of art and other objects for public display made to museums, galleries and other such institutions by private owners and non-national institutions. It does this by indemnifying lenders against loss or damage to their loan. Loans covered by the scheme must be for public benefit. The scheme also covers loans of such objects for study purposes within borrowing institutions where this would contribute materially to the public's understanding or appreciation of the loan. Examples of this are enhancing interpretation or explanation to the public of objects or bringing into the public domain the conclusions of any study.

 Manufacturing industry continues to be very important to the economy of Scotland employing some 300,000 in June 2001 and supporting a further 185,000 jobs in the Scottish economy. Manufacturing exports amounted to &#163;19.3 billion in the year to 2001&#150;02 according to Scottish Executive figures, an increase of 8.6 per cent. compared with the previous four quarters. The sound policies of economic management, which this Government are pursuing, continue to deliver the best platform for the manufacturing sector to deal with current difficult global trading conditions.

<P>
<P>

 The increase in the adult national minimum wage to &#163;4.10 per hour and the youth rate to &#163;3.50 from October 2001 is benefiting around 135,000 people across Scotland. The national minimum wage is having a direct and beneficial impact on the pay of the lowest paid workers in Scotland; is helping to close the gap between the highest and lowest earners; and is helping reduce the differential between men's and women's pay. This has been achieved without any discernible adverse impact on the economy.

 I last met the Chairman of Scottish Enterprise on 27 November and we discussed a range of issues. While Scotland cannot remain immune to the effects of a global slowdown, the tough decisions that this Government have taken mean that the economic fundamentals in the UK and in Scotland remain sound. The Scottish economy, as part of the UK economy, is better placed than ever before to cope with the effects of a global downturn in demand.

Various rate relief schemes apply to many rural post offices. The Government foresee post offices helping customers access a wide range of public services both electronically and over the counter. I understand that Post Office Ltd. do not keep records of the number of post office closures in each parliamentary constituency and consequently such information as the hon.

 We have increased the number of draft bills published and opened up the process of pre-legislative scrutiny.

 General practitioners are not required to provide acupuncture as part of either general or personal medical services.

 The Compliance Unit of the Prescription Pricing Authority (PPA) is responsible for carrying out a number of checks on those patients who claim exemption from prescription charges on grounds such as age, certain medical conditions, low income or receipt of certain tax credits or benefits (such as income support). Appropriate organisations are contacted to confirm entitlement to exemption. Where the patient provides additional information to confirm their entitlement, no further action is taken. However, if it is found that a patient has incorrectly claimed exemption from prescription charges, the PPA recovers the outstanding charges and may impose a penalty charge.

 <i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The prescription information was obtained from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system. Please note that the data up to 1990 are not strictly consistent with data from 1991 onwards. Figures for 1980&#150;90 are based on fees and on a sample of 1 in 200 prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists and appliance contractors only. Figures for 1991 onwards are based on items and cover all prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists, appliance contractors dispensing doctors and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospital or private prescriptions.<P>

2. Benzodiazepines are those drugs defined within the British National Formulary sections 4.1.1, "Hypnotics", 4.1.2. "Anxiolytics", and 4.8. "Antiepileptics".<P>

 <i>[holding answer 24 November 2001]:</i> The Department knows of four academic groups which have been active in reviewing the risks from depleted uranium, the Royal Society Depleted Uranium Working Group, the British Geological Survey, the University of Bristol Department of Earth Sciences and the Southampton Oceanic Centre.

<P><I>4 Dec 2001 : Column 173W</I><P>
increased risk of strokes among members of <i>(a)</i> Asian and <i>(b)</i> African-Caribbean ethnic groups; and what plans he has to commission further research.  [16691]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w08.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The 1999 Health Survey for England commissioned by the Department investigated the health of minority ethnic groups. This found that after adjusting for age, rates of stroke among black Caribbean men were over two-thirds higher than in the general population. Indian men also had higher rates than the general population. Among women, Chines women had low rates of stroke, while all other groups did not differ significantly from the general population. Details of the survey can be found at: http//www.official-documents.co.uk/document/doh/ survey99/houses-00.htm.
<P>

<a name="11204w08.html_para2">The Department has funded a number of literature reviews on ethnicity and health, carried out by the national health service Centre for Reviews and Dissemination (CRD), University of York. One of the reviews looked at stroke in south Asian and African-Caribbean groups. This concluded that south Asian and Afro-Caribbean populations experience significantly raised rates of cardiovascular disease. In particular south Asian groups are at higher risk of coronary heart disease, and Afro- Caribbeans are at greater risk of stroke. The details of these reviews can be found on the CRD website at: http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/crd/welcome.htm.
<P>

<a name="11204w08.html_para3">The Department is currently funding a study entitled 'The South London Stroke Register: The Incidence, Outcome and Ethnic differences of aetiological subtypes of stroke'. This study will compare incidence of stroke between ethnic groups and compare survival, recurrence and functional status between subtypes and ethnic groups.
<P>

<a name="11204w08.html_para4">The Department has no specific plans to commission further research in this area, but stroke will continue to be considered as one of the priorities within the developing research and development strategy that supports the National Service Framework for Older People.

 We will continue to use publicity campaigns designed to persuade smokers to give up.

 On 31 October 2001, the Department published the results of the most recent assessments of cleanliness for national health service hospitals. These results reflect the overall standard of the patient environment. The publication of these results is in line with the commitment we gave in the NHS plan to place this information in the public domain.
<P>

<a name="11204w09.html_para0">The score for each element of the external audit of cleanliness for NHS hospitals has been reported to the NHS trusts concerned. The scores must be interpreted in the context of the written recommendations of the patient environment action teams (PEATs). The publication of the score for each individual element alone will not provide a rounded assessment of standards within each hospital.
<P>

<a name="11204w09.html_para1">NHS trusts are still working to complete the implementation of their 2001&#150;02 patient environment action plans and we expect to see continued improvements throughout the coming months. NHS trusts must incorporate the recommendations of the PEATs within their existing patient environment action plans, as a means of delivering further improvements. These improvements will be reflected in raised scores for each element of the inspection process by April 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health pending the National Institute for Clinical Excellence's appraisal of Glivec for chronic myeloid leukaemia patients, what guidance he has given health authorities on prescribing Glivec <i>(a)</i> to those who have been on Novartis' extended access programme, <i>(b)</i> to those who are on the current trial of the drug and <i>(c)</i> to those who have been diagnosed with CML recently and fall under neither <i>(a)</i> or <i>(b)</i>.

 A letter about the future provision of Glivec, agreed by Ministers and signed by both Neil McKay, the chief operating officer, and Professor Mike Richards, the national cancer director, was sent on 24 October to all national health service regional directors.
<P>

<a name="11204w09.html_para2">Novartis, the manufacturers of Glivec, are making a limited free supply available for those patients on the Extended Access Programme (EAP). It will then be for health authorities and trust to discuss the funding of the treatment. However, as the letter of 24 October makes clear, there is no question of treatment being withdrawn from patients on funding grounds once EAP supplies end. Treatment should cease only on clinical grounds.
<P>

<a name="11204w09.html_para3">Those patients involved in trials of Glivec will continue to have their treatments funded by Novartis.
<P>

<a name="11204w09.html_para4">For new patients, as with all newly licensed treatments in advance of a NICE appraisal, the Department's advice is that funding authorities should consider the clinical evidence available for a specific treatment before making any decision.
<P>

<a name="11204w09.html_para5">It is expected that the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) will publish guidance on Glivec in August 2002.

For 1995 and 1996 and the first half of 1997 data have been amalgamated to the approximate boundaries of the new regional office areas. This allows for comparison with subsequent years.<P>

An incident is three or more patients infected or colonised by the same strain of MRSA in the same month from the same hospital.<P>

The criteria for submission of isolates of MRSA (and other isolates of staphylococcus aureus) to the PHLS for specialist tests have been revised twice since 1996 (in January 1998 and in January 2000).<P>

These revised criteria have led to a fall in the number of incidents of MRSA that were reported to the PHLS. <P>

 We estimate that over 3 million people are eligible for new deal 50 plus. Those who move into work and have an overall gross income of under &#163;15,000 per annum, having been on an eligible benefit for six months or more, will be eligible for the employment credit.

Currently we estimate that over 30,000 people are in receipt of the credit.

 It is not possible to identify individual local authorities in this way. Inspections have revealed that each authority has a mixture of strengths and weaknesses across a wide range of different administrative and counter-fraud activities. Inspections can vary in approach according to the circumstances of each local authority. The information available in the reports does not, therefore, enable such comparisons to be made.

 The amount of subsidy paid to each authority is calculated annually using a formula agreed in consultation with the local authority associations. The formula takes account of the caseload and complexity of housing benefit cases, with elements for accommodation and staffing costs. Once annual allocations have been set, they cannot be altered in-year. However, any changes in caseload would be reflected in the following year's allocation.

 During the last 12 months unemployment has fallen below 1 million for the first time since 1975. The latest figures, for October 2001, show the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance at 951,100. Although this is 4,300 higher than in September, the labour market is still in a better position than a year ago, with claimant unemployment 95,700 lower than in October 2000.

 The information requested is not yet available. Provisional estimates of contributions to stakeholder pensions by employers are scheduled to be available in early 2002. Information on the earnings bands of stakeholder pension contributors is not yet available. However, recently published research from the Association of British Insurers found that the majority of those intending to take out a stakeholder pension in the 12 months following the research had an individual annual income of less than &#163;25,000.

<P>

<a name="11204w13.html_para5">When the Justice (Northern Ireland) Bill receives parliamentary approval and the Government are satisfied that the devolved institutions are working effectively, those functions of the Lord Chancellor which relate to judicial appointments in Northern Ireland will pass to the First Minister and Deputy First Minister and a new Judicial Appointments Commission. The most senior judicial appointments will be made on the advice of the Prime Minister. Other functions of the Lord Chancellor in relation to court sittings and membership of Court Rules Committees will be transferred to the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland. The Lord Chief Justice will also have a new role in relation to the handling of complaints against the judiciary. The Lord Chancellor is also currently responsible for the Northern Ireland Court Service. The Bill anticipates the abolition of the Court Service as a separate and distinct Civil Service and the transfer of its functions and staff, most probably to the Northern Ireland Civil Service.

 Loans made to the administrator by DTLR of &#163;1.17 billion so far, and any additional lending in the future, will not score on the Public Sector Net Borrowing. Such loans will add to the Public Sector Net Cash Requirement when given, and reduce it when repaid. Repayment is anticipated before the end of this financial year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> international organisations have made to the Government of Zimbabwe on (i) the eviction of black farm workers from their homes as a result of land reform policy and (ii) the recent attacks on and arrests of opposition MDC supporters in Matabeleland; what representations his Department has made to SADC countries concerning sending election observer missions to Zimbabwe for the presidential election; what steps he is taking to ensure that a free and fair presidential election will be held in Zimbabwe; and what conditions the UK Government have set for recognising the outcome of the Zimbabwe presidential election relating to the action of the Government of Zimbabwe in ensuring a free and fair election.  [18214]<P>

<P>
<a name="11204w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We continue to encourage the Government of Zimbabwe to abide by the undertakings they made at the Abuja meeting on 6 September, including restoration of the rule of law, an end to violence and intimidation and illegal land occupations. During these representations we regularly draw attention to the plight of farm workers. The British High Commission in Harare made a public statement condemning political violence following the recent politically motivated violence in Bulawayo.
<P>

<a name="11204w17.html_para0">We continue to encourage the Government of Zimbabwe to create a climate conducive to free and fair elections. The presidential election process will be raised as part of the EU consultations with the Government of Zimbabwe under Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement. We are in regular dialogue with South African Development Community&#151;SADC&#151;countries on election observers and other issues related to Zimbabwe's electoral process. We are also discussing Zimbabwe's electoral process with Commonwealth partners, the US and others. The credibility of the presidential election will be questioned by the UK and the international community if the process is not demonstrably free and fair.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what have been the costs of operations undertaken by his Department in connection with events following the 11 September terrorist attacks on the United States; and if these costs will be met from his Department's budget.  [16563]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Since the events of 11 September, the FCO has had to react immediately to sizeable changes in the global environment. This has had a significant effect on the FCO's budget, forcing us to re-prioritise. We have incurred extra expenditure on: vital physical security for our overseas missions and the staff working in them; evacuating British citizens at risk from increased tension and violence in Pakistan; dealing with British victims of the destruction of the World Trade Centre and assisting their families; the considerable diplomatic effort to seek out and bring those responsible to justice, and to build on international coalition against terrorism; and a rapid increase in BBC World Service broadcasting in local languages in and around Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="11204w17.html_para2">Current estimates put the additional cost of the crisis to the FCO this financial year around &#163;40 million. Fee income from visas and passports may well suffer with the downturn in international travel. The last spending review significantly increased the resources of the FCO for this financial year. We are seeking to absorb as much as possible of the new requirements through re-prioritisation as well as efficiency measure. We are in discussion with the Treasury to address the shortfall in resources the FCO faces.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will publish the latest report received from the Oversight Commissioner.  [20914]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w19.html_spnew4"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 In accordance with section 68(4)(a) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000, I have today laid a copy of the Oversight Commissioner's third statutory report for the year 2001 before this House.

<a name="11204w19.html_sbhd5"><H4><center>Government Law and Order Policy</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w19.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Quentin Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the Government's policy is in regard to <i>(a)</i> organised crime and <i>(b)</i> community policing in Northern Ireland.  [16305]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w19.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Government are determined to confront organised crime in Northern Ireland and are leading the fight through the work of the Organised Crime Task Force, which I chair.
<P>

<a name="11204w19.html_para3">The Task Force, launched in September 2000, is a multi-agency initiative, involving the Police Service of Northern Ireland, HM Customs & Excise and others. Work is already well developed and the operational agencies have achieved significant successes. For example, on 8 November, a joint operation by Customs and police resulted in seizure of 42.6 million illicit cigarettes, the largest ever seizure in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="11204w19.html_para4">The Government will not permit the legacy of terrorism to develop into a system of organised crime activity in Northern Ireland. However, there are no short-term fixes. The dismantling of organised crime groups takes time, expertise and commitment.
<P>

<a name="11204w19.html_para5">The Government and the Chief Constable accept the importance of community policing and are committed to ensuring that this is a core function of the police service and the core function of every police station. It is the Government's policy to support, in every way possible, the Northern Ireland Policing Board and the Police Service of Northern Ireland, in delivering effective community policing.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on how many occasions his officials had 



<P>
<P><I>4 Dec 2001 : Column 220W</I><P>
discussions with <i>(a)</i> Ardoyne Road and <i>(b)</i> Glenbryn Road residents about the Holy Cross protest; and what the outcome of these meetings was.  [17233]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w20.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Secretary of State and I along with my officials have had a number of meetings with both sides involved in this dispute. I have also held meetings with members of the Devolved Administration, local community representatives, interest groups, and the hon. Member for Belfast, North (Mr. Dodds) to discuss how the present situation may be resolved. We welcome the recent decision by the residents to end their protest and now hope the children will be able to continue with their education without fear or threat of intimidation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w20.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if he will make a statement on the Police Service for Northern Ireland's policing strategy for the Holy Cross protests; and how many times this has been reviewed.  [17232]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w20.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 During the policing of the Holy Cross protest it has been police strategy to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Respect and uphold the human rights of all those involved including the children, parents, teachers, protestors, residents and the general community;
<P>
<BR>
Prevent public disorder and to ensure the safety of all those involved;
<P>
<BR>
Minimise the disruption to local communities and those attending Holy Cross Primary School; and
<P>
<BR>
Enforce the law and bring offenders to court.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11204w20.html_para0">Protection of the children and their rights has been a paramount factor throughout the protests. In this context, police have sought to work and negotiate with local people from both sides and their representatives in order to ensure the safe passage of the children to their school. The strategy for the operation has been kept under review on a daily basis. In addition there have been six formal meetings to review the strategy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w20.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the cost has been to <i>(a)</i> the Army and <i>(b)</i> the Police Service for Northern Ireland of policing the Holy Cross protest.  [17230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w20.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 Police estimate the additional cost to the police grant of the ongoing operation at Holy Cross to be &#163;18,000 per day arising from increased overtime costs. This equates to a financial cost from September to date of &#163;1.1 million in addition to the human resource effect the operation has on other areas of policing. There have been no additional costs to the Army in supporting the PSNI to police the Holy Cross protest. Any costs incurred are contained within the Army's normal operational budget.
<P>

<a name="11204w20.html_para1">The quoted figures distinguish between the normal costs of policing and the incremental costs (overtime and other expenses) incurred for this specific operation.
<P>

<a name="11204w20.html_para2">Although there may be additional secondary costs to the Army e.g. fuel costs, these are not easily quantifiable. There are no additional manpower costs as the Army does not work overtime.

since April 2000 the police were in receipt of information regarding violence against <i>(a)</i> persons and <i>(b)</i> property in interface areas; on how many occasions officers were sent to the scene; and on how many occasions charges were subsequently brought against those involved.  [17371]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w20.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally and would have to be extracted from a number of different sources. To provide the information from April 2000 could be done only at a disproportionate cost. Generally, if information is received by police prior to an incident of public disorder, patrols are briefed accordingly and if necessary additional patrols are tasked.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what lessons learned from the procurement process of Eurofighter he will apply to the procurement of the European Technology Acquisition Programme; what are the objectives of the ETAP study; when he expects the ETAP study to be completed; what financial commitment he has made to the ETAP study; what expenditure limits he has set for it; and if he will make a statement.  [18288]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w20.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The European Technology Acquisition Programme (ETAP) is concerned with technologies relevant to a wide range of combat air systems, including manned and unmanned aircraft and cruise missiles. The key lessons from the Eurofighter procurement are reflected in Smart Acquisition principles under which ETAP will be conducted. The two project teams are in close communication to ensure that any appropriate lessons are learnt.
<P>

<a name="11204w20.html_para3">ETAP is a joint technology programme with European industry which will sustain and develop European capabilities for combat air systems over the next two decades. Linked to ETAP is a joint study, reporting in summer 2002, which will give an initial assessment of the miliary capabilities that the six nations' armed forces will need around 2020. Nations will commit funds to the specific technology demonstration programmes within ETAP in which they participate. It is too early to say with precision what UK funding will be required, but we would expect to spend some tens of millions of pounds in the early years of ETAP and more thereafter. All funding will be subject to normal MOD approvals.

 The UK has a requirement to replace, towards the end of the next decade, the strike capability currently provided by the Tornado GR4 strike aircraft. This programme is known as the Future Offensive Air System. The primary roles will be to destroy strategic targets deep in enemy territory and to damage the enemy's ability to wage aerial warfare by disabling aircraft on the ground or by damaging their command and control systems.
<P>

<a name="11204w20.html_para4">To meet the capability required, the MOD is studying a range of options, including manned and unmanned aircraft and cruise missiles. Allied to these studies will be a programme of technology demonstrations, some of which will be collaborative; opportunities are being explored within Europe and with the USA and Australia.

<P>
<a name="11204w21.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 November 2001]:</i> Test firing using depleted uranium (DU) contaminated gun barrels is required as part of the effectiveness and safety trials to determine the effect of firing a variety of rounds through worn barrels. The Challenger II tank worn barrel trial is planned to commence in January 2002. The trial involves firing a range of non-DU based ammunition natures such as high explosive and training rounds. The trial will involve the use of barrels that have not fired DU rounds as well as those that have. More recently, between 20 to 29 November, one gun barrel stored at QinetiQ Eskmeals, that had fired DU in the past, was used in a CHARM 3 Training Round (a non-DU round) trial at the Shoeburyness ranges. Test firing is being carried out at Shoeburyness because it meets the minimum firing distance required and provides a round recovery facility and a suitable cost-effective solution. There is no reason on health and safety grounds why the work cannot be carried out at this site.
<P>

<a name="11204w21.html_para4">No specific authorisation to transfer barrels allocated to support these trials is needed. Each barrel that has fired DU in the past has a record annotated accordingly and is accompanied with appropriate precautionary advice.
<P>

<a name="11204w21.html_para5">In the November trial, 71 rounds were fired and none were recovered. The worn barrel trial in January is planned to use 184 rounds and it is planned to recover 



<P>
<P><I>4 Dec 2001 : Column 226W</I><P>
some rounds to ascertain any effects on the round's stability and performance. Recovered rounds fired will be monitored for DU.
<P>

<a name="11204w21.html_para6">No environmental impact assessment was undertaken immediately before the CHARM3 training round trial and none is planned for the worn barrel trial. However, a risk assessment for the routine use of DU contaminated barrels was carried out by the Department's Radiation Protection Adviser, the then DERA Radiation Protection Services, in May 2000. Although this assessment concludes that no DU will be released from the barrel, environmental monitoring was conducted at the start, during and after the firings on 20 November. This involved a base line survey taking soil and grass samples and monitoring around the gun, passive air sampling, and a swab sample of the inside of the barrel when firing was complete. The monitoring will also be conducted in support of the worn barrel trial.
<P>

<a name="11204w21.html_para7">The barrels used at Shoeburyness were monitored before transfer. The monitoring in this case showed that the barrels contained less than 10 kilobecquerels of DU and thus confirmed that the material presented very little risk. This conclusion is based on the generic risk assessment conducted in May 2000, which is applicable to all barrels containing less than 10 kilobecquerels of DU.

However, in general terms detention would have been on the grounds that the persons concerned were in the process of being removed from the United Kingdom, their identities and the basis of their claim needed to be established, or it was believed that they would not comply with the terms of temporary admission or release.

 Various initiatives funded in the Spending Review 2000 are expected to reduce attrition, but are unlikely to begin to have a significant effect until 2001&#150;02. The most important of these are the expansion of the DNA database, the provision of additional scene of crime support, and increased police recruitment, funded from the Crime Fighting Fund. Additional funding of &#163;16.3 million has also been provided to criminal justice services for 2001&#150;02 to cover the increase in workload expected to flow from improved performance. However, it is not possible to disaggregate the total cost of bringing offences to justice.

<P>
<a name="11204w24.html_wqn5"><B> Annabelle Ewing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> special advisers and <i>(b)</i> press officers were employed (i) full time, (ii) part time and (iii) on a contract basis by his Department in each year since 1992.  [6925]<P>

 <i>(a)</i> On the number of special advisers, I refer the hon. Member to the reply given by my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Secretary, Cabinet Office on 21 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 340W.
<P>

<a name="11204w24.html_para2"><i>(b)</i> On the number of press officers, detailed staff profiles for the period prior to 1997 are not held centrally and the cost of providing this information would be disproportionate as it would require the Home Office pay branch to conduct a detailed search of all staff records for the periods in question. Payroll records would not, in any event, provide accurate press officer staffing levels which throughout the period in question were enhanced by attachments and secondments, some at nil cost to the Department, and would not necessarily have been reflected in payroll information.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 I am writing today to the chairman of the Service Authority for the National Criminal Intelligence Service and the National Crime Squad to inform him how I propose to increase the funding for the two organisations.
<P>

<a name="11204w24.html_para6">Under the provisions of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, the principal method of funding the two organisations is now one of grant in aid from the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="11204w24.html_para7">In reaching my decision, I have taken into account the proposals put to me by the Service Authority and also the representations made to me by the Association of Police Authorities, Association of Chief Police Officers and others. I have considered all this against the background of the overall settlement for the police service.
<P>

<a name="11204w24.html_para8">I have decided to make a grant of &#163;134.05 million to the National Crime Squad in 2002&#150;03. This is an increase of &#163;20 million or 17.5 per cent.
<P>

<a name="11204w24.html_para9">I have decided to make a grant of &#163;68.5 million to the National Criminal Intelligence Service in 2002&#150;03. This is an increase of &#163;19 million or 38.4 per cent.
<P>

<a name="11204w24.html_para10">The conditions under which payment of these grants will be made are set out in my letters to the chairman of the Service Authority and in the grant reports which have been published and laid before the House today. Copies have also been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="11204w24.html_para11">For both organisations, this level of increase provides the means for a significant boost in fighting the top priorities of drug and people trafficking. More generally, the increases will enable the National Crime Squad and the National Criminal Intelligence Service to continue and enhance their crucial work in tackling serious and organised criminal activity.

<a name="11204w25.html_para4"><i>Total Standard Spending (TSS)</i>
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para5">Police funding proposals within the local government finance system are being announced today by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. An announcement has also been made in the National Assembly for Wales. These proposals together would provide total standard spending on the police in England and Wales of &#163;7,777.199 million, an increase of &#163;209 million or 2.8 per cent. on the adjusted TSS for 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para6">The National Crime Squad (NCS) and the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) perform a valuable role in the battle against serious crime as part of the overall policing service. The NCS brought together the previous regional crime squads into a single unit, providing direction and control and making it easier to deploy resources effectively to prevent and detect serious crime and tackle major criminals operating in one or more police force areas in England and Wales. The role of NCIS is to develop intelligence to combat serious and organised crime, providing both tactical and strategic intelligence and expertise for law enforcement, Government and other relevant agencies at a national and international level. At present these services are financed mainly by a levy on police authorities set by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. From 2002&#150;03 the services will be funded centrally. The new approach achieves transparency in the funding arrangements for the service authorities. Provision for the services in 2002&#150;03 has been made from TSS. TSS for 2001&#150;02 has been adjusted in the previous table to ensure comparability.

<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para7">The increase in TSS is 2.8 per cent., but increases for individual authorities vary. The formula used to determine the distribution of grant/Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) is again unchanged. The main reasons for differences between authorities result from changes in the data applied from one year to the next. These include changes in population, unemployment, projected pensions' commitments and the area cost adjustment.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para8">We propose that the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) should continue to receive additional funding in recognition of its distinct national and capital city functions. It has proved very difficult for the principal formula to take account of these special circumstances. As in previous years a special payment of grant will be made to the MPS above that given through the principal grant formula. The amount has been set at &#163;197 million, which is included in the total provision.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para9">It is proposed to make a final year's special payment of grant to the following authorities for additional costs incurred as a result of changes in Metropolitan Police District boundaries in April 2000, as follows:

<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para13">The main items are:
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para14">Crime Fighting Fund (CFF): through the CFF resources are being provided for a programme of recruitment over and above forces previous plans. The programme has so far lived up to expectations. &#163;221 million is included in 2002&#150;03 to continue funding around 6,000 recruits from 2000&#150;01 to 2001&#150;02 and to support a further 3,000 to be recruited in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para15">Rural Policing Fund: as in 2001&#150;02, &#163;30 million is provided for the particular needs of more rural forces through the rural policing fund.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para16">Airwave: &#163;65 million will be available for the start-up operational costs of authorities taking Airwave in 2002&#150;03 and to enable those forces who have the Airwave service to purchase additional menu services from BT.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para17">London and South East Payments: &#163;33 million in total is provided for funding of free train travel for all Metropolitan and City of London officers; funding of 75 per cent. of the cost of the increase of &#163;3,327 a year in London allowance paid to officers in the Metropolitan and City of London forces who were recruited on or after 1 September 1994 and who are not in receipt of housing emoluments, and an allowance for other forces in the south-east.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para18"><i>Police Authority Capital</i>
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para19">The main items are as follows:
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para20">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I intend to increase provision of capital grant and supplementary credit approvals from &#163;157.43 million in 2001&#150;02 to &#163;209.43 million in 2002&#150;03. The increase is substantial, and police authorities will be asked to direct a significant proportion of the extra provision towards improvement of their estate, as well as providing for other capital assets such as vehicles and equipment.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para21">Capital grants (up to &#163;76 million) for introduction to Airwave will be made available to those authorities taking up the radio communications service in 2002&#150;03. Similar arrangements were made for 2001&#150;02 and will be made for 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para22"><i>Centrally Provided Services</i>
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para23">The main elements are CFF training costs (&#163;23 million); DNA expansion programme (&#163;61 million); The Airwave contractor's core service charges (&#163;50 million); and the National Strategy for Police Information Systems (&#163;27 million).
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para24"><i>Central Administration</i>
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para25">These include Home Office costs attributable to policing such as the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) and National Police Training facilities.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para26"><i>Enhanced security since 11 September</i>




<P>
<P><I>4 Dec 2001 : Column 240W</I><P>

Additional provision of &#163;30 million has also been made through the pre-Budget review for the police response during the current year to events of 11 September in the United States of America. We are considering further any longer term implications for policing.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para27">The settlement continues to take account of our commitment to improve efficiency and effectiveness in the police service. Future grant allocations will be considered in the light of police authorities improving efficiency by 2 per cent., reprioritising use of resources in favour of front-line policing.
<P>

<a name="11204w25.html_para28">In addition to the resources which I have detailed specifically for policing, police forces share in and benefit from various wider programmes for crime reduction. For example, since April 1999, under the Crime Reduction Programme, over &#163;390 million has been invested in the running and evaluation of over 1,450 crime-fighting projects. These will provide an evidence base on what methods, employed by the police and their crime and disorder partners, are the most effective in tackling crime and its causes.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

This information was taken from progress reports submitted by 403 schools in December 2000. Progress reports for schools operational as of September 2000 are currently being received but the information from these has not yet been collated.<P>

The 1998 School Standards and Framework Act provides for schools with a specialism to select up to 10 per cent. of their intake on the basis of aptitude for a specialist subject prescribed in regulations. Prior to the 1998 Act schools had greater discretion over aptitude selection and this accounts for the percentages above 10 per cent.<P>

<a name="11204w28.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 All local education authorities are required to submit an assessment of the standards of attainment in physical education of Key Stage 3 pupils. However, there is no statutory requirement for local education authorities to submit statistics on the level of competitive sport in schools. The Government's White Paper "Schools: Achieving Success", includes a pledge that all children have access to at least two hours a week of PE or school sport, in or after school. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority's survey into good practice in physical education has included examples from a number of schools in London.

<a name="11204w28.html_para0">On 2 November I published "Learning to Listen: Core Principles for the Involvement of Children and Young People" which sets out principles Government Departments have agreed to follow in their work to involve children and young people in the planning, provision and evaluation of Government policies and services relevant to them. The Children and Young People's Unit developed the principles in close consultation with Government Departments and with expertise from the voluntary sector. The Children and Young People's Unit is now supporting Departments as they plan how to take forward work to implement the principles and develop individual departmental action plans, for implementation from April 2002. The Unit will publish an annual report of progress against action plans.

<P>
<a name="11204w28.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 November 2001]:</i> Public concern about the loss of school playing fields led directly to the introduction in October 1998 of section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Prior to October 1998, the Government had no means of knowing precisely how many school playing fields were being sold. Before section 77 was introduced, only grant-maintained schools were required to seek consent from the Secretary of State before selling land, including areas of their playing fields. Local authorities and other schools that owned their own playing fields were free to sell without restriction.
<P>

<a name="11204w28.html_para6">Our best estimate is that an average of 40 playing fields a month were sold in this way before October 1998. This estimate is based on the number of playing field disposals at grant-maintained schools between April 1996, when the then Conservative Government further encouraged the disposal of playing fields by relaxing the Local Authority Capital Finance Regulations which governed the use of sale proceeds, and 1 October 1998, when section 77 took effect. During this 30-month period, some 64 grant- maintained schools were given approval to dispose of areas of playing field, which is an average of over two a month. Using the proportion of grant-maintained schools at that time compared with the number of other schools, we estimate the total number of playing field disposals each month to have been around 40.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> Capital support for new pupil places is allocated to local education authorities (LEAs) where the forecast growth in pupil numbers in an area exceeds the assessed physical capacity of local schools to accommodate them. Once the number of pupil places needed is established, funding is allocated using a per pupil amount which reflects the average cost of new accommodation. Funding support is normally provided to LEAs in the form of basic credit approvals. Detailed guidance to LEAs on submitting requests for new pupil places is sent to them annually in the "Guide for the Schools Capital Allocation Round and PFI Credits" document, copies of which are lodged in the Library.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> The Government have, as far as possible, moved away from centrally directed, bureaucratic bidding processes. We have moved towards needs related formulaic allocations to schools and local education authorities (LEAs) based on pupil numbers and survey-based assessments of building needs. It is the Government's view that, on balance and with the right safeguards, detailed decisions about capital priorities across a local area are best taken by LEAs working with their schools. In line with this, Asset Management Plans (AMPs) have been introduced by LEAs, giving them a clear and systematic view of the needs of their schools estate, based on surveys of all school buildings. LEAs and schools then prioritise these needs in a rigorous, consultative and transparent way against the formulaic capital support provided to them. This means that most detailed information on how schools capital is invested is held by LEAs and schools.

<P>

<a name="11204w31.html_para1">The rules for movements from farm to farm where the animals stay alive, and pose a higher risk of disease spreading, require the animal to be identified and, in the case of cattle, ear tag numbers to be recorded. The information is vital for effective enforcement of the licensing regime. This requirement was replicated in the movement to slaughter rules introduced on 8 November. But it was quickly realised that the requirement was not always necessary and it was corrected in the revision published on 11 November.

In monitoring and evaluation, the Department is again assisted by external and independent scientific input. Finally, the overall scientific quality of the work of most of our individual contractors&#151;such as our own agencies, the institutes of the Research Councils and the universities&#151;is assisted by independently run science audits or the audits provided through processes such as the DfES Research Assessment Exercise.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effectiveness of the policy of managed retreat in maintaining coastal flood defences during the winter months.  [19543]<P>

<P>
<a name="11204w32.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Managed realignment (occasionally referred to as managed retreat) is one of the options which operating authorities are encouraged to consider when considering long-term options for coastal defence. It is only appropriate in specific circumstances where people or major assets are not at risk. In such circumstances it can have a range of benefits including the achievement of more secure and sustainable defences and the creation of additional areas of inter-tidal habitats. No specific study has been made since only a small number of sites for the implementation of managed realignment has been identified.
<P>

<a name="11204w32.html_para1">The Department has recently approved grant for a major realignment scheme on the Humber where land has been purchased by the Environment Agency to create compensatory inter-tidal habitat for areas that will be lost due to flood defence works elsewhere in the estuary. A series of major studies are continuing to establish the possibility of realignment of defences at other sites in the Humber to relieve the pressures on flood defences that will increase as sea levels rise. Further managed realignment schemes are currently planned for the Wash, Norfolk and in Essex.

<P>
<a name="11204w33.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We have, for a number of years, funded research directly or indirectly related to the welfare of the sow and her piglets, from farrowing to weaning. A key issue which has emerged from this research is that changes in farrowing systems to improve sow welfare can frequently have an adverse effect on the welfare of the piglets. As a result, we are not yet able unreservedly to recommend free-farrowing systems for widespread commercial adoption. Our research, and that of others, continues to seek a solution to this problem. Our aim is to reach a position where it is possible to avoid the close-confinement of all sows.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will announce the national non-domestic rates multiplier for 2002&#150;03; and if he will set out the basis of his calculations of the distributable amount of non-domestic rates for 2002&#150;03.  [20987]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w34.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The non-domestic rate poundage (multiplier) for 2002&#150;03 will be 43.7 pence. The amount of non-domestic rates in England for 2002&#150;03 to be redistributed to local authorities will be &#163;16,626 million, although estimated payments into the pool in 2002&#150;03 will be &#163;15,887 million. The distributable amount includes a surplus brought forward from 2001&#150;02 of &#163;611 million and an allowance of &#163;128 million for an Exchequer payment to the non-domestic rates pool, to compensate for the shortfall which would otherwise occur as a result of the regulations under section 58 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and the transitional relief scheme, announced on 25 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 700.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

For 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 the amounts shown are those recorded in the post end-year (NNDR3) returns. For 2001&#150;02 the amounts shown are the provisional outturn for the year based mainly upon authorities' provisional contributions to the non-domestic rating pool. For 2002&#150;03 the estimates are based on:<P>

1. Item 1: The gross calculated rate yield represents the total value of non-domestic hereditaments on local rating lists times the multiplier.<P>

2. Item 1(i)(a): The Transitional decrease adjustment includes the estimated amount of rates that will not be recouped from local list ratepayers under the transitional arrangements made by regulations under section 58 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and the transitional relief scheme, announced by written parliamentary question on 25 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 770W.<P>

3. Item 1(i)(b): The empty property relief adjustments include voids and partially occupied hereditaments. The 2002&#150;03 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.<P>

4. Item 1(i)(c): Charitable rate relief. The 2002&#150;03 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.<P>

5. Item 1(i)(d): Rural Shops and Post Office relief. Figures include mandatory relief for general stores and post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997. Figures for 2001&#150;02 onwards includes mandatory relief for petrol filing stations and public houses under the Non-Domestic Rating (Public Houses and Petrol Filling Stations) (England) Order 2001 (SI 2001/1345) and mandatory relief for new enterprises on former agricultural premises under the Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001. The 2002&#150;03 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.<P>

6. Item 1(i)(e): Discretionary relief granted to charities, non-profit making organisations and for other reasons including discretionary relief for village shops and post offices under the Local Government and Rating Act 1997. Figures for 2001&#150;02 onwards include discretionary relief for petrol filing stations and public houses under the Non-Domestic Rating (Public Houses and Petrol Filling Stations) (England) Order 2001 (SI 2001/1345) and discretionary relief for new enterprises on former agricultural premises under the Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001. The 2002&#150;03 figure includes an allowance for the increase in the gross rate yield.<P>

7. Item 1(ii)(a) and (b): The allowances for the costs and losses incurred by authorities in collecting non-domestic rates from ratepayers.<P>

8. Item 1(ii)(c): City Offset&#151;the amount which the City of London will not be required to pay into the non-domestic rating pool. It is the amount which will be retained by the City to meet its own expenditure.<P>

9. Item 1(iii): net adjustment in respect of appeals and other amendments to the rating list affecting liability for previous years rates settled in that year.<P>





10. Item 2: the rateable value of non-domestic hereditaments on the central rating list times the multiplier, less the net effect of transitional arrangements, and adjusted for appeals and other changes in respect of previous years.<P>

11. Item 3: the 1999&#150;2000 figures for crown properties include an allowance for the effect of transitional arrangements. For 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 almost all properties included in the crown list in previous years are included in the local list figures at item 1.<P>

12. Item 4: the contribution from central Government to offset the amount of the Secretary of State's estimate of income forgone as a result of transitional arrangements established by regulations under section 58 of the Local Government Finance Act 1988 and the transitional relief scheme, announced by written parliamentary question on 25 November 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 770W.<P>

New primary legislation would be required to introduce such powers. The proposals are in addition to the Government's proposals to introduce mandatory licensing for houses in multiple occupation.

 There are no requirements under the proposed physical agents directives on vibration and noise for businesses to replace existing equipment. It will be for businesses to decide, in the light of the final text of the directives which are still under negotiation, whether they wish or need to replace equipment to help them comply with requirements to limit exposure. In the case of the vibration directive there are long transitional periods before the exposure limitation requirement comes fully into force. The Government have no plans to offer financial support to businesses to comply with the legislation.

These are now being developed in detail and our aim is to conduct a full public consultation in mid-2002 with a view to implementation by means of an Order under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. The aim of the reform would be to simplify, rationalise and consolidate existing legislation, which is currently spread across over 100 different statutes. It would provide for a risk based approach to fire safety allowing more efficient, effective enforcement by the fire service.

<a name="11204w37.html_para0"><i>Letter from Tim Matthews to David Chidgey, dated 4 December 2001:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked by the Transport Minister, David Jamieson, to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the noise barrier programme, the criteria for prioritising resurfacing of concrete roads, and about the condition of the M27 between junctions 7 and 8 and the M3 between Southampton and Winchester.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government recognised in "A New Deal For Trunk Roads in England" published in 1998 that traffic noise was becoming an increasing problem and stated that:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Quieter road surfaces would be specified in all future contracts for new trunk roads;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The most appropriate noise reducing surfaces are used whenever a road needs resurfacing where noise is a particular concern; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A budget would be established for noise mitigation measures to tackle some of the most serious and pressing problems on existing trunk roads.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Traffic noise is therefore being tackled through programmes of quieter surfacing and noise mitigation measures, such as noise barriers. As a matter of policy, we use quieter surfaces whenever a road needs to be resurfaced and as part of the Government's 10 Year Transport Plan, we are tasked with resurfacing at least 60% of trunk roads, including all concrete roads, with quieter materials by 31 March 2011. The criteria to be used in deciding the priorities for resurfacing concrete roads were recently announced by Ministers and are as follows:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That wherever possible the application of quieter surfaces will fit in with normal maintenance needs;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That priority will be given to those sites where treatment would benefit the greatest number of people;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That the works will be carried out in such a way as to minimise disruption to the general public and users of the network;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>That priority will be given to roads, opened since June 1988, where actual noise levels have turned out to be significantly higher than predicted at the time of the Public Inquiry.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Government's proposals for reducing the effects of traffic noise were first set out in Hansard (Column 682 in November 1999). A list of the schemes at these sites that have been completed or are under construction is in Table A attached. The provision of low noise surfacing has an impact on the treatment necessary at these sites. We are still carrying out studies listed in Hansard and until they are completed, I cannot give an indication of the cost or timing of any work identified at the remaining sites. The annual ring fenced budget for noise mitigation measures is &#163;5M and there are currently no plans to review it.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regarding the condition of the M27 and M3, the Agency carries out several different road surveys to determine the condition and residual pavement life of the trunk road network. Measurements are undertaken annually of the road surface condition, including rutting, texture depth and profile. A visual assessment is undertaken every 5 years, together with a deflectograph survey that determines residual pavement life. A skid resistance survey is completed every 3 years. The forward programme of maintenance is identified from a study of the results of all these assessments. Analysis of the results of the latest road condition surveys of the M3 between junction 7 and 8 indicates that, subject to further testing, the section near Winchester may be due for major maintenance, which would include the use of a low noise surface, in about 2004&#150;05. The condition of the M27 between Southampton and Winchester currently indicates that maintenance would not be required within the next 5 years.</FONT></UL>

 All of the factors referred to in the question are reflected to some extent in the current Standard Spending Assessment formulae, which are used to allocate between councils the resources made available by the spending review. We are currently reviewing those formulae and have announced our intention to implement changes to take effect in 2003&#150;04. My right hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what methodology was used by Rough Sleepers' Unit and its predecessor to count the number of people sleeping rough on any single night since 1997; and if he will make a statement regarding the reasons for changes in the methodology used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11204w38.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The methodology used by the Rough Sleepers Unit to count the number of people sleeping rough on any single night was developed in the early 1990s by the Department, in partnership with the voluntary sector. The methodology used for producing a national estimate was set out in an answer given by my right hon. Friend the then Minister for Local Government and the Regions on 19 May 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 355&#150;62W and has been tested and developed through independent research and remains unchanged. The same methodology has been used nationally for over five years, and since the early 1990s in London.
<P>

<a name="11204w38.html_para0">Counts are conducted by voluntary sector homelessness agencies, working with local authorities and independent volunteers. The results are finalised and submitted by these agencies to the Rough Sleepers Unit. The methodology for counts is adhered to strictly and consistently.

 Under the Government's current strategy on rough sleeping, the Rough Sleepers Unit provides funding for a number of agencies who provide permanent and temporary accommodation. The Unit also funds a number of agencies to provide outreach workers and Contact and Assessment Teams who help rough sleepers into accommodation and other services. Staff from the Unit do not routinely refer rough sleepers into accommodation. However, they do from time to time liaise with agencies to ensure that any vulnerable rough sleepers they encounter during street work are helped into appropriate accommodation and support.

The total number of referrals from the streets for those 1,679 individuals was 2,485. These referrals were to the following types of accommodation:
