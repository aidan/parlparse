 PSNI appreciates the impact on families when loved ones are reported missing, and is committed to tracing such persons. Training is given at student officer level, in detective training, and in critical incident training for senior officers. The PSNI website includes pictures and details of those missing and links to support organisations. PSNI also works with the &#145;Missing Kids&#146; initiative&#151;a partnership between police services, the Police National Missing Persons Bureau and an international charity.</p>

 I am advised that since the PSNI was established in 2001 and recruiting was outsourced, educational qualifications have not been routinely requested or supplied. This is consistent with national recruitment policy. It is, therefore, not possible to accurately state how many officers are in possession of a primary degree or equivalent as this information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what percentage of the Government's renewable transport fuels obligation will come from exported sources by 2010; and what estimate she has made of the percentage of these fuels which will come from sustainable sources. [169937]</p>

 The renewable transport fuel obligation (RTFO) will create a demand for some 2.5 billion litres per annum of biofuel by 2010-11. This demand is likely to be met through a mixture of domestically produced and imported biofuels. The Government does not have a precise estimate of the likely split between the two. In theory, and provided a number of large UK biofuel production plants which are currently at the planning stage come on stream by 2010, UK farmers and producers could produce enough biofuel to meet this demand in full. Whether or not they do depends on a wide range of factors including the relative costs of UK-produced and imported biofuels.</p>

This will create an incentive on suppliers to source only those biofuels which deliver genuine environmental benefits.</p>

We have supported the simple claim form arrangements with computer scans run by The Pension Service to discover people getting pension credit but not CTB and this information is passed to local authorities. We encourage local authorities to do take-up activity through our performance standards and have awarded &#163;2.2 million to 38 authorities to increase CTB take-up.</p>

 The recent review of the fire safety aspects in Part B of the Building Regulations considered fire safety in all types of premises and the important role that sprinklers and other types of fire protection measures may have. A number of changes were made, following extensive research and full public consultation. These changes came into force in April this year and were supported by a Regulatory Impact Assessment setting out the costs and benefits of the changes.</p>

The amended Part B gives greater recognition to the role of sprinklers for life safety and the accompanying guidance has been expanded, where justified, to include their use in a wider range of situations. These include in tall (30 m+) blocks of flats, certain care homes and in large single storey storage buildings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"><a name="71205w0007.htm_para14"><a name="07120568000044">In addition, the Regulatory Reform (Fire Safety) Order 2005, which applies to both new and existing non-domestic buildings, requires that the responsible person for a premises carry out a risk assessment and take necessary fire precautions to ensure the safety of the occupants of the building. This could include the provision of sprinklers, where it is justified by the risk. It is also open for property owners and their insurers to consider the benefits of sprinklers for property protection and business continuity.</p>

 As a result of the tragic events of 2 November at Atherstone on Stour in Warwickshire, three key investigations have been initiated. Firstly, the police are conducting an investigation in conjunction with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Secondly, the fire and rescue service are examining the origin, causes and spread of the fire. Thirdly, there is currently a fire and rescue service accident investigation into the implications of the fire. The chief fire and rescue adviser, Sir Ken Knight, is in close contact with the ongoing investigations and is keeping me informed at all times. In addition to these investigations, there will be a coroner&#146;s inquest which, as part of its investigation, will examine the evidence submitted by the investigation teams.

1. Information sourced from local authority claims for housing revenue account subsidy and housing benefit subsidy.<br>
2. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;100,000.<br>
3. Figures prior to 2006-07 are audited, but may change in future if local authorities' audited accounts are amended after a decision or appeal. Figures for recent years are more likely to be amended than older data.<br>
4. 2006-07 figures are initial final (pre-audited) and are subject to change.<br>
5. From 1999-2000 onwards, housing benefit expenditure on asylum seekers was funded by the National Asylum Support Service, and is therefore excluded from the figures presented at Great Britain. However, local authority level information includes all expenditure on these benefits relating to asylum seekers, as it is not possible to isolate at this level that part which applies to asylum seekers.<br>
6. Figures relate to what local authorities spend on claimants, and include discretionary expenditure (mainly disregards of war pensions), and overpayments except where benefit has been granted in advance (where the benefit is paid in the form of a rebate).<br>

<i> [holding answer 4 December 2007]:</i> We expect all local authorities to have plans and procedures in place to tackle emergency repairs and homelessness, and indications are that these have worked well in the aftermath of the summer floods. Government officials and homelessness specialist advisors have been in contact with some of the affected areas, to offer support for local authorities as they help their local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_467"><a name="71205w0010.htm_para0"><a name="07120568000438">At a national level, the Government are making sure that local authorities and other agencies are supported to help householders, business and communities get back to normal as far as possible without unnecessary delays. To date we have made available a comprehensive package of up to &#163;63 million to assist the affected regions, including up to &#163;20 million in flood recovery grant from Communities and Local Government to support the recovery work of local authorities, and particularly their work with those in greatest and most immediate need. Local authorities have the flexibility to decide how to best to use the grant based on their own local circumstances. In practice, this has covered a wide range of action, including support payments to flood affected households, and provision of temporary caravans to allow people to remain within their communities while houses are repaired.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_468"><a name="71205w0010.htm_para1"><a name="07120568000439">Flood affected local authorities have also been able apply to Communities and Local Government for help through the Bellwin scheme which provides financial assistance to local authorities dealing with emergencies. Exceptionally, the terms of the present schemes, have been made more generous because of the circumstances of the recent floods. 50 local authorities have registered for assistance for the June scheme and 52 have registered for the July scheme. 20 local authorities have registered for both schemes. Authorities have six months to spend under this scheme and two have now submitted interim claims.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_469"><a name="71205w0010.htm_para2"><a name="07120568000440">The Government continues to work closely with the Association of British Insurers (ABI) to establish how the insurance industry is dealing with policy holders who have been hit by the floods. The ABI has made clear the insurance industry's commitment to maintaining momentum over coming months in dealing with outstanding claims. However, it will still take time for some properties to dry out before the necessary repairs can be carried out, and this means that some people will not be back in their homes until next year.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 December 2007]:</i> CLG Ministers, including the Secretary of State, have made a series of visits to those areas worst affected by the summer floods, including those areas where people remain displaced from their homes.

 The Government are committed to addressing overcrowding and we are considering updating the standards. However, we do not believe this in itself will solve overcrowding without having the means in place to help overcrowded families and we are considering how we can most effectively address the problem. We have already announced an increase in the provision of new social housing. We have also invested over &#163;35 million in London pilot schemes in the period 2006-08 to provide innovative solutions to some of the worst cases of overcrowding and will be looking carefully at the lessons learned from these.</p>

 Assessments of brown crab stocks are made by Government scientists at The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science. Stocks are managed at both national and Sea Fisheries Committee level. Stocks appear to be stable at the moment but most brown crab grounds available to fisheries are known and fully utilised. The stocks are assessed in six &#147;stock management units&#148; defined as sea areas in England and Wales. Major crab fisheries exist in the Central North Sea, Southern North Sea, and Western Channel, while smaller crab fisheries exist in the Eastern Channel, Celtic Sea, and Irish Sea. Most crab fisheries tend to be heavily exploited and it would be inadvisable for fishing effort to increase beyond current levels. Females predominate in landings but there is no evidence of reduced levels of recruitment.</p>

 Provided that the science clearly justifies them, DEFRA supports the concept of Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) closed to fishing, both for sustainable management of fish stocks and for ecological reasons relating to species and habitats. The usefulness of protected areas as a fisheries conservation measure has to be evaluated in each individual case taking into account factors such as the biology of the stocks, character of the fishery, and other fisheries management measures already in place. It is recognised that there may be displacement of fishing effort from protected areas and these effects must also be managed.  <br>

 Conservation of lobster stocks is achieved currently through a restrictive national shellfish licensing scheme which limits the number of vessels allowed to participate in the fishery. There are also local Sea Fisheries Committee (SFC) permit schemes, an EU minimum landing size, a national prohibition on the landing of v-notched or mutilated lobsters. A range of measures are also applied through SFCs, such as higher local minimum landing sizes, a prohibition on the landing of egg bearing (berried) female lobsters, the release of hatchery-reared juvenile lobsters into the wild, and escape gaps to allow undersized lobsters a route out of lobster pots.</p>

 Lobster fisheries are assessed by Government scientists at The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science and by some Sea Fisheries Committees. The fisheries are predominantly inshore, and known grounds are fully utilised. Assessments show that, while catch rates are stable or increasing and recruitment has recently been good, the stocks are heavily exploited tending towards overfishing.

 I am not aware of any group called the Marine Biodiversity Liaison Group. However, DEFRA has set up a Marine Biodiversity Stakeholder Group which provides a forum for discussion between DEFRA and its stakeholders. The group&#146;s purpose is to provide governmental and non-governmental stakeholders with periodic updates of progress on marine biodiversity policy; all present are given the opportunity to ask questions and contribute to policy development.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_536"><a name="71205w0016.htm_para0"><a name="07120574000193">Membership of the group is broad and flexible and includes representatives from: Government, the devolved administrations, Government agencies, non-government organisations (for example, the Wildlife Trusts), academic organisations (for example, the Marine Biological Association), marine industry sectors (such as the British Ports Association) and marine recreational sectors (for example the Royal Yachting Association).</p>

 The Government consider that where there is a need for wildlife management then the proper use of snares is one of a range of control methods. Used according to best practice, snares can be an effective and practical means of wildlife management and are needed where other forms of pest control are ineffective or impractical.</p>

The DEFRA Code of Good Practice details the legal obligations for people using snares in England and emphasises the importance of weighing the possible risks to the welfare of wildlife against the need to capture pest animals. People choosing to use snares should be aware not only of their responsibilities under the law but also of these guidelines for good practice.</p>

 Jobseeker&#146;s allowance (JSA) regulations, which govern the payment of JSA, state that to receive JSA the jobseeker must be in Great Britain. Therefore when a jobseeker goes abroad on holiday JSA is not payable, nor credit of national insurance contributions awarded, for the period they are away.</p>

This needs to be agreed in advance with the Jobcentre before the holiday commences. There is no limit to the number of weeks a jobseeker can be away from home but usually if the holiday exceeds four weeks the Jobcentre would advise the jobseeker to make a claim in the area they are staying in.</p>

Agreement on police restructuring is a key condition for the conclusion of a Stabilisation and Association Agreement with the EU. The politicisation of the police reform issue has obstructed the work of the Directorate for Police Restructuring and thus far prevented agreement on a way forward. The UK remains closely involved in trying to facilitate cross party political agreement.

Homosexuality is illegal by law and the death penalty remains on the books for consenting same sex relations, but we are not aware of any executions for this in recent years.

 As required by the code, the Government conducted a 12 week consultation on their proposals for the Post Office network which considered the principle of whether there should be post office closures and new outreach services. Post Office Ltd.&#146;s six week local public consultations on its area plans are on how changes are to be implemented at the local level. Before these local public consultations begin, Post Office Ltd. seeks detailed input from Postwatch, local authorities and sub-postmasters in developing its proposals. I understand that Post Office Ltd. takes the view that the combination of the pre-consultation phase and the subsequent six week of local public consultation period enables sufficiently robust consultations to take place at a local area level. I also understand from the company that the level of response to those local consultations which have now closed has been high.</p>

 The Government decided that the consultation period for post office closures would be six weeks as set out in their response to the national public consultation on the post office network. The early stages of developing Post Office Ltd.&#146;s area plan proposals post office closures and new outreach service involve detailed plan development discussions with Postwatch and the involvement of local authorities in advance of formal public consultation. When combined with the subsequent six weeks of public consultation, the Government believe that this enables sufficiently robust consultations to take place at a local area level. We are also mindful of the fact that the organisation representing sub-postmasters argued for a speedy local consultation to minimise uncertainty for sub-postmasters and customers.</p>

 The European Community first applied to become a member of the WCO in 2001 because it has competence for most international trade matters. The WCO's establishing convention does not currently provide for customs and economic unions to become members and will need to be modified. This will take some time, so interim membership arrangements have been put in place and came into effect for the EC on 1 July 2007.</p>

For matters falling under joint or national competence, member states will continue to speak at meetings and to vote: the EC will not act on behalf of member states on these matters. However, member states and the European Commission will try to coordinate an agreed position where appropriate in order to present a unified view at WCO meetings.</p>
