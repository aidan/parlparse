 The Alcohol, Entertainment and Late Night Refreshment Licensing Statistical Bulletin collects the number of licences revoked, but does not indicate why or the type of premises involved. Licences may be revoked following a review by the licensing authority for a number of reasons, including persistent selling of alcohol to children. However, the persistent sale of alcohol to children is a specific criminal offence under section 147A of the Licensing Act 2003.</p>

The number of such suspensions under section 169A between April 2008 and March 2009 was 54, based on replies from 97 per cent. of licensing authorities. However, where the holder of a premises licence is convicted by a court of an offence under section 147A (in respect of the sale or supply of alcohol, following an offence of persistently selling to underage children) to which the licence relates, the court may order that the licence, so far as it authorises the sale by retail of alcohol, be suspended for a period not exceeding three months.</p>

According to a recent UN report, the weekly total of truckloads of goods entering Gaza through Israeli checkpoints for the week of 10-16 January 2010 was 534. This constitutes less than 23 per cent. of the average number of truckloads entering Gaza per week pre-2007. We are unable to establish the total number of truckloads actually attempting to enter Gaza, but it is clear that imported truckloads remain below needs. We continue to press the Israeli authorities to lessen restrictions on access into Gaza and allow the legitimate passage of humanitarian aid, reconstruction materials, trade goods, and people.</p>

 We have serious concerns about the Israeli restrictions on Gaza and the impact they have on the lives of Gazans. Although there is no permanent physical Israeli presence in Gaza, given the significant control that Israel has over Gaza's borders, airspace and territorial waters, Israel retains obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention as an occupying power. The Fourth Geneva Convention is clear that an occupying power must co-operate in allowing the passage and distribution of relief consignments. The restrictions currently imposed on the passage of relief supplies are, as we see it, a disproportionate response to the security threat.</p>

 Substitute service family accommodation (SSFA) and substitute service single accommodation (SSSA) are only ever used as a last resort in cases where service accommodation either does not exist or is not available.

 Central records of statutory instruments made under specific powers have only been maintained by the statutory instruments registrar since 2001. A record has been maintained since that time of statutory instruments made under powers in the European Communities Act 1972, but no record has been maintained of statutory instruments made under other legislation in order to meet obligations arising from EU law. It would be disproportionately costly to seek to find out now what statutory instruments have been made under such other legislation. There are no central records maintained of "other regulations". Since 2001 my department has made 39 statutory instruments (including one for which the Privy Council Office was technically responsible) under powers contained in the European Communities Act 1972. A list of those instruments is set out in the following table</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 January 2010]:</i> This Department's White paper 'Building Britain's Recovery: Achieving Full Employment' sets out our plans for a review of the support we offer to people with a health condition or disability regardless of which benefits they are claiming, including Jobseeker's Allowance customers who are managing health conditions or disabilities whilst actively looking for work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_525"><a name="100120w0009.htm_para2"><a name="10012077000835">We will build on the existing Jobseeker's Allowance regime, which already provides advisers with the flexibility to offer customers a tailor-made and personalised approach to look for work appropriate to a person's health condition, alongside our more specialist disability employment programmes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_526"><a name="100120w0009.htm_para3"><a name="10012077000836">We will be consulting with interested stakeholders and delivery partners over the coming weeks and will publish our proposals for future support for all customers with a health condition or disability, including when we expect these to be introduced, in the spring.</p>

 My right hon. Friend Andy Burnham, Secretary of State for Health fully supports the 10:10 campaign, and the Department has reduced its carbon emissions by over 17 per cent. since 1999-2000. We are working closely with the Carbon Trust to identify measures that will further improve our performance. The Department has recently issued 2010-11 business planning guidance to its arm's length bodies (ALBs), requiring them to produce climate change plans, and we will encourage them to do this during 2010-11.</p>

This is part of our safeguards to protect staff and ensure that its systems are not used in ways that risk breaking the law, damaging the Department's reputation, causing offence to colleagues or people outside the Department or disruption to IT systems. It makes clear the types of websites that are deemed unacceptable such as on-line gambling, operating a personal or freelance business, selling items on internet auction sites (i.e. E-Bay), or participating in political activities. This policy is promoted to all staff and a commercial tool is used to enforce this policy and uses categories to control access to websites.

Patients may qualify for an NHS sight test on more than one criterion. However, they would only be recorded against one criterion on the form. Patients are more likely to be recorded according to their clinical need rather than their age. For example, a patient aged over 60, with glaucoma is likely to be recorded in the glaucoma category only. The count by eligibility is therefore approximate. Patients may also have had more than one sight test in the specified time period.</p>

 1. Central Lancashire PCT serves a number of constituencies-it is not possible to disaggregate the amount spent specifically in Preston from the figures.<br>
 2. The figures are taken from the audited summarisation schedules of Central Lancashire PCT and its predecessor organisations.<br>
 3. The figures represent the total primary, secondary and other health care purchased and provided for the PCT's resident population, with the exception of primary dental and general ophthalmic services since these costs are not directly attributed to PCTs on the basis of a patient's place of residence.<br>
 4. "Other health care" as defined in the audited summarisation schedules is taken to include expenditure for national health service trust impairments, plus grants to other bodies for health related capital projects under joint working arrangements.<br>
 5. Central Lancashire PCT was formed as part of the reconfiguration of PCTs in October 2006, following the merger of Preston PCT, Chorley and South Ribble PCT and part of West Lancashire PCT.<br>
 6. The figures provided for 2002-03 to 2005-06 are the sum of these three PCTs.<br>

1. The programme budgeting data collection is complex, therefore expenditure figures are best estimates rather than precise measurements. Year on year comparisons are not straightforward due to annual refinements to the data collection methodology and changes to underlying data sources.<br>
 2. Subcategory level data tend to be less robust than main category data as they are smaller categories and are therefore subject to greater variation.<br>
3. Figures include expenditure across all sectors. Disease specific expenditure do not include expenditure on prevention, or general practitioner expenditure, but do include prescribing expenditure.<br>

1. The data provided in the response have been compiled from the monthly and quarterly in-patient and out-patient waiting list information. These data are used to assess delivery against the standards for a 13-maximum wait for a first outpatient appointment and for a 26-week maximum wait for in-patient admission from the decision to admit which came into effect in December 2005. These data have been used for this answer rather than 18 weeks referral to treatment (RTT) data, because in-patient waiting time data are available for longer historical time series than RTT data.<br>
2. The median waiting time reflects the amount of time that the 'middle' patient treated has waited. The median rather than the mean is used as it is less prone to fluctuations caused by extreme values, and reflects the experience of the average (middle) person.<br>

However, physical changes to the property or its locality, which would have a material effect on the rental value of the property, can be taken into account.</p>

 The nature, extent and frequency of any non-domestic use within a home will determine whether the homeworking is merely de minimis in the context of the dwelling, or whether the use is of sufficient scale and intensity as to warrant a separate rateable value.

 The effect of the Court of Appeal's judgment in the Waste Recycling Group case was to reduce the revenue yield from landfill tax and render certain waste materials non-taxable, even though they have a detrimental environmental impact. We estimate that around £300 million will be repaid on related claims for periods before 1 September 2009. The Exchequer could also have lost as much as £60 million this financial year and a further £140 million for each subsequent year, if the Government had not made the legislative changes to the landfill tax introduced on 1 September 2009. These changes brought uses of waste materials covered by the Court of Appeal judgment back within the scope of the tax.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV-for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220<br>

 The prediction of sea level rise is at the forefront of scientific research. While prediction of the component from thermal expansion of the ocean is well understood, the contribution from polar ice sheets represents a major source of uncertainty, resulting in a wide range of projections of sea level rise.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_618"><a name="100120w0019.htm_para0"><a name="10012097000265">The IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (2007) estimated that the contribution to globally averaged sea level rise by the end of the century from thermal expansion would be in the range 18 to 59 cm, with up to a further 10 to 20 cm coming from the melting of ice sheets, but that higher values could not be excluded. Since then the literature has suggested that values for the total globally averaged sea level rise are more likely to be in the range 60 to 100 cm, with some papers estimating values as high as 200 cm, although these are thought to be highly unlikely.</p>
