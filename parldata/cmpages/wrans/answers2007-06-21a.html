The Commission recognises, however, that many who work on the estate are unavoidably present for long periods, particularly when the House is sitting. It is therefore desirable to make reasonable provision for those who wish to smoke to do so, provided that the health and safety of other users of the estate is not adversely affected.</p>

From that date smoking will, however, be permitted in four designated external areas: the Terrace, Commons Court (North West corner), North Terrace (between Portcullis House and Norman Shaw South), and in a designated area on the west side of Canon Row courtyard. Cigarette receptacles will be provided in these areas. &#147;No Smoking&#148; signs will be displayed at entrances to the buildings.</p>

 DFID employs both UK-based civil servants and staff engaged overseas on local terms and conditions of service. I have provided a breakdown of the data for the categories requested for both amalgamated groups in the following tables. Table 1 shows all contracts awarded during the years 2004-06, inclusive, broken down by gender. Table 2 shows the same breakdown across the categories for those in the over 55 age range. During the same period seven staff with registered disabilities were awarded contracts. (One temporary, six permanent&#151;of which one was part-time).</p>

 It is for national governments to decide their own policies in relation to user fees in health. However, because of our own UK experience and that of developing countries, DFID is committed to helping countries that want to remove charges at the point of delivery. The recent White Paper commits DFID to help partner governments abolish user fees for basic health services and help them tackle other barriers to access, including discrimination against women.</p>

China is formulating a major health policy to address inequity in the health system, of which free primary health care for all is likely to be an important feature.

The Government of Mozambique has already made a public commitment to look at the case for removing fees, at least for primary health care. DFID is now working closely with the Government of Mozambique to consider the practical implications of removing the remaining user fees. This includes: studying the expected implications for demand; considering how systems will need to be reinforced to support the change; and preventing illegal charging. If the Government of Mozambique makes a decision to abolish more fees, DFID will support this, including through our continued financial support to the sector.  <br>

In other cases, the Department&#146;s practice is normally to seek the repayment of the monies which have been misappropriated.</p>

 We have no records of any compensation payments made to pupils by the Department in the period since 1997.

The amount paid was &#163;2,001. This answer has been provided on the assumption that it relates to payments to serving teachers.

 The Department is implementing the &#145;Every Child a Reader&#146; (ECAR) programme. We are in the third year of a three-year pilot which is helping over 5,000 six-year-olds with significant literacy difficulties to learn to read. It does this by placing highly skilled reading recovery teachers in schools to provide intensive one-to-one or small group support to children most in need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="70621w0007.htm_para8"><a name="07062171000376">As a result, we have announced that ECAR will be rolled out nationally from 2008-09, benefiting 30,000 children a year by 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="70621w0007.htm_para9"><a name="07062171000377">In mathematics, intervention &#145;Springboard materials&#146; have been used for a number of years to support those children who have been identified as working just below age-related expectations and who, with support, might catch-up with their peers. Although they are more often used in group work, they can be used on a one-to-one basis. Wave three intervention materials have more often been used for individuals as well as small groups. Both these materials offer teachers a tracking chart to audit the child's attainment and to identify where to pitch the support.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="70621w0007.htm_para10"><a name="07062171000378">The Department is also currently providing funding for reading mentors. We provide funding to Volunteer Reading Help (VRH); a charitable organisation which recruits, trains and places volunteers to give one-to-one help twice a week to children aged 6 to 11-years who find reading a challenge. Currently VRH has around 2,000 volunteer readers working with around 5,000 children.</p>

 We do not classify foundation degrees as public or private sector because students are recorded according to subjects studied and many courses would apply to the public, private and third sectors. Foundation degrees graduates are, however, well-represented in education, and subjects allied to medicine (which together amount to around 35 per cent. of all FD graduates) where the employment opportunities are largely in the public sector, and around a third of all FD courses currently running are in the areas of education, health and care, community or public services.</p>

Employers can be involved in the design, delivery and regular review of programmes. It is also expected that there will be recognition from employer bodies such as sector skills councils and professional bodies as well as close collaboration between employer and provider institutions&#151;to ensure foundation degrees are responsive to meeting the nation's skill needs.</p>

Features of successful services reflected the &#147;Best practice guidance on the provision of effective contraception and advice services for young people&#148; issued by the Teenage Pregnancy Unit in 2000: easy accessibility in the right location with opening hours convenient to young people; provision of the full range of contraceptive methods, including long acting methods; a strong focus on sexual health promotion (as well as reactive services) through, for example, outreach work in schools, work with professionals to improve their ability to engage with young people on sexual health issues; and through highly visible publicity. Effective services also had a strong focus on meeting the specific needs of young men. All high-performing areas also had condom distribution schemes involving a wide range of local agencies and/or access to emergency contraception in non-clinical settings.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. Information presented here has been derived from an extract of the National Pupil Database which has selected pupils with multiple cases of permanent exclusion from different schools collected via the 2002 through to 2006 School Census&#146;. The characteristic data shown relates to information provided for the pupils' most recent exclusion.<br>
2. A new set of codes to record the ethnicity of pupils was introduced in 2002. Schools were initially permitted to report ethnic data using either the old and new set of codes between which there is no direct mapping. This analysis separately shows data for those pupils whose ethnic group has been classified under the old coding framework.<br>
 3. The new SEN code of practice came into force in 2002 and introduced new codes for recording stage of SEN. Both the new and old codes have been used here.<br>
4. Numbers have been rounded to the nearest 10. There may be discrepancies between the sum of constituent items and totals as shown.<br>

1. The revenue funding per pupil figures only run to 2005-06 because the Department cannot provide a consistent time series beyond that year as the introduction of the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how Local Authorities are funded. The 1998-99 to 2005-06 figures are based on Education Formula Spending (EPS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. In 2006-07 funding for schools changed with the introduction of the DSG which is based largely on an authority's previous spending.<br>
2. In addition, DSG has a different coverage to EFS: EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block.

This means that there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable, an alternative time series is currently under development.<br>
3. To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department have isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06; as described above this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year. There are other grants that support the schools budget, these are not included in the provided DSG figures.<br>

 Under section 114 of the Learning and Skills Act 2000, the Secretary of State has the power to provide or secure the provision of services which he thinks will encourage, enable or assist (directly or indirectly) effective participation by young people in education or training. This power is discharged through the Connexions service who provide careers advice (among a wider range of services designed to improve levels of participation in education and training) to young people aged 13 to 19.</p>

 Mentors can be used to offer specific support in mathematics as well as offering a wider role in supporting children as learners across a range of subjects. Support of a one-to-one type is more often undertaken by a teaching assistant who, working with the teacher, would identify the specific learning needs of the child.

 On 14 June 157 employers made the Skills Pledge, which was launched by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and Sir Digby Jones, the UK Skills Envoy. Thus far more than 1.7 million employees, of which around 1.1 million are public sector and over a 1,000 from the third sector, are covered by the commitment of these employers.</p>

We expect that for some companies the gap may translate into higher level skills, as well as supporting those employees to gain basics skills, such as literacy and numeracy. All of these companies have access to the advice and guidance of independent skills brokers, should they need one.

 Under single market rules, goods from other EU countries must be allowed to circulate freely. Products accepted for sale in one member state cannot be banned from sale in any other member states, except on safety grounds. How Trading Standards undertake market surveillance with regard to the safety legislation they enforce is a matter for them. I understand Trading Standards liaises with HM Revenue and Customs on furniture imports as appropriate, and that this has resulted in furniture being detained and convictions obtained for non-compliance with the Furniture and Furnishings (Fire) (Safety) Regulations 1988 (FFRs). They also act on tip-offs regarding unsafe furniture being sold door-to-door, at boot sales or at the side of the road, and make routine checks of furniture in retail outlets. In the period 1 April 2003-31 May 2007 there were 48 convictions for furniture not complying with the FFRs. This figure is from the Office of Fair Trading who stress it is based on returns received and that the actual figure is likely to be somewhat higher.</p>

Officials from the UK Mission to the IAEA in Vienna have met several times with the agency&#146;s personnel division to discuss their recruitment practices. The IAEA&#146;s personnel systems, including their recruitment section, are subject to oversight by the agency&#146;s external auditors, the latter are appointed by members of the IAEA board of governors of which the UK is a permanent member. In addition the IAEA division of management publishes a biennial report on human resource management, which is issued to IAEA member states. The Government believe this is an acceptable level of scrutiny for such an organisation and are therefore satisfied that the recruitment policy of the IAEA is fair and transparent.</p>

 We share the view of the Commission and most other member states, that it would be too difficult and costly for organic producers to apply a GM threshold significantly lower than 0.9 per cent. It would imply, for example, that the organic supply chain would need to undertake widespread testing where products were liable to have an unintended GM presence. Such testing is expensive and time-consuming. During discussions, organic stakeholder groups indicated that they did not favour including a threshold below 0.9 per cent. in the EU organic production regulation.</p>

 The Government spent about &#163;0.5 million on research and development (R&amp;D) on deep geological disposal of radioactive waste between April 1997 and November 2006. We have not spent on R&amp;D in this area since then. However, the main expenditure on deep geological disposal R&amp;D during these periods has been by United Kingdom Nirex Limited (Nirex). The Government owned Nirex from April 2005 until November 2006, when it became part of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). This is funded by Government through the Department of Trade and Industry and, partially, through its commercial activities. During the period of Government ownership of Nirex, the company was largely funded by the NDA, with a small additional percentage coming from the Ministry of Defence (MOD).</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what progress he has made on amending the performance indicator applicable to local councils in respect of recycling levels to reflect performance in terms of waste minimisation. [141320]</p>

 The recently published Waste Strategy 2007 put forward a range of measures to reduce waste arisings and build on recent improvements in recycling. A greater focus on waste prevention has been recognised through a new target to reduce the amount of household waste not re-used, recycled or composted, from over 22.2 million tonnes in 2000 by 29 per cent. to 15.8 million tonnes in 2010, with an aspiration to reduce it to 12.2 million tonnes in 2020&#151;a reduction of 45 per cent. This is equivalent to a fall of 50 per cent. per person (from 450 kg per person in 2000 to 225 kg in 2020).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_444"><a name="70621w0032.htm_para5"><a name="07062222002021">Waste minimisation is not directly measured by any of the Best Value Performance Indicators (BVPI). However, it is reflected in BVPI 84a, which measures kilograms of household waste collected per head of population. In addition, household waste sent for reuse, including items such as furniture delivered to civic amenity sites, would be excluded from the calculation of BVPI 82.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"><a name="70621w0032.htm_para6"><a name="07062222002022">In October 2006, the Government published the local government White Paper, &#147;Strong and Prosperous Communities&#148;. This set out a new vision for delivering better public services through a rebalancing of the relationship between central Government, local government and local people. Local public service providers will be given more freedom to bring about the changes they want to see. The White Paper sets out a radical simplification of the local authority performance framework including fewer indicators and centrally set targets. This means that 2007-08 will be the final year of best value indicators and targets.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_446"><a name="70621w0032.htm_para7"><a name="07062222002023">Indicators in the new framework will reflect national outcomes, to be agreed later this year in the comprehensive spending review 2007, which will be delivered through local area agreements. The future framework will enable local authorities to contribute to an overall waste outcome that leads us towards more sustainable management of waste in England, focused on minimising the amounts of municipal waste produced and landfilled.</p>

 Since the UK and the anti-whaling bloc had a simple majority at this year&#146;s meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), we were able to sponsor and secure several key resolutions: calling on Japan to halt its lethal &#147;scientific&#148; research programme; promoting the non-lethal use of cetaceans; and reaffirming the continued need for the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling. This last resolution subsequently served us well in the Conference of Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, enabling us to defeat proposals aimed at eventually allowing trade in whale products to take place.</p>

As this matter is currently before the courts, it would not be appropriate to say more than that we believe we have acted entirely appropriately and within our powers, and will contest vigorously the remaining elements of Shrewsbury and Congleton&#146;s claim.</p>

 No formal assessment has yet been made, but it is likely that the proposals would require significant additional changes to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency&#146;s (DVLA&#146;s) IT systems and processes.

A significant proportion of the prisons budget is spent on infrastructure and staffing&#151;essential to keep prisons safe and to protect the public. It is however, better to compare expenditure on drug treatment against actual treatment need. With funding levels up 997 per cent. since 1996-97 and overall numbers engaged in prison treatment increasing year on year, prisons are doing much to close the treatment gap. The calculations are based on additional drug treatment funding allocated as a result of successive spending reviews. The figure approximates to &#163;7 million but it is not possible to breakdown between various treatment types. The pre-CSR baseline has therefore been excluded from the calculations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_516"><a name="70621w0039.htm_para19"><a name="07062227000905">So far as IDTS is concerned, the Department of Health and NOMS have had to make challenging decisions in reviewing the totality of budgets in recent years. Current levels of funding are down significantly on planned expenditure.</p>

Historically, local assessment and epidemiological studies have informed treatment delivery across the prison estate. Work is already underway on a needs analysis model but, ahead of its data being available later this year, NOMS already anticipates there being a significant treatment gap. For example, to identify offenders&#146; drug needs effectively, the CARAT service would need to undertake substance-misuse triage assessments for up to 80 per cent. of the annual prison through-put; based on 136,000 offenders passing through custody, this would be around 108,000 offenders.

 The Prison Service has already implemented measures designed to maximise the use of the whole prison estate.

Each individual is subject to a streamlined risk assessment in order to determine whether they are suitable for transfer.</p>

 Not all Probation Areas in the National Probation Service operate a set establishment against which vacant posts can be measured. As a more representative alternative, Probation Areas are required to report regularly on the number of active vacancies they have. An active vacancy is one which a Probation Area is actively trying to fill through a recruitment process.</p>

 Any person who believes they have been the victim of a miscarriage of justice can apply to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) for a review of their case. The CCRC has the power to review possible miscarriages of justice in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, to gain access to documents and other material which may be relevant to its investigations, and to refer to the appropriate court any case in which there is a real possibility that the conviction will not be upheld. Unless, however, there are exceptional circumstances, the CCRC is not empowered to refer cases until the court appeal system has been exhausted.

The data cannot identify the cost of any PDS services that are directly managed by local NHS trusts, such as certain dental access centres.  <sup>(3)</sup> In the immediate aftermath of dental practices converting from GDS to PDS pilots, there can be a period of overlapping expenditure as time lags in submitting GDS treatment claims can mean that clearance of GDS arrears coincides with the start of regular PDS payments.  <sup>(4)</sup> Payments to dental practices are assigned to areas on the basis of practice postcode data. The practices themselves may draw patients from a wider catchment area.  <sup>(5)</sup> Net payments represent the balance of payments due after taking account of NHS dental charge income collected from patients by dental practices.  <i> Source:</i>  The Information Centre for health and social care and the NHS Business Services Authority.<br>

 We are committed to preventing as many cases of diabetes as possible. Obesity is one of the major causes of type 2 diabetes and tackling obesity, working through national and local partnerships, is a key departmental objective. The Government have a public service agreement (PSA) target, which is jointly owned by three Government Departments, to halt the year-on-year rise in obesity among children aged under 11 by 2010&#151;in the context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole. As childhood obesity often tracks into adulthood, the PSA-owning departments are working to support families to eat more healthily and be more active.</p>

1. On 1 October Sussex Downs and Weald PCT was formed from a complete merger of Eastbourne Downs and Sussex Downs and Weald PCTs. 2006 figures are as at 1 October 2006. 2002-05 figures are an aggregate of the two predecessor organisations.<br>
2. More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total work force figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years&#146; figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated, the level of inflation in earlier years&#146; figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.<br>

 The national health service provides optical vouchers for children and other eligible groups who, following a sight test, have been given a prescription to correct a defect in sight. Optical vouchers can be used to purchase glasses or contact lenses. Parents of children with reading difficulties are encouraged to have an NHS-funded sight test to check that there are no refractive problems or eye disease which may be contributing to the difficulties.</p>

The best interests of children are likely to be served by a scheme of assessment and treatment, which takes into account the full range of possible ways of helping children with the symptoms associated with descriptions of Irlen syndrome. This is something that local education and health authorities should take forward in view of their responsibilities for services in their areas.</p>

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>
2. The table includes deduction from earnings orders (DEOs) and deduction from earnings requests (DERs). DERs are the equivalent of DEOs when a non-resident parent is a member of the Armed Forces.<br>
3. The table above includes those old-scheme cases with either a Full Maintenance Assessment or an Interim Maintenance Assessment; plus those new-scheme cases with either a Full Maintenance Calculation, or a Default Maintenance Decision. New-scheme cases being processed clerically are excluded from this analysis.<br>
4. Data prior to March 2003 is only available quarterly. March 2007 is the most recent available.<br>
5. The volume of deductions from earnings orders/requests (DEO/Rs) decreased to 158,000 in December 2006. This sudden fall was caused by a fix to the new computer system to suspend 8,500 ineffective DEOs on cases where employers had informed the Agency that the non-resident parent on that case was no longer in their employment. These DEOs have been suspended and the Agency put together a recovery plan to trace those non-resident parents and restore compliance, through DEOs where appropriate.<br>

 Contracting out on a defined contribution basis when over the &#147;pivotal age&#148; (currently 44 for personal pensions and 48 for occupational schemes) is not usually financially beneficial, particularly where there is no employer pension contribution. However, an individual may have their own reasons for making this choice as contracting out offers flexibility not available under the State pension scheme. It is not the Department&#146;s policy to encourage or discourage people from contracting out. It is for individuals to decide what sort of pension provision is best for them, given their own personal circumstances.</p>

 Estimates of pension income are heavily driven by a number of assumptions, such as the asset allocation in a particular fund choice, the age at which the individual starts saving and the choice of annuity. It is therefore not possible to say with absolute certainty with which amount of annual savings an individual would achieve a replacement rate of above 100 per cent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_721"><a name="70621w0064.htm_para0"><a name="07062235001226">However, both under a contribution limit of &#163;3,000 and &#163;5,000 a median earner with a full working life is likely to be able to achieve an adequate pension income as defined by a replacement rate. This would require additional voluntary savings above the default contribution. Clearly, the higher an individual&#146;s contributions, the more likely they are to achieve a particular retirement income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_722"><a name="70621w0064.htm_para1"><a name="07062235001227">On 14 June, 2007, the Government published their summary of responses to the White Paper &#147;Personal Accounts: A New Way to Save&#148; consultation exercise.

 If investment returns were in line with the estimated average of a 3.5 per cent. real rate of return in each year, a median earner, who contributed up to the contribution limit in each year, would, in principle, be able to reach <i> (a)</i> around a two thirds per cent. replacement rate with a &#163;3,000 contribution limit and <i> (b)</i> around an 85 to 90 per cent. replacement rate with a &#163;5,000 contribution limit. The benchmark replacement rate for a median earner is around two thirds which is in principle attainable with a &#163;3,000 contribution limit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_723"><a name="70621w0064.htm_para2"><a name="07062235001230">However, these replacement rates are based on the assumption of a full working life (age 21 to 68) and hence a high number of years of saving (46 years). Some people in personal accounts are likely to start saving at a later age than 21 or have caring breaks in their working life and thus need a somewhat higher degree of flexibility of saving to reach their benchmark replacement rates.</p>

 Clydebank Benefit Delivery Centre currently retains files on site for nine weeks before dispatch to the Capita Document Management Centre (DMC) or Heywood Stores as they were known. This retention facilitates routine post-action checks, inquiries or other action. Documents/files are requested from DMC using an on-line retrieval with each request being made available for despatch by the TNT Courier by 20:00 on the day of request where the request is received before 17.00 hours or the next working day for requests made after 17.00 hours. Where the request is urgent we can request a response within two hours by fax or e-mail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_731"><a name="70621w0064.htm_para10"><a name="07062235001281">Where files are not received there are two escalation routes, depending on the information held in the on-line retrieval system, either via the TNT Courier help desk or the DMC Customer Service Desk. DMC will endeavour to resolve the issue at contact. However, if this is not possible complaints will be investigated within 24 hours of receipt and the caller given the option of a written reply by fax or e-mail. If the inquiry cannot be resolved within 24 hours, DMC Customer Service Desk provides a progress report via e-mail or fax. If the response is unsatisfactory or is not received within 48 hours, the issue is escalated to the DWP Record Storage Contract Management Team.  <br>
