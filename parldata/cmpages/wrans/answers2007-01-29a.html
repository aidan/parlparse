We have also made a long-term commitment to UNITAID, the new international drug purchase facility, scaling up to &#163;40 million per year by 2010, subject to performance.

Examples of this are when the service parent is serving on an operational deployment, or on a designated unaccompanied assignment or when exceptional authority has been granted for the service claimant to serve unaccompanied but retain eligibility to CEA. Examples of the circumstances under which such authority may be given are whilst the service claimant is awaiting allocation of service families accommodation at their new duty station, or when they are waiting, for up to six months, for the completion of a house sale/purchase.

However, MOD does support the Carbon Trust&#146;s approach to reductions in emissions where offsetting is the final element of a plan to reduce an organisation&#146;s carbon footprint. For MOD, reduction of energy use and increased use of energy from renewable sources will take precedence over carbon offsetting.</p>

The scheme started in April 2006. In 2005-06, MOD&#146;s estimated annual financial contribution to GCOF at &#163;151,658.67 based on a price of 10/tC. It is estimated that MOD will offset some 15,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent per year. This will be revised using actual data from 2006-07 to establish the GCOF contribution required for this financial year.</p>

This call was made with a view to ascertaining the likely timeframe for a public funding decision to assist in planning and progressing the proposed litigation.

<sup>(4)</sup> HMS Unseen was leased to Canada with an option to purchase, which has subsequently been exercised. The lease covers four submarines, the remaining three, HMS Unicorn, HMS Ursula and HMS Upholder are still under lease until 2008. The total value of this lease is Canadian $360 million for all four submarines&#151;future exchange rate fluctuations make it impossible to estimate a final return in sterling at this time.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> HMS Bicester and HMS Berkeley were transferred to the Hellenic Navy. This transfer involved the vessels being sold to Vosper Thorneycroft (VT) for &#163;5 million each. VT prepared the vessels for transfer resulting in the MOD incurring minimum transfer costs. Although not transferred directly on a G-2-G basis, they are highlighted because of the significance of the sale. The Acquisition Agreement for HMS London and HMS Coventry for Romania for Romania covered the acquisition of these ships with UK MOD procuring their regeneration and modernisation through a &#147;back-to-back&#148; contract. The ships were already decommissioned, no longer in operational condition and were in need of major regeneration. The value to the UK of the project is &#163;116 million including a return for the MOD of between &#163;1.5 million and &#163;2 million for the hulls (&#163;200,000) and the provision of services.<br>

 1. Finished admission episodes: a finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
 2. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis): the primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>
 3. Angina defined as the following ICD-10 code in primary diagnosis: I20 Angina Pectoris.<br>
 4. Asthma defined as the following ICD-10 codes in primary diagnosis: J45 Asthma; J46 Status asthmaticus.<br>
 5. Emergency admission is defined as the following admission methods:<br>
 21 = Emergency: via Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E) services, including the casualty department of the provider.<br>
 22 = Emergency: via general practitioner (GP).<br>
 23 = Emergency: via Bed Bureau, including the Central Bureau.<br>
 24 = Emergency: via consultant outpatient clinic.<br>
28 = Emergency: other means, including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another health care provider.<br>
 6. Ungrossed data: figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
 7. Data quality: Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The Information Centre Health and Social Care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

adventure activities meet an adequate standard of safety for young people not in the charge of their parents. It does this by granting, refusing, revoking or varying a licence to provide those activities, after considering licence applications and obtaining reports from its inspectors; it also investigates complaints and publishes information about licence-holders. In this way the Government help young people to receive instruction or leadership in stimulating activities outdoors (climbing, caving, remote trekking and waterborne activities) without avoidable risks of death or disabling injury.</p>

The first of these was Bristol in June 2006, which marked the establishment of the first Local Education Partnership (LEP), a long-term public-private partnership which is the preferred model for delivering local BSF projects. Greenwich and Manchester signed contracts with their respective private sector partners in October and November 2006, followed by Lancashire, Bradford and Lambeth in December 2006. We expect several more contracts to be signed in the coming months. 18 local authority projects are currently in procurement; seven are now at preferred bidder stage. All but five of the wave 1-3 projects have had their strategies approved. We are just starting work with the 15 authorities in wave 4, which were announced in December 2006.</p>

Following <i> Official Journal</i> of the European Union procurement, the Department has placed a contract with PricewaterhouseCoopers to evaluate the impact of the Building Schools for the Future programme on educational achievement. This is in line with Treasury &#147;Green Book&#148; requirements for major new programmes. This evaluation also aims to learn lessons from the early stages of the programme to inform its development.</p>

The figures quoted in this response come from data in the National Benefits Database and the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS).  3. Figures in this response are based upon periods of employment measured from the WPLS, which is based on data from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC). The figures given can be taken as a minimum only for the following (not necessarily comprehensive) reasons: (i) Some records show that a person started or ended employment at some point in the year, but the exact date on when they started or left their job is unknown, and therefore we do not know if they were employed at the points in time specified in this query. (ii) If a person's earnings are sufficiently low that they fall below the lower income tax threshold and so are not required to pay PAYE income tax on their earnings then there is no requirement to inform HMRC of their employment (although some employers declare these jobs anyway). (iii) This data does not include the self-employed. (iv) Poor quality personal data may lead to missed matches with benefits data. (v) No &#147;HMRC sensitive and secure&#148; information is supplied by HMRC (for example, HMRC employees, members of the security services).<br>

Sales performance and its analysis are matters for Camelot, the National Lottery operator and the independent regulator, the National Lottery Commission. Camelot is working to maximise sales of all Lottery products, including Olympic Lottery Games, and so minimise any impact that Olympic Lottery Games sales may have on income for the other good causes. The NLC and Camelot monitor sales closely and quarterly reports of returns to good causes, including the Olympic Lottery Distribution Fund, are published on the NLC&#146;s website&#151;www.nationallotterycommission.gov.uk. The next such report is due to be published on 31 January.</p>

Six different types of transport energy chain have this potential and also offer increased energy security. None is readily available today and each would require significant changes to the energy system. However, they are sufficiently promising to be worth pursuing as energy options for the UK.
