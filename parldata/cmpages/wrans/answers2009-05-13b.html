 The adding capacity at Heathrow Airport consultation document in November 2007 contained indicative flight path maps. Figure 9 shows that in 2002 Walthamstow was overflown by an average of 298 arriving aircraft a day at a height of 6,000 to 3,000 feet. Figures 8a and 8b show that in 2030, with a fully utilised third runway, numbers are predicted to fall to an average of 260 aircraft a day at a height of more than 6,000 feet. This is because, with a third runway, arrivals would be spread between three runways and final approaches would be further out from the airport, so aircraft would be higher at the point where they are overflying Walthamstow. Walthamstow is not overflown by departing aircraft at a height of less than 4,000 feet and that would continue to be the case with a third runway.</p>

 The Department for Transport provides funding to local authorities for highway maintenance by specific grant, contributions to Area Based Grant and through Supported Capital Expenditure Revenue (SCERs). Local authorities receive support for the borrowing costs of SCERs through formula grant. This is an unhypothecated block grant, not designated for any particular service, and can be used to fund highway maintenance projects or byways, for which the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has policy responsibility. Local authorities also receive unhypothecated income through council tax and other sources such as fees and charges.</p>

 I discussed Burma with US Administration officials and members of Congress when I visited Washington from 3-5 May 2009. We remain in close contact with our US colleagues about the situation in Burma at all levels. We are working with them to ensure that collective international pressure is brought onto the regime to engage with the UN Good Offices mission and to instigate genuine political reforms. We continue to share concerns for the prospects of inclusive elections in 2010 and the grave humanitarian situation. The US Administration have not as yet concluded the work that is under way.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 May 2009]:</i> We continue to urge China to observe its obligations under the 1951 convention on the status of refugees and to allow the UN High Commissioner for Refugees access to the China/Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) border region. This subject was raised with the Chinese at the UK-China Human Rights Dialogue in January 2009. We urged China not to return those people crossing the border from DPRK to China. China continues to maintain the position that cases are dealt with in line with domestic and international law.</p>

 Operation Atalanta is achieving highly positive results in providing protection to World Food Programme and other vulnerable shipping. It has delivered a significant reduction in the number of successful attacks in the Internationally Recognised Transit Corridor in the Gulf of Aden through close co-operation with the shipping industry and close co-ordination with other military operations in the region. While successful pirate attacks continue, these are either overwhelmingly against shipping which is not following the EU&#146;s operations advice and agreed best practice, or is in the Somali Basin further south where shipping is much more at risk given the size of the area for the military operations to cover: the military operations are rightly concentrated further north, given the much greater importance of the Gulf of Aden trade artery.</p>

The working group consists of a wide range of representatives from police, industry and Government, including officials from the Home Office and BERR and members from the British Metal Recycling Association. The working group discusses the most effective ways of working in partnership to tackle metal theft. This includes measures to restrict the activities of illegal scrap operators through police activity with help from the industry. Potential legislation that would aim to further restrict the activities of illegal scrap operators is also discussed in this forum.</p>

 The Home Office took part in the stocktake of the police complaints system last year led by the Independent Police Complaints Commission to assess how well the current system is operating and how it could be further improved in the light of experience of its operation since April 2004. The IPCC worked very closely with its stakeholders in identifying areas for potential change and also carried out a public confidence survey to hear what the wider public think and expect from the police complaints system. The process resulted in 10 proposals for change, which centred on the following themes:</p>

 Taking responses to the first phase of consultation on this subject into consideration, the first arrangements for the production of the first local spending report were made using information which is currently available to the Government and which do not impose significant costs on other bodies. We are still consulting on how the reports should develop over time through the second phase of the consultation which closes on 15 May 2009. We will publish a response to the second phase later in the summer when we will outline our plans for the longer term development of the local spending reports including the scope for extending the reports to include other agencies. This will enable the Government to develop local spending reports which are useful and whose cost is likely to justify their benefit.</p>

 To date, 24 Interim Empty Dwelling Management Orders (EDMOs) have been approved by the Residential Property Tribunal Service (RPTS) since the legislation came into effect in April 2006.

The CML data are for repossessions on first-charge mortgages only, including Buy-to-Let mortgages, as issued by their members. CML estimate that their lenders currently account for 95 per cent. of mortgage lending. The FSA data, as well as covering possessions on first-charge mortgages, cover possessions on second-charge loans by regulated firms (many second charge lenders are not regulated) but do not cover possessions as comprehensively on Buy-to-Let mortgages, as some of these are from unregulated firms. The overall effect of the differences is that the FSA's statistics on possessions are slightly higher.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice is committed to reusing, recycling and reducing waste. Wherever possible, office supplies are from recycled sources and all white paper for printing and photocopying across the Ministry now contains a minimum of 80 per cent. recycled fibre. It is not possible, however, to determine what proportion of total expenditure on office supplies relates to recycled products. To do so would require a detailed analysis of an extremely large number of invoices which could be undertaken only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_654"><a name="90513w0019.htm_para5"><a name="09051376000136">The draft directive proposes to prohibit discrimination in the provision of services on the grounds of religion or belief, disability, age and sexual orientation. It applies to those who are providing the service and not those who are procuring the service. Any organisation that is delivering a service, whether a faith group or not, will have to deliver that service in a non-discriminatory way. This is already a requirement in UK law on three of the grounds covered by the draft directive (religion or belief, disability and sexual orientation) and we are introducing protection from discrimination on the remaining ground (age) in the Equality Bill. The directive will not therefore affect public authorities procuring services from faith groups.</p>

Both are eligible for the 90 per cent. level of compensation and both are subject to the compensation cap. While both will have the cap actuarially reduced if they draw compensation before age 65 the person who took early retirement before the PPF became involved could have had a number of years where they were in receipt of their pension at full rate and the PPF does not recover those amounts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_726"><a name="90513w0025.htm_para3"><a name="09051376000694">After careful consideration the Government has decided not to make any changes.

Our inquiries over time suggest that few head teachers are utilising the power to search any pupil they suspect of carrying a weapon but the power is available should they decide such action is appropriate for their school. We have encouraged schools, through directors of children's services, to liaise with the police in safer school partnerships over random screening but we believe such screenings remain low in number, although figures are not collected.</p>

 A new programme of study for science at Key Stage 4 was introduced into schools for first teaching from September 2006. The new curriculum maintains the breadth, depth and challenge of the previous curriculum, but has a better balance between knowledge and understanding. Pupils now learn more about the applications and implications of science (for example, global warming and genetic screening).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_739"><a name="90513w0026.htm_para9"><a name="09051376000903">GCSE specifications were also revised from September 2006 to reflect the new programme of study. The Qualification and Curriculum Authority is currently reviewing the GCSE science criteria again with a view to revised specifications being taught from September 2011: these changes will ensure that the content remains up to date and engaging, and will address concerns about the level of challenge in some assessments identified in the recent Ofqual review of the 2006 specifications. Awarding bodies have also made changes to this summer&#146;s assessments in response to the Ofqual report.</p>
