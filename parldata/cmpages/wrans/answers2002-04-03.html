<P>
<a name="20403w01.html_wqn0"><B> Angus Robertson:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the expenditure is on training in the <i>(a)</i> Royal Navy and Royal Marines, <i>(b)</i> the Army and <i>(c)</i> the RAF in (i) the UK and (ii) Scotland. [32459]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20403w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 1 February 2002]: </i>The latest best estimates for the amounts spent by the Services' Training Agencies on individual training for the Royal Navy, Army and RAF in the last 12 months are respectively: #403.6 million; #894 million and #404.5 million. These figures are approximate and are in accordance with Resources Accounting and Budgeting (RAB) procedures which incorporate consumption figures not included in a cash budget.
<P>

<a name="20403w01.html_para0">For the Royal Navy, a small proportion of trainee days are spent in Scotland, but separate costs are not recorded for these activities by the Naval Training and Recruiting Agency. The Army Training and Recruiting Agency estimates that its total expenditure in Scotland in the current Financial Year will be #22 million. The majority of the RAF Training Group Defence Agency's training establishments are based either in England or Wales, but the in-year cost of their Outdoor Activity Centre in Scotland for the current financial year is #675,000.
<P>

<a name="20403w01.html_para1">The cash costs of Royal Marines individual training for financial year 2001&#150;02 are projected to be #39.9 million. It is not possible to identify separately Royal Marines training expenditure in Scotland.

<i>[holding answer 26 March 2002]: </i>As my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Defence made clear in the House on 19 March 2002, it is necessary to look very carefully at the report published by the Select Committee in the other place. We are conducting a detailed study of its analysis of the facts and the interesting technical views expressed. Were new evidence to be determined, this would of course, be fully evaluated.

<i>[holding answer 25 March 2002]: </i>The position has not changed since I answered a similar question from the hon. Member on 21 January 2002, <i>Official Report, </i>column 558W.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20403w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Peter Duncan:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what criteria were used by the Airfield Regulator in assessing the safety of future operations at West Freugh airfield. [45916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20403w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 25 March 2002]: </i>The criteria used by the Regulator to assess the safety of future operations at West Freugh airfield were the adequacy of safety infrastructure and the number of aircraft movements. Regulatory minima are set for both the overall number of movements and the number of fast jet movements in order to maintain the currency of air traffic controllers. The numbers of aircraft movements at West Freugh had fallen below these regulatory minima, leading to the decision to cease full-time airfield operations.

<a name="20403w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Hancock:  </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the answer of 14 March 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1179W (1) if he will list those who gave statements but were not called to give evidence; how many of those who made a statement expressed a wish to give evidence; and if he will make a statement;  [45836]

<P>
(3) whether the Board of Inquiry into the sinking of HMS Sheffield were given copies of all statements; whether all 98 people were offered as witnesses; who decided which of them were called to give evidence and be cross-examined; and if he will make a statement.[45837]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20403w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram:  </B> 
As I informed the hon. Member in my reply to his previous questions on HMS Sheffield, I am satisfied that the Board of Inquiry was conducted in a professional and proper manner and no new information has become available that would warrant the re-opening of this tragic incident. We have no record of any individual who made a statement expressing a wish to give his evidence through being interviewed by the Board. The statements taken from the surviving crew members were available to the Board of Inquiry. The Board interviewed witnesses where it was believed that doing so could assist in its inquiries. The decision as to which witnesses were interviewed was the responsibility of the Board. To publish a list of those who provided statements to the Sheffield Board of Inquiry would be a breach of the Data Protection Act 1998 and a breach of confidentiality, unless the permission of all the individuals involved was first obtained. This could only be provided at disproportionate cost.

The Ministry of Defence recognises that supplier training and employment practices are important for the timely delivery of the quality goods and services the MOD requires. The MOD will normally contract only with suppliers who have achieved an appropriate, certified quality management standard. Additionally, it will usually make use of qualification questionnaires and associated tools to help assess a potential supplier's suitability for a contract both before and after invitations to tender are issued. The MOD's standard contract terms also remind suppliers of their obligations under the Racial Discrimination and, where appropriate, Fair Employment (Northern Ireland) Acts.

The Steering Group are aiming to produce an Annual Report of progress in April/May 2002 which is expected to contain details of costs incurred during the first year of the programme. It is intended that this report will be made widely available and I will place copies in the Library of the House.

No payments have been received in connection with the voluntary package of measures to minimise the environmental impact of pesticides nor will they be in the future. The farming unions and the Crop Protection Association have estimated the costs to themselves associated with implementing the voluntary package and they will be expected to show actual costs as the programme progresses.

DEFRA, working closely with other departments, is leading on the UK's domestic and international preparations for the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD). The Department is represented on MISC18, the Cabinet Committee set up to co-ordinate, develop and deliver the Government's strategy for WSSD. DEFRA also chairs two official level groups which co-ordinate preparations across Government. My officials are fully involved in the international preparations for the Summit and are attending the third preparatory meeting in New York which started on 25 March.

<a name="20403w02.html_para2">DEFRA also leads on the development of a cross Whitehall communications strategy to raise awareness of the Summit. We are working closely with local authorities, NGOs, business and other organisations to ensure that we engage a wide range of stakeholders in the Summit. DEFRA has also developed the government sustainable development website (www.sustainable-development.gov.uk) to include information on WSSD.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) whether the 2001 United Kingdom business package waste recovery and recycling targets for <i>(a)</i> recovery and <i>(b)</i> material-specific recycling were met; and whether the percentage levels of business packaging waste recovery and recycling in the United Kingdom in 2001 satisfied the stipulations of the EU Packaging Waste Directive 1994;[46357]

<i>[holding answer 26 March 2002]: </i>The recovery and recycling targets in article 6(1) of the EC Directive on Packaging and Packaging Waste&#151;94/62EC&#151;were implemented in Great Britain by the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended).
<P>

<a name="20403w03.html_para0">In order to comply with the requirements in the Directive, recovery and recycling targets for 2001 under the packaging regulations were 56 per cent. for recovery and 18 per cent. for material-specific recycling of packaging waste. Final figures for 2001 are not yet available, but data received to date suggest that, if all obligated parties met their obligations, these targets should be met. This would mean that the UK had recovered 4.6 million tonnes of packaging waste in 2001 ie 50 per cent. We would expect to recycle some 45 per cent. We also anticipate that all materials will meet the 15 per cent. material-specific recycling target in the Directive, with the possible exception of plastic.

<P>
<a name="20403w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 26 March 2002]: </i>The United Kingdom's fishing industry has a negligible interest in fisheries agreements south of the EU so no assessment has been carried out. Fisheries agreements with countries north of the EU are of considerable importance to UK fishermen.

We are now considering the applications from candidates based in the West Midlands, received both before and after the original deadline, and hope to interview a shortlist in May.

We hope that match funding will raise the figure to some #100 million. The Department does not plan to monitor the amount and purpose of individual grants made in each town. The process at a local level is important in itself. Most towns are still at the stage of community consultation prior to agreeing action plans, and few project grants have been approved.

<a name="20403w04.html_spnew4"><B> Margaret Beckett  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 14 March 2002]: </i>There is no single approved buffer zone between GM crop trials and non-GM crops. The conditions governing each trial, including the separation distance between GM plants and other crops, are determined on a case-by-case basis and set out in each consent.
<P>

<a name="20403w04.html_para0">The basis for the size and nature of the buffer zone on other conditions is to restrict the impact of the GM crop on the environment. The distances are dependent on the reproductive characteristics of the GM crop, the nature of the modification and whether any alternative form of risk management is in operation (eg flower removal, pollen barrier).
<P>

<a name="20403w04.html_para1">These distances are set after consultation with the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE), the Government's statutory advisory committee on matters relating to the release of GMOs to the environment, which examines all applications for GM trials. ACRE advises on the basis of the best scientific evidence available and experience gained from previous releases and, for example, by the seeds industry in the use of separation distances to secure specific levels of seed purity amongst conventionally bred plant varieties.
<P>

Neither Gatcombe parish council nor Newchurch parish council have been classified as Xbarely active".

I have not yet determined the overall level of fees for community pharmacy services for 2002&#150;03. However, pending my decision, the basic dispensing fee from April 2002 will rise from the current level of 91.6p to 94.6p per prescription item.
<P>

<a name="20403w06.html_para4">I agreed in February that officials should work with the Pharmaceutical Services Negotiating Committee (PSNC) to explore ways of improving information about community pharmacy finances as part of a set of measures to inform our discussions on remuneration and on modernising the current NHS contractual framework. This work is under way.

It is for local councils with social services responsibilities to meet their statutory obligations and achieve best value for the people they serve. We have agreed a protocol on the use of intervention powers with the Local Government Association. This forms Annex D of the (former) Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions Circular 10/99, which has been placed in the Library. The protocol sets out the framework to discuss policy for the use of the intervention powers set out in the Local Government Act 1999. It states

<i>[holding answer 12 March 2002]: </i>The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) in conjunction with its independent scientific advisory committee, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) is responsible for monitoring the safety of all marketed medicines to ensure that medicines meet acceptable standards of safety and efficacy. The nature of the clinical setting is not within the scope of CSM advice.

A clinic was established at St. George's Healthcare NHS Trust in 1997 to treat non-cancer lymphoedema patients (primary lymphoedema) and cancer patients. While there are other clinics in South West London where cancer patients and lymphoedema are treated, the St. George's service also meets the needs of patients with non-cancer lymphoedema. The St. George's service is a specialist service and receives referrals nationally. The Trust is also one of the few places where academic and epidemiological work is progressing related to lymphoedema. This work includes a recent local study run by the Lymphoedema Epidemiology Project Group.

<a name="20403w08.html_para9">In July 2001 the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) was launched and presents a unique opportunity to reshape services and practice in line with the evidence base. The Institute will bring together the research, development and dissemination functions of the full range of mental health services. NIMHE will be concerned with primary, specialist and tertiary care organisations in both health and social care and recognise the need to integrate service development and mental health legislation. One of the standing programmes of NIMHE will be a mental health research network designed to increase the number of multi-centre research projects in mental health.

In 1997, the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) performed a detailed analysis of reports received through the Mind patient reporting scheme. Expert advice on this analysis was sought from the Committee on Safety of Medicines. No new drug safety signals were identified, although the results highlighted that patients considered that insufficient information was available to them about their medicines. There was an ongoing programme at that time to ensure that Patient Information Leaflets were authorised for all products and this programme was completed by January 1999.

XRisk Assessment for transmission of vCJD via Surgical Instruments: A Modelling Approach and Numerical Scenarios", published by the Department on 16 March 2001, set out a methodology for assessing the risk of transmission of vCJD through the re-use of surgical instruments. A new risk assessment model is unnecessary since there is no significantly new scientific evidence to warrant revising the structure or assumptions of the current model.
<P>

<a name="20403w09.html_para3">Because of the multiple uncertainties surrounding this issue, it was not considered feasible to make a straightforward prediction of potential secondary infections from surgery. The Risk Assessment therefore did not predict the scale of any secondary epidemic of vCJD, instead, it developed different scenarios to address the various uncertainties&#151;including the standard of decontamination&#151;and gaps in our knowledge about vCJD.
<P>

<a name="20403w09.html_para4">The advice we had from Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee was that good decontamination is key in reducing the risk of person to person transmission of vCJD via surgical instruments. This was confirmed by the Risk Assessment. As a result of the work we did last year on improving decontamination, all NHS hospitals in England have access to decontamination services of an acceptable standard.

In the longer term, data collected on written complaints will be used to inform service improvements as well as give practice managers and the service as a whole more qualitative information around access to health care services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 7 February 2002, <i>Official Report, </i>columns 1160&#150;64W, on stolen equipment, what criminal proceedings have been undertaken for cases of theft against his Department, stating in each case <i>(a)</i> whether the proceedings (i) led to a criminal conviction and (ii) were unsuccessful, <i>(b)</i> the cost incurred by his Department in pursuing a conviction and <i>(c)</i> the value of items recovered; and if he will make a statement.

<i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]: </i>All losses are investigated by the Department and stolen equipment has been recovered on some occasions to the value of about #5,000. Losses over #500 are reported to the police. It has not been possible to bring criminal proceedings in any one case mainly due to a lack of evidence. We have progressively put in place a series of measures to combat our losses from both organised and opportunistic theft. We take seriously the theft and loss of our assets. We recognise the importance of safeguarding our equipment both inside and outside the office.

The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) is promoting models of service delivery, which will improve the quality of treatment and accessibility to treatment for everyone who wants treatment, irrespective of their background. This will ensure effective access to all services, particularly substitute prescribing and residential rehabilitation services. The NTA are working towards achieving the national target of:

<a name="20403w11.html_para1">However, we do recognise that GPs have a crucial role to play in our overall strategy of increasing the availability of treatment to drug users. The Department made available #1.8 million to the Royal College of General Practitioners for the development and implementation of an accredited training programme to give GPs the skills they need when working with drug misusers. Since its launch in October 2001 more than 400 GPs have taken part in the programme.

I have had discussions with the Chief Constable of Greater Manchester Police (David Wilmot) about the policing costs of the games. On 30 January 2002, I announced that my right hon.

We have asked officials with Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary to look closely at the total additional costs estimated by the Chief Constable. On the basis of their further assessment we will consider whether any further grant would be justified.

<a name="20403w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 21 March 2002]: </i>On 23 October last year, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary (Mr. Blunkett) asked the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs to review the scientific literature on cannabis, including the so-called Xgateway theory". Their analysis of this theory can be found in section 4.6 of their Report, XThe classification of cannabis under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971", which was published on 14 March 2002. The Report says that it is not possible to state, with certainty, whether or not cannabis use predisposes users to dependence on Class A drugs. Nevertheless, the risks (if any) are small and less than those associated with the use of tobacco or alcohol.
<P>

<a name="20403w12.html_para3">There is a link between Class A drugs and crime. Preliminary findings from the drug testing programme, currently being piloted in Staffordshire, Nottingham and Hackney, show that 55 per cent. of offenders arrested for trigger offences (property crime, robbery and Class A drugs offences) tested positive for heroin and/or cocaine (including crack cocaine). The number who previously used cannabis is not known.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what procedures are in place to take account, when deciding asylum claims, of <i>(a)</i> an applicant's treatment in detention abroad and <i>(b)</i> medical evidence of torture; and in what proportion of cases such information is actively sought at interview by interviewing officers. [44254]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20403w13.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle:  </B> 
All information provided by an asylum applicant is fully considered in light of the known country situation in the country from which the applicant is claiming asylum. Any claim to have been maltreated whilst in detention abroad is fully considered by the caseworker. Caseworkers have access to various sources of information, including country assessments prepared by the Country Information and Policy Unit (CIPU) of the Home Office which often provide information on the prison conditions in a particular country. CIPU have access to a wide variety of further information and have links with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, as well as other organisations who are able to assist with specific requests.
<P>

<a name="20403w13.html_para2">If, during the course of an interview or in other written representations, an applicant claims to have been tortured, caseworkers ask the applicant whether a medical examination has taken place. If so, the applicant is asked to submit a copy of the report. Where the applicant has raised torture and the caseworker feels it would be useful, the applicant may be invited to submit a medical report.
<P>

<a name="20403w13.html_para3">However, it is for the applicant to decide whether they wish to undertake a medical examination to establish that torture has taken place. The Immigration and Nationality Directorate does not insist that a medical report is submitted when torture has been alleged. Not all forms of torture result in physical scars or injuries which could be identified during a medical examination.
<P>

<a name="20403w13.html_para4">Any medical report provided is fully considered in the light of the country situation and alongside any other information provided by the applicant. Information on the number of medical reports sought is not routinely collected.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if, when an applicant for asylum has provided evidence of torture, he will ensure that any letter of refusal states whether the evidence has been accepted. [44256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20403w13.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle:  </B> 
The Immigration and Nationality Directorate's Asylum Policy Instructions state that where a caseworker has decided to refuse an application for which a medical report has been submitted, the Reasons for Refusal Letter (RFRL) should explain how the medical report has been considered, and whether this evidence has been accepted or not.
<P>

<a name="20403w13.html_para5">Any other evidence of torture which might be provided by the applicant would be considered in accordance with guidance issued to caseworkers which states that, following the Court of Appeal case of 



<P>
<P><I>3 Apr 2002 : Column 1062W</I><P>
