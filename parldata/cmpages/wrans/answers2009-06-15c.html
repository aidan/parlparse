 Since 2005 the Department for International Development (DFID) has contributed approximately &#163;150,000 in supporting the Government of Liberia in its efforts to establish the Liberian Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) and to develop and finalise its National Anti-Corruption Strategy. In 2008, DFID also paid off outstanding arrears owed by the Liberian General Auditing Commission (GAC), which amounted to a total of $43,145, allowing the Auditor General and his staff to attend specialised training courses to enable them to undertake more comprehensive and detailed audits of government finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="90615w0002.htm_para2"><a name="0906153000310">The scheme opened on 1 April 2009 and up to 29 May it had received 1,115 applications and made 599 awards with a total of &#163;920,275.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_44"><a name="90615w0002.htm_para3"><a name="0906153000311">MOD Ministers and Chiefs of Staff participated in the 65<sup>(th)</sup> anniversary events in Normandy at the invitation of the Royal British Legion and Normandy Veterans&#146; Association. There was significant representation by our armed forces with over 1,000 participating in events across Normandy and standing alongside veterans. MOD is also discussing with Westminster Abbey the possibility of a commemoration service in the autumn as requested by the Normandy Veterans Association.</p>

 Civil aviation safety in the UK is regulated by independent aviation safety regulators: the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). As such the Department for Transport does not itself issue guidance. In July 2001, the Federal Aviation Administration issued an Airworthiness Directive (AD) related to a potential unsafe condition associated with unreliable airspeed indication. The AD was issued in order to mandate action for Airbus A330 aircraft registered in the US, which had already been taken in Europe by France as the State of Design for that aircraft. The French Directorate General of Civil Aviation recognised a potential safety problem and issued two ADs on the Airbus A330 in February 2001 The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) made the ADs mandatory in the UK at that time.</p>

 While there is no specific requirement in place, the Olympic Delivery Authority (ODA) is encouraging all contractors to use the waterways to transport materials. The ODA's work to open up navigable waterways will actively encourage contractors to employ sustainable transport methods at every opportunity.

Two of the ODA's other tier one contractors, Veolia and Aggregate Industries, have also committed to using the waterways to transport materials in and waste out.

 It is not currently possible to provide estimates of the potential costs and savings over the next three years. It has, however, been shown in the Stern Review on the Economics of Climate Change that timely and well-targeted climate adaptation measures will yield benefits in excess of their costs. The main rationale for investment to address climate risk will be to reduce the UK&#146;s vulnerability to longer-term climate change impacts.</p>

 As a result of the High Court decision of 30 September 2008 the UK Border Agency issued revised guidance on 24 April 2009 for considering settlement applications from former Gurkhas. We estimated that approximately 10,000 former Gurkhas and their families would benefit from the new guidance and would be entitled to settle in the United Kingdom should they choose to do so. These estimates were based on an analysis of records held by the Ministry of Defence.</p>

 Causes of incapacity are based on the International Classification of Diseases, 10<sup>(th)</sup> Revision, published by the World Health Organisation. To qualify for incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance, claimants have to undertake a medical assessment of incapacity for work which is called the Personal Capability Assessment. Therefore, the medical condition recorded on the incapacity benefit/severe disablement allowance claim form does not itself confer entitlement to incapacity benefits. For example, the decision for a customer claiming incapacity benefit on the grounds of alcohol and/or drug related conditions would be based on their ability to carry out the range of activities in the Personal Capability Assessment.</p>

 Nine out of 10 families are entitled to tax credits. This near-universal provision has helped reverse decades of stigma attached to financial support that prevented the very poorest taking up the help they needed. Take-up of tax credits is now the highest ever for an income-related system of financial support, at 81 per cent. overall and 92 per cent. for the poorest fifth of families. Tax credits are carefully targeted so that the greatest support goes to the poorest families. Only a tiny proportion of tax credits spending goes to those earning more than &#163;50,000&#151;just 0.2 per cent. of overall entitlement in 2007-08.</p>

 The Government do not provide financial support to parents of young people who are taking advanced courses. In these cases, young people are entitled to a separate stream of support.

 It is not currently possible to provide estimates of the potential costs and savings over the next three years.

 Custody for young people under 18 is the last resort. Where a person under 18 has committed a very serious offence (generally one for which a person aged 21 years or over could be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 14 years or more), section 91 of the Powers of Criminal Court (Sentencing) Act 2000 enables the court to impose a term of detention not exceeding the maximum term of imprisonment that a person aged 21 or over could receive for the same offence. Before the court may decide to impose a sentence of detention under section 91, subsection 3 requires it to consider all other possible disposals, including a shorter period of custody under a detention and training order.</p>

This level of performance should ensure that interest to suppliers under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998 is greatly reduced for the current financial year.</p>

 National Offender Management Service (NOMS) probation leadership and management development at first line manager level has to date largely been delivered at a local level in areas and trusts, through training consortia or areas and according to local need. A full audit and review of management development on the probation side is currently being undertaken through NOMS headquarters to inform planning for future delivery. In the interim, all NOMS managers (probation and prisons) have access to the NOMS tool, &#147;My Leadership Potential&#148;, a new e-learning management development package launched in April 2009. This provides an opportunity for managers to develop their skills and knowledge on a self-managed learning basis.

This represents on average approximately 45 per cent. of the total number of newly promoted first line managers on an annual basis and 12-14 per cent. of the total number of first line managers. In April 2009, the programme was temporarily closed pending review of continuing fitness for purpose and an updated version or a comparable level 3 nationally accredited programme will be re-launched in October 2009.</p>

The first, focusing on treatment offered and responses to treatment, is being carried out by the University of Oxford. It is due to report to the stakeholder Departments, the Ministry of Justice and the Department of Health, by the end of this year. The second, concerned with staffing and organisation, is by Imperial College. It is due to report in the first quarter of 2010.

 Prisons in England and Wales are asked to send mobile phones and SIM cards they find to a central unit for analysis. In 2008, 8,062 mobile phones and SIM cards were analysed. This figure includes items discovered within prison perimeters and on entry to establishments.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_172"><a name="90615w0014.htm_para15"><a name="09061531000468">We believe that this figure may understate the actual number of finds because it does not include items retained by the police for evidential purposes, and because in some instances prisons have not sent items for analysis. NOMS is putting in place new procedures to ensure that we have a more comprehensive picture in future. While the numbers of phones found indicates the scale of the challenge in tackling illicit mobile phones, it is also a reflection of prisons' increasing success in finding them and better reporting.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_173"><a name="90615w0014.htm_para16"><a name="09061531000469">NOMS is implementing a strategy to minimise the number of phones entering prisons, and to find or disrupt those that do enter. As part of the strategy, prisons are being provided with technologies to strengthen local security and searching strategies, in line with the recommendations in the Blakey report, &#147;Disrupting the Supply of Illicit Drugs into Prisons&#148;, published in July 2008. This includes the roll out of BOSS chairs to all prisons, and the deployment of other detection and disruption technologies, including mobile phone signal blockers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_174"><a name="90615w0014.htm_para17"><a name="09061531000470">We have also strengthened the law, through the Offender Management Act 2007 (implemented in April 2008), which makes it a criminal offence with a punishment of up to two years' imprisonment to bring an unauthorised mobile phone or component part into a prison.</p>

Central collection of information about the reasons for each restraint began in April 2008. Details of the age, sex and ethnic group of the young person restrained were also collected from that point, but it is not possible to provide a further breakdown, by those categories, of the reasons for restraint, as the Youth Justice Board does not receive the data in that format. Statistics relating to young offender institutions and secure children&#146;s homes are not collected in the format requested and obtaining them would require a search through individual records, which could not be carried out without disproportionate cost. The YJB does not collect data on whether or not a young person restrained has a disability, or the requested information about removal from association, and these could not be provided without disproportionate cost.</p>

 REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals) aims to minimise animal testing, and actively promotes the development and use of non-animal alternative test methods. However, it is inevitable that some further animal testing will be necessary in order to fill the many gaps which currently exist in our knowledge of the way chemicals impact on human health and the environment. Animal testing is only allowed as a last resort where no suitable non-animal alternatives exist. REACH prohibits repetition of animal tests once they are completed, and requires the data from them to be shared between everyone wanting to register the same substance.</p>

One of the aims of the scheme is to redress some of the disadvantages for those living within close vicinity of a landfill site.

 The Government consider that where there is a need for wildlife management then the proper use of snares is one of a range of control methods. Used according to best practice, snares can be an effective and practical means of wildlife management and are needed where other forms of pest control are ineffective or impractical.

</td></tr></tbody><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="7"><i> Notes:</i><br>
Includes activity in English NHS Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
<i> Small numbers</i><br>
To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br>
<i> Alcohol-related admissions</i><br>
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed:<br>
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br>
Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br>
Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing&#146;s syndrome (E24.4)<br>
Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br>
Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br>
<i> Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis</i><br>
These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
<i> Secondary diagnosis</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Assignment of Episodes to Years</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient&#146;s hospital stay.<br>

 The recovery of payment owed to national health service trusts by foreign nationals for treatment provided to them is a matter for the individual trust.

It is the legal responsibility of all hospital trusts to ensure that the eligibility of all patients seeking treatment is confirmed and, if they are not eligible for free healthcare, that the appropriate charges for treatment are levied and subsequently recovered. The Department has provided comprehensive guidance on implementation of the charging regulations to help the NHS to discharge their responsibilities.</p>

 Statistical disclosure rules are operated to protect the inadvertent disclosure of personal information about an individual pupil. For achievement data, the recognised approach is to suppress school level performance information where there are 10 or fewer pupils at the end of key stage 4 in the school.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="90615w0029.htm_para6"><a name="09061543000326">That is accepted practice in the published Achievement and Attainment Tables.
