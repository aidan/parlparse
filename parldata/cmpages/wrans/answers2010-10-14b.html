 The time taken to process an application for an EFG backed loan is mainly determined by the internal processes of the lender concerned. There are relatively few additional administrative requirements for EFG compared with a normal loan. These primarily relate to ensuring EFG is used appropriately and that the relevant EU regulations on state aid are adhered to. Lenders have access to a web portal to determine EFG eligibility and approval of the loan guarantee. Overall, lenders confirm that an EFG loan application only takes two to three days longer than it might take to process a commercial loan.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_234"><a name="101014w0001.htm_para7"><a name="10101423000174">Nonetheless, as speed and certainty is important for EFG lending decisions, this Department has worked with each of the main lenders, who account for over 97% of the SME lending market, to introduce a processing target of 20 working days for all major lenders participating in the EFG to provide certainty for businesses on how long their applications will take to process.</p>

 Open general export licences (OGELs) have been a key part of the UK's export controls for many years. They permit the export of less sensitive items to less sensitive destinations and as such they allow the Government to maintain a robust licensing regime while minimising administrative burdens for legitimate and low risk exports. These risks are managed through careful definition of the goods and destinations; by the terms and conditions applied to each OGEL including, in some cases, prior approval of the export by the MOD; and by a comprehensive programme of on-site compliance audits. All OGELs are kept under review and they can be amended or withdrawn at any time.</p>

 Recruitment of teachers other than trainees is largely a matter for schools, who are best placed to make decisions about their particular requirements. The School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document (STPCD), which contains the statutory pay and conditions of employment for teachers in maintained schools in England and Wales, includes a number of pay flexibilities to support recruitment and retention, which may be used to attract experienced staff where appropriate.</p>

It will be for head teachers and school governors to decide how to use the premium to meet the needs of disadvantaged children in their schools, and this might include using flexibilities in the pay system to attract more experienced staff. Ministers are determined to make teaching a more attractive profession for teachers in all schools, by removing bureaucracy, trusting teachers to get on with their job and taking measures to tackle behaviour and discipline in schools. These include strengthening teachers' powers to maintain good behaviour in the classroom, removing the bureaucratic burden on schools when giving detentions, and giving teachers the strongest possible protection from false allegations. The Government will announce further measures to reduce bureaucracy during the autumn, as Ministers engage with teachers and frontline staff on their plans to give them more power and remove the form-filling and bureaucracy that takes them away from the classroom.</p>

 When my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met with E3+3 counterparts in September, they reaffirmed determination and commitment to seek an early negotiated solution to the Iranian nuclear issue. We assess that the E3+3's twin-track strategy of pressure and an offer to negotiate an agreement is having an impact on Iranian decision-makers. We believe it is essential that Iran come to the table; and match our good faith. If it does not, the pressure, in the form of sanctions, will increase.</p>

1. A FCE is a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. Figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year. The figures represent admitted patient care only.<br>
2. Number of episodes with a (named) main or secondary procedure: The number of episodes where the procedure (or intervention) was recorded in any of the 24 (12 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and four prior to 2002-03) procedure fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if the procedure is recorded in more than one procedure field of the record. More procedures are carried out than episodes with a main or secondary procedure. For example, patients under going a 'cataract operation' would tend to have at least two procedures-removal of the faulty lens and the fitting of a new one-counted in a single episode.<br>
3. HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 national health service trusts and PCTs in England, and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

 The Government have made it clear that tackling health inequalities is a priority. Everyone should have the same opportunities to lead a healthy life, no matter where they live, or who they are. The national health service has a critical role to play in reducing the health inequalities that effect disadvantaged people, and the White Paper, "Equity and Excellence: Liberating the NHS", published on 12 July 2010, would create an explicit NHS duty on tackling inequalities in access to NHS healthcare and the outcomes for that care. Our aim is to create an NHS that is much more responsive to patients, putting them at the heart of everything it does, and that reduces inequalities in care.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="101014w0002.htm_para25"><a name="10101423001135">The White Paper also sets out plans for the new public health service that would have an important role in reducing these inequalities. The public health budget would be ring-fenced and allocated to reflect relative population health outcomes, with a new "health premium" to promote action to reduce health inequalities. We would therefore create a service that both recognises the impact of deprivation and rewards improvement, providing further incentives to reduce inequalities in health. We expect to publish a White Paper on public health later this year, outlining the Government's plans for establishing the new public health service, and also mapping a cross-Government strategy on public health.</p>

 The Mental Health Act 1983 (which was amended by the Mental Health Act 2007) is primarily concerned with the legal framework for the compulsory care and treatment of people with mental disorders, rather than with the provision of services. There is nothing in the Act specifically to enable mental health services to provide early preventive treatment to individuals. Such services are, however, widely provided by the national health service, not least through dedicated early intervention teams for younger people experiencing a first episode of psychosis.

 The outcome of the Multilateral Aid Review will be published early next year. Interim decisions on funding for multilateral partners need to balance the requirements to minimise disruption to the work of our partners and ensure consistency with the results of the review. My Department is in contact with our partner institutions to discuss whether financing decisions can be delayed for a short period without adversely affecting their work on the ground. Where this is not possible, or where a delay in an announcement of UK funding may delay negotiations with other donors, I will make an earlier decision, informed by the evidence and analysis already gathered during the review.</p>
