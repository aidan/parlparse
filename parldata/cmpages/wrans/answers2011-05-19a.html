When weather factors are taken into account the reduction beat the target by 0.7%.</p>

Performance has declined due to reduction in reported amount of glass recycled; the cause continues to be investigated but appears to be due to incorrect historic data from the contractor. The new waste contract due to be awarded this summer will require the provider to work in partnership with the authorities in the two Houses to meet our waste recycling targets.</p>

 The Government have recognised the issue of inward migration and the potential difficulties that this can cause in some areas. In the past, population figures did not accurately reflect the extent of general immigration. However, for the first time Formula Grant is informed by more accurate and timely population estimates developed through Phase 1 of the Migration Statistics Improvement Programme. This means that those areas that have experienced increased population growth over recent years will receive a larger grant  <br/>

If a property is found to contain serious (category 1) hazards, the local authority has a duty to take the most appropriate action. This could range from trying to deal with the problems informally at first to prohibiting the use of the whole or part of the dwelling. This system provides an important safety net, ensuring that homes are safe and free of hazards which pose a significant risk to the occupant. It is in local authority's interests to collect information across all housing tenures through housing condition surveys and to decide on the best approach for their area.</p>

In those discussions we underline the importance of condemning the violence against civilians who are expressing their views in peaceful protests, the need for the Syrian authorities to show restraint and to respond to the legitimate demands of people with immediate and genuine reform, not brutal repression.</p>

On Friday the Syrian ambassador to London was told that if the violence does not stop immediately and all political prisoners are released, the EU would take further measures including sanctions targeted at the highest levels of the Government. Alongside this action in the EU we are working to convince others that the UN Security Council should send an unequivocal message of condemnation of the situation and call for urgent political reform.</p>

               <a name="11051961000345"> There are a number of FPN schemes in operation across a wide range of offences which provide the police and other enforcement agencies with the means to deal quickly and effectively with low-level offending. Among these are the penalty notice for disorder (PND) scheme and FPNs for a number of road traffic offences.</p>

               <a name="11051961000346"> The aim of the PND scheme is to allow the police to impose a swift financial punishment in response to low-level, nuisance behaviour which provides a practical deterrent to future offending. The initial payment rate for PNDs was 53% in 2009. Unpaid PNDs are registered as fines by the courts and are indistinguishable from other fines. The overall payment rate for all fines in the financial year to March 2011 was 93%, and the payment rate excluding the value of administrative cancellations for the same period was 80%. 76% of adults and 67% of youths who received a PND in 2008 did not go on to reoffend within one year.</p>

In addition and where appropriate, police officers can offer offending drivers the opportunity to attend, at their own expense, an educational course as an alternative to paying the fixed penalty amount and receiving the associated penalty points. This helps people become better drivers and further reduces pressure on the criminal justice system.</p>

ONS is expecting to release the first outputs at ward level in Autumn 2012, but the detailed content and means of dissemination of these will not be finalised until the 2011 Census output prospectus is published early in 2012.</p>

 The civil service pension scheme rules allow civil servants to retire and draw their pension from either age 50 or age 55, depending on the date they joined the scheme. Where individuals draw pension before pension age (generally 60 or 65, depending on pension terms), an actuarial adjustment applies. In practice, civil servants retire at a range of ages, with many choosing to work on beyond pension age.</p>

 The Cabinet Office during 2010-11 implemented a wide range of measures to reduce cost which will provide benefits throughout the spending review period. Key among these has been the creation of the Efficiency and Reform Group, which has brought together a range of functions allowing it to drive substantial efficiencies and reforms in civil service HR, ICT, commercial and procurement, estates and other support functions. The ERG has also changed the way in which these functions are carried out as between the Centre and Departments, allowing it over the two years to 31 March 2012 to reduce the headcount and cost of its aggregated functions by around one-third. The ERG has now embarked on substantial reforms of arrangements for learning and development within the civil service, affecting the National School for Government; for procurement by Government Departments, affecting Buying Solutions; and government marketing and advertising, affecting the Central Office of Information.</p>

               <a name="11051961000373"> Further savings will come from changes to the structure of and programmes run by the Office for Civil Society (OCS). Some functions of the former Social Exclusion Taskforce ceased when OCS was formed. These included responsibility for social exclusion policy and a number of community-related grant programmes (e.g. grassroots grants, community assets fund) which have now been realigned with this Government's priorities.</p>

There have also been smaller scale changes within the National Security Secretariat flowing from the creation of the National Security Council and Office of Cyber Security, and publication of this Government's National Security Strategy.</p>

               <b>Richard Benyon:</b>
 The opening quota for the 10 metre and under fleet is boosted by fisheries administrations acquiring additional quota in-year for their use. Information on the under 10 metre fleet's share of quota at 31 December 2010 is in Table 1. However, focusing on such an analysis can be misleading, as some of the quota stocks included are of little interest to inshore vessels. In addition, many of these vessels catch types of fish, such as crabs and scallops, which are not subject to the constraints on their activity that may be seen when targeting quota species. Figures for landings of quota stocks and non-quota stocks are also included in the table and show that 79% of all landings by the UK 10 metre and under fleet in 2010 were of non-quota stocks.</p>

The UK Government remains supportive, in principle, of an international phase-down of production and consumption of HFCs but there are many technical issues to be discussed before any formal negotiations on a phase-down could take place. The Government will continue to push for the development of a phase-down agreement at the upcoming Montreal Protocol and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change meetings, and support this aim.

It should be noted that these estimates are highly uncertain, and are very small in relation to HFC emissions from the other sectors.

 The Government have two key aims in their reform of the student immigration system: to tackle abuse of the student system and support work on reducing migration to sustainable levels. The independent school sector is a highly regulated part of the education sector, with independent schools subject to statutory regulation, overseen by the relevant Departments and inspectorates responsible for education across the UK. In our experience of operating Tier 4, the independent school sector has demonstrated good levels of compliance with immigration requirements.</p>

               <a name="11051961000800"> Independent schools primarily use the Tier 4 (Child) category as the majority of their pupils are aged between four and 17-years-old, using the Tier 4 (General) category for the very small number of pupils who need to apply to the UK Border Agency once aged 18 or over. Independent schools have therefore been excluded from the interim limit on the number of Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies they may assign under Tier 4 (General) between 21 April 2011 and 5 April 2012, because of the low levels of abuse and small numbers using the Tier 4 (General) category when compared with other sectors which are not subject to statutory regulation, have higher levels of non-compliance and higher numbers of students attending institutions within the sector.</p>

 In November 2006, the Department allocated £35,000 to South Central Strategic Health Authority (SHA) to commission consultants to conduct a feasibility study of fluoridating Southampton. The study found that, in addition to 160,000 residents of Southampton, the water distribution system also served approximately 35,000 people living in parts of Eastleigh, Totton and Netley in south-west Hampshire.

            <p class="tabletext">We attempted unsuccessfully to seek clarification of this question from your office. We have therefore interpreted this question as the reasons for cases administered on the CS2 computer system being cancelled/withdrawn or closed in each of the last five years. A cancelled/withdrawn event on a case is the first step of the closure process. This event occurs to stop an ongoing liability on a case. A case should not be fully closed until all outstanding arrears on a case are cleared. If no outstanding arrears exist then a case can go through the whole closure process on the same day.</p>

1. Robust information is not available for cases closed on the CSCS computer system.
2. Figures include cases that have been cancelled/withdrawn or closed.
3. Closures as above, though completed by a case worker, can be initiated by either the CS2 system or the user themselves. Where case workers initiate closures, the closure reason is selected from a pre-defined list. As this is subjective, in some instances the selected reason may not reflect the actual reason for closure.
4. Closure reasons ‘Casebuild Terminated’ and ‘Insufficient Information’ should only be relevant to applications closed during the application process. All other closure reasons can be used prior or following a successful application.
5. Casebuild terminated refers to Jobcentre Plus applications received prior to the repeal of Section 6.
6. Figures rounded to 100.
7. Cases that have closed following calculation which have previously paid only includes cases which have had a payment or a maintenance direct arrangement recorded on the CS2 computer system. As this excludes payments made off system the number of cases may be under stated.

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sourced from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). These use disposable household income, adjusted using modified OECD equivalisation factors for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living. They cover the United Kingdom. The Households Below Average Income report can be found at:
http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/index.php?page=hbai
2. All estimates are based on survey data and are therefore subject to uncertainty. Small differences should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.
3. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures are single financial years.
4. Numbers of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 100,000, while proportions have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.
5. These statistics are based on incomes before housing costs.
6. Each of the measures is defined as:
Relative poverty: children living in households with less than 60% of contemporary median household income before housing costs
Absolute poverty: children living in households with less than 60% of 1998-99 median household income before housing costs held constant in real terms. The 2020-21 target will be measured against median income in 2010-11 held constant in real terms.
Low income and material deprivation: children living in households with less than 70% of contemporary median household income before housing costs who also experience material deprivation.

1. These statistics are taken from the DWP publication, ‘Low Income Dynamics 1991-2008’ based on data from the longitudinal British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) run by the University of Essex Institute for Social and Economic Research. They cover Great Britain. The Low Income Dynamics report can be found at:
http://research.dwp.gov.uk/asd/index.php?page=lid
2. The table shows the percentage of children who are below the 60% of median income in at least three out of four years in a series of consecutive four year periods. This is the definition of persistent poverty used in the Child Poverty Act 2010.
3. Low Income Dynamics 1991-2008 does not provide an estimate of the number of children this is. The four targets in the Act are based on proportions.
4. The table presents results on the persistence of low income on a Before Housing Costs (BHC). However the housing costs in the BHPS differ from ones used in the Households Below Average Income publication. The BHPS defines housing costs as simply as weekly gross housing costs recorded on the BHPS. Rents include service and water charges, but these are excluded the housing costs of mortgage payers. In addition, BHPS includes both repayments and interest in the housing costs of the mortgage payers where as the HBAI exclude the repayments from housing costs.
5. Proportions of children living below 60% of median income in at least three out of four years have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.

               <i>[holding answer 16 May 2011]:</i> Only a small proportion of HMRC officers receive physical self-defence training. The total number is approximately 1,250 individuals, some 2% of total HMRC staffing.</p>

               <a name="stpa_449">

               <a name="11051961001474"> The vast majority of those who receive training do so because they are required to conduct arrests using the powers contained in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, or equivalent powers in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The remainder are trained because the risk assessment relating to their work indicates that such training is necessary for their own safety.</p>

               <a name="stpa_450">

               <a name="11051961001475"> The Department currently has eight senior instructors, who are trained by the National Police Improvement Agency (NPIA) in the ACPO-approved Personal Safety Techniques curriculum. This incurred a one-off cost of approximately £1,500 per senior instructor. By successfully completing this training, these officers are accredited “trainers of trainers”, so they are able to train and accredit other HMRC staff to act as instructors. The Department currently has approximately 50 such instructors, a number of whom are currently under training.</p>

In 2010-11, the Department paid approximately £6,000 to the NPIA for the training of four senior instructors, and £32,250 to various venues, mainly private gymnasiums.</p>

               <b>Mr Davey:</b>
 A range of tariff and non-tariff barriers apply to agricultural imports to the EU from Algeria, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia. Tariff barriers are governed by bilateral Association Agreements between the EU and the respective countries, and vary considerably product-by-product and country-by-country. Limited agricultural tariffs remain for Egypt for example, which finalised a revised Association Agreement in 2010 whereas Algeria has yet to negotiate substantial revisions and so faces higher tariffs. Key non-tariff barriers remain for all countries including seasonal restrictions, Sanitary and Phytosanitary Standards, complex rules and regulations, and weak trade facilitation.</p>

 The EU Military Committee meeting with Chiefs of Defence on 3 May 2011 covered two main topics: capabilities and operations. The session on capabilities focussed wholly on pooling and sharing of military capabilities, where member states showed broad support for the initiative.

Decisions concerning military capabilities to be pooled and shared are subject to, and potentially constrained by, matters of national sovereignty. Although the work is being co-ordinated by these institutions, we are clear that the initiative must be member state driven, and conducted voluntarily.</p>

 There are a number of sources of information on greenhouse gas emissions in Brazil, Russia, India and China. Official inventory figures submitted to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat are available for 1990 emissions in Brazil and Russia, and also for 2005 and 2008 respectively. The World Resources Institute Climate Analysis Indicators Tool database may be used for estimated totals for China and India in 1990 and provides an estimate for China in 2005. India's Ministry of Environment and Forests has provided national emissions inventory figures for 2007.</p>
