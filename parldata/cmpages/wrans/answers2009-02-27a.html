<i> [holding answer 12 February 2009]:</i> It is for Local Authorities to determine levels of salt necessary for their winter maintenance programme as set out in the UK Roads Board's (voluntary) code of practice on highways maintenance management, Well-maintained Highways. For the trunk road network, the Highways Agency has in place long established procedures which require salt stock capability reporting on a daily basis between 1 October and 30 April. Salt stock requirements are ascertained from a combination of longer term weather forecast</p>

Salt capability is expressed as the number of treatment days available based on six treatments per day at 20gm/m2&#151;the level of treatment typical for snow conditions. A weekly summary is produced which gives an overview of salt stocks and provides advance warning when salt stocks are approaching a critical level.</p>

 During the financial year 2008-09, the Anglian eastern area of the Environment Agency spent over &#163;17 million on flood protection measures in the Essex catchment. &#163;4.67 million has been spent on the maintenance of rivers and tidal defences, &#163;2.62 million on major refurbishment of existing flood defences and &#163;10.4 million on new or improved flood defences.</p>

 There have been 910 incidences of &#145;secondary flooding&#146; in Hull since January 2008, although the relationship between the flooding in summer 2007 and subsequent water ingress remains to be explored further. The city council is working with the Environment Agency and the university of Hull to understand the factors which contribute to the continuing incidences of water ingress into homes. As of 29 January 2009, of the 472 households displaced from their homes in Hull by flooding, 360 were displaced as a result of water ingress from January 2008 or subsequently.</p>

Approximately 100 households returned each week between the end of June and the middle of November and on that basis we estimate that more than 19 out of every 20 households originally displaced are back home. That compares well to the Carlisle floods in 2005 when one in 10 were still out of their homes after 18 months.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 February 2009]:</i><i> </i>In a transparent and fair process which involved stakeholders in drawing up a set of business and quality of life criteria and the consultancy firm KPMG carrying out an independent assessment against these criteria, Plymouth was selected as one of the six shortlisted locations for the Marine Management Organisation&#146;s headquarters. The criteria used to arrive at the shortlist, and subsequently tested through site visits and presentations from the locations, were:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_122"><a name="90227w0006.htm_para7"><a name="09022737000909">As well as carrying out site visits to further test locations against these criteria, all short listed locations were given the opportunity to present their case to be the home of the MMO HQ and I met with MPs from all the shortlisted locations. Plymouth presented a strong case and, like all of the shortlisted locations, would have been a good home for the MMO HQ, allowing the MMO to meet its business needs and benefit from local marine expertise, organisational networks and academic links.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_123"><a name="90227w0006.htm_para8"><a name="09022737000910">However, Tyneside demonstrated the strongest and most comprehensive case to be the home of the organisation and provides a location from which the organisation can best achieve its aims. Among other factors, Tyneside has a broad range and good balance of marine interests with a working port, all of which fit well with the role of the MMO. Tyneside also provides strong transport links in terms of access to key stakeholders in London, Brussels and Scotland. There was a compelling demonstration of support from a wide range of stakeholders across the North East region, a region which has benefited little to date from the Lyons Review in respect of the relocation of public sector employment. The extensive evidence of partnership working in the area provided confidence that Tyneside had actively considered the bespoke requirements of the MMO with regard to its role under the Marine and Coastal Access Bill.</p>

 The current system of local authority housing finance is based on a system of surplus authorities (where assumed income exceeds assumed costs) making payment to central Government and deficit authorities (where assumed income is less than assumed costs) receiving subsidy. In the current year approximately &#163;550 million will be paid to deficit authorities in aggregate.

The issue of councils retaining all rental receipts is closely bound up with a number of other key policy decisions, including what rents should pay for and how these receipts would be used in a local area. It would be premature to reach conclusions specifically on this matter until the Review reports to Ministers later this year, when it will be considered as part of the overall structure for a new or improved system.</p>

 I have been asked to reply, and can confirm that the letter in question will be placed in the Libraries of the House. On carbon offsetting, it is very difficult to ensure that UK-based carbon offset projects are truly additional&#151;that is, that they result in real emission reductions that would not have happened anyway in the absence of carbon finance. For this reason the government's voluntary quality assurance scheme for carbon offsetting&#151;which was launched on 26 February 2009&#151;will not cover projects based in the UK. Support for local emission reduction projects can be beneficial, but caution should be exercised in claiming those emission reductions as offsets to balance a carbon footprint.</p>

 Discussions were held across Whitehall in preparation for the agreement by parties that 2 per cent. of the share of proceeds from the Certified Emissions Reductions issued for the Clean Development Mechanism will go towards the Adaptation Fund. This international financing mechanism is now in place. The UK Government are working with others on the Adaptation Fund Board to establish sound operational procedures for the Adaptation Fund to ensure that it will meet international fiduciary standards and be an effective mechanism for delivering increased finance where it is needed.

This process has been particularly challenging as parties have requested access to funding without the assistance of intermediaries.

<i> [holding answer 23 February 2009]:</i> The UK (the Department for International Development (DFID) and my Department) has allocated the &#163;800 million Environmental Transformation Fund to the World Bank-administered Climate Investment Funds. The Climate Investment Funds are divided into the Clean Technology Fund and the Strategic Climate Fund. Sub-programmes of the latter include: the Pilot programme for climate resilience, and two programmes under development: the Forest Investment programme and the Scaling-up Renewable Energy programme. The funds will be administered by the World Bank with individual programmes implemented through any one of the Multilateral Development Banks. Decisions are made by recipient countries on the basis of their country-led investment plans. We expect UN agencies to participate as delivery agents.</p>

Haemophilia centre doctors were asked to give patients the choice of finding out whether or not they had been treated with products known to have been manufactured using plasma from donors who developed vCJD. In 2006 when further implicated batches were identified, doctors were asked to notify those patients who had received these batches.</p>

The HPA and the UKHCDO wrote to centres asking that a letter be sent to all patients informing them of this finding and emphasising that it did not change the status of patients already informed that they were 'at risk'. The doctors were asked to give patients the opportunity to discuss the finding if they wished.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_190"><a name="90227w0015.htm_para3"><a name="09022737002991">The patient notification exercises were supported by a wider communication strategy in which documentation was sent to others, including medical directors of NHS trusts, general practitioners and clinician and patient organisations, including the Haemophilia Society, and information placed on the HPA website.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many people in each age cohort <i> (a)</i> were diagnosed with and <i> (b)</i> had their death attributed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in each of the last 10 years; and what the equivalent figures are for 2009 to date. [259728]</p>

 The following tables show separately the deaths from sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD), familial or genetic CJD/Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, iatrogenic CJD and variant OD from 1999-2009 by 10 year age cohorts. A further table shows age at diagnosis for variant CJD in 10 year age cohorts or, for those cases who were diagnosed only after death (i.e. post mortem), age at death. For other forms of CJD data on year of diagnosis is almost identical to year of death as mean survival is only four months.</p>

 There already exist well-established national service frameworks for diabetes, kidney disease and coronary heart disease and a national stroke strategy was launched in December 2007. All four of these strategies include a focus on prevention. A vascular risk assessment and management programme is under development at present. This will target the group of modifiable risk factors shared by these four conditions. The analytical modelling and evidence base underpinning this programme indicate that there are significant health gains to be made in this area. No recent assessment has been made of the potential benefits of integrating treatment and care in respect of diagnosed cases of these conditions. However there is considerable opportunity for sharing examples in generic areas, such as support for people living with a chronic condition, across these four disease groups.</p>
