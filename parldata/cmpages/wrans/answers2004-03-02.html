<a name="40302w01.html_sbhd0"><H3 align=center>Agriculture and Fisheries Council</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hood: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the outcome was of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 24&nbsp;February; what the Government's stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement.  [157673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 24&nbsp;February.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para0">The Irish Presidency briefly presented its work programme for the first half of the year. Their general priorities were enlargement, simplification and enhancement of food safety.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para1">The Council agreed by a qualified majority a regulation providing for tariff quotas for the importation of certain fishery products. Italy voted against because of its view that the quota for tuna loin imports was insufficient and Spain abstained because it felt that the quotas in general were too large. I supported the proposal.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para2">The Council noted progress on technical level discussions preparatory to political discussion at the April Council on the proposals for a regulation on the protection of animals during transport. There was a discussion, and I supported the need for an early agreement and for a longer-term objective of moving trade in live animals for slaughter to a meat basis.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para3">The Council noted a presentation from the Commission on its proposals for the financial perspective.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para4">The Council noted a report from the Greek Minister about severe weather conditions in Greece affecting agriculture and the sympathetic response from the Commission. Greece and the Commission would pursue the assessment of this situation bilaterally.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para5">The Council took note of a report from the Commission on its public hearing on 22&nbsp;January on organic food and farming. This is preparatory to the tabling of an action plan by the Commission to the Council later in the Irish Presidency.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para6">Under any other business, the Council noted a written report on BSE and reports from Commissioner Byrne on the current situation in regard to Avian Influenza in Asia and a recent outbreak in the US. Commissioner Byrne notified the Council that acting under comitology procedures the Commission was to introduce a ban on the importation of live poultry and certain products from the US. The Council also noted a report from 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2004 : Column 780W</I><P>
Spain and Portugal about the high level of feed grain prices and indications from Finland and Sweden that there remained supplies of oats which could be used.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para7">The Council also noted information from Italy and Portugal with support from other wine producing countries about recent changes which had been made to the use of traditional terms for wine imported from third countries. The Council noted that the Commission had explained that these changes were necessary to take account of recent discussions at WTO level.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para8">The Council noted information from France about the low level of milk prices. A wide range of views were expressed in subsequent discussion. I made the point that this was to be expected as a result of the changes agreed last June which was reflected in the compensation payments to be introduced shortly. The Commission undertook to produce an analysis of the situation with assistance from the member states.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para9">Finally the Commission amplified the terms of a letter which it had recently sent to all member states about the single farm payment to explain that it was simply making the point that member states which chose to operate on regional or hybrid models would need to justify this decision to the Commission as will be clarified in the Commission implementing regulations. This was noted by the Council.

<a name="40302w01.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Animal Welfare</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Streeter: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the prospects of obtaining approval under Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome to ban the live transport of horses to the Continent.  [153628]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 We have considered very carefully the idea that the Government could seek a ban on the grounds of public morality (Article 30 of the Treaty of Rome), but we do not believe that this would be defensible <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;when horses have always been slaughtered in this country in order for the meat to be exported for human consumption and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;when horses are exported for a variety of purposes. That is why we have concentrated our attention on issues of horse welfare during transport in order to make sure that we have future arrangements based on horse welfare which are stronger and more robust that the current 'minimum values' rules.

<a name="40302w01.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Energy White Paper</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_wqn2"><B> Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs when the Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan announced in the Energy White Paper of February 2003 is to be published; whether publication of the plan is expected to be within the timescale originally indicated in the White Paper; and when she expects to publish the second annual progress report on the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy.  [154580]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As announced in a written statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on 3&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 30&#150;31WS, the Energy White Paper first annual report will be published shortly after the Easter recess. This will allow the Government to report on a full year from the launch of the White Paper in February 2003, as 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2004 : Column 781W</I><P>
we are legally required to do by the Sustainable Energy Act 2003, as well as to capture some key energy statistics for the relevant period. Given the importance of energy efficiency to delivery of the Energy White Paper objectives, the Government intend to publish the Energy Efficiency Implementation Plan at the same time as the Annual Report. The Government also envisage simultaneous publication of the fuel poverty strategy implementation plan and the CHP strategy as well as the second annual progress report on the UK Fuel Poverty Strategy.

<a name="40302w01.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Flood Defences</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what guidance has been issued to the Environment Agency on matching local authority funding for flood defences.  [154915]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_spnew3"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 No such guidance has been issued. From April 2004 the Environment Agency's flood defence service in England will be funded primarily through Defra grant in aid which will replace, in large part, the levies that local authorities have previously paid to the Agency. We have, however, left in place a power for the Agency to levy local authorities to fund works not covered by Defra grant. These levies need to be agreed by the relevant flood defence committee on which the local authorities have a majority.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para10">Levies are also subject to a cap of three times the level of Formula Spending Share allocated to each local authority to support the levy payment.

<a name="40302w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Horses</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much horse meat was exported in 2003.  [157263]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_spnew4"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 In 2003, 1,566 tonnes of horse meat was exported from the UK.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;grants and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;other public funding she has made available to defray the start-up costs of the National Equine Database;  [156652]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;start-up budget and the <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;running costs of the National Equine Database are; and from which budget it will be funded.  [156654]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Defra is making provision for funding the start up costs of the National Equine Database for the first two years, and thereafter Defra will be responsible for the on-going maintenance costs of the data that Defra will use.
<P>

<a name="40302w01.html_para11">We have invited tenders to supply the database, and until the procurement process is complete the estimated costs for the database have to be treated as Commercial-in-Confidence.

<a name="40302w01.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Pig Industry</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the business recovery scheme to which the unspent funds from the pig industry restructuring scheme was re-allocated.  [155497]




<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2004 : Column 782W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The widely welcomed Business Recovery Fund (BRF) was set up in May 2001 to help small non-farming rural businesses recover from the effects of the foot and mouth outbreak. Pig farmers were eligible to apply for the BRF, but only if they wished to be helped to diversify from farming. The Fund provided a total of some &#163;74&nbsp;million for allocation to qualifying businesses. &#163;54&nbsp;million was new money provided by the Government, and the remainder was provided by Regional Development Agencies, who administered the Fund.

<a name="40302w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Rural Payments Agency</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;full and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;part-time staff have been employed in the Rural Payments Agency in each of the last five years.  [156046]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w01.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The figures for the number of full and part-time staff employed by the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) are set out in the following table.

<a name="40302w02.html_sbhd0"><H3 align=center>Liquified Petroleum Gas</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w02.html_wqn0"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he is taking to encourage continued use of liquified petroleum gas following removal of road fuel tax support for liquid petroleum gas.  [157450]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Liquified petroleum gas (LPG), has and will continue to receive considerable support from Government, not only in the form of a duty incentive (worth &#163;75&nbsp;million in terms of duty forgone in 2002&#150;03 alone), but also through grants for vehicle conversions (the Powershift scheme), and reduced rates of vehicle excise duty for gas-powered vehicles.
<P>

<a name="40302w02.html_para0">As the pre-Budget report made clear, the relative environmental benefits of LPG vehicles have become less significant in recent years as a result of progressively tighter emission standards for new conventional petrol and diesel vehicles. As a result the Chancellor announced in the pre-Budget report that he will begin to gradually increase the rate for LPG over the next three years, setting duty differentials on a path towards a level commensurate with the fuel's environmental benefits. Consistent with the Government's commitment to give three-year certainty on duty differentials for alternative fuels, future differentials for the next three years will be announced at Budget 2004.

<a name="40302w02.html_sbhd1"><H3 align=center>Correspondence</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Horam: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport when the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State will reply to the letter of the hon. Member for Orpington of 2&nbsp;October 2003, regarding the public safety zone surrounding Biggin Hill airport.  [157148]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 I regret that the hon. Member's letter had not been answered. I have written to him today explaining that in the light of revised forecasts of numbers and types of aircraft movements we have decided to reduce the size of the public safety zones at Biggin Hill airport. The effect will be that the areas of highest risk will no longer include any residential properties and that the airport company will no longer be expected to purchase any properties in Oaklands Lane or Victoria Gardens.

<a name="40302w02.html_sbhd2"><H3 align=center>Motor Insurance</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w02.html_wqn2"><B> Miss McIntosh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what progress his Department is making on establishing a link between existing DVLA and motor insurance databases.  [157530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 DVLA established a link with the Motor Insurance Database on 17&nbsp;February 2004 which allows the agency to confirm that a vehicle is insured prior to relicensing without having to view the insurance documents.
<P>

<a name="40302w02.html_para1">The Motor Insurers Anti Fraud and Theft Register is also linked to DVLA and automatically updates the vehicle record when a vehicle is seriously damaged. This allows an identity check to be carried out when such a vehicle is returned to the road.

<a name="40302w02.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Overseas Hauliers (UK Roads)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many overseas hauliers paid to use UK roads in each of the last three years; and how much the Government received in each year.  [157718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There is currently no charging regime in the UK for overseas hauliers. The Government announced in 2002 their intention to introduce a scheme to charge all lorries using UK roads on the basis of distance travelled. The Government remain committed to introducing such a charge and my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced in the pre-Budget report his intention to publish a farther progress report during this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;procedures and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;priorities followed by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency when issuing a reminder notice in the case of Statutory Off Road Notifications.  [157805]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Reminder notices are issued on or around the 15th day of the month of expiry of both the Statutory Off Road Notification and the vehicle licence.

<a name="40302w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Government Departments continue to work towards getting all Government services online by 2005, and seek to use Digital TV (DTV) wherever appropriate. Flagship services available now on DTV or planned by 2005 include Teacher TV, NHS Direct, Jobcentre Plus and the Pensions Service. In addition, UKonline Interactive is a world-first national one-stop-service for Government on DTV, bringing together access to all nationally available DTV services and progressively rolling out access to local government services on DTV.

 A new Insolvency Fees Order will come into effect on 1&nbsp;April 2004 that will include a new rate of 17&nbsp;per cent. "For the performance by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry of her general duties under the insolvency legislation in relation to the administration of the affairs of each company which is being wound up by the court" and "For the performance by the Secretary of State of her general duties under the insolvency legislation in relation to the administration of the estate of each bankrupt". However, the fee will not be applied to the first &#163;2,000 of receipts in a case and the maximum of this fee in any one case will be limited to &#163;100,000. The new rate will only apply to cases where the insolvency Order is made on or after 1&nbsp;April 2004.
<P>

<a name="40302w03.html_para3">For cases where the insolvency Order has been made before 1&nbsp;April 2004 the current scales will continue to be applied except in relation to the affairs of companies which are being wound-up voluntarily where the fees will be revoked from 1&nbsp;April 2004.
<P>

<a name="40302w03.html_para4">This is only one of a number of changes being made on 1&nbsp;April 2004 in relation to fees in insolvency cases. The new Fees Order, which will shortly be signed and be made available on The Insolvency Service's website (insolvency.gov.uk), seeks to simplify the fee structure applicable in relation to insolvency proceedings by reducing the number of fees payable. Hence it is not possible to make a direct comparison between any specific fee that will be prescribed in the new Fees Order with a specific fee charged under the Insolvency Fees Order 1986 or earlier legislation.

In light of this my Department has commissioned research on the key factors contributing to the relative competitiveness of UK call centre operations to help identify any appropriate actions which need to be taken by industry or Government in response to the increasingly global market for call centre services.

<a name="40302w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government's Manufacturing Strategy, which we developed in partnership with industry, trade unions and other stakeholders, aims to create a high-value manufacturing sector in the UK with a highly skilled and well paid workforce, moving away from competing on the basis of low skill and low wages. We are continuing to develop a range of initiatives under the Skills Strategy such as employer training pilots, modern apprenticeships, the growing network of Sector Skills Councils and other measures to better deploy and retain skills to improve business performance.
<P>

<a name="40302w05.html_para4">Where there are significant redundancies in the manufacturing sector, the Rapid Response Service works to move people quickly into new jobs, preventing them from becoming detached from the labour market. Although a trend to declining manufacturing employment has been a feature of advanced economies over the last 30 years, new jobs are still being created all the time. Around 250,000 manufacturing vacancies were reported to Jobcentre plus in the last year. Overall the UK labour market is performing well, with total employment rising by nearly 1.7&nbsp;million since spring 1997, and unemployment falling in every region in Britain over the past year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will maintain the level of service provided by the <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;National Near Earth Object Information Centre and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;the Spaceguard Centre.  [155368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w05.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The British National Space Centre (BNSC) has contributed funding to the setting up and maintenance of the Near Earth Object (NEO) Information Centre based at the National Space Science Centre in Leicester. It provides information to the public and monitors NEO activity. This follows the recommendations of the Near Earth Object Task Force Report. The BNSC contract expires on 31&nbsp;December 2004. The Government has not contributed funding to the Space Guard Centre in the UK.

<a name="40302w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Department has no direct responsibility for the banking sector. As part of our normal discourse with business we do speak with the banking sector, including discussion of recent attempts to gain customers' passwords and other details. The results of these discussions are reflected in our promotion of information security best practice to business.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what procedures govern the categorisation of rural and urban post offices.  [157810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The decision to classify a post office branch as urban or rural is an operational matter for Post Office Ltd. The company classifies as rural any post office within a community of less than 10,000 inhabitants. Above that the post office is classified as urban. I understand that the company has a geographical mapping model that enables it to adopt a consistent approach to classification across the country.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much money has been spent on the Public Sector Research Exploitation Fund in each year since its inception; and how many organisations have received assistance through this fund.  [157250]<P>

<P>
<a name="40302w05.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B>

[157620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 The Department did not support programmes specifically focused on internally displaced people in Burma in 2002&#150;03 or 2003&#150;04. However, internally displaced people may be among the beneficiaries of other DFID programmes during this period, such as a UNICEF-led immunisation programme in Burma for which DFID provided &#163;567,000 in 2002&#150;03, work by the International Committee of the Red Cross

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development how much of the world's rainforests has been destroyed in each of the last 10 years to provide land purely to provide food for animals; and how much grain for humans this land could provide per year.  [156966]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 A recent Food and Agriculture Organisation study sampled 10&nbsp;per cent. of the world's tropical forests in 1980, 1990 and 2000. The key changes noted were a loss of 'closed forest' (i.e. rain forest) amounting to 70&#150;80&nbsp;million hectares per decade, and a gain in "other land cover", primarily cultivation and pastures, of an almost identical area.
<P>

<a name="40302w06.html_para2">It is not possible to state the proportion of forest destroyed to provide food for animals, since deforested land often has a sequence of changing uses. For example, in South America land cleared for cattle ranching is often later used for soy bean cultivation. In Africa, land cleared for small-scale landholdings is often used for both cultivation and raising livestock.
<P>

<a name="40302w06.html_para3">It is not possible to say how much grain for humans deforested land could provide per year owing to huge variations in land fertility.

<P><I>2 Mar 2004 : Column 803W</I><P>
technical open-ended meeting of an ad-hoc working group in Santiago, Chile in March. The outcome of this will be a report of key lessons and challenges in relation to further implementation of ICPD. Secondly there will be a high-level regular meeting of ECLAC in Puerto Rico in June, which will consider the outcome of Santiago.
<P>

<a name="40302w06.html_para4">The UK Government will be represented at both these meetings as members of ECLAC. We are keen to emphasise the importance of the ICPD commitments and to support countries that do not wish to weaken the consensus of ICPD. DFID is particularly concerned with maintaining wording on reproductive health, rights and sexual health and avoiding unproductive arguments about issues that have already been agreed. The emphasis of the two ECLAC meetings should be on monitoring of progress of the ICPD commitments in the region and discussion around enhancing progress for the next 10 years.

Last December, UNAIDS launched the Global Epidemic Update (available at www.unaids.org) which provided a synthesis of trends in the epidemic in all regions. They will be producing detailed country information to launch at the World AIDS Conference in July 2004 in Bangkok.

<P>
<a name="40302w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 We have not received any representations from non-governmental organisations on over-estimates of HIV/AIDS rates in sub-Saharan Africa. This Department does not plan to commission research into the differences between data based on population-based surveys and on ante-natal clinic-based surveys in giving reliable estimates of the level of HIV/AIDS infection in sub-Saharan Africa. UNAIDS has the mandate to provide information on the status of the epidemic.
<P>

<a name="40302w07.html_para4">UNAIDS included information about methodological issues relating to differences between data taken from these two different sources in the Global Epidemic update, which was released last World AIDS day. They concluded 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2004 : Column 805W</I><P>
that population based surveys are likely to underestimate true HIV prevalence in most cases, because some respondents are absent from the household at the time of a survey and some refuse to participate. UNAIDS also recognise that most antenatal clinic-based surveillance systems have limited geographical coverage, which can lead to wide variations in the quality of the national estimate of HIV prevalence.
<P>

<a name="40302w07.html_para5">UNAIDS is now doing some analysis linking behavioural data to the surveys, to see whether and how that has affected the result of the population-based surveys. They will convene a meeting in May to analyse different results across a number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa from the two sources of data. They aim to report findings at the World AIDS Conference in Bangkok in 2004.
<P>

<a name="40302w07.html_para6">We have not made any specific representations to UNAIDS about changes to future exercises estimating HIV/AIDS prevalence rates in SA, to include population based surveys as opposed to surveys which indicate trends in HIV prevalence. DFID is in dialogue with them on issues around data sources for HIV estimates. UNAIDS contend that conducting ante-natal clinic-based surveys and population surveys at three to five year intervals can serve as valuable components of surveillance systems and can help improve estimates of the levels and trends in HIV prevalence. This Department supports UNAIDS in their efforts to analyse the different results from different sources, rather than relying on one source alone. All HIV estimates need to be assessed critically. Using different sources for data and interrogating the results will always provide more robust analysis than relying on one source.

<a name="40302w09.html_para2">Future plans include the purchase of two new aircraft carriers, further orders of Type 45 destroyers and Astute Class submarines, the Joint Casualty Treatment Ship, and the replacement of existing RFA vessels through the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability project. The Department is also considering options for leasing new Offshore Patrol Vessels to replace the current Castle Class capability. Tenders are currently being assessed for the Nato Submarine Rescue System, which will enter service in 2006.
<P>

<a name="40302w09.html_para3">Looking further ahead, we expect to replace the capability provided by the Type 22 and 23 Frigates with the Future Surface Combatant. It is too early to say how the capability will be met or when orders will be placed because the project is still at the concept stage.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of the suitability of current Royal Fleet Auxiliary oilers for future expeditionary warfare.  [146507]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Royal Fleet Auxiliary operates four classes of oilers (Wave, Leaf, Rover, and Fort Victoria). The two Wave class oilers (Wave Ruler and Wave Knight) entered service in 2003 and will remain operational until after 2025.
<P>

<a name="40302w10.html_para0">The Leaf and Rover classes are due to reach their expected out of service dates by 2011. They are single-hulled and so will be non-compliant with revised Marpol (International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships) regulations on the introduction of double-hulled vessels. The newer Fort Victoria ships are also single-hulled but we are currently considering ways of maintaining compliance with international legislation beyond 2010. While Marpol does not apply to vessels owned or operated by a state and used only on Government non-commercial service, as is the case with the RFA oilers, it remains MOD policy to comply with Shipping Acts and associated regulations where practicable. Consequently, MOD has a programme to phase out all non-compliant RFA vessels with a target date of 2010 based on the earliest practicable point for compliance.
<P>

<a name="40302w10.html_para1">As explained in my answer of 11&nbsp;February 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1459&#150;60W, the Department's programme, known as the Military Afloat Reach and Sustainability (MARS) programme, seeks progressively to replace most of the current RFA fleet, including Leaf, Rover, and Fort Victoria class oiler vessels. As part of this, these ships will be replaced by more flexible and capable vessels fully compliant with Marpol. This will significantly enhance the RFA's ability to provide the Royal Navy with its afloat support requirements.

 No money has been spent on developing the Typhoon's operational role to operate off the new aircraft carriers. As part of the Concept Phase for the Joint Combat Aircraft project, a feasibility contract was let with BAE Systems to identify broad order costs and design issues for a number of different solutions. This contract was valued at around &#163;2&nbsp;million. The study considered the potential for adapting Typhoon for carrier operations but showed that a significant amount of re-design and investment would be required to operate Typhoon from the future carriers. Joint Strike Fighter has been selected to meet this requirement.

 The Inland Revenue has approximately 350 local Tax Offices. However many are located in multi-occupied buildings with other Revenue Offices. For example, a building might house a Tax Office but it could also house a Contact Centre, Tax Enquiry Point, Working Families Tax Credit Office etc.

The variant projections included a 'Natural Change' projection which assumes zero net migration in future. Relevant results from the principal projection and the natural change variant projection are summarised in the following table.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what contribution was made to each of the figures in Table B5 of the pre-Budget report 2003 by Private Finance Initiative or associated schemes that have been accounted for on the balance sheet of the public sector client; and whether the data underlying Table B5 are updated when a particular Private Finance Initiative scheme subsequently moves on- or off-balance sheet to the public sector client.  [156158]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The assumptions used for the spending projections underlying Table B5 are set out in paragraph B27 on page 208 of the pre-Budget report. Current and capital expenditure under PFI contracts is fully recorded in the expenditure rows of Table B5, and hence in the fiscal aggregates consistent with independently set accounting and reporting standards. Accordingly, these tables will fully reflect the balance sheet treatment of assets once this treatment has been determined.

 Reductions in the main rate of corporation tax of this magnitude would be likely to have indirect as well as direct effects on tax revenues. The "Tax Ready Reckoner and Tax Reliefs" published with the pre-Budget report in December showed the direct effects of a one percentage point change in the main rate of corporation tax in April 2004 as &#163;650&nbsp;million in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;1,300&nbsp;million in 2005&#150;06.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The UK Government has regular discussions with the Afghan Government, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and international partners about progress on measures to reduce opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. There are no immediate solutions and no single approach to address the variety of factors which influence farmers to grow poppy. The UK is supporting the Afghan Government in implementation of their national drug control strategy with &#163;70&nbsp;million committed over three years and a dedicated counter narcotics team in place in Kabul. We also co-hosted last month a counter narcotics conference in Kabul to increase Afghan and international awareness and engagement in tackling this problem.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The security situation in Afghanistan remains fragile. The two lethal bomb attacks on Canadian and UK IS AF personnel in January in Kabul followed the killing of four German ISAF personnel in a similar attack in June 2003. Other attacks, such as the murder of a UN employee in November 2003 and the attack near Kandahar on 22&nbsp;February in which an Australian pilot was killed and a British aid worker wounded, have targeted the international community and NGO operations outside the capital. Security in the south continues to cause concern, especially near the border with Pakistan, where extremist groups are operating. There have been fewer problems in the north, but long-standing tensions persist and these can flare up into violence.

<P>
<a name="40302w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Our policy, and that of our EU partners, is to use targeted measures against Zimbabwe's leadership as a means of pressing it to return to democratic governance which respects human rights and the rule of law. We do not support economic or trade sanctions, as these would have a negative impact on all Zimbabweans. The EU measures are targeted on the ZANU(PF) leadership and on those who are responsible for human rights abuses and do not impact on ordinary Zimbabweans. On 19&nbsp;February the EU agreed, by consensus, to continue with the targeted measures for another year and to extend from 79 to 95 the number of people on the travel ban and assets freeze.

<P>
<a name="40302w13.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 There are no Commonwealth sanctions on Zimbabwe. The Commonwealth suspended Zimbabwe from its Councils in 2002. Commonwealth Heads of Government decided to continue the suspension when they met in Nigeria in December 2003. Following that decision Mugabe decided to withdraw Zimbabwe from the Commonwealth. The EU does have targeted measures against Zimbabwe consisting of a travel ban, assets freeze and arms embargo. On 19&nbsp;February the EU decided to continue these measures for another year and to extend by 16 the number of people on the travel ban and assets freeze. The measures are now targeted on 95 people.

 South Korea's average income per capita in 2002 (latest year for which actual figures are available) was US$9,979. This year, the figure is expected to reach around US$12,000, owing to economic growth and appreciation of the Korean won against the US dollar.

could still eventually be overcome by smoke inhalation. The research also found that it would not be cost effective to require the universal installation of sprinklers in all residential premises.

<a name="40302w17.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The responsibility for attaching conditions to liquor licences under current law rests with the licensing justices.Under the Licensing Act 2003, which received Royal Assent on 10&nbsp;July 2003, this responsibility will be transferred to licensing authorities which, in the main, are local authorities. There are two mandatory conditions in the 2003 Act, which will be attached in all cases where a premises licence authorises the supply of alcohol. The first is that no supply of alcohol may be made at a time when there is no designated premises supervisor in respect of the premises or at a time when the premises supervisor does not hold a personal licence or it is suspended. The second is that every supply of alcohol under the premises licence must be made or authorised by a person who holds a personal licence.
<P>

<a name="40302w17.html_para8">The 2003 Act provides further mechanisms to promote the prevention of nuisance and crime and disorder. The Act introduces the review of licences. Interested parties and responsible authorities will be able to request that a review of a premises licence occurs on a ground which is relevant to one or more of the licensing objectives (the prevention of crime and disorder, the prevention of public nuisance, the protection of children from harm and public safety). The review may lead to modifications of the conditions 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2004 : Column 843W</I><P>
on the licence, the exclusion of certain licensable activities from the licence, the removal of the premises supervisor, or the suspension or revocation of the licence.
<P>

<a name="40302w17.html_para9">In addition, the 2003 Act provides powers for a magistrates court in a particular area to make an order requiring premises at or near a place of disorder, or expected disorder, to be closed for a period not exceeding 24 hours.
<P>

<a name="40302w17.html_para10">In addition a particular premises may be closed if a senior police officer reasonably believes there is, or is likely imminently to be, disorder on, or in the vicinity, of the premises and the closure is necessary for public safety, or alternatively if a public nuisance is being caused by noise coming from the premises and closure is necessary to prevent the nuisance. These closure orders can be for up to 24 hours and may be extended in certain situations. These powers will also be applicable to temporary events held under temporary event notices.
<P>

<a name="40302w17.html_para11">In addition to these provisions, the 2003 Act contains offences such as the sale of alcohol to a person who is drunk or obtaining alcohol for a person who is drunk.

Digital terrestrial television is now receivable in around 75&nbsp;per cent. of the UK.
<P>

<a name="40302w18.html_para6"><i>(b)</i> <i>Through Satellite</i>
<P>

<a name="40302w18.html_para7">Consumers need to get either a digital satellite adaptor and connect it to their existing analogue TV set or a digital TV set designed to receive digital satellite signals. They will also need a dish installed outside their home. Digital satellite signals reach the vast majority of UK homes, but in a few cases reception may not be possible, because the line of sight to the satellite is obstructed, or because planning or property regulations do not permit householders to put up a dish.

 <i>[holding answer 1&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is working with stakeholders, within the Digital Television Action Plan, to ensure that everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form (BBC 1 and 2, ITV, Channel 4/S4C and Channel 5) will be able to receive them on digital systems. However, this might not be possible before switchover for a small minority of consumers. Though Digital satellite signals reach the vast majority of UK homes, in a few cases reception or installation of the necessary dish may not be possible, either for topographic or legal reasons. We are reviewing these legal constraints to ensure they are minimal and proportionate. Any further extension of the digital cable networks is a commercial matter for the operators. As for terrestrial reception, it is not possible to extend it before switchover, as signals currently have to be transmitted at low power to prevent interferences with UK and foreign analogue signals. Only switchover will allow digital terrestrial television to reach the same level of coverage as analogue.

 Progress against the target is measured by using the results of periodic surveys carried out by each museum and gallery. These record the number of C2DEs visiting the museum. Progress is reported to the Department half-yearly and annually. The results are aggregated to measure progress against the PSA target.

[156950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 There are 2,945 Public Sports Centres in England, 935 of which contain one or more sunbed.
<P>

<a name="40302w19.html_para0">As I am sure the hon. Member will appreciate, any decision to provide sunbeds in public leisure facilities will be for the individual local authorities to make. However, the Government acknowledge the risks to young people of exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) in all of its forms and the Health and Safety Executive has published guidance for operators and customers on using sunbeds. This guidance was developed after consultation with leading experts and is accepted as good advice.
<P>

<a name="40302w19.html_para1">The hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w19.html_spnew4"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Government are aware of the situation of the former employees of Ballast plc, but has not made an assessment of the effect the liquidation has had on their occupational pensions. However, we have great sympathy for the uncertainties they, and other people in similar circumstances, are facing in regard to their pensions.

[156684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w19.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Government recognise the concerns that have been expressed about the financial responsibilities of parent companies and sympathises with the position of all members of pension schemes that may not receive the pension that they expected as a result of employer insolvency. However, the legal obligation to fund a salary-related occupational scheme is with the sponsoring employer of the scheme. The holding company is not responsible for the debts of an insolvent subsidiary because the two companies have separate legal identities. Any political intervention would, therefore, be inappropriate in this case.

 We are taking significant steps to protect members of defined benefit schemes. We are introducing the Pension Protection Fund, which will protect scheme members by paying compensation if their employer becomes insolvent and the pension scheme is under funded. We are also introducing a new Pensions Regulator that has the flexibility and powers to take a targeted and proportionate approach to protecting the funds held in pension schemes.
<P>

<a name="40302w20.html_para2">Additionally, on 23&nbsp;February, we laid Regulations that strengthen members' protection when a defined benefit occupational pension scheme starts to wind up while its sponsoring employer is solvent. On 24&nbsp;February, we announced changes to the priority order which applies on wind up. This will help ensure that assets of the pension scheme are shared as fairly as possible between non-pensioner and pensioner scheme members.
<P>

<a name="40302w20.html_para3">In the event of employer insolvency assistance is available to pension scheme members under the Employment Rights Act 1996 and the Pensions Scheme Act 1993. Under these Acts, the Redundancy Payments Directorate makes insolvency payments from the National Insurance Fund (NIF) to qualifying former employees. Claims for unpaid employees' contributions are limited to the actual amount deducted from wages during the 12 months prior to the date of insolvency. Unpaid employers' contributions for the 12 month period prior to the insolvency date are also payable, but are subject to monetary limits depending on the type of pension scheme.

 The marketing campaign for Pension Credit has been designed to be flexible, and the level of expenditure may change according to need. However, in England, Scotland and Wales, it is currently estimated that media costs, including direct mailing, television and press advertising, will be in the region of &#163;12&#150;&#163;17&nbsp;million, excluding VAT, to October 2004.

 As far as I am aware no civil servants in Northern Ireland have resigned from the Civil Service as a result of the current pay dispute. Extensive negotiations over several months did not result in an agreed pay deal for the 11 Departments of the Northern Ireland Administration this year. Management Side presented an offer worth 3.67&nbsp;per cent. on 5&nbsp;November. As this could not be agreed, and Trade Union Side declined to negotiate within the 3.67&nbsp;per cent. envelope, we took the decision to proceed to pay the award and communicated this to staff and Trade Union Side on 27&nbsp;November. I have made clear to Trade Union Side that the 3.67&nbsp;per cent. deal is the maximum that can be paid. We are however open to exploring other reasonable means of resolving the dispute. The latest meeting of the Central Whitley Council between Trade Union and Management Sides took place on Thursday, 19&nbsp;February, and we have agreed to hold further negotiations as a matter of urgency.

<a name="40302w22.html_para6">The PSNI are involved in a number of initiatives to reduce the number of vehicles taken without the permission of the owner. In West Belfast an Auto Crime Team has been established to specifically address this issue. While such initiatives can help reduce the incidence of vehicle crime it has been recognised that a long-term strategy is required and the PSNI are working in partnership with a number of agencies and groups, to tackle this problem as part of a multi-agency project. Each District Command Unit uses a range of resources and methods to target vehicle related crime in their area as effectively as possible.
<P>

<a name="40302w22.html_para7">In addition to these measures the Government will publish draft legislation for Northern Ireland for consultation by the end of January, aimed at tackling so-called "joy-riding" offences. The proposed legislation will introduce two new offences: "aggravated vehicle taking", attracting a maximum prison sentence of five years and "causing death or grievous bodily injury by aggravated vehicle taking", which will attract a maximum prison sentence of 14 years. These tough new measures are part of the Government's overall strategy to specifically target and punish so-called "joy-riders".

 A great deal of work is being taken forward by the Department of Education in a range of areas to improve the levels of provision for children with learning difficulties, and in particular autism and dyslexia. While this represents a broad strategic approach, the Department is not engaged in a formal exercise to draw up a Strategy for People with Learning Disabilities.
<P>

<a name="40302w22.html_para8">In 2002, two Northern Ireland Education Task Groups published reports, with recommendations, on the future development of educational provision for children with autism and dyslexia. Following DE-led conferences on these areas in autumn 2002, Education and Library Boards (ELBs) have prioritised the reports' recommendations and consequently the Department has made &#163;270,000 available in 2003&#150;04 and up to &#163;540,000 in 2004&#150;05 to the ELBs to develop training needs and support measures in the field of Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD). An Inter Board ASD Group has been established, which will promote consistency of approach in relation to children with ASD across the five ELBs. A further &#163;500,000 was allocated in 2003&#150;04 to provide support and training for parents and staff in pre-school settings working with children with ASD.
<P>

<a name="40302w22.html_para9">DE led the collaborative North/South production of complementary parent and teacher videos/CD-ROMs and guidance material on autism. These were distributed widely across Northern Ireland in 2003. A dyslexia video/DVD ROM is also nearing completion by a joint North/South group and it is hoped to distribute this in the near future. The Education and Training Inspectorate is working to produce a "Dyslexia Friendly Schools" guide during 2004.

<P>
<a name="40302w22.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The cost of teaching staff is met from each school's budget. The number of teachers appointed and the management structure within a school is a matter for the Board of Governors of the school to determine, taking account of the school's policies, priorities and overall financial position.
<P>

<a name="40302w22.html_para11">In determining the amount to be made available for allocation to schools, account is taken of the likely change to the overall teacher salary bill arising from, among other things, pay settlements. Additional resources are made available for small schools with above average teacher salary costs.

<a name="40302w23.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The decision to rate vacant non-domestic property was informed by an analysis of the potential impact on deprived areas. It concluded that the impact is likely to be positive because such property tends to be concentrated in deprived areas and the effect of the measure will be to encourage owners to bring them back into use and occupation. This New TSN analysis was published with the policy paper in April 2003.
<P>

<a name="40302w23.html_para8">In line with the outcomes of the consultation exercise in 2002, the exemptions to the vacant rate will largely mirror those in the rest of the UK. They will cover the situation where the occupation or use of the property is restricted or prohibited in some way, or where the person would be liable only as a proxy for someone else. Property with a net annual value of less than &#163;2,000, property vacant for less than three months, and other properties such as listed buildings will also be exempt. It is also intended to exempt industrial property, that is factories, mines and quarries, from the vacant rate. However, standalone warehouses will not be exempt because, unlike industrial property, they can be readily converted and put on the market for sale or letting to a range of buyers or tenants.

 The Government does not produce forecasts for unemployment. The Northern Ireland economy has benefited from the stability generated by the UK's strong macroeconomic framework while the performance of the labour market in particular has proved resilient in the face of global economic uncertainty.

<a name="40302w24.html_para4">Current Labour Market Statistics show that employment is at record levels and claimant unemployment is at its lowest rates since the mid 1970s. According to the Labour Force Survey, however, figures for the period October to December 2003 show a rise in the rate to 6.3&nbsp;per cent. (48,000 people) from 5.6&nbsp;per cent. a year earlier. This is still 1.7 percentage points lower than the EU15 average.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will make an assessment of the impact on victims of crime of repeated adjournments of court proceedings at crown and magistrates' courts.  [157332]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 In the Crown court close management of ineffective trials by courts and other Criminal Justice System agencies has resulted in a reduction to 17.8&nbsp;per cent. in January 2004 from the baseline of 23&nbsp;per cent. set last year. Progress in the magistrates court has been slower, but is still 1.5&nbsp;per cent. better than the baseline, at 29.4&nbsp;per cent. in January.
<P>

<a name="40302w25.html_para0">Interviews with victims of crime have found that the inconvenience and emotional upheaval each adjournment causes reduces the likelihood that the victim will attend the next time.
<P>

<a name="40302w25.html_para1">The Government are addressing the problem of ineffective trials through the Effective Trial Management Programme, which will ensure cases are ready on the trial date. In addition, on 4&nbsp;February the Government announced a &#163;27&nbsp;million award for the "No Witness, No Justice" Project. This project will ensure victims and witnesses needs are taken into account so that they are more likely to attend on the date of trial.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what steps he is taking to reduce the number of unnecessary adjournments of court proceedings.  [157333]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Adjournments and ineffective hearings in criminal cases are often caused by poor case preparation. The Department for Constitutional Affairs is working with the Home Office and Crown Prosecution Service to reduce the number of ineffective trials and improve case preparation and progression, including through the Effective Trial Management Programme. All criminal courts have been directed to address the rate of ineffective trials.

 It is not possible to provide information in the form requested for the following reasons:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) work under the General Criminal Contract, carried out for hearings in the magistrates courts, is paid for by a different mechanism from hearings in the Crown court. Therefore there is no continuity of data which would readily enable us to identify total payments in cases heard in the magistrates court, and which are subsequently transferred to the Crown court and;</FONT></UL>
<P>

 In recent years the National Archives has developed many online services aimed at family historians, including the digitisation of wills from 1384 to 1858. This and other services are available on its website at: www.nationalarchives.gov.uk. It also operates a website which acts as a gateway for online family sources throughout the United Kingdom at www.familyrecords.gov.uk. The National Archives is determined to maintain this momentum through the development of its digitisation programmes and licensing agreements with commercial organisations.

<P>

Cancer&#151;ICD-9 140&#150;208; ICD-10 C00-C97;<P>

Ischaemic heart disease&#151;ICD-9 410&#150;414; ICD-10 120&#150;125;<P>

Falls&#151;ICD-9 E880-E888 excluding E887; ICD-10 W00-W19.<P>

<P>

<P>

<sup>(20)</sup> Persons aged 61 years and over.<P>

<P>

<sup>(21)</sup> Figures are based on deaths occurring in each calendar year.<P>

<P>

<sup>(22)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that data for cancer are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The data should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from cancer is described in a report published in May 2002.*<P>

<P>

<sup>(23)</sup> The data for falls for 1997 to 2000 exclude fractures of unspecified cause (ICD-9 E887), so data for these years are comparable to those for 2001 onwards. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from falls is described in an article published in August 2003.*<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w27.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Department recommends that adults participate in at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity, at least five days a week and that young people participate in physical activity of at least moderate intensity for one hour per day. Leisurely cycling (around 10 miles per hour) represents one way of meeting these recommendations.

<P>

<a name="40302w27.html_para5">Regular cycling improves fitness significantly, reducing the risk of obesity, strokes, coronary heart disease, certain types of cancer, diabetes and osteoporosis. There are also benefits for mental health, with evidence of reduced depression and stress, improved self-esteem and confidence in performing physical tasks.

<P>

 The Skills Strategy (published in July 2003) set out our plans for identifying skill needs across the economy.

<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para10">In relation to the particular areas highlighted:
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para11"><i>The construction industry and plumbing</i>
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para12">Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) are being established to identify and define the skills that employers need to raise productivity in all major sectors of the economy. Construction is one of four sectors pioneering new Sector Skills Agreements to deliver on this agenda.
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para13">Construction was highlighted as a priority curriculum area in "Success for All: Our Vision for the Future" the Government's strategy for reforming further education and training published in November 2002.
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para14">The 2003 National Employers Skills Survey shows the construction sector as having a relatively high number of skill shortage vacancies per employee in comparison to other sectors.
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para15">Forecast future requirements in the construction sector are of an annual net requirement between 2003 and 2007 of 54,000 construction workers and 6,000 plumbers. This is to replace both an ageing workforce and to meet an expansion of the sector.
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para16">Supply is expected to meet this increased future demand. In 2001/02 there were 49,000 vocational awards for construction and 11,000 for plumbing while the number of first-year construction trainees increased for the fifth year running in 2002/03.
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para17"><i>The NHS</i>
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para18">The NHS Plan acknowledged that shortages in human resources were the biggest constraint facing the NHS and set ambitious targets for increasing the NHS workforce. By March 2004 there will be 7,500 more consultants, 2,000 more GPs, 20,000 more nurses and 6,500 more therapists and other health professionals employed in the NHS than in 1999.
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para19">Furthermore, "Delivering the NHS Plan" included expected increases in the NHS work force. Between 2001 and 2008, we expect there to be increases of 35,000 nurses and midwives, 15,000 consultants and GPs and 30,000 therapists and scientists.
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para20"><i>The education system</i>
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para21">The Secretary of State for Education and Skills is responsible for ensuring an adequate supply of school teachers. Since 1997 there has been an increase of nearly 25,000 regular teachers in maintained schools in England. Recent improvements in recruitment to initial teacher training and innovative ways of remodelling the work force&#151;with support staff helping teachers to use their professional skills to greatest effect&#151;mean that supply is expected to continue to be sufficient. Alongside rising teacher numbers, there is also evidence of improving teacher quality.
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para22">The DfES liaises regularly with the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to ensure that the supply of teaching and learning is not adversely affected by labour shortage.
<P>

<a name="40302w29.html_para23">In addition, the DfES has responsibility&#151;following the publication of the Green Paper, "Every Child Matters"&#151;for children's services more broadly, including social care, and is currently developing its evidence base on the wider children's work force.

<P>

<a name="40302w30.html_para0">First, for them to consider those cases which are affected by the Attorney-General's Review. In those cases, councils should stand ready to act in the light of the outcome of that review.

These are cases where they have commenced care proceedings in relation to a child and where the court has not yet made a final care order. In these cases councils should consider with their lawyers the implications, for those proceedings, of the Court of Appeal's judgment in the Cannings case.
<P>

<a name="40302w30.html_para2">Thirdly, within the next 12 weeks social services should, together with their lawyers, identify those cases where a final care order was made in the past, which involved harm to the child or a sibling, and where the making of the care order depended, exclusively or almost exclusively, on a serious disagreement between medical experts about the cause of the harm. In such cases, councils should again consider, with their lawyers, whether there are now doubts about the reliability of the expert medical evidence. If that is so and, in the light of the child's current circumstances and current best interests, they should then consider whether to apply to the court for the care order to be discharged, or whether to support any application that may be made by the parents or the child. Councils, when reviewing cases, will also need to take into account any fresh case law judgments from the appeal court that may be relevant.

 The impact of Connexions on previously existing services has been tested through a survey of 'stakeholders'&#151;individuals and representatives of partner organisations on the Connexions Partnership Boards and Local Management Committees (e.g. local authorities, the police, health and social services, voluntary and community organisations and employers).
<P>

<a name="40302w30.html_para9">The survey of local partners in January 2003 found that a large majority (83&nbsp;per cent.) believed that the objectives of Connexions were consistent with those of their own organisation and over 60&nbsp;per cent. agreed that Connexions helped their organisation meet its own targets and objectives. Nearly eight out of 10 local partners thought that joint working between agencies providing services to young people in their areas was effective compared with 40&nbsp;per cent. prior to the establishment of Connexions Partnerships.

 From 1&nbsp;April 2004 local authorities will be under a statutory duty to provide sufficient nursery education for all three and 4-year-olds in their area. Local authorities have been encouraged through published guidance, to grow provision using a mixture of Maintained, Independent, Voluntary and Private providers to support parental choice and take into account the needs of children and families.

 The majority of capital support is allocated to schools and local education authorities (LEAs) by formula, and they decide how to invest it in line with the priorities of their asset management plans. The Department does not, therefore, have complete information about capital investment in individual schools. This information should be held locally. However, the following table shows the total capital support made available by this Government for school buildings in Blackpool LEA since 1998&#150;99 when Blackpool became a unitary authority.

The average time taken for a care case to pass through a Family Proceedings Court (FPC), which deals with about half of all cases of this type, is lower. Centrally held data does not record the longest waiting time. More complete and accurate figures for both FPCs and Care Centres will be available by the end of March.

 The Home Childcarer Scheme allows registered childminders to gain an additional approval to care for children in the children's home. This approval process does not involve an assessment of the children's home, where the carer is already registered by Ofsted as a child minder.

<P>
<a name="40302w32.html_spnew9"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The government are already investing significant sums in widening access to higher education, which will also increase the supply of potential postgraduate students. The additional funding available for science and research (up &#163;1.25&nbsp;million by 2005/06 compared to 2003/04) will also increase the volume of research and opportunities for postgraduate study. Financial support for postgraduate study is available through the Career Development Loan Scheme which is administered by my Department.

<P>

<a name="40302w33.html_para2">The Government's Manufacturing Strategy, which we developed in partnership with industry, trade unions and other stakeholders, aims to create a high value manufacturing sector in the UK with a highly skilled and well paid workforce, moving away from competing on the basis of low skill and low wages. We are continuing to develop a range of initiatives under the Skills Strategy such as employer training pilots, modern apprenticeships, the growing network of Sector Skills Councils and other measures to better deploy and retain skills to improve business performance.
<P>

<a name="40302w33.html_para3">Where there are significant redundancies in the manufacturing sector, the Rapid Response Service works to move people quickly into new jobs, preventing them from becoming detached from the labour market. Although a trend to declining manufacturing employment has been a feature of advanced economies over the last 30 years, new jobs are still being created all the time. Around 250,000 manufacturing vacancies were reported to Jobcentre plus in the last year. Overall the UK labour market is performing well, with total employment rising by nearly 1.7&nbsp;million since Spring 1997, and unemployment falling in every region in Britain over the past year.

 The Department for Education and Skills published extended schools guidance in October 2002. The guidance covers a range of practical issues, including information and advice on providing community access to sports facilities. A copy has been placed in the House of Commons Library.
<P>

<a name="40302w33.html_para4">The Department has made funding available to support local coordination and management of extended services in schools, and to create up to 240 full service extended schools, with at least one in each LEA area, by 2006. These schools will provide a prescribed core range of extended services and facilities, including sports and arts facilities.

The strategy promotes the extended use of school sports facilities, for example the Sport Partnerships programme is delivering increased out of school hours sports opportunities. Schools benefiting from the &#163;686&nbsp;million investment in the New Opportunities for PE and Sport and the Space for Sport and the Arts capital programmes are required to demonstrate how the new school sports facilities can be shared with other schools and opened up for community use.

 <i>[holding answer 27&nbsp;February 2004]:</i> Figures for the costs of education of children with special education needs (SEN) with and without statements are not collected separately.

<P>

<a name="40302w33.html_para9">The total estimated cost of providing special needs education in 2003&#150;04 is &#163;3,464,836,204. Of this, it is estimated that &#163;1,717,253,601 will be spent on pupils in mainstream schools, in addition to their normal place funding. An estimated &#163;1,511,349,567 will be spent on pupils in special schools. This includes pupils in maintained special schools and fees for pupils in independent and non-maintained special schools. In addition, an estimated &#163;236,233,036 will be spent in this financial year on centrally funded SEN activities.

This includes an element of corporate and charitable sponsorship raised through the new Partnership Fund, which was introduced in 2002 to support schools in raising sponsorship. Schools raise the rest of the required amount through a combination of fund-raising, charitable donations from parents and other activities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w34.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 I should clarify the situation regarding the Home Childcarers Scheme to which this question refers. The scheme was launched in April 2003 to extend eligibility to tax credits to families using childcare in their own homes. It does not impose a new accreditation requirement on home based carers&#151;seeking approval is entirely voluntary. Prior to the introduction of this scheme if a family needed to use childcare in their own home it was not possible to have this approved, or to access the childcare element of the Working Families Tax Credit.
<P>

<a name="40302w34.html_para0">Currently there are 124 Home Childcarers who have been approved, by Ofsted, to care for children in the children's home. Home Childcarers can be employed by more than one family so the number of families using a Home Childcarer is unknown.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w34.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 No parents have lost their entitlement to tax credits under this scheme. The purpose of the Home Childcarer Scheme is to extend the availability of tax credits rather than to restrict it.
<P>

<a name="40302w34.html_para1">Prior to the Home Childcarers Scheme parents using childcare in the child's home were not eligible to claim the childcare element of the Working Families Tax Credit (now replaced by the Working Tax Credit). The introduction of this scheme has enabled some parents to claim tax credits when before they were unable to do so.
<P>

<a name="40302w34.html_para2">This Government are committed to extending the Home Childcarers Scheme to carers other than registered childminders and to enable more parents to benefit from the help available through tax credits. We are committed to holding a consultation on the options for an extension in spring 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many asylum seeking households containing children or pregnant women were placed in bed and breakfast accommodation by the National Asylum Support Service under legislation other than the Housing Act 1996 and are as a consequence not included in the provisions of the Homelessness (Suitability of Accommodation) (England) Order 2003 in each of the last five years.

 Apart from Tanzania, we have not yet started any negotiations with other countries. These partnerships are not about processing asylum claims nearer to the country of origin. Rather the Tanzanians are helping us to establish whether certain failed asylum seekers in the United Kingdom who claimed as Somali are in fact Tanzanian. We are also seeking to help them better manage their own refugee caseload.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his Answer of 20&nbsp;January 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1205W, on animal welfare, ref 147328, with reference to recommendation 14, when the Inspectorate will be reviewed; and by whom.  [155934]<P>

<P>
<a name="40302w35.html_spnew0"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 In its report, published in July 2002, the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures recommended that the Home Office Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate should be subject to periodic review, by a body other than the Inspectorate itself. The Committee went on to describe the Inspectorate as a "trustworthy, professional body" and also acknowledged the valuable role that it has played in creating a culture of care in establishments licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.
<P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para0">In the Government's response, published in January 2003, we welcomed the Select Committee's endorsement of the integrity of the Inspectorate and of the important contribution that it has made to the welfare of animals in designated establishments. However, we recognise that public awareness of the valuable job done by the Inspectorate is poor and agree that this needs to be remedied. We have, therefore, concluded that there would be value in the Inspectorate publishing an annual report on its work. The Inspectorate's first annual report will be published in the autumn of 2004.
<P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para1">As to the periodic review of the Inspectorate, under Section 18 of the 1986 Act, Inspectors are responsible directly to the Secretary of State who is, in turn accountable to Parliament for their work. Inspectors are all medical or veterinary practitioners, as well as being civil servants, and are bound by medical or veterinary codes of professional conduct. In addition, in common with other Home Office staff, the Chief Inspector and members of the Inspectorate are subject to the civil service code and annual performance reviews as part of routine personnel management arrangements. In the light of these comprehensive arrangements, we do not believe that any further form of performance review is necessary. Members of the Inspectorate are highly professional and dedicated and have the complete confidence of Government Ministers.

Government and the scientific community should engage in a systematic and visible search for methods involving the 3Rs&#151;the replacement of animal use, reduction of the number of animals used and the refinement of the procedures involved to minimise suffering&#151;in toxicology and that the Government should nominate one department to take the lead on this.
<P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para2">In the Government's response to the Select committee's report, published in January 2003, we agreed that a systematic and visible effort is required. As a first step, the Home Office is currently leading a review of the scope for improving the application of the 3Rs and promoting research into alternatives through the Inter-Departmental Group on the 3Rs. Membership of the Inter-Departmental Group is drawn from the Home Office, the Department of Health, the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, the Department of Trade and Industry, the Office of Science and Technology, the Health and Safety Executive and other agencies.
<P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para3">The work of the group includes exploration of the case for a United Kingdom centre for research into the 3Rs, which was also recommended by the House of Lords Select Committee, a review of the implementation of the Inter-Departmental Data-Sharing Concordat, announced in August 2000, and the review and revision of the Guidelines on Regulatory Toxicology and Safety Evaluation Studies, published in February 2001, and the statement of principles concerning animal welfare endorsed by the Home Office and other regulatory authorities in 1999&#151;Annex 1 to the Regulatory Toxicology Guidelines.
<P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para4">I am currently considering the Inter-Departmental Group's further advice on the proposed United Kingdom centre for research into the 3Rs. I expect to receive the findings of the Inter-Departmental Group on the other two issues shortly and will then consider what further steps are required.

 In its report, published in July 2002, the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures recommended that the United Kingdom Government should use their influence to urge the European Union to make the development and validation of replacements for animal experiments a priority, particularly in toxicology.
<P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para6"><P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para7">In our response, published in January 2003, the Government noted the Select Committee's view and agreed that replacement should be the ultimate goal.

We are instead fully committed to the furtherance of all of the

<a name="40302w35.html_para8">United Kingdom Government Departments and agencies are involved in a number of specific initiatives in the European Union to develop, validate and incorporate more advanced test methods into regulatory practice. The Government also continue to support the work of the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) and the head of the Home Office Animals Scientific Procedures Division is now the United Kingdom representative on the ECVAM Scientific Advisory Committee and is contributing to discussions about the future direction of ECVAM's work. The Government also warmly welcome the liaison between ECVAM and its United States counterpart, the Interagency Co-ordinating Committee for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ICCVAM), as a means of achieving greater progress, more quickly and ensuring commitment from more than one economic region. Quick gains cannot necessarily be expected, but we shall continue our efforts to persuade other member states of the importance of progress on the 3Rs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w35.html_spnew3"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The aim of the stakeholder forum, which was held on 9&nbsp;January 2004, was to hold informed debate on the recommendations contained in the Animal Procedures Committee's (APC) report entitled "The use of primates under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986&#151;analysis of current trends with particular reference to regulatory toxicology". This in turn was to assist preparation of a ministerial response to the issues which the APC has raised.
<P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para9">The Home Office and the APC agreed that, in order to hold a focused debate, attendance at the forum should be limited to organisations with practical experience in the use of primates in scientific procedures, or with other particular expertise relevant to the report's recommendations.
<P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para10">Consequently, invitees included holders of related project licences issued under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, from both the commercial and academic sectors, as well as individuals from funding and regulatory organisations and other Government Departments. Groups with expertise in alternatives to animal experiments were also invited to send representatives.
<P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para11">It was decided that representatives from animal protection organisations such as Animal Aid and Europeans For Medical Advancement should not be invited to comment through this forum. Places at the forum were limited and the Home Office and the APC primarily wanted to test the technical basis and the practicalities of the recommendations with those experts in the use of primates best placed to contribute to such an exercise.

[156768]<P>

<P>

 There are 47 countries from which more than 1,000 applications have been made in the United Kingdom between 1999 and 2003. The countries and their numbers are contained in the list below. Of these countries, the United Kingdom has negotiated formal bilateral readmission agreements with Albania and Romania, which are currently being ratified. In addition, negotiations have commenced with Poland and will start shortly with Serbia and Montenegro. The European Commission has been mandated to negotiate Community readmission agreements on behalf of member states with Sri Lanka (negotiations have

been concluded and the agreement is being ratified), China, Turkey, Pakistan, Algeria, Albania, Russia and Ukraine. Bilateral and Community readmission agreements set out the process and evidence required for the re-documentation of returning nationals.
<P>

<a name="40302w35.html_para18">In addition, where it is our experience that a lack of documentation presents a barrier to removal to particular countries, the United Kingdom is working with the authorities of those countries to facilitate the process of identification and re-documentation of persons. These countries include Sri Lanka, India, Turkey, Somaliland, the Democratic Republic of Congo and China. Since October 2003 the United Kingdom has had a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding in operation governing returns to Afghanistan and very recently agreed with the Coalition Provisional Authority to effect returns to Iraq.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the cash seizures that have been effected by the Assets Recovery Agency since its inception; what the value seized in each case was; and whether the order was enforced.  [155962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w36.html_spnew0"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The Assets Recovery Agency has no power to seize and forfeit cash under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. This power is reserved to the police and Her Majesty's Customs and Excise. As at the end of January 2004 a total of 1,219 cash seizures with a total value of &#163;55.68&nbsp;million had been made in England and Wales since the powers came into force in December 2002. Cash seized can only be forfeited when a forfeiture order has been made by a magistrates' court. A total of 64 cash forfeitures have been made under the Act with a total value of &#163;2.98&nbsp;million. Details of individual cash seizures and forfeitures are not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="40302w36.html_para0">At present the minimum amount of cash which can be seized is &#163;10,000. The threshold is to be reduced to &#163;5,000 under The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Recovery of Cash in Summary Proceedings: Minimum Amount) Order 2004 which was laid before Parliament on 24&nbsp;February.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40302w36.html_spnew1"><B> Caroline Flint: </B> 
 The confiscation and restraint powers in the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 are triggered by offences committed after the provisions were brought into force on 24&nbsp;March 2003. It will therefore be some time before confiscation cases are dealt with by the Crown Court in numbers.

 Immigration Rules (HC 395 as amended) provide for anyone to be refused entry clearance or leave to enter to the United Kingdom who seeks entry for a purpose not covered by the Rules. The Rules provide for entry for the purpose of private medical treatment but not for NHS treatment. They further provide for an Immigration Office to take account of a Medical Inspector's assessment of the likely course of treatment in deciding whether a person seeking entry for private medical treatment has sufficient means at his disposal.

Audit work on the claim for 2002&#150;03 was delayed initially by work required to finalise the lists of asylum seekers eligible for support during the year. The due date for the completion of the 2002&#150;03 audit has been set at 31&nbsp;March 2004. At present the council are also investigating the exact amount of the outstanding balance for 2002&#150;03 and this may also delay the completion of the audit.
<P>

<a name="40302w37.html_para4">The instructions for 2003&#150;04 relating to Adults and Families were published in June 2003. The instructions for Unaccompanied Asylum Seeker Children (UASC) were published in January 2004.
<P>

<a name="40302w37.html_para5">The Home Office reimburses local councils for asylum support costs via a series of interim payments during the year. Kent county council submitted four interim claims in 2002&#150;03 and three for the year to date in 2003&#150;04. These have all been paid. The outstanding balance for 2002&#150;03 is subject to investigation as mentioned above. If it is agreed that a significant amount has not been covered by the interim claims in 2002&#150;03 then the Home Office is prepared to make a further payment against the final audited claim.
