<a name="90302w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Derek Twigg: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what plans he has for reform of Part 1 of the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act 1994.  [74713]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Dr. Jack Cunningham: </B> 
 The Government have reviewed the operation of the deregulation order-making power in Part 1 of the Act. We believe the safeguards in the process are proven, but that the legislative limitations on the application of this power restrict our ability to deal effectively with measures which are no longer needed, or which impose a greater burden than necessary.
<P>

<a name="90302w01.htm_para0">When Parliamentary time allows, the Government intend to extend the scope of the deregulation order-making process, whilst maintaining the statutory protection against its misuse. I am launching today an extensive public consultation on proposals for reform of this power. I have sent copies of the consultation document to all MPs and have placed copies in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="90302w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Estelle Morris </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> We are aware of the large pool of qualified teachers who are currently not active in the profession, and we are keen to maximise the number who are attracted back into teaching. Around 12,000 people do re-enter teaching in England and Wales every year. Over time, the proposals for better rewards, support and training in our Green

<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 612</I><P>
Paper, "Teachers--Meeting the challenge of change", will be key in boosting our ability to draw back former teachers.
<P>

<a name="90302w01.htm_para5">In the shorter term, the Teacher Training Agency funds a number of courses specifically designed to update the skills of returners and ease their way back into teaching. Last year, 618 returners made use of TTA-funded courses, and we have just increased the amount of funding available for these courses. The new network of local recruitment advisers I announced last October are working to promote these courses and find other creative ways of targeting returners. We also changed the pensions abatement provision last year to introduce greater flexibility for retired teachers considering a return to work. It is too early to assess the impact of these initiatives, but we will be evaluating their effect later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact on his Department's policies 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 616</I><P>
of the goods and services provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to be implemented in October 1999.  [71274]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We are acting to ensure that the Department's policies meet the needs of disabled people and that we comply with our legal requirements. The Department already takes positive steps to make it easier for disabled people to make use of its services. We shall continue to do so, not only by complying fully with new duties in the Disability Discrimination Act but by aiming to exceed them where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="90302w02.htm_para5">The Department issued internal guidance recently on mainstreaming which ensures that all new and existing policies and programmes are assessed for any adverse impact not only on disabled people, but on any minority or disadvantaged group. That includes the need to ensure that our policies and their outcomes comply with the law. Where necessary we shall act to remove or reduce the impact on these groups. This complements the guidance "Policy Appraisal for Equal Treatment" which the Cabinet Office issued to all Government Departments in November 1998, and which was signed jointly by the Minister for Women, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Home Secretary.
<P>

<a name="90302w02.htm_para6">The Departmental Board monitors the Department's performance and will publish information on the progress being made in this area, as will other Government Departments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 I have today placed in the Library of the House a list of the reviews, task forces and advisory groups that have been established by my Department since 1 May 1997 and the reports which they have published. Information on costs incurred to date cannot be provided except at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="90302w02.htm_para7">Non-Departmental Public Bodies have not been included, since information on these is provided in the publication "<i>Public Bodies 1998</i>" which is available in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Although records are not kept of the methods of transport used on official visits, Ministers have used London Underground on a number of occasions over the last six months, as well as buses, taxis and walking.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para0">In addition to using London Underground for their official duties, Ministers in my Department use it regularly in their private lives.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w03.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had with London borough councils on the development of cycle lanes within their boroughs; and if he will make a statement.  [72774]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 In the Transport Policies and Programme settlement for 1999-2000, announced on 17 December last year, authorities were advised on the priorities for developing the London Cycle Network. In the coming year they should continue to take a more strategic approach, with the overall aim of encouraging more people to cycle in London.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para1">All the London Boroughs have been involved with the development of the LCN, with the Royal London Borough of Kingston upon Thames acting as the overall co-ordinating authority. Through TPP funding good progress has been made on the LCN, with over 1000km of cycle routes already available for use.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para2">The intention is to produce an initial network by April 2000--to be launched alongside the London part of the Thames Cycle Route--that will be of a standard to facilitate cycling in London and provide a satisfactory base for taking forward and completing the LCN in future years.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para3">Advice on the prioritisation of cycling provisions was also included in the guidance recently issued to Local Authorities in London, on the preparation of their Interim Transport Plans, for the 2000-01 bidding round.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para4">I have consistently raised the issue of cycle provisions during visits to various London Boroughs over the last 18 months, and my officials will continue to attend regular meetings of the London Cycle Network steering group, and of the Borough Cycling Officers' Group. Progress reports, including information monitoring the usage on newly completed cycle routes, will be discussed with the boroughs.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w03.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will instruct local authorities in London to create trial cycle lanes along main thoroughfares.  [73473]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend does not have the power to issue such an instruction. The London Boroughs are responsible for deciding whether cycle lanes or other measures should be provided on their local roads.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para5">My Department publishes Traffic Advisory Leaflets on the results of research projects carried out into traffic management issues--including facilities to encourage cycling. In addition, there already exists a design manual, produced by the LCN lead authority, to encourage good practice in the establishment of cycle lanes and other cycling measures.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w03.htm_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Dunwoody: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans the Government have to create additional passenger transport executives.  [73172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w03.htm_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The power to establish PTEs was removed under s57 of The Transport Act 1985. The need for more PTA/Es was considered in the lead-up to the White Paper. 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 618</I><P>
PTA/Es were established because of the heavy reliance on public transport in the metropolitan conurbations outside London. They have co-operated closely with the metropolitan district councils (the highway authorities) to produce joint local transport strategies under the package approach.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para6">Shires and Unitary Authorities have the same public transport powers as PTA/Es (except for the special duty which PTEs have for local rail services which reflects the high number of local rail services in the metropolitan areas). Shires and Unitaries are, therefore, ideally placed to produce integrated local transport plans for their areas.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para7">The creation of additional Passenger Transport Executives would require primary legislation. The Government have no plans for any such legislation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations his Department has received in the past six months from <i>(a)</i> Communities Against Nuclear Transport and <i>(b)</i> other community groups concerning the safety of the rail transport of spent nuclear fuel and nuclear wastes.  [72964]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w03.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 This Department has received <i>(a)</i> one letter from Communities Against Nuclear Transport (Brent Terrace Residents Association) and <i>(b)</i> eight letters from other community groups on these subjects.

<P>
<a name="90302w03.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The 1997 CITES Conference decided by a two thirds majority to transfer the elephants of Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe from Appendix I to Appendix II of the Convention. The Conference also agreed a one-off experimental export of stockpiled ivory to Japan to raise revenue for conservation and community development projects in the African countries concerned, provided that the CITES Standing Committee, which the UK now chairs, was content that strict conditions had been met.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para8">At its 41st meeting last month, the Standing Committee examined a report prepared by the CITES Secretariat on verification missions made to each of the four countries concerned. The report concluded that the conditions had been met by all the countries except Botswana. After careful consideration of the report, the Standing Committee endorsed the CITES Secretariat's conclusions and agreed that Namibia and Zimbabwe should be authorised to sell and ship 13.8 and 20 tonnes of ivory respectively to Japan on or after 18 March 1999. The proceeds from the sales must be directed towards conservation and community development projects. Botswana cannot participate until full compliance has been verified by the CITES Secretariat.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para9">The resumption of commercial trade is limited to this one-off trial shipment. There is no possibility of further shipments being made without the express permission of a future Conference of CITES Parties. The shipments themselves will be closely monitored by the CITES Secretariat who will ensure compliance with marking and registering requirements.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para10">As part of the agreement, the CITES Secretariat had already established a reporting and monitoring procedure to assess illegal hunting and trade in elephants and elephant products. At the February meeting, the Standing Committee endorsed new measures, which the Government fully supported, to build on this by providing two new elephant monitoring systems. The United Kingdom has already offered to provide the first year's funding for the Elephant Trade Information System (ETIS) which will monitor legal and illegal trading in ivory. At the meeting, the European Union, United States and Japan pledged substantial funding towards the second part of the system, MIKE, (Monitoring of Illegal Killing of Elephants), which will involve tracking, analysis and assessment of illegal killing and trends in poaching on a representative sample of sites across Africa and south Asia.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para11">In addition, the Standing Committee agreed a mechanism to reinstate the elephant populations currently listed on Appendix II, to Appendix I of CITES if there is evidence of increased poaching or failure by any of the Parties concerned to comply with the conditions set by the 1997 Conference.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para12">The Government believe that the proper implementation of the new pan-African and Asian elephant trade and poaching monitoring systems, together with the early warning system agreed at the meeting, should protect the elephant against the risk of any escalation in poaching caused by the very limited ivory trade agreed by CITES Parties. As Chair of the CITES Standing Committee, we will, along with the CITES Secretariat and others, continue to monitor the situation in Africa closely.




<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 620</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para13">The decisions taken at the last CITES Conference also addressed the problem of rising ivory stockpiles elsewhere in Africa. The risk posed by these stocks, which are difficult and expensive to protect, is frequently overlooked. For the first time, CITES has put in place a system for registering and auditing stocks and encouraging donors to buy them up for non-commercial purposes with the proceeds being re-invested in conservation trust funds established for that purpose. In practice, this is likely to mean destruction of much of these ivory stockpiles.
<P>

<a name="90302w03.htm_para14">I recently announced that the Government are willing to offer up to &#163;60,000 to fund new elephant conservation work in return for disposal of part of these ivory stockpiles. We hope that other donors--including conservation organisations--will also come forward to take stockpiled ivory out of the system and at the same time raise revenue for elephant conservation.

<P>
<a name="90302w04.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 This Government take very seriously the implementation of the Joint Aviation Requirements on Flight Crew Licensing (JAR-FCL,) in order to harmonise the standards for licensing pilots in the 29 member states of the Joint Aviation Authorities (JAA). The requirements will enable pilots to operate aircraft up to the age of 65 years either as Pilot-in-Command or Co-Pilot, provided that only one pilot in the crew is 60 or over.
<P>

<a name="90302w04.htm_para9">It will be for individual states to decide how to implement JAR-FCL with respect to their airspace, but we have urged JAA states to apply it consistently.

 Over 90 per cent. of the funding for Regional Development Agencies in 1999-2000 will be in respect of the regeneration programmes which they will inherit from the Government Offices for the Regions, English Partnerships and the Rural Development Commission. The distribution of those resources is determined largely by statistical indicators of need.

<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 623</I><P>
and 18 per cent. of bridleways were poor or unusable at some point on their length. Horse riders and cyclists found that 25 per cent. of bridleways were difficult to use. 25 per cent. of footpaths equates to about 20,500 miles, and 25 per cent. of bridleways represents about 4,600 miles.
<P>

<a name="90302w04.htm_para12">Wales has a total of 24,850 miles of rights of way. Between 1992 and 1998, 7,215 miles were surveyed and it was found that 23 per cent. of footpaths were blocked or difficult to use. This equates to 5,716 miles of the total. No comparable figures are available for bridleways due to the statistically small proportion surveyed.

<P>

<a name="90302w05.htm_para0">In collaboration with the Passenger Transport Executives, guidelines were published by the Department several years ago on the design of accessible public transport infrastructure, including bus stops. We have recently commissioned consultants to review that material and to draw up comprehensive guidance for transport operators and local authorities to help them to introduce good practice in making infrastructure accessible both to optimise the transport provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act and to prepare for the full introduction of Part III of the Act which covers access to goods, services and facilities.

 We had extensive and regular discussions with both Railtrack and the rail operating companies in developing the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 1998 which were introduced on 1 November 1998. Those regulations, which apply to new rolling stock coming into service from 1 January this year, will ensure new trains and trams are accessible to disabled people, including those who need to travel in a wheelchair.

 One letter has been received making such representations. Copies of this same letter have also been forwarded by six Members of Parliament. The Health and Safety Commission initiated an eight-week consultation on 24 November 1998 on proposals to charge for activities conducted under the proposed Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations (COMAH). The consultation document included details of the charging proposals, chargeable activities, the methodology used for calculating charges, the likely impact of charging on industry and illustrative examples of charges for a range of COMAH establishments.

<a name="90302w05.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Two letters have been received making such representations. Copies of one of these have also been forwarded by six Members of Parliament. The current projection is that the overall charges to industry, for the performance of the functions placed on the Competent Authority under the proposed Control of Major Accident Hazards Regulations (COMAH), will amount to approximately &#163;6 million in 1999-2000, and &#163;6.6 million in 2000-01 and 2001-02. It is not possible at this stage to separate out the costs of charging likely to be borne by the fuel supply and distribution and liquefied petroleum gas industries from those of other industries. The COMAH charging consultative document provided illustrative examples of the likely charges for different, typical types of establishment to enable operators to estimate their costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w07.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 No targets have yet been set. For the police service broadly to reflect the minority ethnic population of England and Wales, there would need to be an overall ethnic minority representation of at least 6 per cent. Each force will be asked to set targets for recruitment, retention and progression for ethnic minority officers. Force targets will have regard to ethnic composition of the community served.
<P>

<a name="90302w07.htm_para0">The minority ethnic population in Cumbria is approximately 0.4 per cent. of the total population of the area. Inevitably, this will mean that targets for this area will be below the national average.

 The police service needs to reflect the communities it serves, which means that, taking England and Wales as a whole, the aim should be for minority ethnic representation of at least six per cent. Not all minority ethnic residents in an area will be eligible to join the police, but it is unlikely that the number of asylum seekers measured against the total population will have a significant impact on targets.

 I have no plans to establish an independent judicial inquiry into the decision not to bring to trial the three men arrested in connection with the murders of PC Patrick Dunne and Mr. William Danso in Clapham on 20 October 1993. Following the arrest and charging of the three men, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) sought the opinion of Treasury Counsel, who advised that there was insufficient evidence to proceed with the charges of murder and conspiracy to murder. During the course of the investigation where further evidence was discovered, this opinion was re-examined by Counsel, but it was concluded that there was still insufficient evidence for a realistic prospect of convictions, a conclusion accepted by the CPS and the Metropolitan Police Service.
<P>

<a name="90302w07.htm_para7">I understand from the Metropolitan police that whilst this investigation remains an active inquiry, no new evidence has since come to light which would cause either the CPS or Counsel to reconsider their opinion.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 15 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>518</i>, if he will estimate the effect of adopting an upper limit for the Phoenix-based survey on time between arrest and sentence for persistent young offenders to take into account the effect of the minority of cases which may be protracted for reasons outside the control of case management.  [74219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w08.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 On the basis of information currently held, it is not possible to calculate the number of cases where progress is protracted for reasons outside the control of case management. It is not possible to estimate the effect of adopting an upper limit for the Phoenix-based survey which would only exclude such cases. Any upper limit imposed would be likely to exclude cases affected by unnecessary delay, and would not be consistent with the Government's intention to reduce delay in all cases involving persistent young offenders.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will provide a breakdown of the figures used to calculate the benchmark figure of 142 days for the pledge to halve the time between arrest and sentence for persistent young offenders.  [74212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w08.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The calculation for the figure of 142 days from arrest to sentence was based on a representative sample of almost 1,500 occasions on which slightly over 900 persistent young offenders were sentenced for almost 4,500 offences during 1996, across England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="90302w08.htm_para2">The dates on which the sampled persistent young offenders were sentenced were obtained from the Police National Computer, Phoenix. As Phoenix does not generally hold arrest dates, this information was obtained directly from police forces. The date of arrest for each sentencing occasion was defined as the earliest date of arrest (or date of laying of information) and was collected in respect of each offence for which a sentence was passed. Once this information had been added, the time from arrest to sentence was calculated on the basis of the difference (in calendar days) between the date of sentence and the date of arrest (or laying of information). The national baseline is the mean arrest to sentence time for the sampled sentencing occasions.

 The UK strongly welcomed the report from the External Evaluation on the IMF's Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) when it was presented to the IMF Executive Board last year. In particular, we welcomed the report's findings on the need to implement a new approach to address the social impact of ESAF programmes, on the need for better and more effective collaboration between the IMF and World Bank, and on the importance of ownership to the success of programmes. We encouraged the publication of the external report to promote further public discussion of its findings.
<P>

<a name="90302w09.htm_para6">We have been working at the IMF to ensure that the findings of the external report are used to strengthen ESAF programmes. We welcomed the IMF's paper on "Distilling the Lessons from the ESAF reviews", supported its decision to implement a new approach to ESAF on a pilot basis, and have encouraged the Fund to go further and incorporate the lessons of the review in all ESAF programmes. We will continue to work to ensure that the lessons of the review are fully addressed.

 <i>[holding answer 16 February 1999]:</i> In Northern Ireland health and social services have been provided within an integrated structure since 1972. Eleven of the existing 19 HSS Trusts provide health and social services on an integrated basis, some on a model similar to the Down Lisburn Trust. As part of the modernisation of the service, the Government are examining responses to their recent consultation paper on the structure of health and social services entitled "Fit for the Future". Decisions on future arrangements will be taken by the Northern Ireland Assembly.

The Department of Trade and Industry plans to issue a consultation paper on the review shortly. Northern Ireland Orders have already been made for 32mw of contracted renewable capacity and consideration will be given to a further Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation competition in Northern Ireland on completion of the review. In addition, the EU supported Energy Demonstration Scheme and INTERREG Programme, continue to offer financial assistance to the developers of new and renewable energy projects.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Unfortunately, it is not possible to provide the details requested because records are not currently held centrally about the amount of waste generated or what happens to it.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, the position will change as the 1978 Order is superseded by the Waste and Contaminated Land (NI) Order 1997. This Order is being brought into operation through a series of Commencement Orders, three of which have been made since August 1998. Two requirements of the Order are that the Department prepares a waste strategy for Northern Ireland as soon as possible, and that District Councils prepare and agree with the Department, waste management plans which take account of the strategy.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To this end the Department produced a draft Waste Management Strategy which was issued for public consultation between June and December 1998. We expect that, subject to consideration by the Assembly, the statutory Strategy will be finalised later this year. It will include targets for waste minimisation, recovery and recycling.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, for these targets to be effective and realistic, it will be necessary to establish a baseline on how much waste is currently produced, its composition and what happens to it. Therefore, the Department has recently awarded a contract for the completion of a detailed study of Waste Arisings in Northern Ireland. This will provide comprehensive data on the various waste streams by sector, composition and volume. In conjunction with this, the Department will shortly let a further contract for a Waste Characterisation study which will involve the actual sampling of waste collected. The results of these two studies will inform District Councils' development of their Plans and will be available for public information.</FONT></UL>

This latter correspondence includes letters addressed to The Queen, the Prime Minister, the Secretary of State for Defence and other Defence Ministers as well as direct approaches to officials in those branches dealing with campaign medals. In addition, I was handed a petition containing some 20,000 names in support of a medal for service in the Suez Canal Zone during the early 1950s at a meeting in March 1998, where the case for a medal was discussed in detail.

 In the last five years 268 requests for the Africa General Service Medal 1902-56 have been received by my Department. Of these applications, 95 were successful and medals with the appropriate clasp(s) issued.

The medal is not issued alone, but with the appropriate clasp, which recognises specific periods of service in areas laid down in the appropriate Command Paper. No clasp to the Africa General Service Medal 1902-56 was instituted for service north of the Sahara.

<P>
<a name="90302w13.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1999]:</i> An investment appraisal into a number of collocation options demonstrated that collocation of the Defence Vetting Agency (DVA) from its existing four locations on to a single site would represent value for money. Subsequent studies showed that there was little, in financial terms, to choose between Hartham and York, as a location for the DVA.
<P>

<a name="90302w13.htm_para7">Meanwhile, it became apparent that the Defence Communications Services Agency (DCSA) needed additional office accommodation near its headquarters at Corsham, and the Hartham site would meet this requirement. I therefore decided to accept collocation of the DVA at York as being in the best interests of my Department overall, as well as meeting the needs of the DVA.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 1999]:</i> Under the Smart Procurement Initiative developed as part of the Strategic Defence Review, MOD is reviewing its relationships with all its suppliers to ensure that the relationship is of mutual benefit to each party. Where appropriate, this includes examining the potential for establishing preferred supplier arrangements. For British Aerospace, and Royal Ordnance in particular, we are looking into the ways by which Royal Ordnance could become the preferred MOD supplier for a number of types of ammunition, where the company has shown through competition, that it can offer a cost effective product.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement about the future of the Royal Ordnance Plant, Glascoed.  [73546]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w14.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Royal Ordnance factory at Glascoed is a major recipient of work stemming from the award to Royal Ordnance in December 1998 of the &#163;100 million large calibre training ammunition multi year buy. While the future of Glascoed is a matter for the company, the terms governing the sale of the Royal Ordnance Factories to British Aerospace require the Ministry of Defence to be informed of any intention by the company to relinquish any major asset.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assistance was given by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency to Somchem/Denel in preparing its tender for the modular charge system contract recently awarded to them.  [73390]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w14.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 February 1999]:</i> No assistance was given by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, DERA, to Somchem/Denel in preparing its tender for the Modular Charge System sub-contract. DERA's only role in this procurement was to work, under tasking form the MOD, to provide independent technical advice on the submissions from each company participating in the competition, which were provided through the prime contractor, and to organise the associated firing trials.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence in calculating the savings to be achieved from awarding 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 660</I><P>
the modular charge system contract to Somchem/Denel what account he took of <i>(a)</i> possible qualification costs to be incurred in the future by other suppliers of propellants, <i>(b)</i> the cost of the loss of the Bishopton factory as a competitor for the supply of propellants, <i>(c)</i> the cost of extra stocks of propellant needed to offset the risks to supply associated with a foreign competitor and <i>(d)</i> the cost of any failure to supply by Denel.  [73392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w14.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 February 1999]:</i> The Somchem charge was a clear winner of the Modular Charge System sub-contract competition. The implications of this outcome were considered very carefully, including the cost of qualifying alternative sources of propellant, as necessary, should Royal Ordnance close the site at Bishopton. We are confident in the security of supply from Somchem, and do not consider that additional propellant stocks are required. The contracting arrangements will, as is normal for MOD contracts, protect our financial position in the event of any default by the contractor. There are sufficient alternative suppliers of propellant in friendly and reliable countries overseas to facilitate competition and we do not consider, therefore, that prices will necessarily rise in future if Bishopton closes.

 In the Strategic Defence Review White Paper, we announced that we believed that there would be advantages to be gained from having a single tri-Service Act governing discipline in the Armed Forces.
<P>

<a name="90302w14.htm_para0">Clearly, all three Services will be heavily involved in the project and there will be extensive consultation with them as work proceeds. Furthermore, as Service law frequently mirrors the civilian criminal law, it will be necessary to involve other Government departments with an interest in our proposals.

<a name="90302w14.htm_para1">However, this project will be a substantial undertaking and it will be some time before the nature of the changes, and hence the scope for wider consultation, are determined.

 There are presently 8,666 personnel trained as combat engineers in the army, 1,100 officers and 7,566 soldiers, of whom 413 are trained in explosive ordnance disposal, which encompasses landmine clearance. The information on these numbers for 1994 is not readily available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, it is unlikely to differ significantly from the current figures.

<a name="90302w16.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 A company of 100 personnel from 42 Commando conducted late autumn training in Romania during October 1997. I understand that some 60 Romanian personnel also participated in the exercise. This was the third annual deployment by the Royal Marines to Brasov in the Carpathian mountains. This exercise enabled the Royal Marines to continue to develop their mountain and cold weather operational capability, and also gave them an excellent opportunity to conduct environmental training outside the usual NATO training areas. A further significant benefit was to further the United Kingdom's bilateral defence relationship with Romania, which has developed significantly in recent years, through joint training and patrolling exercises with Romanian mountain troops.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence on 4 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>626</i>. The MOD is currently in discussion with a number of companies, including Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd., as part of the investigation into options for the storage of decommissioned submarines. The results of the investigation, which are expected to be available by mid-1999, will address all relevant issues, including safety and any requirement for additional facilities for the dry storage of reactor compartments. The decommissioned submarines at Rosyth are regularly and independently monitored. Evidence to date shows that external radiation levels are well within permissible limits.

 Deaths which occur during an operation, or before recovery from anaesthetic, must be reported to the coroner, who may order a post mortem examination to establish the cause of death. Such examinations may 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 672</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90302w18.htm_para0">Although the main organs will be returned to the body wherever possible before burial or cremation, in most cases the time necessary to perform the laboratory tests would cause long and unacceptable delay to the funeral.

<a name="90302w18.htm_para2">The National Screening Committee (NSC) has considered the case for extending the National Health Service breast screening programme to older women. The view of the NSC was that the first priority must be to ensure that all women are screened at three yearly intervals and to maintain the quality of the existing programme. The NSC acknowledged the promising nature of the interim results of the pilot studies for extending

Some of the drugs may be used for other conditions and it is not possible to split the cost between drugs used to treat asthma and those used to treat other conditions.

<a name="90302w18.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> There have been no reports of United Kingdom doctors receiving payments from a pharmaceutical company to prescribe drugs. Regulations which came into force in 1994 prohibit the promise, offer or supply of gifts or other inducements to persons qualified to prescribe or supply medicines. It is also an offence for health professionals to solicit or accept such gifts. Guidelines on the promotion of medicines are contained also in the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry Code of Practice for the Pharmaceutical Industry, which is administered by the Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority, copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90302w18.htm_para3">The Medicines Control Agency wrote to all pharmaceutical companies and professional bodies in 1997 reminding them of their legal obligations and our policy of not tolerating unlawful promotions which seek to exert improper influences on prescribers. The public have a right to expect that health care professionals will make decisions solely on the basis of their patients' interests and not on incentives to prescribe or supply certain medicines.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what training provided by his Department is currently available to NHS general practitioners on the possible causes of allergies and their treatment.  [74293]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w18.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The medical education curriculum is a matter for the General Medical Council, medical schools, the relevant Medical Royal Colleges and, in the case of general practice, the Joint Committee on Postgraduate Training for General Practice. These bodies have a vested interest in ensuring that doctors are prepared for the conditions and circumstances they will encounter in hospitals and in general practice.
<P>

<a name="90302w18.htm_para4">Each trainee general practitioner during their year of general practice training, their two year hospital rotation and during their pre-registration year, will almost certainly see patients with allergy related illnesses. Doctors are also encouraged to continue with their medical education after qualification and they would be expected to spend some time developing their knowledge of illnesses commonly encountered including allergic conditions.
<P>

<a name="90302w18.htm_para5">In addition, there is a range of advice and guidance available to general practitioners and other health professionals on allergies. This includes advice on the management of anaphylaxis which the Department sent to all doctors in 1994 in Chief Medical Officer's Update No. 2.

<a name="90302w19.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 As at 31 March 1998, there were seven local authorities that did not directly run residential care homes for older people (including those who are mentally infirm). The authorities were Bromley, City of London, Knowsley, Somerset, Stockport, Tameside and Wandsworth. This information is taken from the Department of Health's statistical collection RA1998, Form A, Part 1. Data for 1999 will become available later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w19.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Current expert advice is that the gamma knife has been overtaken by new linear accelerator technology (the linac scalpel), which can provide a greater range of treatments. Consequently, in January the NHS Executive agreed, with Sheffield Health Authority and the Central Sheffield University Hospitals NHS Trust, that a migration plan would be devised. This will enable the phasing in of the linear accelerator technology over a three year period whilst continuing the gamma knife service, achieving both continuity and modernisation as the linear accelerator technology comes on stream. The migration plans have been received and a business case will be considered shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w19.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Local outbreaks of meningococcal meningitis and septicaemia are managed by local Consultants in Communicable Disease Control who, in conjunction with any outbreak control team, are responsible for providing advice and information to schools and to parents and for organising any local action in the event of a case of meningococcal disease. Guidance on handling outbreaks in schools was published in the Public Health Laboratory Service's Communicable Disease Report on 10 January 1997, copies of which are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90302w19.htm_para11">The Department's public education programme provides reliable factual information for parents and young people on spotting meningococcal infection, including how to do the "glass test" to check rashes, through a Departmental leaflet entitled "Knowing about meningitis and septicaemia", available from general practitioners' surgeries. The Department also funds the Health Education Authority to produce public information about meningococcal disease, including a tailor-made leaflet for students called "Look out for your mate" (of which around 1 million copies were distributed through universities and colleges last year), the booklet "A Guide to Childhood Immunisations", which goes to parents of new born children, and a book "Birth to Five" given to new parents. In addition the Department collaborates with the two meningitis charities, the National Meningitis Trust and the Meningitis Research Foundation, to raise public and professional awareness.

<P>
<a name="90302w20.htm_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 UK's contributions to the European Commission are subject to reporting and audit requirements. In 1998, EC expenditure (combined DG1A, DG1B, DGVIII, ECHO) on mines action totalled some 50.7 million euros (approximately &#163;36 million) for programmes in 11 countries, and for research and development, and contribution to ICRC's Mines Appeal. The share attributable to the UK was &#163;5.4 million.
<P>

<a name="90302w20.htm_para3">During the UK's Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 1998, we worked closely with member states to achieve more targeted discussions on European Union (EU) mine action within the EU Working Group on Disarmament and Security (CODUN); we urged greater transparency and accountability of European Commission (EC) activities and the implementation of the EU Joint Mine Action Programme.

<a name="90302w20.htm_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 From May 1997 to date, about &#163;720,000 has been spent on assessment trials of prototypes and full field trials of equipment for anti-personnel mine detection and clearance, preliminary vegetation clearance and operator safety tests.

 All the Department for International Development-funded projects work to the United Nations standard for humanitarian mine clearance which aims for a minimum 99.6 per cent. clearance on verification. This ensures that cleared land can be used with confidence by the beneficiaries. Mine awareness is normally included within projects to reduce risk to communities in areas where clearance has not been completed. We look for opportunities to use appropriate technology within our projects to increase clearance rates while achieving the high standards required for humanitarian mine clearance activities.

<P>
<a name="90302w21.htm_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Our bilateral development assistance to the Pacific is provided from a single regional programme (total spending will be around &#163;3.75 million in the current financial year). In the particular case of Tuvalu, the view was taken following Independence in 1978 that we could best assist that country's development through the establishment of a Trust Fund to help meet both recurrent and capital expenditure. The Fund was established in 1987 with contributions of &#163;3.2 million each from Britain, Australia and New Zealand. With prudent management, the Fund has since grown substantially in real terms, while providing a reliable source of funds for the Government of Tuvalu.
<P>

<a name="90302w21.htm_para0">Tuvalu is also eligible for awards from a Pacific-wide allocation of the Department for International Development (DFID) and The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) funding for Chevening Scholarships. Three such awards

have been made over the past five years. In addition, Tuvalu benefits from the support we give to regional institutions (such as the University of the South Pacific, the South Pacific Forum and the Pacific Community) and from our contributions to multilateral agencies (including notably the European Development Fund) active in the region.

 Neither my right hon.

We will be taking all available steps to secure an extension of the EP franchise to Gibraltar. We can do this only by amending the 1976 EC Act on Direct Elections. This will require the agreement of all EU member states. HMG will seek such an amendment in the current negotiations in Brussels on establishing Common Principles for EP elections.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if his Department is requiring Elf Exploration plc to carry out further drilling operations in Poole Bay.  [74055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w23.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Petroleum Licence covering block 98-12 in Poole Bay was awarded in 1991 with an obligation on the licensees to drill at least three exploration wells. The first of these was drilled in 1993, south east of the location of the well currently under discussion. This was unsuccessful and the licensees asked 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 690</I><P>
for all the outstanding work obligations to be waived. A waiver was granted in respect of one of the wells, but my Department took the view that the other should be drilled in order to fully explore the potential of the licensed area.
<P>

<a name="90302w23.htm_para0">The current licence operator, Elf Exploration UK plc, has been preparing to seek consent to a further well to test a small structure which lies between the first well on the licence and the Wytch Farm oil field, but has now sought my Department's agreement to waive the outstanding commitments and relinquish the licence. This request is being considered and a response will be given as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w23.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Last week I announced 3 major new PV initiatives:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) a call for proposals for the development of PV components and systems, with the aim of enhancing the competitiveness of UK companies;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) a field trial for around 100 homes across the country to test a variety of actual PV installations under UK conditions;</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) development of a scheme to demonstrate the use of PV in large-scale building applications.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90302w23.htm_para1">The total value of these initiatives is expected to be &#163;15 million, with &#163;5 million coming from the DTI. In the case of the demonstration scheme the final go-ahead will have to await the outcome of the Renewables Review, on which I expect to issue a Consultation Paper shortly.
<P>

<a name="90302w23.htm_para2">These new initiatives are in addition to the work on solar photovoltaics that my Department is already funding (under the DTI's New and Renewable Energy Programme, the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council PV R&D programme, and the Foresight Scolar Programme), and will be taken forward in consultation with the PV and building industries.

 There are over 500 companies involved in renewable energy in the UK, which are estimated to employ some 3,500 people directly. These companies include manufacturers, developers, consultants, and operators.
<P>

<a name="90302w23.htm_para3">Statistics for European Countries are not generally available. In the EU White Paper--<i>Energy For the Future: Renewable Sources of Energy</i>--the Commission cites the example of the wind energy sector which it estimates has created 30,000 jobs in Europe. The White Paper also states that if the contribution of renewables to energy supply in Europe were to double from the current 6 per cent. to 12 per cent. by 2010 it would create at least 500,000 jobs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the accessibility of the plutonium in MOX fuel contained in BNFL shipments to Japan for the purposes of making nuclear weapons.  [73211]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w23.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The process by which MOX fuel is made combines the uranium and plutonium in such a way that separation by physical means is not possible. To recover plutonium from MOX fuel would require a chemical separation process requiring complex and highly specialised plant, equipment and skills. Very stringent physical protection and safeguards measures are applied to MOX fuel at all times to prevent its theft or diversion.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w23.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Responsibility within Government for the security of MOX shipments rests with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. Consultations between DTI and other Government Departments, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry of Defence, have continued in the normal way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w24.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what representations he has received regarding proposed oil extraction near St. Kilda; and if he will make a statement.  [69388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w24.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I have received correspondence from environmental groups, members of the public and hon. Members expressing concern about the impact of petroleum extraction on St. Kilda, and about the potential contribution to climate change of continuing exploitation of fossil fuels.
<P>

<a name="90302w24.htm_para0">There is no evidence that either the offer of petroleum licences in the Atlantic or activity under such licences has compromised the environmental sensitivity of the area, jeopardised the status of any World Heritage Sites or harmed any particular species or habitat.
<P>

<a name="90302w24.htm_para1">Prior to offering acreage west of the Hebrides in the 17th Seaward Licensing Round, the Department took the advice of the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), the Government's statutory adviser on conservation matters, about the potential environmental impact of activities under licences. The JNCC advised--and my Department accepted--that because of the environmental importance of the protected area around 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 694</I><P>
St. Kilda, no acreage within 25 miles of the island should be offered for licensing. In actual fact, the nearest licence awarded is 45 miles away.
<P>

<a name="90302w24.htm_para2">As a further safeguard, conditions were attached to these licences at the request of JNCC and the Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department (SOAEFD) which prohibit seismic acquisition and drilling during specified sensitive seasons in order to minimise any potential disruption to local ecosystems.
<P>

<a name="90302w24.htm_para3">The advice from the JNCC, and the Department's subsequent decision-making process about the offer of blocks for petroleum licensing, takes full account of the requirements of the EU Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC). Such advice from the JNCC and other consultees has led to some blocks being excluded from licence offers in particular licensing rounds, despite clear interest from oil and gas companies which wished to see them made available.
<P>

<a name="90302w24.htm_para4">All exploration wells are subject to the Petroleum Pipe-lines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1998, which implement the European Union Environmental Impact Assessment Directive (85/337/EEC) across the whole of the UK Continental Shelf. Under these Regulations, the Secretary of State must take account of the likely environmental impact of the well before he may decide whether or not to consent to its drilling. Both the JNCC and SOAEFD are consulted about the likely effects of wells in this area and may recommend that a full environmental statement is required before a consent decision can be made. Such statements must be made available to the public for their comments and the Secretary of State must then take into consideration any comments he has received when making his decision about consent for the project.
<P>

<a name="90302w24.htm_para5">Under the Regulations, the same process must be applied to any application for consent to a further well to appraise the commercial potential of an oil or gas discovery, and again to any subsequent proposal to develop such a find for production. The production of an environmental statement is mandatory for most development projects. No application has yet been received for consent to commercial extraction of oil or gas west of the Hebrides.
<P>

<a name="90302w24.htm_para6">Offshore activity, including all exploration wells, is also subject to the Merchant Shipping (Oil Pollution Preparedness and Response Convention) Regulations 1998. These require an oil spill contingency plan to be submitted to this Department for approval before drilling activities may commence. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) are consulted in relation to such plans. Each contingency plan is project-specific and will take account of relevant environmental sensitivities.
<P>

<a name="90302w24.htm_para7">The UK offshore oil and gas industry has a good environmental record. Areas west of Scotland were first licensed for petroleum exploration and production in 1972. The first commercial developments in the area are the Foinaven and Schiehallion oil fields, which lie west of Shetland, more than 200 miles northeast of St. Kilda. Regrettably, there have been some small oil spills around these facilities since production started, but all dispersed naturally with no evidence of damage to the environment. 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 695</I><P>
However, the companies involved have been asked to reassess their operational procedures to ensure that the risk of even small oil spills can be reduced still further.
<P>

<a name="90302w24.htm_para8">The Government are committed to playing its part in tackling the threat of global warming and agrees that we need to move away from dependence on fossil fuels. The Government intend to develop a strategic UK climate change programme for publication later this year which will set out proposals for policies and measures to achieve international targets and its domestic policy aims, including increased support for renewables. The aim of the programme will be to develop an equitable, balanced strategy, covering all sectors of the economy and engaging all parts of the community. It will be finalised after public consultation and the Government will take forward its implementation, probably in 2000 and subsequent years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what is his estimate of the number of electron microscopes employed in the United Kingdom 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 696</I><P>
for the purposes of assessing the presence of asbestos fibres in lung tissue in order to advise <i>(a)</i> special medical boards on respiratory diseases; and <i>(b)</i> coroners.  [70180]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w24.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Within the DTI, the Office of Science and Technology (OST) has a specific interest in areas of research using electron microscopes, investigating the health effects of fibre inhalation, including asbestos fibres, in relation to the pathogenesis of disease, through the Medical Research Council (MRC) Toxicology Unit in Leicester.
<P>

<a name="90302w24.htm_para9">The DSS is responsible for "special medical boards" which, I am informed, do not use electron microscopy for assessing the presence of asbestos fibres in lung tissue. The Home Office are not aware of any figures for Coroners. My Department has no such estimate; even if it were possible to gather such information, it would involve disproportionate cost.

Minutes for the meeting have been circulated to all attendees of the meeting and a copy has been placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the effects on information technology in the United Kingdom of the implementation of the resolution by the European Parliament to outlaw Internet web caching.  [73383]<P>

<P>
<a name="90302w25.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Unauthorised reproduction of copyright material in electronic form is generally prohibited under the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988. The European Parliament's proposed amendment to the draft Directive on copyright in the information society, which would mean that temporary copies such as occur in caching could infringe copyright if right owners have not agreed to use of their material in the relevant service, would not therefore change the situation in the UK. Current UK copyright law does not seem to have inhibited the development of information technology services, or placed undue burdens on those providing such services. However, we support moves to clarify the liability of service providers under copyright and other laws, along the lines proposed in the draft Directive on electronic commerce.

Following evaluation of his experience later this year, consideration will be given to extending its use to other Ministers.

However, no interviews or inquiries have yet been commissioned.

<P>

<a name="90302w25.htm_para4">In the light of this continuing objection by Mr. Gair's solicitor, the most appropriate way forward would seem to be for the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission to instruct or carry out any necessary investigations once it comes into operation on 1 April this year. The new Commission will have powers to undertake its own inquiries and to obtain statements and reports. One of the main intentions behind our setting up this Commission is to make the review of alleged miscarriages of justice in Scotland clearly independent and to ensure public confidence in the process.

We shall continue to do so, not only by complying fully with new duties in the Disability Discrimination Act but by aiming to do more where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="90302w25.htm_para6">Existing guidance on policy appraisal is currently being reviewed in the light of the guidance "Policy Appraisal for Equal Treatment" which the Cabinet Office issued to all Government Departments in November 1998. This was signed jointly by the Minister for Women, the Secretary of State for Education and Employment and the Home Secretary. The new guidance will ensure that all new and existing policies and programmes are assessed for any differential impact, not only on disabled people but on women and people from ethnic minorities. That includes the need to ensure that policies and their outcomes comply with the law. Where necessary, we shall act to remove any differential impact.

<P>

<a name="90302w26.htm_para5">Mental Health is one of the health priorities in Scotland, and CSO's awards to mental health research projects in 1998-99, total some &#163;2M. Many of these projects may be relevant to schizophrenia psychoses alongside other severe mental health problems, and some may have implications for methods of care, including community care, for sufferers. Projects, completed or still running in 1998-99, which we have identified as definitely relevant to schizophrenia psychoses (and perhaps--to varying extents--to community care for sufferers) are detailed below. Their awards total some &#163;657K of the &#163;2M.

R&D Support Fund expenditure on schizophrenia psychoses cannot be identified separately, except at disproportionate cost. From 1 July 1999, this will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking when the Benefits Integrity Project ended in Greater Manchester, what has replaced it, and how the replacement is different from its predecessor.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Benefit Integrity Project (BIP) will end nationally on 31 March 1999 and is to be replaced by a new and fairer system. No new cases will be selected for the BIP after this date. Cases where action has already started will continue to be processed through the stages of adjudication including review and appeal.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From April, a new system of "Periodic Review" will be introduced. This will incorporate the lessons already learned from BIP, and will be fairer as it will gather information by home visits and postal enquiries across the whole range of rates and components of Disability Living Allowance (DLA). It will therefore provide for awards to be increased as well as decreased in line with entitlement.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At the outset, those DLA recipients whose cases have been examined by the BIP will be excluded from the process, as will those people in any one of the specific categories of exclusions from the BIP. People with a fixed period award due to end within the next three years will also be excluded.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The process will be evaluated after six months. The findings will be used to continue to improve the process to make it more sensitive to the circumstances of the individual concerned. Additionally, we will be testing new ways of evidence gathering for DLA claims. Discussions are taking place with disability groups to ensure that the new system is sensitive and is both fair and effective.</FONT></UL>

 Information is not available about the number of applications for deferment of arrears. However, Child Support Agency records show that there are currently 7,647 cases, where arrears of child support maintenance have been deferred. As at 31 January 1999 the Agency had made 1,233 payments of compensation to parents with care under the deferred debt scheme.

[73718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w27.htm_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Child Support Officers are expected to consider whether deferment of arrears should be offered in all cases where arrears of maintenance are due to delay by the Child Support Agency in completing initial maintenance assessments and periodic or change of circumstance reviews. A non-resident parent may also ask the Agency to consider deferring arrears of maintenance at any time. We are satisfied that these arrangements are sufficient to ensure that non-resident parents are offered deferment of arrears, whenever this is appropriate.

 The help provided for people on low incomes to meet their housing costs is kept under review. Housing Benefit helps people on low incomes meet their rent, whether they are in or out of work. Help with mortgage costs is provided for those on Income Support or income based Jobseeker's Allowance. Extending help with mortgage costs to those with low incomes but above the level of Income Support or income based Jobseeker's Allowance could cost up to &#163;1 billion per year, if it was fully taken up.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will lay regulations under the decision making and appeals provision of the Social Security Act 1998; and if he will make a statement.  [74676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w28.htm_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Last year in the Social Security Act we laid the foundations for a new system for handling decisions and appeals in benefits, child support and vaccine damage claims. Today my right hon. Friends the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Social Security are laying the main Regulations, which will provide the detailed legal framework for this new system.
<P>

<a name="90302w28.htm_para0">The new system for handling decisions and appeals is a major step to modernise the delivery of Social Security and child support as part of the Government's programme for welfare reform. The current system needs to change. It is confusing for claimants and staff. Putting mistakes right is complicated and claimants often have to appeal, even when a mistake is obvious to all concerned. Appeals take far too long to be cleared--on average seven months--even where they have no prospect of success. These delays are unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="90302w28.htm_para1">The changes we are making will enable the Benefits Agency, Child Support Agency and Employment Service to provide a more helpful and accessible service to the public.
<P>

<a name="90302w28.htm_para2">Under the new system, decisions will continue to be based on the facts and the law, with a right of appeal to an independent tribunal. There will be clearer, simpler decisions and a programme to develop simpler communications for the public. There will be new arrangements for handling disputes, so mistakes are put right more easily without having to go to appeal. There will be one type of appeal tribunal, rather than five, with one unified set of rules and three, two or one member tribunals according to the issues raised by the appeal. Appeals, which have no prospect of success, will be resolved more quickly.




<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 709</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90302w28.htm_para3">The new arrangements will come into operation during the second half of this year. They will apply to child support from the beginning of June. For benefits they will be introduced in stages between July and November, to help maintain service to the public while the new arrangements start to operate.
<P>

<a name="90302w28.htm_para4">The Independent Tribunal Service will be replaced by The Appeals Service, which will encompass both the administration of appeals and the appeal tribunals. The administration of appeals will be undertaken from April 2000 by a new executive agency of this Department. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will set targets for the Agency, which will be published and reported on annually.

 The information is not available in the format requested.
<P>

<a name="90302w28.htm_para8">The calculation of the National Insurance Rebates contains an assumption that they are paid in the October following the end of the tax year for which they are due. Normally around 90 per cent. of payments have been made by that date, increasing to 95 per cent. by December. This year by October 14 per cent. had been paid, by December this had increased to 46 per cent. Currently 77 per cent. has been paid.
<P>

<a name="90302w28.htm_para9">The delay in payment of the age related rebates has allowed the retention of Government gilt's which would otherwise have been sold to meet the age related rebate payments. In determining any potential gain to the National Insurance Fund as a result of the delay, certain assumptions need to be made about the pattern of payments that would have been made and the rate of return on gilts. Assuming certain payment patterns and 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 711</I><P>
a 6 per cent. rate of return then the gain to the National Insurance Fund is tentatively estimated to be around &#163;58 million.
<P>

<a name="90302w28.htm_para10">We have been paying compensation at the rate of 0.5 per cent. per month for each month of delay, since November 1998. To date &#163;21 million has been paid and it is estimated that the total compensation figure will be around &#163;38 million.
<P>

<a name="90302w28.htm_para11">We have not made any estimates about the actual loss of investment incurred as a result of the delays. Instead we have implemented a system to compensate individuals which takes into consideration the following factors: First the calculation of the rebate, in particular the assumption within the calculation that the payment is made in October, following the end of the tax year for which it is due. Second the need to provide certainty for scheme members and personal pension holders. Third the investment return prevailing at the time (September 1998) and finally the need for straightforward and cost effective administrative arrangements which would minimise the additional work required by pension providers, scheme administrators and Contributions Agency.
<P>

<a name="90302w28.htm_para12">The level of compensation was discussed with the Government Actuary's Department who agreed that 0.5 per cent. per month represented a reasonable level of compensation given the prevailing market conditions in September 1998 and on the assumption that the arrangements put in place at that time were designed to cover a few months delay.

 Personal advisers working on the New Deal for Lone Parents receive up to six weeks training, at an average cost of &#163;4,337 (including travel and subsistence), half of which is provided by the Employment Service and half by the Benefits Agency. All personal advisers are fully trained in the skills and knowledge required to deal with the client group, and specifically in jobsearch activity; benefits and allowances training; advanced interviewing and presentational, marketing and representational skills.
<P>

<a name="90302w29.htm_para0">The Single Gateway pilots will provide the information we need to determine the optimum investment in training for our personal advisers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w30.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The daily allowances where the periods of time over which earnings or benefit are lost or additional expense is incurred are: Up to 4 hours--&#163;24.84 and more than 4 hours--&#163;49.68. Where a juror has served on more than 10 days, they can claim up to a maximum of &#163;99.37 for each day over the tenth day. We will be considering whether or not the allowances should be increased.

<P>

<a name="90302w30.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It is necessary to place a limit on the amount of financial loss allowance payable to jurors to ensure that the expenditure from the public purse is not excessive. There are no plans to alter the current system, which allows jurors to receive up to &#163;49.68 per day for loss of earnings, rising to a daily maximum of &#163;99.37 after 10 days of jury service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w30.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following changes in registration requirements in 1993 information is no longer maintained on the beneficial ownership of UK registered fishing vessels. However, we estimate that over the last 2 years the number of over 10 metre vessels which are part or wholly owned by overseas interests has fallen from some 160 to 140.
<P>

<a name="90302w30.htm_para2">From 1999 onwards all vessels fishing against the UK's quotas are required to demonstrate that a satisfactory economic link is maintained with our coastal communities. That link may be achieved by landing at least 50 per cent. of the vessel's catch of quota stocks in the UK, by employing a crew of whom 50 per cent. are normally resident in a UK coastal area, by incurring operating expenditure in the UK for goods and services provided in UK coastal areas or by demonstrating an economic link by other means providing sufficient benefit to populations dependent on fisheries and relative industries. Responsibility for maintaining an economic link rests with the vessel owner and compliance will be assessed annually after the conclusion of each quota year.
<P>

<a name="90302w30.htm_para3">There is clear evidence that these new arrangements, which have been blessed by the Commission, are being taken very seriously. Although vessel owners are not required to give notice of the means by which they will 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 719</I><P>
be achieving an economic link there has been a series of discussions with the Fisheries Departments about the means by which satisfactory links can be established.
<P>

<a name="90302w30.htm_para4">As a result of such discussions we have accepted that some 17 vessels belonging to the North Sea Fish Producers Organisation may achieve part of their economic link by making part of their annual quota allocation available for redistribution by the Fisheries Departments, with the remainder of their link being achieved through other means such as landings, crewing or expenditure in the UK. The quota, which will consist of 50 tonnes of North Sea sole along with smaller quantities of turbot and brill and Channel plaice, will be used to extend the fishing opportunities for the inshore fleet and in particular the under 10 metre vessels.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will list for each of the initial assessments in connection with the placing on the market of genetically modified novel foods or novel food ingredients, pursuant to Article 4 of Regulation (EC) No. 258/97, the comments or reasoned objections made by <i>(a)</i> himself, <i>(b)</i> other Member States and <i>(c)</i> the European Commission.  [69874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w32.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nick Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> Initial assessments under EC Regulation 258/97 have been made for the following novel and GM foods: <i>Stevia rebaudiana</i>, phospholipids, chicory, and tomatoes (for processing).
<P>

<a name="90302w32.htm_para0">The UK Advisory Committee for Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) concluded that there was insufficient information provided to be able to come to a view on the safety of the <i>Stevia rebaudiana</i>, chicory and phospholipids. Concern was also expressed about the lack of suitable labelling proposals for the latter two. The ACNFP concluded that the GM tomato products were as safe as processed products from non-GM tomatoes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w32.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In recent years the English and Welsh wine industry has been remarkably successful and innovatory, having made particular progress with the development and production of sparkling wine. English and Welsh wine is very much on the edge of the major wine producing area of Europe and because of this there are inevitable difficulties of climate, relatively low yields and other uncertainties. This has led to the cessation of production of some marginal vineyards in recent years. However, I am sure the industry can look to the future with confidence. My colleagues and I take every opportunity to promote its products.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make representations to the European Commission regarding new cattle tagging requirements to be implemented on 1 January 2000 in respect of the particular difficulty that these will present to commoners in the New Forest.  [73009]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w32.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Cattle need to be tagged early in their lives so they can be traced and it is in the farming industry's interest to ensure this happens. Currently cattle eartags must be applied within 30 days of the birth of an animal. For dairy animals, one of the eartags required must be applied within 36 hours.




<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 1999 : Column: 725</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90302w32.htm_para3">The 30 day deadline will reduce to 20 days on 1 January 2000. If there are major practical difficulties with this next year, we will look at bringing these to the attention of the European Commission.

 Aid actually paid varies considerably between and within member States both in respect of levels of aid and types of production. EC Regulation 2078/92 sets out the limits on EU funding towards such aid.
<P>

<a name="90302w32.htm_para4">Following the recommendation of the Select Committee on Agriculture and having taken views from consumers, environmentalists and farmers, we have announced plans to almost double the rate of aid available to farmers in England converting to organic practices. Subject to the approval of Parliament, the new rates will be introduced shortly.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many fishing vessels were boarded by fisheries inspectors in the last year for which records are available; how many such actions resulted in legal proceedings for breach of regulations; and what was the nationality of the vessels concerned.  [73282]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90302w32.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 During 1998, the UK enforcement authorities boarded 4,189 fishing vessels at sea. Those boardings resulted in the masters and/or owners of 19 vessels being successfully prosecuted for breaches of fisheries regulations. The nationality of the vessels concerned were 8 UK, 5 Belgian, 5 French and 1 Irish. There are some cases which are still being processed and the numbers of prosecutions may therefore rise.
