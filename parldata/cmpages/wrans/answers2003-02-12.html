To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, what proportion of <i>(a)</i> magistrates' and <i>(b)</i> other courts have broadband access; and what targets have been set for full broadband access in each case.  [95742]<P>

<a name="30212w01.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 For <i>(a)</i> magistrates' courts in England and Wales, a high band width, wide area network has been rolled out to nearly 90 per cent. of staff. This roll-out is scheduled to be completed by April 2003, with the exception of one court that is awaiting the completion of a building project. In <i>(b)</i> the Crown Court in England and Wales, 5 per cent. of our court staff currently have access to a high band width, wide area network. We plan to extend such access to all Crown Court staff by April 2006. We are currently considering plans for extending access to the county courts of England and Wales.

 I assume the question refers to the 1992 National Audit Office report about the Al Yamamah programme. The report refers to confidential arrangements between the Governments of the United Kingdom and Saudi Arabia on a programme which is of great significance for British jobs and exports. The report has not been published because publication would breach that pledge of confidentiality; the report has therefore been withheld under Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his answer of 27 January, <i>Official Report</i>, column 638W, on the Eurofighter, what criteria were used in selecting areas for the testing of Eurofighter.  [97601]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The three managed areas designated for the training of fast jet crews were selected on the basis that they were sufficiently large to enable training at high speeds, were relatively close to operating bases, and minimised the effect on civilair routes.
<P>

<a name="30212w04.html_para0">It is anticipated that the majority of supersonic flights will take place over the sea in the two more southerly areas. The third most northerly area is essential for backup training, particularly when sea and wind states are determined to be too high for safe training over the water. Supersonic flight will not be permitted over land.

<i> [holding answer 11 February 2003]: </i>We expect Typhoon to be available for operational deployment in the second half of this decade. The aircraft will be multi-role. Designed primarily for air superiority, it will be fitted with an initial ground attack capability. Thereafter, it will benefit from progressive enhancements to its ground attack capabilities as part of the aircraft's planned procurement programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what criteria will inform his decision on selection of the prime contractor for the Future Integrated Soldier Technology programme, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> price and <i>(b)</i> technical specification;  [95423]
<P>
<UL>(2) when he plans to announce selection of the prime contractor for the Future Integrated Soldier Technology programme; and whether the Future Integrated Soldier Technology programme will be the centrepiece of infantrymen's personal combat equipment in the future;  [95421]
<P>
(3) if he will take the value of export opportunities for British businesses into account in his assessment of the relative merits of the competing contractors for the Future Integrated Soldier Technology programme;  [95425]
<P>
(4) what estimate he has made of the potential value of the export market for Future Integrated Soldier Technology equipment systems and sub-systems over the next 20 years;  [95424]
<P>
(5) what the value is of <i>(a)</i> the next assessment phase and <i>(b)</i> the demonstration and manufacture phases of the Future Integrated Soldier Technology programme.  [95422]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Future Integrated Soldier Technology (FIST) programme will bring the benefits of technology improvements to the infantry soldier by providing an integrated suite of equipment which will enhance mission effectiveness in dismounted close combat. An announcement on the Prime Contractor for the Assessment Phase (AP) of the FIST programme will be made shortly.

<P>

<a name="30212w04.html_para1">Expenditure of up to &#163;30 million is anticipated during AP. Demonstration and Manufacture costs are expected to be up to around &#163;800 million dependent on the precise configuration of the suite of equipment identified during the AP. The cost and scope of work to be performed will be more closely defined during the AP.
<P>

<a name="30212w04.html_para2">Evaluation of the competing proposals will be based on a number of criteria. Both bids are based on the same level of funding in the AP so price will not be a discriminator, and technical specifications will only be developed as a product from the AP. Selection will be informed by assessments of the bidders' planning and scheduling proposals, their proposals on technology exploitation during AP, their preparedness to engage in effective partnering arrangements, and their acceptance of contractual terms and conditions.
<P>

<a name="30212w04.html_para3">Wider factors, consistent with our Defence Industrial Policy will also be considered including potential export value to the United Kingdom defence industrial base. Current analysis of the potential export market suggests opportunities in the region of &#163;3 billion over 15 years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The term 'grounded' is normally used only when a whole fleet or mark of aircraft is identified as unsafe to fly because of specific serious engineering or airworthiness problems which call into question the safety of the aircraft type. No Merlin helicopters are being used to provide spares for operational aircraft.

<a name="30212w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 All our troops are provided with personal equipment that is right for the operation to be undertaken. The clothing, boots and other personal equipment that is provided to each soldier has been tested, and procured to a high quality and reliability standard. The views of soldiers are taken into account during this process. We hold stocks of all types of personal equipment for the variety of operations that might occur but, because it is not sensible to tie up assets for all contingencies, these basic stocks are supplemented as operations become better defined. Adequate stocks of desert equipment for Army personnel will be available for Operation Telic.

 Initial Gate approval for procurement of a Primary Casualty Receiving Capability (PCRC) was granted on 20 December 2001. A contract was awarded to BMT Defence Services on 21 December 2001 for support in determining the size and shape of an afloat medical facility that would meet our needs and to establish which ship types could potentially become host platforms. In parallel, the PCRC Integrated Project Team (IPT) is considering which procurement options are likely to prove most cost effective. It is anticipated that tendering for the demonstration and manufacture phase of the project should take place during 2003&#150;04. The In Service Date will depend upon the final technical specification and procurement route selected but should be towards the end of the decade.

 The Ministry of Defence is committed to sustaining the Ptarmigan trunk communication system for land forces and continues to keep the system available at high readiness for any potential operations. To enable Ptarmigan to cope with increasing demands placed on it, two planned enhancements were completed in 2002. One will enable Ptarmigan to connect to future systems such as Bowman. The other allows more rapid and flexible deployment of some of the more mobile components of Ptarmigan. We are currently making minor modifications to the Ptarmigan system to enable it to be used more effectively in the context of potential operations. I am withholding specific details under Exemption 1 (Defence, security and international relations) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

<a name="30212w06.html_para0">The Government has made clear its commitment to effective monitoring of the end-use of UK defence exports where this can make a genuine contribution to preventing their diversion or misuse. However, follow-up monitoring can only confirm if UK exports have been misused or diverted after the export has taken place. The Government believes that the most effective way to prevent misuse or diversion of UK defence exports is by rigorous assessment at the export licensing stage. To this end we have taken a number of steps to strengthen end-user risk assessment in the export

Before taking a decision on an export licence application, the Government takes into account all reliable information about end-users of potential concern, including reporting from other Government Departments and UK posts overseas, and also from any relevant information received from non-governmental organisations and other external sources. Overseas posts have standing instructions to report any misuse of UK-origin defence equipment so that it can be taken into account in the licensing process.

 The Coal Authority has (in consultation with the industry) estimated that established reserves workable by either opencast or deep-mining methods in Britain total some 222 million tonnes with a further known potential of 380 million tonnes. The extent to which thee tonnages are available is influenced by a range of factors, not least operators' ability to mine the coal safely and economically and to secure the necessary consents to do so. No separate figures are available for Wales.

<a name="30212w06.html_para1">In addition, the Department recently commissioned a report which examined coal reserves and resources accessible from remaining deep mines (excluding the Selby Complex scheduled to close in March 2004).

<a name="30212w06.html_para6">In February 2002 the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security (ATCS) Act came into effect. Part 12 of the Act puts beyond doubt that the law of bribery applies to acts involving foreign office holders, including Ministers, MPs and judges, and takes jurisdiction over crimes of bribery committed by UK nationals and UK companies overseas. Previously some part of the offence had to take place in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30212w06.html_para7">The measures outlaw acts of bribery by UK nationals and companies abroad in the same circumstances as they are outlawed at home.

In order to ensure a smooth transition to the new spending programme, the Government have announced transition funding for waste projects in England which would otherwise have a shortfall between the funding committed through the LTCS and that need to complete planned activity during 2003&#150;04.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what plans he has to seek the opinion of an independent railway operations expert on the viability of maintaining an enhanced timetable of services on the Lisburn to Antrim railway line before a decision is made on the closure of the line.  [97292]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w09.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 It is clear that an enhanced timetable of services on the Lisburn to Antrim railway line could only be introduced at the expense of a reduced timetable of services elsewhere on the network, and in particular on the direct line from Antrim to Belfast via Bleach Green junction. Switching more trains to run on the Lisburn to Antrim line would disadvantage more people than it would help. Accordingly, I have no plans to seek the opinion of an independent railway operations expert on the viability of maintaining an enhanced timetable of services on the Lisburn to Antrim railway line.

 Provisional figures for EC development spending in 2002 indicate that around 25 per cent. of DFID's budget has been spent through European Commission programmes.




<P>
<P><I>12 Feb 2003 : Column 761W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30212w09.html_para1">The EC development budget particularly for those regions funded from the regular budget, performs poorly compared with other multilateral providers. Some of the EC's programme are of high quality but overall they are not focused on reducing poverty. While quality should improve if the reforms launched in 2000 have the desired impact, procedures are still cumbersome and the process of deconcentration is behind schedule.
<P>

<a name="30212w09.html_para2">Prioritisation needs radical overhaul. Allocation decisions too often reflect the political consensus by the Council of Ministers and European Parliament to maintain spending at historical levels in middle income regions which reflect domestic or foreign policy considerations. These programmes do not generate the institutional reforms these regions require. We want to see the pledge, explicit in the EC's Development Policy Statement of November 2000, to focus on poverty reduction reflected in annual decisions over resource transfers. Given the clear links between poverty and global security the Commission and Member States need to widen the horizon beyond the near abroad and focus scarce grant resources where they can make the most difference in tackling poverty and instability. Provisional figures indicate that in 2001 only 43 per cent. of the EC's budget was spent in the poorest countries. Although an improvement from 38 per cent. in the previous year, we believe the Commission should achieve the target of spending 70 per cent. of the development budget in low income countries by 2006.




<P>
<P><I>12 Feb 2003 : Column 762W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30212w09.html_para3">EC budget figures are set until 2006. Discussions about the next financial perspectives over the budget for 2007&#150;2013 are at a very early stage, and might be influenced by the outcome of the Convention debate on the future of Europe. There are some key questions: if Commission programmes can be better delivered through national agencies or other multilateral providers, then it is hard to justify their continuation. If the Commission can demonstrate its comparative advantage in terms of effectiveness, impact and outcomes then we should also use it more as a channel for national funds. Unless they can do this, we will seek a reduction in future Commission aid levels. We need to focus their programmes where they can add value, and cut back other activities.

reviewed all Afghan applicants granted asylum who applied since 1 October 2001, shortly before the fall of the Taliban.
<P>

<a name="30212w10.html_para10">No cases were found of people granted asylum because they were committed to the Taliban regime and feared persecution from the new government.

 The use of charter flights is a means of removing large numbers of failed asylum seekers and other immigration offenders when there is no availability of seats on scheduled aircraft.
<P>

<a name="30212w10.html_para11">They are also used for removals to destinations that carriers from the United Kingdom currently do not operate to, eg Kosovo.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 I understand from the Chief Constable (Mr Paul Stephenson QPM) that the additional costs of policing the disturbances was 1.3million. On 30 January 2002 we announced a special grant of &#163;820,000. This grant met 64 per cent. of the additional costs incurred by the force.

<a name="30212w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Information is not collected centrally on the number of police officers deployed to child protection duties. The allocation of resources within a force is decided locally by the Chief Constable or, in the case of the Metropolitan Police Service, the Commissioner. Under the National Policing Plan all forces and authorities are expected to review their force policy and local service plans to ensure that child protection is given the appropriate priority.

<P>

<a name="30212w11.html_para3">As a condition of funding, each scheme is required to undertake an independent evaluation of its effectiveness as a tool to assist the police and reduce crime and the fear of crime. These evaluations will cover implementation, impact and cost effectiveness. In addition, to help ensure maximum impact and sustainability of CCTV, a &#163;1.5 million Home Office funded national evaluation programme is being carried out by the Scarman Centre, University of Leicester, on 17 approved CCTV initiative schemes. The final report will not be published until 2004 but interim reports will be available before then. The first&#151;providing guidance for practitioners on implementation of CCTV schemes&#151;is due for publication shortly.

 The British Crime Survey (BCS) 2001&#150;02 provides information on victims of crime and includes statistics on risks of crime by household type for burglary (table 4.03), vehicle thefts (table 5.04) and violent crime (6.02). Figures are broken down into categories which include household income, employment status and area type. More detailed analysis of the risks of burglary, based on the 1998 BCS, was published in 1999. This analysis did not show an independent link between risk of burglary victimisation and household income. The BCS 2001&#150;02 also published risks by types of neighbourhood. This showed that people living in the more deprived 'striving areas' tended to experience higher risks generally, although there was also an increased risk in 'rising areas', such as affluent urban areas.
<P>

<a name="30212w11.html_para4">In terms of offending, poverty has been identified as one of the potential risk factors associated with offending. For example, a study of working class boys found that a combination of low income, poor housing and large family size consistently identified an increased

risk of self-reported offending, criminal convictions and both juvenile and adult offending (Farrington 1992b and 1992c).
<P>

<a name="30212w11.html_para5">The new English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) research programme, which involves interviewing and drug testing adults arrested by the police, confirms a link between drug misuse and crime. Analysis on the links between crime, family background and drug use is published in the 1998&#150;99 Youth Lifestyles Survey. This examined the extent to which various factors were associated with offending among young people aged 12 to 30. Figures show, for example, that young people who lived in a lone parent or a step parent family were more likely to be serious or persistent offenders than those who lived with their natural parents. However, persistent, serious conflict between parents, or between a parent and a child, appears to be more important, in this respect, than family structure. While some structures&#151;notably lone parent families&#151;are correlated with an increased risk that children will offend, the evidence suggests that this is a product of factors that also affect children in two-parent families. Drug users were also more likely to be serious or persistent offenders than non-drug users.

 In summer 2002 around 370 Splash and Splash Extra schemes were run in high crime areas, enabling over 90,000 young people to take part in a wide range of activities. These schemes contributed to an overall reduction in local crime rates of 5.2 per cent., with reductions of up to 31 per cent. in street crime and robbery in some areas. A full report on the evaluation of the 2002 programme will be published in the spring.

The new programme will mean less bureaucracy for local areas, allowing them to focus on delivering good quality programmes to young people at risk of crime and social exclusion.

If an existing licence holder currently has permission to sell alcohol and intends to do so under the new licensing regime they will also have to acquire a personal licence. Existing holders of justices' licences will automatically qualify for a personal licence at a cost of around &#163;30, subject to the right of the chief officer of police to object if they are satisfied that the exceptional circumstances of the case are such that granting the application would undermine the Bill's crime objective.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the projected fees are for <i>(a)</i> a premises licence and <i>(b)</i> a club licensing certificate under the proposed Licensing and Entertainment Bill; and what the expected scale of charges is.  [97406]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w15.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government estimate that under the provisions of the Licensing Bill an application for a premises licence or a club premises certificate would cost between &#163;100 and &#163;500 with an annual charge of between &#163;50 and &#163;150 to maintain a revenue stream and cover continuing inspection and enforcement. The Government envisage that fees will be set in bands depending on the size of the premises and are consulting industry, local authorities and others on the precise details of the fee structure.

 DCMS did not record any cases of computer hacking or fraud in the period in question. There were four instances of computer theft in 2001 and three in 2002. DCMS has no evidence that any departmental computer systems were illegally accessed by hackers, inside or outside the Department.

<a name="30212w16.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Greenway: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what estimate she has made of the number of additional entertainment licences required because of the reform of the two in a bar rule under the Licensing and Entertainment Bill; and what assessment she has made of additional costs.  [97472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w16.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Under the provisions of the Bill there will be no separate licence for the provision of public entertainment. Permission to carry on any of the activities licensable under the Bill will be covered by a single premises licence. It will cost no more, in terms of time or money, to apply for a licence permitting the sale of alcohol and the provision of entertainment than it would to apply for one permitting the sale of alcohol only.
<P>

<a name="30212w16.html_para0">The Regulatory Impact Assessment that was published alongside the Licensing Bill states that just over 9,000 on-licensed premises and registered members clubs hold permanent public entertainment licences or certificates of suitability. An estimated 37,000 temporary public entertainment licences are also issued each year. The Government have made no estimate of the number of premises that will apply for permission to provide entertainment under the new licensing regime. We expect, however, that the removal of the cost deterrent in applying for permission to provide entertainment, along with the provision of a less bureaucratic system and measures to prevent unnecessary conditions being attached to licences by licensing authorities will encourage many more premises to take the opportunity to provide public entertainment.

 DWP Ministers meet with ministerial colleagues regularly to discuss issues related to the alleviation of child poverty. They attend the Ministerial Group on Children and Young People (MISC9) and the Joint Ministerial Committee on Poverty, both of which address child poverty issues.
<P>

<a name="30212w19.html_para0">We do recognise that disabled children, and their families, have additional needs. We are committed to helping severely disabled people with the extra costs they face as a result of their disabilities. In April 2002 the disabled child premium was increased by &#163;5 a week on top of the normal uprating, to &#163;35.50. In April 2003, it will rise again by &#163;5 above inflation, to more than &#163;40 a week on top of basic Income Support or tax credits. In addition, the higher rate mobility component of Disability Living Allowance was extended to three and four-year-olds in April 2001, providing an extra &#163;39.30 a week to those families.
<P>

<a name="30212w19.html_para1">A full analysis of our strategy to eradicate child poverty is given in our annual "Opportunity for all" reports. "Opportunity for all&#151;fourth annual report" (CM 5598) was published in September 2002. It reports on a range of outcome indicators covering many dimensions of poverty and social exclusion.

 The Lower Earnings Limit is currently set at &#163;75 a week, and will rise to &#163;77 a week from the start of the new tax year.




<P>

<P>

<a name="30212w19.html_para2">Until April 2000 employees started paying national insurance contributions, and building up entitlement to contributory benefits, once their earnings reached the Lower Earnings Limit. However from April 2000 a new employees' earnings threshold was introduced as the point from which employees start to pay contributions. This is currently &#163;89 a week, and will remain at this level for 2003&#150;04. This means that employees who earn between the Lower Earnings Level and the earnings threshold do not have to pay national insurance contributions, but nevertheless continue to build up entitlement to contributory benefits such as state pension.
<P>

<a name="30212w19.html_para3">The recent Green Paper "Simplicity, security and choice: Working and saving for retirement" (Cm 5677) recognised that some people, in particular women, in low-paid or part-time work may face difficulties in accruing sufficient individual rights for the state pension. We will continue to look at the effect of this on contributory and other benefits.

 DLA provides a contribution towards the extra costs faced by severely disabled people. It is paid to those who require personal care and/or have walking difficulties as a result of their disabilities. Spending on the benefit has increased steadily year on year because more people than ever are receiving the benefit (and because its value has been maintained by increasing the rates at which it is paid each year in line with the movement in prices as measured by the retail prices index).

 Through the policy research programme, the Department has funded a programme of research, in two phases and with a total value of about &#163;2.5 million, which has addressed priorities important to improving nutritional health.
<P>

<a name="30212w21.html_para1">The first phase, from 1994 to 1997, which was commissioned and managed jointly with the Medical Research Council (MRC), focused specifically on the relationship between nutritional factors and clinical outcome and, in particular on the role of diet and nutrition in the prevention and development of cancers and cardiovascular disease.
<P>

<a name="30212w21.html_para2">The second phase, from 1997 to 2002, included studies that looked at facilitators and barriers to good nutritional health, obesity and interventions aimed at achieving recommended dietary changes, particularly in low-income groups. Still looking at the dietary risk factors linking to cardiovascular disease and cancers, this phase of the programme also included work on nutritional aspects of bone health.
<P>

<a name="30212w21.html_para3">This time limited programme of research has now been completed and the Department is currently producing an overview of findings from the second phase, the purpose of which is to highlight key messages for policy and practice. The Department is also currently funding a systematic review of the facilitators and barriers to healthy eating for children aged 4 to 10 years, having just completed a similar review for young people.
<P>

<a name="30212w21.html_para4">The Department has no immediate plans to commission additional work following on from this programme, but further studies that link poor diet and specific diseases might emerge as priorities under future bidding rounds for policy research programme funding.

 Every English local authority is required to submit an annual statistical return to the Department, which includes information about the numbers of children who have gone missing from care in their area over a 12 month period.

<a name="30212w22.html_para1">"Children Missing from Care and Home&#151;a guide to good practice" was issued to every English local authority in November 2002, under Section 7 of the Local Authority Social Services Act 1970.

<a name="30212w22.html_para4">The Government are committed to tackling the historical social and geographical inequalities of the impact of coronary heart disease (CHD). We are taking action now to remedy these inequalities through the implementation of the national service framework for CHD, which sets clear national standards for the prevention and treatment of CHD.
<P>

<a name="30212w22.html_para5">In the area of CHD prevention, one example of the local implementation of these initiatives is that National Health Service smoking cessation services in Gateshead and South Tyneside Health authority helped over 4,000 people to give up smoking for at least four weeks between April 2000 and March 2002. South Tyneside Primary Care Trust has also been invited by the New

<P>

<a name="30212w22.html_para7">In the area of CHD diagnosis, there has been considerable expansion of diagnostic angiography services locally over recent years, with a New Opportunities Fund financed laboratory established in Sunderland to supplement a new Gateshead laboratory.
<P>

<a name="30212w22.html_para8">In the field of primary care, at least 84 per cent, of patients who have suffered a heart attack are now being prescribed life-saving statins. A table showing the rate of increase of the prescription of statins in South Tyneside and nationally over the last three years, has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30212w22.html_para9">One of the aims of the Patient Choice initiative which has been in place since July last year is to reduce the impact of regional variations in secondary treatment provision for CHD patients. Under this initiative, CHD patients who have been waiting more than six months for a revascularisation procedure are offered the opportunity to be treated at a hospital or clinic of their choice, which may be either another NHS hospital or a hospital or clinic in the private sector. This and other associated initiatives are currently offering the possibility of shorter waits for treatment to patients in South Tyneside and many other areas, and local NHS service providers are keen to encourage eligible patients to take part.
<P>

<a name="30212w22.html_para10">There has been little progress made in changes to lower emissions in the last few years, except during the last year, when LPG vehicles have been added to the choice list as they become available from manufacturers. We hope to replace our pool car fleet with LPG vehicles and will be reviewing our choice list before the end of 2003 to include mor of these.

<P>

<a name="30212w23.html_para1">The Department aims to respond to requests within the statutory period and allocates resources to meet anticipated numbers of requests. Requests over the past three years have averaged three or four per month on a steady upward trend. The number of complex requests relating to contact over many years with staff in different areas of the Department has also been increasing.

 Subject to parliamentary approval, the Medicines Control Agency and the Medical Devices Agency will combine to form the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) with effect from 1 April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30212w25.html_para7">The new Agency will operate as a trading fund and its expenditure will be financed mainly by income from charges for the services it provides to the pharmaceutical industry and other customers. The Department will, however, purchase medical devices services from the MHRA and may also, from time to time, issue medium term loans to support capital expenditure or other developments.
<P>

<a name="30212w25.html_para8">The level of Departmental funding for medical devices services in 2003&#150;04 and subsequent years has yet to be finalised. The Department's main estimate for 2003&#150;04 will include provision for the necessary funding in the MHRA's first year.

<a name="30212w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Budgets for financial years covered by the 2002 Spending Review have not yet been finalised for the Department's internal directorates, the NHS Pensions Agency or the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency. As a trading fund, most of the expenditure of NHS Estates falls outside the Department's budgets. The future budget for services the Department purchases from NHS Estates has also not yet been finalised.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Registrations lapse if patients do not return to their dentists within 15 months. Registration rates will exclude patients who have not been to their GDS dentist within the past 15 months and patients who receive dental treatment from other NHS dental services.<P>

2. During the period 1997 to 2002, the registration numbers are affected by the change in the registration periods for adults and children. Also, the figures do not include patients attending the Dental Access Centres, which opened during the period, and whose patients are not registered.<P>

3. Registrations are included in the area of the dentist. The registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving their dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live.<P>

4. Patients wishing to register with a GDS dentist can obtain details of dentists accepting new patients in their area by contacting NHS Direct.<P>

They have been selected to capture the multidimensional nature of poverty and to utilise the best available information. The indicators meet certain criteria, one of which is to be outcome focused rather than concentrating of inputs and process. All of the indicators are linked to departmental public service agreement targets, which are reviewed as part of spending review cycles.

<P>
<a name="30212w27.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Successful transplantation of donor kidneys is by far the most clinically effective and cost-effective treatment for suitable patients with established renal failure. The average cost of maintaining a heamodialysis patient is estimated at &#163;34,500 per annum, compared with &#163;20,000 for the first year of a cadaveric kidney transplant and &#163;6,500 per annum after the first year. Survival data from three transplants units show that the medium term outcomes of successful transplantation of non-heartbeating donor kidneys are as good as heartbeating donor transplants.

<a name="30212w27.html_para2">In 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, UK Transplant funded seven national health service trusts to increase the number of non-heartbeating donor transplants.

 The renal national service framework (NSF) will be published in due course.

 We do not collect information on the prescribing levels of drugs for particular disorders. Amphetamines and related drugs, e.g. Ritalin, are specifically contra-indicated for the treatment of depression. Ritalin is therefore not an accepted treatment for manic depression.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to raise the limit for mandatory Disabled Facilities Grant which was last raised from &#163;20,000 to &#163;25,000 in January 2002. The Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance)(England and Wales) Order 2002 gives local authorities a new wide ranging discretionary power which allows them to provide additional financial assistance for housing adaptations. This includes the ability to help with the purchase of a new property for the disabled person if this is a more cost-effective option than the adaptation of the existing property.

 The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 (WATO), as amended, requires that any person transporting cattle, sheep, goats, pigs or horses on journeys of over eight hours by road, or by air, rail or sea must be specifically authorised. A specific authorisation is issued only after checks that the applicant is a fit and proper person to transport animals. A total of 947 specific authorisations have been issued in Great Britain to hauliers and other transporters since 1 October 1997. Full information about WATO is available on the internet at: www.defra.gov.uk
<P>

<a name="30212w30.html_para3">Compliance by livestock hauliers with WATO is generally monitored by enforcement agents at livestock markets, ports and during roadside vehicle checks. We are currently piloting a new agreement for animal health and welfare with enforcement agencies, which is intended to provide more consistent and improved enforcement.

<P>
<a name="30212w30.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 it is an offence to take a badger except in certain circumstances. For instance, a person is not guilty of an offence if he takes a badger that has been disabled otherwise than by his action for the purpose of tending the animal. The licensing provisions in the Act enable English Nature to grant a licence, among other things, to take a specified number of badgers for the purpose of conservation of badgers. In addition, the Act enables Defra to grant a licence to take a badger for the purpose, among other things, of preventing serious damage to property.

<P>
<a name="30212w30.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Any limitation on the movement of cattle, such as the 20 day livestock movement restrictions, reduces the opportunity for TB infection to be brought onto herds. However, limiting movement alone is not sufficient as a TB control measure. Defra has advised farmers that they must take responsibility for ensuring they are aware of the TB status of animals brought onto farms, and that they should buy only from herds with up-to-date TB tests.

The Agency's website suffered problems in its service between 1&#150;6 January.

A number of technical changes have now been carried out to improve the site's performance.

<P>
<a name="30212w32.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Forest Enterprise does not publish its forest design plans on the internet. However, the Forestry Commission maintains a "Register of New Planting and Felling", which it publishes on its website http://www.forestry.gov.uk/consultations. The register gives information on new planting and felling applications received from private woodland owners and information about Forest Enterprise design plans.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department has made of how internal drainage boards are exercising their duty under the Land Drainage Act 1994 to further the conservation and enhancement of natural beauty and the conservation of flora, fauna and geological or physiographical features of special interest.  [96400]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government currently assess the conservation performance of Internal Drainage Boards in a number of ways.
<P>

<a name="30212w32.html_para0">Firstly, each flood and coastal defence scheme currently submitted by an Internal Drainage Board (IDE) for Defra grant-aid is assessed not only for its economic and technical robustness, but also its 



<P>
<P><I>12 Feb 2003 : Column 846W</I><P>
environmental compliance. To assist in making a judgment on the acceptability of each submission, English Nature is asked for an opinion on the environmental compliance of all grant applications that are processed. The improved access to in-house conservation advice that several IDB consortia now have is a welcome step that is improving the ability to take advantage of the environmental opportunities presented by many flood management schemes.
<P>

<a name="30212w32.html_para1">Secondly, High Level Targets 9 and 10, which are set for all operating authorities, relate to conservation of the environment.
<P>

<a name="30212w32.html_para2">In addition to meeting statutory obligations when carrying out flood and coastal defence works, HLT 9 requires that IDBs must aim to avoid damage to environmental interest; ensure there is no net loss to habitats covered by Biodiversity Action Plans; and seek opportunities for environmental enhancement. IDBs are required to report annually to the Environment Agency on all losses and gains of habitats covered by Biodiversity Action Plans. The last report to be published by Defra was on 24 May 2002. I refer the hon. Member to my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Luton, North ( Mr. Hopkins), on 24 May 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 641&#150;42W.
<P>

<a name="30212w32.html_para3">High Level Target 10 relates specifically to Water Level Management Plans (WLMPs), which are required for wetlands of recognised importance for nature conservation. The target was revised in January 2001 so that each operating authority, including all IDBs, must provide to Defra and the Environment Agency:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a definite timetable for completing any outstanding WLMPs;
<P>
<BR>
and an outline timetable for preparing a programme for implementing and reviewing WLMPs.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30212w32.html_para4">In addition, each operating authority must have in place a detailed programme for implementing and reviewing WLMPs for European sites and Ramsar sites by 1 April 2002 and other SSSIs by 1 April 2003.
<P>

<a name="30212w32.html_para5">In line with these revisions, all operating authorities are required to make an annual report to Defra of their progress in implementing and reviewing WLMPs against their published programme. The last report to be published by Defra was in August 2002. I refer the hon. Member to the my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Rhondda (Mr. Bryant) on 29 October 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 732&#150;33W.
<P>

<a name="30212w32.html_para6">As the majority of WLMPs have now been written, the emphasis has now moved to implementation and it is pleasing to report that one of the largest applications for grant-aid to implement WLMP actions was made on behalf of an IDB consortia.
<P>

<a name="30212w32.html_para7">While it must be recognised that IDBs primarily provide a local land drainage service, it is also recognised that there is room for improving their environmental performance. Further steps to address this are one of the aspects under consideration in the Flood and Coastal Defence Funding Review, on which I will shortly be making a statement.

 The following table shows total estimated UK emissions of mercury from all sources up to 2001 (the latest date for which figures are available). The estimated emission of mercury to air from UK power generation in 2001 was 1.65 tonnes, representing 19 per cent. of total UK mercury emissions. Total emissions have fallen by 72 per cent. (from 31.6 tonnes to 8.8 tonnes) since 1990. Mercury emissions from power stations have fallen by 80 per cent. (from 8.36 tonnes to 1.65 tonnes), over the same period.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the environmental impact of mercury emissions from UK power stations.  [97519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w32.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Mercury emissions from UK power stations have fallen by some 80 per cent. (from 8.36 tonnes/annum to 1.65 tonnes/annum) since 1990.

<P>

<a name="30212w32.html_para9">The Environment Agency carried out dispersion modelling of the impact of mercury emissions from UK power stations in 1996. The impact as a result of the concentrations attributed to the power stations was found to be insignificant. The Environment Agency will however keep the question of emissions under review as alternative fuel sources became available/viable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w32.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 There is no acceptable maximum level of mercury in the environment. To protect against direct human inhalation, the World Health Organisation (WHO), recommends a guideline level of 1 microgramme per cubic metre for inorganic mercury vapour in air. However due to the fact that mercury has been shown to bioaccumulate in its toxic, methylated form in the environment, particularly in the aquatic food chain, the WHO recommends that ambient levels of mercury in air should be kept as low as possible.
<P>

<a name="30212w32.html_para10">Environmental quality standards (EQSs) for mercury in the aquatic environment are set out in List I of the Dangerous Substances Directive (DSD) (76/464/EEC) and the Surface Water (Dangerous Substances) (Classification) Regulations (1989) as 1 nanogramme per litre for freshwater and 0.3 nanogrammes per litre for saltwater. Mercury discharges are also covered by daughter directives of the DSD (82/176/EEC and 84/156/EEC).

<P>
<a name="30212w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 While it is not Government policy to provide marketing funding for the pig industry, in 2000&#150;01 a one-off payment of &#163;2.65 million was made to the Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) to help them advertise the "pork mark". This was a campaign to promote welfare friendly pork. No further payments were made in 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03. Livestock and meat marketing, including the pig industry, is one of the functions of the MLC, established by the Agriculture Act 1967. The MLC has the general duty of promoting greater efficiency in the livestock products industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w33.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Compensation is not generally paid for destruction of plants in order to prevent or control the spread of plant pests or diseases. The Plant Health Act 1967 gives a discretion to pay compensation. A claim has recently been made by a grower in respect of action against plants infected with Phytophthora ramorum (the pathogen which is causing Sudden Oak Death in the United States of America). No final decision has been made on this claim. A case is currently before the European Court of Justice on the question of compensation for the destruction of diseased fish. The outcome of that case will be taken into account in reaching a final determination on the issue of compensation.

 Defra's Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate (PHSI) are continuing to survey nurseries and garden centres for symptoms of the disease and are examining established plants and trees in areas close to nurseries and garden centres in which the disease has been found. Substantial resources have been diverted into this work and the associated research programme. Plants moved from other member states or imported from third countries are being monitored to ensure that they meet movement requirements and are not carrying the disease. Any plants found to have the disease are destroyed. The devolved authorities and the Forestry Commission are taking similar action. Research is underway at the Central Science Laboratory and at the Forest Research Agency to assess the risk presented by this disease to a wide range of plants, in particular our native tree species and other native plants. The findings of this research will be used to update the Pest Risk Assessment in order to keep under review the precautionary actions being taken against the spread of this disease.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Government's policies on commercial whaling and the proposal for a Southern Ocean whale sanctuary.  [97132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w34.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government are strongly opposed to all whaling other than subsistence whaling by indigenous people. They fully support the International Whaling Commission's moratorium on commercial whaling and works within the IWC to maintain this.
<P>

<a name="30212w34.html_para0">The Government support the maintenance of existing whale sanctuaries in the Southern and Indian Oceans and has cosponsored proposals made by others for the creation of new sanctuaries in the South Pacific and South Atlantic.

<a name="30212w34.html_wqn2"><B> Diana Organ: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she has received concerning the introduction of a single closing date for the next round of the Woodland Grant Scheme for new planting.  [96828]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w34.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 10 February 2003]:</i> I have received one representation and this expressed concern about the introduction of a single closing date for new planting applications as announced by the Forestry Commission on 16 December 2002.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w34.html_wqn3"><B> Diana Organ: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of applications for the Woodland Grant Scheme for new planting in each of the last three years were from private landowners who had no previous experience of woodland planting.  [96831]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w34.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Previous experience is not a criterion for grant-aid. This information is not, therefore, routinely collected and could be made available only at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w34.html_wqn4"><B> Diana Organ: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what difficulties were experienced by <i>(a)</i> the Forestry Commission and <i>(b)</i> DEFRA staff with the two closing dates per year for the Woodland Grant Scheme, in each year since 2000.  [96861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w34.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Forestry Commission has found that any delays to the processing of grant applications made late in the year could result in applications not being approved in time for implementation during the current planting season. These delays can be for a number of reasons, including the resolution of issues between the Commission and the applicant and resolving items raised during the consultation process. Defra do not process the Woodland Grant Scheme (WGS), but process the associated Farm Woodland Premium Scheme (FWPS). Therefore any delays to a WGS application which has a parallel FWPS application can have a knock on effect within Defra.

<a name="30212w34.html_wqn5"><B> Diana Organ: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the difficulties with the 31 October deadline were for applicants for the Woodland Grant Scheme referred to by the Forestry Commission in its circular to interested parties dated 16th December 2002.  [96862]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w34.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 10 February 2003]:</i> Where there are delays in processing applications submitted late in the year, applicants may receive approval too late in the planting season to undertake the agreed work. A delay may be caused where applications are incomplete or require modification to meet the rules and standards of the Woodland Grant Scheme. Any objections arising from the consultation process have to be resolved, which can also add to the processing time.

<P>
<a name="30212w34.html_wqn6"><B> Diana Organ: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many applicants there were for the Woodland Grant Scheme round for which the closing date was 31 October 2002.  [96867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30212w34.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 10 February 2003]:</i> 633 applications for new planting were received for the 31 October 2002 closing date.
