DEFRA&#039;s Rural Strategy published in 2004 is leading to delivery reforms, including the creation of Natural England with which the Forestry Commission will be aligned.

 The Government assessed the costs of implementing a statutory Operating and Financial Review against those of implementing an enhanced Business Review in a Regulatory Impact Assessment, which was published alongside the DTI&#039;s formal response to consultation. It was estimated that a statutory Operating and Financial Review would cost business &#163;33 million per annum more than the Business Review.

<a name="stpa_27">Consistent with its approach to company law reform of simplifying company law, reducing the regulatory burden on business and promoting effective shareholder engagement, the Government have concluded that a requirement for an enhanced Business Review, in line with the requirements of the European Accounts Modernisation Directive, is preferable to a requirement for a statutory Operating and Financial Review for quoted companies. The enhanced Business Review will meet key narrative reporting requirements, while imposing considerably less cost than the Operating and Financial Review.

<a name="stpa_50">A great deal has already been achieved. For example, we have introduced regulations significantly improving access for disabled people to all new trains, buses and coaches; over 4,700 accessible rail vehicles will be in service by the end of 2005 and almost half of the bus fleet is already accessible across the country, with much higher proportions in many urban areas.

<a name="stpa_51">Measures in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 will further increase disabled people&#039;s rights when travelling by public transport. These include extending to transport services the right of access&quot; disabled people currently have to services such as shops and banks. The new Act also allows us to set an end date&quot;, of no later than 1 January 2020, by which time all trains will have to be accessible. We are on course to implement these measures in December 2006 in line with our published timetable.

<p><a name="st_62"><a name="51208w07.html_spnew9"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The Public Service Vehicles Accessibility Regulations 2000 (as amended) require buses with a capacity of more than 22 passengers, used on or after 31 December 2000 to be accessible to disabled people including wheelchair users. The regulations set end dates of 1 January 2015 for small single deck buses, 1 January 2016 for large single deck buses and 1 January 2017 for double deck buses to comply with the regulations. After those dates all buses in service will be accessible. Bus operators are free to choose how and where they introduce compliant buses, often leading to higher concentrations of accessible buses in major cities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he is taking to improve access to public transport for disabled people in Swindon.  [33227]</p>








<p><a name="st_63"><a name="51208w07.html_spnew10"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 We have introduced accessibility planning&quot; into the local transport planning process to encourage local authorities and other agencies to assess more systematically whether people can access transport services in their areas. This process covers all forms of transport from buses, coaches and taxis to cycling and walking networks. Making provision for disabled people is a condition against which the resulting Local Transport Plans (LTPs) are assessed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w07.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_52">Swindon borough council is using its LTP funding for an on-going programme of improvements at bus stops that will assist disabled passengers. The programme involves provision of raised kerbs at bus stops to minimise the step height between the pavement and the bus. This allows easier access for wheelchair users and for other people who have difficulty with high steps such as many older people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w07.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_53">Routes to bus stops are also being improved with new link paths and dropped-kerb road crossings and bus Stop Clearways are introduced to ensure that parked cars do not obstruct the stops allowing buses to pull up alongside the raised kerbs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w07.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_54">Local bus operators are providing new accessible low floor buses in Swindon and the Local Transport Plan funding to improve bus stops will allow the benefits of this investment in new vehicles to be maximised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w07.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_55">Rail services in Swindon are already accessible to disabled people. The station has lifts to all platforms and recent access improvements have been made to the forecourt and bus stop areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w07.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_56">At a national level there has been significant progress in making public transport accessible to disabled people through regulations made under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA 1995). We made the Rail Vehicle Accessibility Regulations in 2000 and many of the trains calling at the station comply with those. Although the older rolling stock serving Swindon doesn&#039;t comply it can nevertheless accommodate passengers travelling in a wheelchair.

<p>
<a name="51208w07.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_57">More generally disabled people in Swindon as elsewhere in the country will also benefit from the provisions in the Disability Discrimination Act 2005 (DDA 2005). We have already laid regulations which

 The London Development Agency (IDA) is responsible for acquiring the land in East London that will be needed for the Olympics and has recently made two compulsory purchase orders to this end. Other regional development agencies (RDAs) at Olympic sites elsewhere in the UK will also be able to acquire land (compulsorily or by agreement) if that proves necessary. Under the London Olympics Bill, currently before Parliament, the new Olympic Delivery Authority will have powers to acquire land by agreement&#151;including, with the consent of the Secretary of State, on the same terms as for compulsory purchases.

<a name="stpa_70">The Government made an amendment to the London Olympics Bill at Report Stage, on 6 December, which will ensure the necessary land can be assembled without delay and used for Olympic development. Where a RDA purchases land for the purpose of preparing for the Olympics, the amendment has the effect of removing the need for a special parliamentary process to approve the compulsory purchase of &#039;special land&#039; where equivalent land is not being provided in exchange; clarifying that &#039;special land&#039;, once acquired, can be built on; allowing the compulsory purchase of Crown land and any interest in Crown land; and extinguishing all existing rights over the land acquired (while providing for compensation to those who have rights removed).

 The cost of home heating oil in Northern Ireland is determined by a competitive market and, on average, has been lower than the equivalent cost in the remainder of the United Kingdom.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w11.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_83">The competitive market reflects developments in the international oil market. Global oil prices have been high and volatile over the past eighteen months as a result of very strong growth in global demand and accompanying pressure on supplies. Most recently, disruptions to US Gulf of Mexico production and refining capacity, as a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita, led to prices rising to record levels in early September 2005. These developments were reflected in a corresponding record increase in the price of home heating oil in Northern Ireland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w11.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_84">A recovery of global oil production and refining facilities, together with a slight reduction in demand has resulted in a subsequent moderation of prices. This, in turn, has led to a corresponding reduction in the average price of home heating oil in Northern Ireland.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry whether he plans to ban the import of cat and dog fur from China; and what penalties he has power to impose on those found to have breached such a ban.  [34606]</p>








<p><a name="st_111"><a name="51208w13.html_spnew9"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 The Government share the ethical abhorrence felt on hearing reports of cruelty to domestic cats and dogs. However, to date, the Government have no evidence of imports of domestic cat and dog fur into the UK. In a statement to Parliament on 28 January 2005 the Government made it clear that they are committed to establishing the facts about this issue and taking practical and proportionate action in response. We continue to believe, given EU competence on commercial policy, that any action is best pursued at EU level. We continue to discuss this with the European Commission.

<a name="stpa_116">The package of reforms to the EU&#039;s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) agreed in June 2003 and May 2004 mark a significant shift in the EU&#039;s agricultural policy. The de-coupling of subsidies from production should connect European farmers much more closely to the market and have real impacts on reducing excessive production, which results in dumping and harms developing countries. The Government will continue to be at the forefront of those pushing for further reform of the EU&#039;s agricultural policy and I welcome the fact that the Commission has re-affirmed its commitment to ensuring that the EU plays a full and constructive role in the WTO agriculture negotiations. I also welcome the commitment in the WTO to agree to set an end date for all export supports. The UK believes these should end by 2010.

<p><a name="st_151"><a name="51208w18.html_spnew12"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 Mainstream Government funding is, by its nature, determined by the relevant Government Departments based on their own procedures for allocating funding towards meeting their objectives under their Public Service Agreement. For most Government programmes, this is covered by the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1501W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
periodic spending reviews. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has been working with Departments towards ensuring that growth is given due consideration in the allocation of funding. In a number of cases this would follow in the ordinary course, simply because funding levels are based on (among other factors) population. In other cases, specific mechanisms are available to safeguard rapidly growing areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w18.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_132">To give an example from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s own departmental expenditure, population is an important factor in the allocation of revenue support grant (RSG) to local authorities. As a result of recent changes to the formula for allocating RSG, namely the abolition of ceilings&quot; and (as from 2006&#150;07) the use of forward-looking population data, local government funding will be more responsive to the relatively rapid population growth associated with growth areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w18.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_133">By way of example from another Department, capital funding from the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) for new schools places responds formulaically to local authorities&#039; estimates of pupil numbers. Local authorities in the growth areas should therefore be taking account of growth plans in their submission to DfES. Nonetheless, a safety valve&quot; mechanism has been put in place to allow exceptional needs resulting from unanticipated factors (which could include growth in pupil numbers) to be taken into account. A number of growth locations have accessed funding under this mechanism.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w18.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_134">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has made grant funding available exclusively in support of projects in the growth areas. The total amount of such funding, up to and including 2007&#150;08, is around &#163;1.25billion. This does not include the &#163;200 million to be made available to the growth areas by Department for Transport under the community infrastructure fund. Expenditure beyond 2007&#150;08 will be subject to the forthcoming Comprehensive Spending Review. This expenditure will lever in funding from other sources. For example, it was estimated that the initial round of ODPM funding (amounting to just over &#163;600m) would lever in funding of over &#163;3 billion from other public and private sector partners (not including Department for Transport funding).
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w18.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_135">Private sector investment will respond to opportunities presented by the growth areas, e.g. investment by the privately owned utilities in water, wastewater and electricity supply infrastructure. In addition, housing developers will be expected to contribute to the infrastructure costs associated with housing development through Section 106 contributions. A good example of this is in Milton Keynes, where the local delivery vehicle Milton Keynes Partnerships Committee has been negotiating a standard charge of over &#163;18,000 per house from developers in the east and west expansion flanks. This will generate approximately &#163;300 million of funding to complement circa &#163;900 million of funding from public sources in support of infrastructure to facilitate construction of 15,000 houses to 2016.

<p><a name="st_164"><a name="51208w20.html_spnew1"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has made no formal assessment of the impact of local authority fees on the willingness of applicants to use the process provided by the Anti-Social Behaviour Act 2003 to deal with excessively high hedges. This part of the 2003 Act came into operation in June 2005 and so it is too soon to draw conclusions about the impact of local authority fees. We are also aware that authorities are keeping their fees for this service under review.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what guidance he has issued to local councils on actionthey should take in response to an application under high hedges regulations to cut a hedge by morethan a third to ensure reasonable enjoyment of a property.  [34913]</p>








<p><a name="st_165"><a name="51208w20.html_spnew2"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has issued no guidelines on not cutting hedges by more than a third. Paragraph 6.24 of our publication &#039;High Hedges Complaints: Prevention and Cure&#039; advises that Councils cannot order remedial works that would kill a hedge. In our view this would amount to the same as removing the hedge altogether and, under section 69(3) of the 2003 Act, Councils are expressly prevented from ordering action involving removal of a hedge.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w20.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_140">How far one can reduce a hedge before it is killed will vary according to the particular circumstances and, to illustrate the point, we give the example of a healthy Leyland cypress hedge which will usually respond well to a reduction by up to one-third whereas an older specimen may not. There will be circumstances where Leyland cypress, or other species, may be reduced by more than one-third without destroying them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51208w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_141">Where local councils have concluded that remedial action is required to ensure reasonable enjoyment of a property, it is for them to decide what height the hedge should be reduced to while ensuring its survival. That judgment depends on the species of the shrubs or trees in the hedge, their age and health, and past management. We recommend councils, therefore, to consider each case on its merits and to obtain arboricultural advice.

Further information is published on the Frequently Asked Questions pages of our website at www.odpm.gov.uk/treesandhedges, under the heading &#039;Remedial works&#039;. This acknowledges that there may be some cases where councils could be prevented from requiring action that would provide a full remedy to the problems identified because it would kill the hedge. Nevertheless, they would still be able to order works that offer some relief to the complainant. In addition, if a complainant 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1507W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
considers that the action specified in a remedial notice does not go far enough, they can appeal against the council&#039;s decision to the Planning Inspectorate.

The Environment Agency would be consulted as part of theEIA process, and if it was decided in the light of the resulting environmental statement that the development should proceed, it could require conditions on the monitoring of river quality to be attached to the mineral permission.

Where applicable, those visits will continue beyond that three year limit.

The guidance makes clear that schools should demonstrate to children that they are in a safe environment where they will be listened to, and that schools should have a child protection policy in place, which emphasises the importance of listening to children and taking their concerns seriously.

Notes:<br>

1.Numbers are rounded to the nearest thousand and percentages to the nearest whole number.<br>

2.Robust information covering the period May 2003 to February 2004 is not currently available.<br>

3.Information prior to November 1995 is not provided as management information is not available.<br>





4.The above includes those old scheme cases with a full maintenance assessment, and those new scheme cases with either a full maintenance calculation, or a default maintenance decision. Old scheme cases with a punitive interim maintenance assessment (an imposed assessment due to the non co-operation of the non resident parent), a small number of which would have deductions from earnings orders in place, are excluded from this analysis in line with the Agency&#039;s target definitions, as are new scheme cases being processed clerically.<br>

5.These figures include all cases with a maintenance liability with the exception of around 5,000 cases for which the method of payment is unknown.<br>

Old scheme cases with a punitive interim maintenance assessment (an imposed assessment due to the non co-operation of the Non Resident Parent), a small number of which would have deductions from earnings orders in place, are excluded from this analysis in line with the Agency&#039;s target definitions, as are new scheme cases being processed clerically.<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>8 Dec 2005 : Column 1550W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>Previously, a customer may have had to visit a Jobcentre to access job vacancies, and a social security office to arrange payment of benefit. The new service brings both together in an integrated, personal service for customers. In fact, customers in receipt of benefit other than Jobseeker&#039;s Allowance have increased access to our offices, as there will be approximately double the number of Jobcentre Plus locations compared with the number of social security offices they could have previously contacted.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_112">In planning the new network of Jobcentre Plus offices, local managers take into account many factors including population spread, availability and cost of public transport and the distance between offices. We aim to locate our new offices where there are good transport links. Inevitably as the office network changes, there will be some customers who will find they will have to travel further. Jobcentre Plus is actively working with local partners to ensure these hard to reach communities have access to services.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_113">In many locations, particularly rural locations, we are often able to provide outreach facilities, ensuring access to job vacancies, advice and information through third party premises.

Where the closure of an office means customers having to travel over an hour to the nearest office, we will consider if postal signing is appropriate.

The Colombian Government have a clear duty to undertake thorough judicial investigations into all attacks and abuses, including those where there are credible allegations of collusion.

Former Ugandan Minister, Betty Bigombe, who has been trying for years to encourage peace talks, has suggested that if it is genuine in its latest offer, the LRA should call a ceasefire in northern Uganda. For any peace talks to succeed the LRA needs to demonstrate that they are seriously pursuing a sustainable peace that ensures those indicted by the International Criminal Court face justice in The Hague.

Following up the implementation of the guideline, NICE has carried out surveys measuring its impact and these are available on the NICE website at www.nice.org.uk The surveys have found that 95 per cent. of the PCTs who responded are offering at least one cycle of IVF to those defined as eligible according to local criteria. The primary responsibility for the implementation of the clinical guideline on the assessment and treatment of people with fertility problems produced by NICE rests with the national health service at local level, in discussion with patients&#039; groups and local health bodies.

Notes:<br>

1.Last 10 years for which data are currently available.<br>

2.Figures do not accurately represent the number of patients treated as a patient may have more than one episode of care during the year.<br>

3.Two different counting systems were used during this time series. From 2000&#150;01 counts were based on administrative data category field &#039;admincat&#039; but for earlier years the counts were based on a derived administrative category data field.<br>

4.Figures are grossed for coverage, except for 2003&#150;04 which is not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>
