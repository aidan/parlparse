<i> [holding answer 8 February 2011]:</i> Bus lanes are provided to give buses priority at times of congestion. It is for local highway authorities to determine which, if any, other classes of vehicle may be allowed to use bus lanes in their area.</p>

 A system of requiring vehicles to display evidence that a vehicle is insured by means of a windscreen disc has been considered. However, UK law requires the driver to be insured, rather than the vehicle; a disc would not guarantee that the person behind the wheel was insured to drive. In addition, the disc would only be evidence that somebody had insurance cover for the use of the vehicle at the time when the disc was issued and would not demonstrate whether insurance was currently valid.</p>

 Direct services between London and Lowestoft ceased operation in December 2010. This was part of a wider package of service changes which provided more seats across the Anglia network as a whole. The analysis carried out by the Department for Transport focused on the financial impact across the whole franchise. It did not carry out a specific analysis of the impact on Lowestoft.</p>

Bidders will, however, be encouraged to develop timetable proposals which maximise the value of the franchise and the benefit for passengers. It is possible that these might include new journey opportunities should there be a case for doing so.</p>

 The decision not to send a destroyer or frigate to the Caribbean region during 2011 was taken on the basis of available capability and not as a savings measure. The ship that had been identified for this task will be redeployed elsewhere and will, therefore, continue to incur operational costs. The financial implications are still being assessed.</p>

Estimates for 2010-11 may be revised after the end of the cold weather payment season, but will still be estimates not actuals.<br>
2. A cold weather payment is made to an eligible customer when the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0Â° C or below over seven consecutive days at the weather station linked to the customer's postcode. (When the temperature criterion is met, the weather station is said to trigger.)<br>

4. Estimates of potential qualifiers for each weather station for 2010-11 were made at the beginning of the winter. Both Charlwood and Gravesend weather stations have already triggered this winter, so the estimated number of benefit units that received at least one cold weather payment in 2010-11 will not change during the rest of the winter. The estimates for 2010-11 may be revised once the national out-turn for the winter is known.<br>

 In the Welfare Reform Bill we will be introducing a claimant commitment, which will set out the responsibilities of benefit recipients, alongside a clear and robust set of sanctions. Claimants will therefore know what they are expected to do and the consequences of failing to meet those expectations. These changes will be introduced under the current benefit system and will continue to apply under universal credit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_73"><a name="110211w0001.htm_para38"><a name="11021133000533">The proposed model of sanctions could lead to longer sanctions for some claimants, particularly claimants who have repeatedly failed to meet their responsibilities. For other claimants-those who fail to meet lower level requirements-sanctions could be shorter depending on how quickly they re-engage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_74"><a name="110211w0001.htm_para39"><a name="11021133000534">The overall effect on benefit costs will depend on the response of claimants to the proposed sanctions system. If-as is hoped-claimants are encouraged to comply in the first place and re-engage more quickly where they do fail to meet their responsibilities, there are unlikely to be any savings in comparison with the current system as a result of more sanctions being imposed. However, there could be savings from people moving off benefit more quickly as a result of greater compliance with the system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_75"><a name="110211w0001.htm_para40"><a name="11021133000535">This sort of behavioural response is difficult to predict with certainty. And at this stage it is not possible to quantify the impact of the behavioural impact of the changes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_76"><a name="110211w0001.htm_para41"><a name="11021133000536">Overall, we have estimated that universal credit will have a substantial positive impact on poverty and could lift as many as 350,000 children out of relative income poverty. This is a combined impact of all measurable universal credit factors, and does not identify the impact of the sanctions regime. This will help to meet the four 2020 income poverty targets in the Child Poverty Act.</p>

<i> [holding answer 8 February 2011]:</i> The Environmental Noise Directive 2002/49/EC (END) required member states to submit summaries of all the adopted airport noise actions plans to the European Commission by January 2009. Given the possible risk of infraction, DEFRA officials have ensured that the Commission has been kept regularly informed of progress and of the timetable for completion of the process. The Commission has recognised that its timetable was very tight and, thus, the reasons for the delay. It is understood that some member states have yet to report any information on action plans. Furthermore, the devolved Administrations have completed their action plan reporting, and England has already reported summaries of the action plans for its agglomerations, major roads and major railways. As a result, our current assessment is that the risk of infraction proceedings is minimal. DEFRA is planning to report to the Commission in the early summer, following the adoption of the action plans for the 17 English airports.</p>

 It is not possible to give an accurate estimate of the value of the Government Art Collection, which has no current market valuation. The current monetary value of a work of art can be accurately assessed only at the time of purchase or sale or by professional valuation.
