 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what effect she expects the removal of Varroosis from the list of notifiable diseases to have on the health of <i>(a)</i> feral and <i>(b)</i> non-feral colonies of bees.  [208365]</p>




<p><a name="50119w02.html_spnew2"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Removing Varroosis from the list of notifiable diseases is not expected to have any significant impact on bee health as the disease has been endemic in the UK for several years.

<p><a name="50119w02.html_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 In recent years, the value of honey production in the UK has fluctuated between &#163;10 million and &#163;35 million per annum. Production has ranged between 3,000 and 7,500 tonnes per annum. The contribution of the honey industry to the agricultural economy is difficult to measure since productivity depends on a range of factors. But, subject to the influence of environmental conditions, such as the weather and available flora, bee health and the interest in the craft of beekeeping, no marked change is expected in the next five years.

 Defra annually monitors the numbers of a whole range of birds, through the Breeding Bird Survey. This survey, conducted and funded jointly by the British Trust for Ornithology, the RSPB and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, assesses trends in the numbers of common species of birds across the country. A range of other surveys, funded by these organisations, assesses trends in scarcer species. Annual reports are produced for each of the surveys, but summary information derived from them is contained in the report The State of the UK&#039;s Birds 2003 <sup>1</sup> , which was published in July 2004.

Whilst there is no reason for complacency, indications are that the dramatic rate of long-term decline in overall bird populations may have been halted.

<p><a name="50119w02.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Ministers were briefed about and had access to Mr. Dring&#039;s personal statement in the week beginning 8 March 2004. Officials knew about Mr. Dring&#039;s statement prior to and during the period of the FMD 2001: Lessons to be Learned Inquiry, chaired by Dr. Iain Anderson
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w02.html_para6">
Mr. Dring&#039;s personal statement was not submitted to the Lessons to be Learned Inquiry, as there was concern that the contents would have been prejudicial to Mr. Waugh&#039;s trial at which Mr. Dring was a witness of fact, rather than an expert witness, had the statement received publicity beforehand. The contemporaneous notes of Mr. Dring&#039;s visits to Burnside were given to Dr. Anderson. Mr. Dring also contributed fully to the investigations on the origins of the foot-and mouth (FMD) outbreak 2001, submitted by the then Chief Veterinary Officer to the Inquiry. This Origins of FMD report was based on wide-ranging evidence and rigorous investigation and was published by Dr. Anderson. Defra has no record of minutes of informal meetings being made or submitted to the inquiry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w02.html_para7">
Ministers and Dr. Anderson have said it was regrettable that the Mr. Dring&#039;s statement was not sent to the inquiry. However, Dr. Anderson has stated that had he seen Mr. Dring&#039;s statement at that time it would not have changed any conclusions or recommendations of his inquiry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w02.html_para8">
The circumstances surrounding Mr. Dring&#039;s visit to Burnside Farm were discussed with the Lessons Learned Inquiry Team on 4 March 2002; a note of the meeting was also published by Dr. Anderson.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w02.html_para9">
Defra has known about the video since it was first being made in so far as a Veterinary Officer was present on Burnside Farm on 24 February 2001, when filming took place. We have no record of Ministers being expressly informed of the existence of the video until recently. The Under-Secretary of State (Lords) became aware of the video when extracts were shown in the television news media at the time of Robert Waugh&#039;s trial in May 2002. It was brought to Ministers&#039; attention

Defra has no record of being sent a copy of the video by Northumberland county council before February 2003. Northumberland county council did not release any copies of the video before the trial of Mr. Waugh in May 2002, after Dr. Anderson had stopped receiving evidence for his Lessons to be Learned Inquiry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w02.html_para11">
Officials were aware made aware of the scientific tests results on the samples taken at Burnside Farm, as soon they were available, resulting in Defra confirming disease on Burnside farm on 23 February. Details of the samples and the results of the tests are set out in the Origins of FMD report submitted to the Anderson Inquiry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w02.html_para12">
As set out in the Origins of FMD report, samples were taken at Burnside Farm on 22 February, which included epithelium samples from two pigs and 20 blood samples taken from other pigs on the premises. On 24 February further sampling was carried out when FMD experts from the Institute for Animal Health, Pirbright and an epidemiological team from Defra visited the farm. 88 per cent. of the 241 pigs blood sampled on that day were seropositive for FMD Type O antibodies.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs where the UK ranks in the Environmental Sustainability Index; and what the rankings are of other EU countries.  [208224]</p>




<p><a name="50119w03.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK ranks 91st in the current 2002 Environmental Sustainability Index. The ranks for other EU countries are shown in the following table. We understand that an updated Index is to be published by the end of February.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w03.html_para2">
The UK and other countries believe this index is flawed and potentially misleading. It is an aggregated indicator that aims to weigh together many components into a single overall measure of &quot;environmental sustainability&quot;, an approach that as yet is not scientifically robust. The choice of the components, and the way in which they are weighted together is largely subjective. A different choice of components or weights would give different results&#151;amply illustrated by the fact that the previous edition of this index, based on a different selection of components, placed the UK 16th. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Jan 2005 : Column 942W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Furthermore, there are still many areas where data are not sufficiently comparable between countries, or are simply not available and have been imputed. It should also be noted that the variables in this index tend to measure circumstances at a single point in time rather than trends or changes, therefore to the extent the index measures anything at all, it is based on the environmental situation which a country faces rather than its progress or performance in improving environmental Sustainability.

 The data are not available in the form requested. The Government are currently consulting on a waste data strategy, designed to improve the quality of waste data in the interests of all potential users.

<p>
<a name="50119w04.html_para1">
The Environment Agency&#039;s National Waste Production Survey (NWPS) of 20,000 businesses, conducted in 1998&#150;99, produced the following estimates in respect of food waste:

<p>
<a name="50119w04.html_para2">
However these figures only relate to that fraction of the waste that is definitely food. A considerable amount of food waste was also contained within the general and biodegradable category. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) estimate that the amount of food waste produced by the hotel and restaurant sector, for example, could be as high as 3 million tonnes per year.

From 1 January 2006 the Animal By-Products Regulation (EC) No 1774/2002 will prohibit the use of landfill for the disposal of former foodstuffs containing material of animal origin which originate in food manufacturing and retail premises. Also, I understand that a number of multiple retailers have voluntary initiatives in place to make use of unsold food products.

Defra has also contributed funding, along with other stakeholders, to a Transport 2000 study to model various transport distribution scenarios for a &#039;basket&#039; of three food products. The study examined whether a shift to sourcing these products more locally would lead to

 Staffing levels at the National Bee Unit will be affected by a reduction of 20 per cent. in funding for the Defra bee health programme from 2008. Detailed decisions are a matter for the Central Science Laboratory but we anticipate the reduction will impact most on seasonal bee inspectors.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on progress on the Government programme for use of timber products which are legal and sustainably grown.  [209377]</p>




<p><a name="50119w05.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 In July 2000 the Government made a commitment that its central Departments and their executive agencies would seek to purchase their timber and timber products from legal and sustainable sources. Since then the Government has commissioned research and advice on implementing this policy, undertaken consultation with stakeholders, raised the awareness of central Departments, promoted the policy to the wider 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>19 Jan 2005 : Column 946W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
public sector, published guidance and commenced the development of a central point of expertise on timber (CPET).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w05.html_para0">
The Sustainable Development in Government Reports provide an indication of the progress being made by central Departments in England. The Third Annual Report 2004 reveals that certified products accounted for 71 per cent. of the money spent on construction timber and 78 per cent. of the money spent on manufactured timber products during the financial year 2003&#150;04. Much of the uncertified timber purchased was supplied with some evidence of legal and sustainable sources. For the preceding financial year 2002&#150;03 Departments reported that certified products accounted for approximately 50 per cent. of their spend on all timber products and that there was some evidence that much of the uncertified timber came from legal and sustainable sources.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w05.html_para1">
The CPET is being developed in phases. Phase 1 was completed in November 2004 and provided an assessment of the extent to which five forest certification schemes provide Government buyers with assurance that legal and sustainable timber has been procured. Phase 2 of CPET will provide a help line service for public sector buyers and their suppliers. A pilot scheme is currently in operation and will provide information that will assist the Government in developing a full service. The Government expects the Phase 2 Help Line service to be operational before autumn 2005.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will incorporate social criteria involving impacts on indigenous forest people into official programmes for responsible timber use.  [209378]</p>




<p><a name="50119w05.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s timber procurement policy is aimed, in part, at helping to improve the well being of forest dependent peoples throughout the world. The Government is asking its timber suppliers to provide independent verification that their timber was legally harvested and preferably grown in well-managed forests. In many producing countries the forest laws will help to protect indigenous people&#039;s rights, customs and livelihoods. The application of certification scheme standards and equivalent standards that provide assurance of sustainable forest management will add to that protection in many instances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w05.html_para2">
The Government does not place contractual obligations on its suppliers to take direct action to protect indigenous people because the Government understands that to do so would be in contravention of EU procurement directives. EU procurement law prohibits the specification of criteria that are not strictly relevant to the performance of a contract. Specifications must relate to what is being procured rather than to the people or undertakings that produce what is being procured.

<p><a name="50119w11.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 There have been four acts of decommissioning to date. The latest act occurred on 21 October 2003, when the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning reported that it had witnessed a third event in which IRA weapons were put beyond use. The Prime Minister made clear at Leeds Castle, the Government regards the completion of decommissioning by paramilitary groups as essential to progress in Northern Ireland.

 I met with the Chief Executives of the four main banks in Northern Ireland last week to discuss how security systems can be further enhanced. I have asked the Armed Robbery Expert Group of the Organised Crime Task Force to look urgently at the lessons to be learned from this robbery and to report at the next meeting of the OCTF.

 There is no doubt that paramilitary organisations continue to engage in illegal activity. The IMC report which was published on 4 November 2004 provided a clear assessment of the extent of the involvement of both loyalist and republican paramilitary organisations in organised crime and other forms of criminality. The Government have consistently made clear that there can be absolutely no place for terrorist activity or criminal activity and I call on all paramilitary groups to cease all of their activities.

<p><a name="50119w17.html_spnew0"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 Donations to charity are not themselves taxed. The Gift Aid scheme allows individual donors to make a declaration allowing the charity to reclaim the basic rate tax they have paid on the money they donate, adding 28 pence to every &#163;1 donated. In some cases tax will not have been paid on the money donated so there is nothing for the charity to claim back. It is important that charities claim tax only where they have a declaration from the donor allowing them to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w17.html_para0">
The Disasters Emergency Committee has announced that, as of 6 January 2005, &#163;100 million has been donated to the Tsunami appeal. This figure is increasing on a daily basis. It is estimated that Gift Aid tax repaid on donations will be over &#163;15 million. The precise amount will depend upon the final total donations and the number of donors using Gift Aid. Gift Aid declarations may be made retrospectively, so donors who have made donations without making a declaration can go back to the charity and do so. The more donors use Gift Aid the more government will be able to add to their donations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w17.html_para1">
The Inland Revenue website contains information for donors and charities and there is also a link from the Treasury website to this information. Inland Revenue is actively promoting tax effective methods of giving such as Gift Aid and Payroll Giving.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w17.html_para2">
In addition the Treasury will make a special donation to the Disasters Emergency Committee to offset the VAT costs associated with the proposed charity concert, charity records and other events designed to raise money specifically for the tsunami appeal. The exact sum will be based on the VAT expected to be collected by Customs in relation to fund-raising sales of goods and services.

On balance, the New Earnings Survey sample size for the Isle of Wight is such that their labour costs cannot be estimated with the same degree of precision as other, more populous, areas. The Isle of Wight sample size is no larger than other unitary, metropolitan or London boroughs that we have combined together in order to avoid small samples.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) if he will make a statement on the eligibility of housing association tenants for the right to buy;  [208658]
</p>



<p>(2) how many housing association tenants are eligible for the right to buy.  [208659]</p>




<p><a name="50119w20.html_spnew1"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Around 870,000 housing association tenants have the Right to Buy or the Preserved Right to Buy their rented homes.

<a name="50119w20.html_para0">
The Right to Buy is available to approximately 65,000 pre-1988 secure tenants of non-charitable housing associations. Housing association properties were generally let on secure tenancies until 1988 but all new lettings since then have been on assured tenancies which do not include the Right to Buy.

<p><a name="50119w20.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Swayne: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether his Department plans to use a revised formula for the Supporting People grant allocations for 2005&#150;06; and if he will make a statement.  [208528]</p>




<p><a name="50119w20.html_spnew2"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Supporting People grant allocations for 2005&#150;06, announced on 2 December 2004, were partly informed by a new needs based distribution formula. The overall size of the Supporting People budget has reduced in 2005&#150;06 by 5 per cent. The Government made a commitment to limit any decrease in grant to individual authorities to no more than 7.5 per cent. The majority of authorities received the average reduction of 5 per cent. The formula, which is intended to help allocate funds to areas of greatest relative need, was only used to inform grant levels to those authorities likely to receive longer term increases or decreases in funding.
</p>

<p><a name="50119w20.html_spnew3"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The precautionary approach recommended by the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones&#039; report in 2000 has provided the basis for Government policy. The Group&#039;s report did not recommend a ban on the construction of mobile phone masts near schools or any other site. What the report did do was make some specific recommendations for precautionary action for the use of mobile technology. The Government accepted the precautionary approach advised by the Group and have adopted a range of specific actions.

<i>[holding answer 29 November 2004]:</i> The statement made by the National Contact Point (NCP) for the OECD Guidelines on Avient drew, in part, on documentation provided by the UN.

 The references to &quot;free&quot; and &quot;undistorted&quot; competition in Article 1&#150;3(3) of the new Constitutional Treaty are both widely used and widely understood in outlining the aims of competition policy. They are terms used in Articles 3<i>(l)</i> <i>(g)</i> and 4 of the current treaty. EU competition policy aims to create and maintain a system which promotes undistorted competition within an economic area free from anti-competitive practices and, through its monitoring and investigative powers, bans cartels, prohibits the abuse of dominant positions on the functioning of markets, exercises merger controls, controls on State subsidies and has responsibility for liberalising markets&quot;.

 We fully support the representatives of Burmese ethnic groups addressing UN bodies which are mandated to accept their evidence. In general, only UN member states and observer states are able to address the UN General Assembly. However evidence provided to other UN Committees and Working Groups, and at UN General Assembly side-events, can help raise the awareness of UN members to the human rights abuses that are taking place in Burma. The UK also played a key role in drafting last year&#039;s UN General Assembly Human Rights Resolution on Burma. The Resolution, adopted by the UN in December, condemned the many human rights abuses in the country, including against ethnic groups.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on his Department&#039;s policy towards mixed wards in hospitals.  [207733]</p>




<p><a name="50119w26.html_spnew9"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The Department has given a clear commitment to improve patient privacy and dignity, and has set three objectives for national health service trusts, which require them to provide single-sex accommodation for hospital in-patients.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w26.html_para8">
We use the term &quot;accommodation&quot; rather than &quot;wards&quot;, as this expands the scope of the requirement to segregate men and women to areas which do not fall within the traditional definition of a ward, for example to care environments which are residential in design.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w26.html_para9">
Single-sex accommodation is defined as single-sex sleeping areas, separate bathroom and toilet facilities for men and women and, for those trusts delivering mental health services, safe facilities for the mentally ill. The separation of male and female sleeping areas can be achieved in a variety of ways, including the use of single rooms and combinations of single-sex bays.

The NHS has worked hard to achieve our standards. By December 2003,

The small number of NHS trusts who have yet to achieve the objectives have hospital development works underway, the completion of which will bring them to the required standard.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50119w26.html_para12">
In some circumstances, such as emergency admissions, the use of mixed-sex accommodation may be unavoidable. This is regrettable, but no hospital will turn a patient away because a bed appropriate to their gender is not immediately available. Good practice indicates that patients in this situation be moved to appropriate single-sex accommodation within 48 hours.
