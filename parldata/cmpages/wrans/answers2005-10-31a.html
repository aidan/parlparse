<p><a name="st_5"><a name="51031w01.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The Department has put in place a considerable programme of improvements across a wide range of transport policy areas since 1997. I am confident that the Gateshead East and Washington West constituency will have benefited from these. For example, the injury totals for all road casualties in Great Britain fell from 327,803 in 1997 to 280,840 in 2004, and the numbers of children aged less than 16 years killed or seriously injured on our roads fell from 6,452 in 1997 to 3,905 in 2004. On our railways, passenger kilometres have increased from 32.1 billion in 1996&#150;67 to 42.4 billion in 2004&#150;05, a rise of 32 per cent. In terms of improvements to air quality, emissions of the UK&#039;s two main pollutants, nitrous oxides and particles, fell by 38 per cent. and 21 per cent. respectively between 1997 and 2003.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what assessment he has made of the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>31 Oct 2005 : Column 671W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
process by which power was transferred from the police to local authorities following the decriminalisation of parking offences; what steps he took to ensure that this was a smooth transition of authority; and if he will make a statement;  [22882]

<p><a name="st_12"><a name="51031w02.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 The Road Traffic Act 1991 provides for the decriminalisation of most non-endorseable on-street parking offences in London and allows similar arrangements to be introduced elsewhere. Research for the Department by the Transport Research Laboratory (&quot;Special Parking Areas in London&quot;; &quot;The Special Parking Area in the District of Winchester&quot;; and &quot;The Special Parking Area in Oxford&quot;) showed that decriminalised parking enforcement provides local authorities with greater control over their enforcement activity and an enhanced ability to deliver their parking strategies. The Department partly funded the British Parking Association&#039;s recent review of decriminalised parking enforcement, which concluded that the existing system works well but that it would benefit from some modifications.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51031w02.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_7">In 1995, the Secretary of State issued detailed guidance for local authorities in England outside of London on applying for, introducing and operating decriminalised parking enforcement. The guidance&#151;local authority circular 1/95&#151;makes clear that local authorities should liaise with the police to ensure a smooth and orderly transfer of responsibilities and that they should, therefore, continue to liaise with the police so that the two systems can operate effectively side-by-side. When applying for the power to enforce parking regulations, authorities have to submit detailed applications to the Department for Transport which need to confirm, among other things, that the authority will review its existing Traffic Regulation Orders, signs and road markings and use suitable documentation&#151;including an appropriate penalty charge notice (PCN)&#151;when enforcing contraventions. The appropriate police authority is asked whether it supports the application.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51031w02.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_8">Circular 1/95 also makes clear that the Government expect authorities to have regard to the minimum or common standards set out in that guidance. The information that must appear on a penalty charge notice is set out in the Road Traffic Act 1991. The Secretary of State&#039;s 1/95 guidance provides further suggestions about information that should be provided on penalty charge notices.

Many of these had been shown in the past to harbour <i>M. bovis</i> occasionally, but this project has been the first to show <i>M. bovis</i> in muntjac deer. The prevalence in most of these species was very low and ecological factors suggested that they posed little risk.

<a name="stpa_55">A number of measures have been introduced aimed at tightening surveillance and reducing the risk of TB spreading to new areas. The recalculation of routine testing intervals will ensure TB testing complies with Commission legislation while offering robust protection. Livestock movement restrictions are now imposed immediately a herd&#039;s routine test becomes overdue and a more rigorous and systematic approach to identifying and dealing with potential new TB hotspots is in place. In addition to this, rigorous testing schedules for new and reformed herds have been introduced.

 The Government regards responsible business behaviour as very important and that corporate social responsibility can help companies to become more efficient, more profitable and more sustainable. The Company Law Reform Bill will address one aspect of corporate social responsibility through its introduction of a statutory statement of directors general duties. This will provide greater clarity to directors on how they are expected to behave. The basic goal of directors is the success of the company in the collective best interests of shareholders, but in fulfilling this duty directors will be required, to have regard to factors such as the impact of the company&#039;s operations on the community and the environment. This approach will give directors the clarity they need, while recognising that business prosperity and responsible business behaviour are two sides of the same coin. It complements the requirement on quoted companies to report on matters such as social and community issues and the environment in the operating and financial review where these are necessary for an understanding of the nature of the business.

 The best opportunity for increasing the accessibility of the EU market to trade with developing countries is a successful and ambitious result from the Doha Development Agenda in the World Trade Organisation (WTO).

Notes:<br>

1. The figure for the United Kingdom is derived from estimates in the ONS Public Sector Employment Quarter 2 First Release (published 30 September 2005).<br>

2. Northern Ireland data are based on information from the Quarterly Employment Survey and relate to the number of public sector jobs not the number of people working in the public sector. Data are expressed as a percentage of the total workplace employment level from the LFS in Northern Ireland. HM forces data are not included.<br>

3. Figures for the regions and countries within Great Britain have been produced using estimates from the Labour Force Survey. These have been constrained to the total UK public sector employment total so that estimates are in-line with National Accounts definitions of the public sector.<br>

<a name="qnpa_36">In particular, the summit endorsed the need for faster progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), acknowledging the special needs of Africa.

<a name="qnpa_38">Important commitments were also made in other areas too. For DFID, our immediate priorities are to support the establishment of the Peacebuilding Commission by the end of the year and to develop satisfactory arrangements for the Peacebuilding Fund; to be closely involved in the process by which the Secretary General develops his ideas for longer-term reform of the UN development architecture; and to continue to work with the UN on reform of the humanitarian assistance system.

<a name="qnpa_39">The Millennium Review Summit ensured that the momentum generated at Gleneagles was maintained, and the commitments made there given global endorsement by the 191 UN member states. There is still much to be done, but the agreements reached this year represent a significant step towards reducing poverty in developing countries.

<i>[holding answer 24 October 2005]:</i> The key performance target for overcrowding in public sector prisons for 2005&#150;06 is for no more than 24 per cent. of the population, and for the private sector 34.5 per cent. of the population held in accommodation units intended for fewer prisoners. The difference in the targets between the public and private sector prisons reflects their different circumstances. Private sector prisons are generally of a comparatively newer design and construction than their public sector equivalents and better able to safely accommodate higher levels of overcrowding than the public sector estate. At present, there are 23.5 per cent. of prisoners sharing accommodation in crowded conditions in the public sector and 24.9 per cent. in the private sector. This is kept under review.

 In criminal cases, legal aid funding provides for the services of an interpreter when an individual is arrested and held at a police station. Once the case is heard at court, an interpreter for the defendant is arranged and funded by Her Majesty&#039;s Court Service.

<a name="stpa_202">For civil cases, interpreter fees are allowable in principle as a supplier disbursement in all categories of law, both for preparation work and in court.

 No recent research has been commissioned by the Department of Constitutional Affairs or the Legal Services Commission specifically on the reasons for individuals opting to take up legal aid. However, studies tasked with investigating other aspects of the justice system do occasionally include some consideration of the reasons for take-up of legal aid.
