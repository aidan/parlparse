<P>
<a name="20226w01.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The National Service Framework for Older People highlights the development of services for people with dementia as a high priority. As such, future research underpinning the continued development of services for older people will take full account of dementia services.
<P>

<a name="20226w01.html_para0">We welcomed the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) appraisal of anti dementia drugs in January last year. The widespread availability for the anti dementia drugs appraised will have a profound effect on the quality of life for mental health sufferers; it will tilt the balance of specialist services towards earlier diagnosis and a more clinic-based approach than has been the case to date. With &#163;12 million being made available for the prescribing of these drugs, it is expected that 15,000 people will benefit from NICE's guidance.
<P>

<a name="20226w01.html_para1">The Medical Research Council (MRC), the main agency through with the Government support research on the causes and treatment of disease and funded via the Department of Trade and Industry, spent approximately &#163;8.2 million on dementia research in 2000&#150;01.

 We want to ensure that all mental health problems are addressed through good quality services which are sensitive to service users needs, gender and ethnicity. That is why we published a National Service Framework (NSF) for mental health, in September 1999. This sets national standards in five key areas with time 



<P>

scales and targets for achievement. Eating disorders, including anorexia, is one of the common mental health problems, which the framework seeks to address.
<P>

<a name="20226w01.html_para4">We have made significant additional investment in mental health services&#151;&#163;700 million over three years in addition to the &#163;3 billion already invested. Strong monitoring mechanisms have been introduced to ensure that money for mental health is actually spent on implementing the NSF. It is for health authorities to plan and decide on the level of additional investment locally to meet the standards of NSF in relation to eating disorders.
<P>

<a name="20226w01.html_para5">Services for people with eating disorders have been defined as specialist mental health services. This means that primary care trusts will be expected to act collaboratively to ensure that the right level and quality of service is available to their populations. The new strategic health authorities will have a role in ensuring that this happens. Consideration is also being given to a means of achieving national oversight of specialised mental health services to ensure that they become increasingly available to the whole population.
<P>

<a name="20226w01.html_para6">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence will be developing a specific guideline on the management of eating disorders and the further development of NHS Direct will mean that eating disorders sufferers will be able to get first-level advice and referral on to specialised helplines or to local services.

We will shortly be publishing a consultation paper with proposals to clarify and strengthen the way in which topics are selected for referral to NICE, including proposals for the future composition of the Technologies Advisory Group.

 Data are not collected on average waiting times for heart bypass operations specifically. Instead, data have been provided for the last 12 months on the average waiting time for in-patient procedures in the cardiothoracic surgery and cardiology specialties in England and in Gloucestershire health authority. Waiting times in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are matters for the devolved Administrations.
<P>

<a name="20226w02.html_para0">&#163;15 million investment was announced in November 2001 for extra heart operations; the national health service is now working towards a 12-month maximum wait by March, which we are expecting to be achieved in most areas. The waiting and choice initiative from July will give patients who wait more than six months for their operation the choice to move to an alternative provider, which will mean a shorter wait for many.

<a name="20226w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Helen Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what estimate he has made of the numbers of <i>(a)</i> private and <i>(b)</i> local authority homes that (i) have closed and (ii) plan to close due to the higher standards of care set out in the Care Standards Act 2000;  [30296]

<P>
(4) what date private nursing homes and residential units for the elderly must meet the standards of care stated in the Care Standards Act 2000.  [30295]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w02.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 There is no evidence of a direct correlation between the introduction of national minimum standards under the Care Standards Act 2000 and the reduction in numbers of care home beds. Many providers already meet or exceed the standards and will have no reason to be concerned about them.
<P>

<a name="20226w02.html_para1">We do not consider it appropriate to provide direct financial assistance to care homes who do not meet the standards. However, we are providing significant additional resources for social services. Resources for social services have increased by 20.4 per cent. in real terms between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03, and average annual increase of 3.1 per cent. This means that local authorities have the resources they need to purchase services at realistic prices. In contracting with care homes we expect local authorities to take into account a range of provider 



<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 2002 : Column 1068W</I><P>
costs such as implementing national standards. The additional resources include the &#163;300 million that we announced on 9 October for this year and next.
<P>

<a name="20226w02.html_para2">The standards for care homes for older people will apply from 1 April 2002, unless otherwise stated in any standard. However, this does not mean that homes must meet all the standards immediately. If standards were not being met in a few respects, the National Care Standards Commission would note this in its inspection report and write to the home owner giving reasonable time in which to make the changes. The national minimum standards for care homes for older people were published on 2 March 2001 and a copy placed in the Library. The standards for care homes for younger adults were approved in December 2001 and are available on the Department of Health website (www.doh.gov.uk/ncsc). The final version will be published shortly and placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20226w02.html_para3">We are determined that the standards will be introduced in a way that will ensure that the application of the new standards does not lead to the closure of good quality homes. On 30 January I launched a package of measures to help smooth the introduction of the standards. This included statutory guidance to the Commission. In particular, the guidance says the Commission should consider whether care homes can fulfil the needs of service users without making environmental changes to meet the standards. The guidance particularly covers issues of room size, lifts, baths and shared rooms. The guidance has been welcomed by the major associations representing care homes, the Registered Nursing Homes Association, the National Care Homes Association and the Independent Health Care Association.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what assessment he has made of the use of Copaxone in the treatment of MS;  [30379]

 In August 1999, we asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) to conduct a detailed appraisal of the clinical and cost-effectiveness of beta interferon and glatiramer acetate (brand name Copaxone). NICE issued its guidance on 4 February 2002. NICE recommends that these products are not cost effective on the current arrangements for supply to the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20226w02.html_para4">On 5 September 2001, following NICE's recommendation in its Provisional Appraisal Determination, the Department of Health commenced discussions with the manufacturers of beta interferon and glatiramer acetate about the possible provision of these therapies for patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) on the national health service in a manner which could be considered to be cost-effective. These discussions are complete and on Monday 4 February we announced details of an innovative scheme to make these products available on the NHS. The scheme starts on 6 May 2002. Details are contained in Health Service Circular 2002/004 which has been issued widely across the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20226w02.html_para5">We do not hold information centrally on individual health authority policies on treatments for MS.
<P>

<a name="20226w02.html_para6">According to our records, since 5 September (when the discussions with manufacturers commenced) we have received no written representations from patients using glatiramer acetate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the regulatory regime for <i>(a)</i> private sector hospitals, <i>(b)</i> private sector general practitioners and <i>(c)</i> private sector consultants.  [30853]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w03.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Independent hospitals are currently regulated by health authorities under the Registered Homes Act 1984. Private general practitioners are not currently regulated, although those who work in the national health service as well as the independent sector will be subject to inspection by the Commission for Health Improvement.
<P>

<a name="20226w03.html_para0">Consultant surgeons who are in charge of their own independent clinics are regulated by health authorities, but those who are granted practising privileges in independent hospitals but have no managerial role there, are not.
<P>

<a name="20226w03.html_para1">On 1 April the national care standards commission will take over from health authorities the regulation of independent hospitals and clinics under the Care Standards Act 2000. From that date, general practitioners who work exclusively in the private sector will be brought under regulation by the national care standards commission for the first time. Private consultants with practising privileges in independent hospitals will, as before, not be required to register personally with the commission. However, the registered providers will be held responsible for the quality of treatment those consultants provide.
<P>

<a name="20226w03.html_para2">The regulations and national minimum standards for the independent health care sector have been published and are available on the website www.doh.gov.uk/ncsc. Copies have been placed in the Library.

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2002]:</i> National health service clinicians learn to operate an appropriate range of electronic medical equipment as part of their basic professional education. The Department does not set the curricula for pre-registration and undergraduate health professional education. This is a matter for the professional regulatory bodies.
<P>

<a name="20226w03.html_para3">Developing and maintaining the standards and skills of NHS staff who use electronic medical equipment is the responsibility of individual local NHS employers working in partnership with regulatory and professional bodies. However, as part of Medical Devices Agency's (MDA's) guidance and leverage programme, the MDA provide information routinely to health care professionals which assists in the training and safe use of electronic medical equipment and devices. This information is in the form of: device safety alerts, covering specific device related problems; technical notes; device bulletins; posters; and other written communications. Device bulletins in particular cover in more detail general device issues and have included training and management guidance.
<P>

<a name="20226w03.html_para4">The MDA has issued advice on "Medical Devices and Equipment Management for Hospitals and Community- based Organisations" (DB 9801 January 1998). The MDA have also co-operated with professional bodies and training organisations in developing targeted training for health care workers using electronic medical devices and equipment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the impact on waiting lists of the implementation of the advice on prion transmission by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee.  [32783]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w03.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The move to single use instruments for tonsil and adenoid surgery in January 2001 was part of the Department's strategy to reduce the theoretical risk of transmitting variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD) through surgical instruments. The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) advised that single use instruments be considered for tonsil and adenoid surgery as part of this strategy "provided patient safety would not be compromised".
<P>

<a name="20226w03.html_para5">An initial shortage of single-use instruments led to the number of patients waiting for tonsil and adenoid surgery rising between January and June 2001, however the waiting list has fallen each month since June 2001. The number of patients waiting over 18 months for tonsil and adenoid surgery peaked in July 2001 at 206, but this figure had reduced to eight by November 2001.
<P>

<a name="20226w03.html_para6">Following the increase in provision of single use instruments in June 2001 the Medical Devices Agency Adverse Incident Centre received reports of adverse events with their use in tonsil and adenoid surgery. This included an increase in primary and secondary bleeding that required re-hospitalisation, return to theatre and blood transfusion. In the interests of patient safety and taking account of the improvement in central sterile services in

[32826]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w03.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Regardless of grade or job title the normal age of retirement for all staff in the Department and its agencies is 60. Some staff who transferred into the Department from the national health service retained the right to retire on NHS terms at the age of 65. The Department is currently involved in taking forward a Cabinet Office led initiative called "Winning The Generation Game" looking at flexible retirement options.

<P>
<a name="20226w03.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 I am advised that there are currently 54 Wyre Forest residents waiting for non-urgent prostate surgery, the majority of which will be treated within 12 months.
<P>

<a name="20226w03.html_para7">I am further advised by the trust that in cases where the clinical need is judged the greatest, the waiting time will be far shorter. The trust expects that all patients waiting for non-urgent prostate operations will be treated within 15 months, and urgent cases of prostate cancer patients will be treated within two weeks of diagnosis.
<P>

<a name="20226w03.html_para8">Figures for Wyre Forest residents are in line with non- urgent prostate surgery waiting times in Worcestershire as a whole.

The MRC is not currently funding any research into migraine, and has not funded any research in the past five years. The MRC, however, always welcomes high quality applications for support into any aspect of human health and these are judged in open competition with other demands on funding. Awards are made according to their scientific quality and importance.

 The average number of General Dental Service (GDS) registrations in England during the years 1996&#150;97 to 2000&#150;01 is shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="20226w05.html_para5">Registration numbers were reduced by the shortening of the registration period for new registrations from September 1996. For adults the period fell from 24 to 15 months. Children's registrations used to lapse at the end of the following calendar year; they now last for 24 months. This affected registration numbers between December 1997 and August 1998. Data for 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 are not comparable with later years.

 An estimated &#163;1.2 billion will be spent on the general dental service and in excess of &#163;50 million revenue will be invested in personal dental service pilot schemes in the current financial year.

[30845]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w06.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The national health service does not target developing countries for recruitment of nurses and no recruitment activity is planned in countries of sub-Saharan Africa, which have been hardest hit by the HIV epidemic. However, many developing countries have invited the UK to offer job opportunities to health care professionals, particularly to enhance their clinical practice and to benefit from further education and training in the NHS.
<P>

<a name="20226w06.html_para0">While the safety of patients is of paramount importance, it should be recognised that the procedures involved in most nursing duties do not pose a risk of HIV infection to patients, provided normal infection control precautions are observed. There have been no reported cases of HIV transmission from infected health care workers to patients in the UK.
<P>

<a name="20226w06.html_para1">Existing guidelines place health care workers who are or may be HIV infected under ethical and legal duties to protect the health and safety of their patients by seeking counselling and HIV testing if they believe they have been at risk of infection. If infected, they are required to seek and follow confidential occupational health advice about the need to modify or limit their working practices.

<a name="20226w06.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The west midlands regional surveillance system of HIV provides an accurate picture of the epidemiology of HIV infection in the west midlands in order to ensure appropriate targeting of preventative interventions and to monitor progress in tackling the epidemic.
<P>

<a name="20226w06.html_para3">I am advised that Coventry health authority has highly proactive educational, preventive and support programmes that work with individuals and their families and various target groups. The health authority works closely with national health service providers as well as the Terrence Higgins Trust and has a continuous programme of needs assessment in order to tailor the services to the changing epidemiology. Coventry also has a well established needle and syringe exchange scheme.
<P>

<a name="20226w06.html_para4">In terms of funding, in 2001&#150;02, the west midlands received &#163;7.7 million for HIV treatment and care and &#163;4.3 million for HIV prevention. During the same period, Coventry health authority received &#163;481,000 for HIV treatment and &#163;268,000 for HIV prevention.

 This is a matter for the Scottish Executive. However, infection control is an issue that we take seriously and we are determined to ensure that there are universally robust infection control arrangements in place. This should ensure that all patients receive the level and quality of care they expect. National standards for infection control have been developed to be delivered in all national health service trusts in England. These are independently reviewed and monitored by both the Audit Commission and the Commission for Health Improvement.

Where patients travel abroad for treatment the NHS meets the cost of the patient's travel from the point at which they begin their international journey (the airport, ferry port or international train station) to the foreign provider. Reimbursement of travel expenses between the patient's home to the airport, ferry port or international train station are governed by the same rules that apply to payment of travelling expenses to hospitals in England. This change

 The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatments for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC) which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry. In 2000&#150;01 the MRC spent &#163;920,000 on research into Muscular Dystrophy. This included a number of projects and fellowships looking specifically at Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy and a major programme of work on the molecular analysis of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy at the MRC Functional Genetics unit in Oxford. This work is at a basic level and it is hoped that such research will lead to treatments in the future.

<P>
<a name="20226w07.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The NHS Plan set a target for all primary care trusts to have schemes in place so that people get more help from pharmacists in using their medicines by 2004. We have set up a collaborative medicines management programme, hosted by the National Prescribing Centre. The first wave of 26 pilot sites was announced last July and the second wave of 40 sites was announced on 12 February. We are also supporting a trial of structured services based exclusively in community pharmacies for patients with coronary heart disease. These initiatives build on and complement other local initiatives under which pharmacists are involved in reviewing patients' medication.

 Under their national health service terms of service, pharmacies are not required to provide monitored dosage systems. Any charges for the supply of monitored dosage systems are therefore a commercial matter.

 There are nearly 5,000 medicines which can be sold or supplied by a pharmacy without a prescription. We are aware of a small number of primary care trust areas where some medicines which do not require a prescription are supplied on the national health service, through a pharmacy, without patients needing to see their general practitioner. A larger number of PCT areas are using patient group directions to make a limited range of prescription only medicines available through pharmacies. However, as there are local initiatives, no definitive list of such schemes, nor of PCTs which plan to establish such schemes, is held centrally.

 There have been exchanges of correspondence on the new requirements between the Department and the headquarters of the leading charitable provider of hyperbaric oxygen therapy since November 2000. In July last year the proposed regulations and national minimum standards for independent health care providers were published for consultation. This exercise prompted a good response and the proposed standards were revised in light of the comments made. Consequently, the requirements for hyperbaric facilities for therapeutic use are considerably fewer than for those used to treat patients with acute medical conditions, and proportionate to their simpler operation.

 In the statutory charging system for residential care the value of a property is generally taken into account when assessing a person's ability to contribute to the cost of their care. Each council will need to establish the amount a property is worth. This is done by referring each case to the district valuer or a professional valuer who will give them the current market price. The value of a property can depend on whether it is freehold or leasehold. Other than this, the tenants of leasehold properties and residents of freehold properties are treated identically when they are financially assessed for residential accommodation.

 There are currently 12 charitably funded air ambulance services operating in England. The charities are responsible for the number of aircraft provided.

<a name="20226w11.html_para0">Air ambulances have a role in delivering emergency care especially in rural areas and where road access is a problem.

<sup>(5)</sup> To 31 December 2001<P>

<P>

<i>Note:</i><P>

1. This list includes sums provided to the three Lottery Film Franchises. The legal contracts committing the Franchise funds were signed in 1997&#150;98 when the Lottery franchises were awarded by the Arts Council of England and are not new awards. The Franchisees are therefore contractually entitled to the funding irrespective of current Board membership.<P>

2. Awards made to the Franchisees as soft commitments before 1 April 2000 are disclosed here as hard commitments. This disclosure follows the accounting treatment in the 2001 accounts.<P>

3. Paul Webster is a Director of Film Four. Film Four acts as co-producer or co-funder on a number of projects also supported by the Film Council. However, the awards are made to third party organisations and any benefits accruing to Film Four will be derived from its own investment in the project and not through the Film Council. In the financial year 2000&#150;01 the total amount of awards to such organisations was &#163;4,468,072.<P>

4. Other applications have been received from organisations in which Board members have an interest which are either pending a decision or have already been rejected.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the practice of the Film Council in relation to awards to organisations in which members of the board of the Film Council had an interest.  [36967]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w11.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 2002]:</i> Evaluation of lottery funding applications has been delegated by the Film Council board through the Chief Executive Officer, as Accounting Officer, to fund or scheme managers. This ensures that members of the board do not participate in the discussion or determination of individual awards whether or not individual board members hold an interest in the application.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the awards made by the Film Council since 1 April 2000 to organisations in which members of the board of the Film Council had an interest.  [36966]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w11.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 2002]:</i> The Film Council acknowledges that with a board which includes industry practitioners, there will be occasions when board members or organisations employing board members will apply for Film Council funding. The procedures adopted by the council for handling potential conflicts of interest provide that board members do not exert any influence in the determination of applications for lottery awards.

<a name="20226w11.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proportion of the awards made by the Film Council since 1 April 2000 were made to organisations in which members of the board of the Film Council had an interest.  [36964]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w11.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 2002]:</i> The proportion of new awards made to organisations in which board members have an interest, since 1 April 2000, and where no pre-existing commitments exist, is 9 per cent. However, awards honoured since 1 April 2000, including prior contractual commitments inherited by the Film Council from the Arts Council of England in respect of the three lottery film franchises, increased the proportion to 55 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the steps taken by the Film Council to ensure that no conflict of interest existed when decisions to make awards to organisations in which members of the board of the Film Council had an interest were taken.  [36968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w11.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 2002]:</i> Decisions on Lottery funding applications have been delegated to individual fund or scheme managers. This ensures that members of the board do not participate in the discussion or determination of matters in which they might have a direct interest. There is an onus on both the board member and on the Film Council to identify at an early stage any new interest a board member, their spouse or close family member or any person with whom they have a close personal relationship, whether or not living in the same household, has in projects or in activities resulting in an application to the Film Council for funding. A register of board members' interests is maintained and is updated annually.

 Officials from my department have met a number of independent film producers, television producers, and broadcasters, as well as representatives from industry trade organisations, and the Film Council, to discuss the use of tax allowances. The views expressed were passed to the Inland Revenue as changes to the tax relief are, ultimately, a matter for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

<P>
<a name="20226w12.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 About 50 per cent. of the tax relief, by value, goes to film producers, and 50 per cent. to television producers. The vast majority of applications from film makers for a 'British film' certificate to access

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to her answer of 18 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 506W, what the cost of refurbishing each ministerial private office was in each year since May 1997.  [37888]<P>

<P>
<a name="20226w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The previous answer addressed the cost of refurbishment, which was taken to mean not merely redecoration and/or replacement furnishing but rather extensive building works. The cost of redecoration/ refurnishing of ministerial offices has been &#163;106,382.98 in the period November 1997 to January 1998. A sum of &#163;22,134 in 1999 and &#163;11,200 in late 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans the Government have concerning charitable status for sports clubs.  [37883]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Charity Commission announced in November 2001 that certain local amateur sports clubs would be eligible to apply for charitable status on the grounds that such clubs promote healthy recreation. I have recently met the commission's chairman to discuss how best to encourage clubs to apply for charitable status, and to ensure that the widest possible range of sports are eligible. In the light of that meeting, I consider that charitable status will offer a great deal to many clubs.

<P>
<a name="20226w12.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 A television licence is required to use any television receiver as defined in the Wireless Telegraphy (Television Licence Fees) Regulations 1997. The licence fee does not vary according to the size or portability of a television set. However, a television licence covers the use anywhere in the United Kingdom, by the licensee or a person normally living with the licensee at the licensed address, of a television receiver powered solely by its own internal batteries.

[37718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w12.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 As announced last year, the Government propose to introduce measures to preserve the rights of beneficiaries of the Accommodation for Residential Care (ARC) concessionary television licence scheme when the social mix or the level of warden cover in their sheltered housing change, so long as they remain in accommodation provided or managed by a local authority, a housing association or a development corporation. Consultations between officials and the BBC about the necessary amendments to the television licence fee regulations are currently under way. We intend to bring forward these amendments as soon as we can but it is important that in doing so we do not create any new anomalies or unnecessary administrative burdens.

<a name="20226w12.html_para2">The change in the resource element of the DEL arises from the transfer of resources from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of &#163;2,000,000 toward the costs of mounting the 2002 Commonwealth Games in Manchester; the transfer of resources, as part of the machinery of government changes, from the Cabinet Office of &#163;210,000 for the administration costs of the Commonwealth Games Unit; from the Home Office of &#163;2,461,000 for the administration costs of the Golden Jubilee Unit and of the alcohol licensing, gambling, film and video licensing functions, of &#163;1,265,000 for the receipts and &#163;3,680,000 for the expenditure of the Gaming Board of Great Britain, and of &#163;3,000,000 for grants and associated expenditure for the Queen's Golden Jubilee.

 The global fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria (GFATM) is committed to adopting a balanced, integrated approach between treatment and prevention.

Through such measures, Post Office Ltd. is continuing its efforts to reopen sub-post offices where there have been recent closures.
<P>

<a name="20226w15.html_para2">Consignia define an unavoidable closure of a post office as one where no one suitable is prepared to take over from the departing sub-postmaster, where no suitable premises remain available or can be identified or where an associated retail business is no longer commercially viable.

 This Act is part of a package of measures that the Government have put in place to change the late payment culture here. The Credit Management Research Centre (CMRC) based at Leeds University has been monitoring late payment activity in England since 1998.
<P>

<a name="20226w16.html_para0">The CMRC reports show that there has been a fall of almost 7.5 per cent. in the percentage of payments that are reported as being late by the businesses that they survey. This fall relates to the period between their first survey and the survey for the quarter ending June 2001. During the same period the number of debtor days for small businesses has fallen by almost 24 per cent. and the mean number of debtor days for all businesses has fallen by almost 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20226w16.html_para1">Finally, the "European Business Survey" for 2001, produced by the accountants Grant Thornton, shows the UK as having a payment period almost a week (five days) shorter than the EU average (52 days).

 We are currently working to give businesses two significant new entitlements; the right to claim reasonable debt-recovery costs without having to go to court; and the ability for grossly unfair terms and conditions that work against the intent of the late payment legislation to be challenged and their continued use prevented.
<P>

<a name="20226w16.html_para2">The changes will come into effect from 8 August 2002, and from that date the late payment legislation will be available to all businesses and organisations irrespective of their size. Currently only small businesses can use the legislation, although previously this right was to have been extended to all business and organisations from 1 November 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many companies granted a licence under section 10 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 have complied with the requirement under Condition 16 of Schedule 4 of their licence to have satisfied the Director General of Oftel that they have sufficient funds secured to meet any liabilities arising from their activities.  [37202]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Two operators, Orange and Vodafone, have satisfied the Director in accordance with condition 16 of their licences. Discussions are taking place between Oftel and two further operators, Energis and Telewest.
<P>

<a name="20226w17.html_para0">In order to improve this position and to reflect changes in the industry since the original Condition 16 arrangements were established, the Director General has had detailed discussions with both the industry and the Highway Authorities and has now completed a public consultation on proposals to change these arrangements. He hopes to commence a second public consultation shortly on a proposal for a new approach which will be easier to implement and should prove to be less costly for the companies concerned.

<P>
<a name="20226w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 I understand that this matter is still before the courts. It would therefore be inappropriate to make a statement at this time. If the final decision in this case has important implications for postal services these will need to be considered in the first instance by Postcomm.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps the Government will take to safeguard the future of postal services in rural areas.  [31275]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alexander </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2002]:</i> Under the Postal Services Act 2000 the postal regulator the Postal Services Commission (Postcomm) has the primary duty to ensure the provision of a universal postal service. The obligation consists of a service provided at an affordable price determined by a public tariff uniform throughout the UK and includes the delivery each working day to the home or premises of every individual in the UK and a collection each working day from access points.
<P>

<a name="20226w17.html_para1">Subject to this primary responsibility Postcomm is also under a duty to exercise its functions in the manner which it considers is best calculated to further the interests of users of postal services, wherever appropriate by promoting effective competition between postal operators. In performing this secondary duty Postcomm shall have regard to the interests of, amongst others, individuals residing in rural areas.
<P>

<a name="20226w17.html_para2">Currently Postcomm requires Consignia plc, in the licence to provide a universal postal service. Subject to Consignia's universal service obligations, the number and timing of deliveries is an operational issue for Consignia.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B>

<P>
<a name="20226w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The liquid high-level radioactive waste (Highly Active Liquid (HAL)) held at the B215 facility at Sellafield contains essentially all the radioactive isotopes produced in a nuclear reactor. This includes caesium 137 which is estimated to account for approximately a quarter of the total activity contained in the HAL. The total amount of HAL kept in the highly active storage tanks at any one time is related primarily to (1) the total amount of HAL arising from spent fuel reprocessed at Sellafield and (2) the amount of HAL that is converted from liquid form into vitrified form (solid glass blocks).
<P>

<a name="20226w17.html_para5">The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has published a number of detailed reports by the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) on the safety of storage of liquid high level waste (HLW) at Sellafield. The report published by HSE in February 2000 assesses the key safety issues associated with HLW storage at Sellafield and the actions to be taken to reduce the stocks of liquid waste contained in the tanks to buffer volumes by the agreed target date of 2015. This report and an addendum to it that was published by HSE in August 2001 are in the Libraries of the House. The February 2000 report includes at appendix B a detailed outline of the history of HLW storage at Sellafield. From this it can be seen that the first eight tanks at B215 were commissioned in 1955 with a further 13 commissioned during the period between 1970 and 1990.

There has been no ministerial contact with the Chairman of CSCS following their refusal to permit the affiliation of the registration of Landbased Operatives Scheme (ROLO) launched by the British Association of Landscape Industries (BALI). Both BALI and CSCS are independent organisations. CSCS has set down affiliation criteria which the ROLO scheme has not satisfied.

This is in addition to the &#163;100 million that the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced on 27 November 2001 in his pre-Budget report.
<P>

<a name="20226w19.html_para5">The urgent operational requirements that this funding allows us to meet include: equipment to improve our ability to work with the US and other allies, such as additional secure communications equipment; enhancements to our intelligence capabilities; and a range of small but significant enhancements to our forces for operations in the campaign against international terrorism.

 I am delighted to announce that Paradigm has today been selected as the preferred bidder for the Skynet 5 project. This is the largest Ministry of Defence Private Finance Initiative project to have reached the preferred bidder stage, and will deliver the next generation of satellite communications services for Britain's armed forces. The Skynet 5 solution will be based on a constellation of at least two satellites, which will be owned and operated by Paradigm. We expect to place a contract with Paradigm later this year, with an initial service being provided from 2005. In preparation for this, Paradigm will take over responsibility in 2003 for the existing Skynet 4 capability. The PFI approach offers significantly better value for money when compared to 



<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many married quarters in each grade (1) in the UK are available to the Defence Housing Executive; and how many service families are entitled to quarters in each grade;  [35645]

<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w19.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Married personnel in the armed forces are entitled to a quarter. The type of quarter (i.e. its size, design and number of rooms) to which a married service person is entitled is determined mainly by rank for officers and mainly by family size for other ranks. Family housing in mainland UK is managed by the Defence Housing Executive (DHE) whereas that in Northern Ireland and overseas is managed by the relevant service authorities. A breakdown by Type of the family housing stock is shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="20226w19.html_para6">Figures for numbers of entitled service families are not readily available in the form requested. However, many personnel do not take up their entitlement to family housing, preferring to buy their own. The DHE does not normally house entitled personnel in houses of a type below their entitlement: instead, additional houses are rented by the Ministry of Defence on an ad hoc basis where necessary to meet entitlement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w19.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Responsibility for the allocation of maintenance expenditure is delegated to top level budget holders, though they are guided by the high priority we attach to improving single living accommodation, as announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence in March last year. The nature of property maintenance expenditure means that it is difficult in practice to attribute it precisely between single living accommodation and other areas. This information could therefore be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2002]:</i> War Disablement Pensions (WDP) were recognised as being tax-free both before 1973 and since. As WDPs are exempt from tax, the War Pensions Agency has no mechanism to deduct tax and no record of any deductions. There may have been occasional individual problems with regard to tax affecting WDPs but we are aware of none.
<P>

<a name="20226w20.html_para0">We would need to conduct a manual search of current and closed pension files in order to identify the number of Army Service Attributable Pensions (SAP) correctly treated for tax purposes since 1973. The current problem has arisen principally with respect to Service Invaliding Pensions (SIP). It is possible, however, that in a small number of Army cases an error may have arisen for SAPs in those cases where the scheme rules require the SAP to be paid at the SIP rate where the latter is higher. This is because the pension will have been recorded as a SIP within our computer systems and Inland Revenue may have been advised of eligibility for tax on that basis.
<P>

<a name="20226w20.html_para1">The number of SIP cases identified as a result of our review of the some 20,000 relevant live Army pension files, following recognition of the error in 1998, is as set out.

We are in the process of conducting a sample search of those files dating from the 1940s where we have been able to establish that a SIP might have been in payment and might therefore have been incorrectly taxed. This work should be completed shortly and should provide a clearer perspective on the scope of the problem.

 The Phoenix system, the Ministry of Defence only in-service unmanned air vehicle (UAV), entered service in 1998. Development of future UAV capability is being pursued through two projects: "Watchkeeper", which is planned to deliver a tactical UAV towards the end of this decade; and the Future Offensive Air System (FOAS) programme, where we are assessing the feasiblity of UAVs contributing to our future strike capability from about 2020 onwards.
<P>

<a name="20226w20.html_para5">The MOD's expenditure on UAV development over the last three years was approximately &#163;9 million in 1999&#150;2000, &#163;17 million in 2000&#150;01, and &#163;18 million in 2001&#150;02. This does not include the cost of broader-based research, which could bring benefit in due course to a range of capability areas including UAVs.

 I assume the hon. Member is referring to unmanned aerial vehicles and that the term organic air vehicles relates to small UAVs developed as an integral part of a military platform. Against this common understanding, there has been no expenditure by the Ministry of Defence specifically on the development of organic or micro air vehicles in the last three years. There are elements of the research programme that may in the longer term prove applicable to organic or micro air vehicles but no specific apportionment of expenditure is possible.

 Ministry of Defence records do not separately identify contracts with "private military companies". As the Command Paper "Private Military Companies: Options for Regulation" published by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 12 February makes clear, the term "private military company" covers a wide range of people, corporations and activities. The MOD has and continues to seek the involvement of private sector companies who can provide assistance with military support activities, for example maintenance and training. Types of activity where the MOD is involving the private sector in public-private partnerships were listed in my answer to the hon.

 The estimated final cost of the Eurofighter procurement programme for the Royal Air Force, based on 232 aircraft, is &#163;18,869 million. This figure excludes initial in-service support. Fifty-five aircraft have so far been ordered for the RAF. Detailed costings are provided in the National Audit Office's Major Project Report 2001, a copy of which has been placed in the Library of the House.

 The main development contracts were placed in 1988 and the first development aircraft flight took place in 1994. In 1995, the contracts were re-orientated following the end of the Cold War, and the production contracts were awarded in 1998. The next major milestone will be the first flight of an instrumented production aircraft, trials of which will permit acceptance into service of series production aircraft. Royal Air Force Eurofighters will initially operate from the BAES site at Warton before the first squadron forms at RAF Coningsby in 2004. Full operational capability is expected to be achieved during the second half of the decade.

 The paper "Post-combat Syndromes from the Boer War to the Gulf War: A Cluster Analysis of their Nature and Attribution" is a valuable contribution to understanding post-combat health.

These findings will be taken into account as we continue to evolve our policies, procedures and practices for managing health issues in the armed forces.

 Since its creation as a company on 1 July 2001, QinetiQ has not purchased any United States companies. However, QinetiQ did form a US subsidiary last year, QinetiQ, Inc, with the aim of enhancing the growth of QinetiQ's business with government and commercial customers in the US market. In addition, QinetiQ has recently re-formed a new US company, QinetiQ Trusted Information Management, Inc, as a wholly owned subsidiary of QinetiQ, Inc.

<P>
<a name="20226w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The EU tried for eight months to engage Zimbabwe in constructive consultation, under the Cotonou agreement. President Mugabe refused to engage. The EU accordingly moved to Article 96 consultations in October 2001. This was a final opportunity for the Government of Zimbabwe to engage positively. Again, they did not.
<P>

<a name="20226w24.html_para1">As a consequence, at the General Affairs council on 28 January the EU decided it would close Article 96 Consultations and implement targeted sanctions if the Government of Zimbabwe prevented the deployment of an EU observer mission, or impeded its effective operation; if they prevented the international media from having free access to cover the election; if there was a serious deterioration in the human rights situation, or attacks on the opposition; or if the election was assessed as not being free and fair.
<P>

<a name="20226w24.html_para2">On 4 February the Zimbabwean Government sent a letter to the European Union, inviting it to send observers to cover the election. The letter specifically excluded the United Kingdom, Denmark, Sweden, the Netherlands, Germany and Finland from sending observers. It did not specify how many could be sent, (the EU had intended to send a total of 150). The letter did not specify either what access they would have to voting stations.

<P>

<a name="20226w24.html_para4">Mr. Schori reported to the General Affairs Council (GAC) on 18 February that an EU election observation mission was untenable because the Zimbabwe Government was obstructing the deployment of observers and because of the unremitting violence and restrictions on the media. The GAC therefore decided to impose targeted sanctions (asset freeze, travel ban and arms embargo) against 20 senior members of the Zimbabwe Government. The vote was unanimous. A copy of these conclusions has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20226w24.html_para5">The GAC conclusions note that the EU reserves the right to take additional targeted restrictive measures, at a later date, if the situation deteriorates further.

[36929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 On 29 November, the day after the establishment of a National Investigation Commission, the Charg&#233; d'Affaires in Jakarta raised our concerns about this case with Manuel Kaisiepo, the Minister for the Development of Eastern Indonesia. On 5 February Foreign Office officials raised the issue of the National Investigation Commission with the Indonesian Ambassador in London.

<P>

<a name="20226w24.html_para6">The UK Government are aware of widespread concern over the composition of the National Investigation Commission, and the presence of the separate Indonesian armed forces investigation team.

 While there has been good progress in East Timor in bringing to account those who committed crimes in 1999, progress in Jakarta has been disappointingly slow. However, judges and prosecutors for the Ad Hoc Tribunal have now been appointed and the tribunal is expected to begin hearing cases in March.
<P>

<a name="20226w24.html_para7">While it is important for the tribunal to begin as soon as possible, we will continue to raise our concerns about the jurisdictional limitations of the tribunal with the Indonesian authorities.

<P>

<a name="20226w24.html_para8">There is currently no provision for victim/witness protection under Indonesian law. However, it is expected that this will be included in forthcoming legislation.

 One of the key objectives of the Lisbon economic and social reform strategy is to make the EU the most dynamic and competitive economy in the world. Improving EU productivity levels is central to achieving that aim. At the second annual review of the Lisbon strategy, in Barcelona, the Spanish Presidency is proposing to concentrate on five priority areas: transport and communication networks; energy; education and training; financial services; labour markets. The Government fully support this approach. All five areas have a key role to play in improving EU productivity. Better interconnection between transport and communication networks will improve physical and virtual mobility and delivery; more energy liberalisation and interconnection will improve competition and lower prices; the right approach to education and training will deliver the skills and adaptability required by the 21 Century workplace; integrated financial markets will lower the cost of capital and increase consumer and business choice; more flexible and dynamic labour markets will facilitate job creation and labour mobility.

He has also discussed affordable housing with the National Housing Forum, and visited the Priory Heights Community Housing Project in London. In addition, I attended a debate on affordable housing in South Gloucestershire.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w27.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The DTLR's guidance "Evaluating the Extent of Rough Sleeping" states that rough sleeper counts should take place on a single night and should take place between midnight and 6am.
<P>

<a name="20226w27.html_para0">The guidance contains the methodology for carrying out a count of rough sleepers. This methodology was developed by voluntary sector agencies including Shelter in the early 1990s and has been tested and developed through independent research. The methodology has remained unchanged and has been used nationally for over five years.
<P>

<a name="20226w27.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Rough Sleepers Unit funds a range of housing associations and voluntary organisations in England to provide temporary accommodation, including hostels and rolling shelters, for rough sleepers. In financial year 2001&#150;02, this amounted to &#163;8,193,000.

 Rough sleeping counts are arranged and supervised by staff from voluntary agencies and local authorities. Guidance issued to local authorities highlights that the safety of counters should be the overriding priority when carrying out a count and that safety is discussed before a count takes place.
<P>

<a name="20226w27.html_para2">Counters work in pairs for safety reasons and to verify the accuracy of the records made. In some cases voluntary organisations have drawn up additional safety and good practice guidelines to ensure the well being of their staff and volunteers who help out with counts.

<a name="20226w27.html_para3">Arrangements should also be made in advance by local authorities or the voluntary agencies for the safe transport home of counters, by taxi if necessary.

 Guidance on publicity material is contained in the Department's "Housing Transfer Guidance&#151;2002 Programme" which includes a Good Practice Guide on consultation material.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w27.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The Department currently has no budget for this purpose because local authorities in England are required to meet the early debt redemption premiums that may be incurred when authorities repay housing debt at the time of a housing stock transfer. Responsibility for housing in Wales is a devolved issue and is now a matter for the National Assembly for Wales.

 The Nottingham Express Transit is a 14km light rail line running from Hucknall, north of Nottingham, through other former mining communities and disadvantaged inner city areas before reaching the city centre and terminating at Nottingham railway station.

 A table showing the number of malicious dwelling fires attended by local authority fire brigades in the UK for the period 1997 to 2000 has today been placed in the Libraries of the House. These figures are also expressed as a rate per million of the population (PMP) and per 10,000 dwellings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what regulations are in place on minimum standards for the size and quality of housing.  [37176]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w28.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 There are a number of regulations in place in relation to the size and quality of housing.
<P>

<a name="20226w28.html_para2">Under the housing fitness standard, set out in section 604 in the Housing Act 1985, as amended by the Local Government and Housing Act 1989, a dwelling is unfit if, in the opinion of the local authority, it fails to meet one of nine specified requirements and, by reason of that failure, is not reasonably suitable for occupation. The requirements constitute the minimum deemed necessary for a dwelling house to be fit for human habitation. They include that a dwelling house should be free from serious disrepair, that it should be structurally safe, and that it should be free from dampness prejudicial to the health of the occupants.
<P>

<a name="20226w28.html_para3">When parliamentary time allows, the Government intend to replace the housing fitness standard with a new risk-based assessment procedure&#151;the Housing Health and Safety Rating System. This will improve upon the existing standard by covering all the important health and safety risks in the home.
<P>

<a name="20226w28.html_para4">Local authorities have a range of powers to improve standards in houses in multiple occupation (HMOs)&#151;primarily through section 352 of the Housing Act 1985, as amended. This power enables a local authority to serve a notice requiring a landlord to carry out works to ensure the physical condition of the property is adequate for the number of occupants. The Government are also committed to introducing a mandatory licensing scheme for HMOs which will operate closely alongside the proposed Housing Health and Safety Rating System.




<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 2002 : Column 1174W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20226w28.html_para5">In addition, the Government have set a target to bring all social homes up to set standards of decency by 2010, and to reduce the number of social tenants living in non-decent homes by one-third by April 2004, with most of this reduction taking place in deprived areas.
<P>

<a name="20226w28.html_para6">A decent home must:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>be above the current statutory minimum standard for housing;
<P>
<BR>
be in a reasonable state of repair;
<P>
<BR>
have reasonably modern facilities and services; and
<P>
<BR>
provide a reasonable degree of thermal comfort.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20226w28.html_para7">The decent home standard is not set down in statute.
<P>

<a name="20226w28.html_para8">The Government have also developed with the Housing Corporation the Housing Quality Indicator (HQI) system, which is a measurement and assessment tool designed to allow housing schemes to be evaluated on the basis of quality rather than simply of cost. The HQI assesses the quality of a housing project using three main categories: location, design and performance. These three categories produce 10 "Quality Indicators", which include an assessment of unit size. An HQI assessment generates separate scores for each indicator, producing a profile of the scheme and an overall HQI score. From April 1 2001 the Housing Corporation Scheme Development Standards require HQIs to be used on all new developments utilising social housing grant. In addition, as part of the process of completing the HQI assessment, potential developers and architects should also be able to make design decisions which result in higher quality housing with minimal cost implications.
<P>

<a name="20226w28.html_para9">Overcrowding standards are set out in Part X of the Housing Act 1985. The room standard is breached if two people of opposite sexes, who are not living together as husband and wife, must sleep in the same room. The space standard specifies the number of people who may sleep in a dwelling according to the number of rooms.
<P>

<a name="20226w28.html_para10">Building work, which includes the erection or extension of a house, is subject to the Building Regulations which set out the requirements to ensure the health and safety of people in and around buildings, energy efficiency, and access and facilities for disabled people. They make no requirements for size, but in respect of quality, it is stipulated that the work shall be carried out with adequate and proper materials and in a workmanlike manner.

<a name="20226w29.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 For the period from 1997&#150;98 to 2002&#150;03, the actual increase on a like-for-like basis in Government grant to local authorities is &#163;11.3 billion. The actual increase on a like-for-like basis in personal social services provision (standard spending assessment increase plus earmarked grant increase) over the same period is &#163;2.7 billion. These levels of increase are enough that all authorities should be able to deliver improvements to public services while sticking to reasonable council tax increases.

 Last year, Exmoor National Park Authority (ENPA) put forward proposals in the context of the National Park local plan review to tackle a shortage of affordable houses for the park community and what it perceived as excessive numbers of second homes.
<P>

<a name="20226w29.html_para0">The Government believed such local policies would give rise to serious problems of definition and enforcement. We therefore objected to the proposed plan policy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w29.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Current Government planning policy for telecommunications is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 8 (revised): Telecommunications. The guidance advises that all telecommunications operators have a duty under the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and the Management of the Health and Safety at Work Regulations 1999 to ensure that so far as is reasonably practicable, their work activities&#151;which would include the installation and operation of their equipment&#151;do not expose people to risks to their health and safety.
<P>

<a name="20226w29.html_para2">Following publication of the Stewart report on mobile phones and health in May 2000, the Government accepted that, as a precautionary measure, the emissions from mobile phone base stations should meet the more restrictive International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) guidelines for public exposure (as expressed in the EU Council Recommendation of 12 July 1999 on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields (0 Hz to 300GHz)). Most base stations already meet the ICNIRP guidelines and all new base stations will do so.
<P>

<a name="20226w29.html_para3">The Stewart report recommended the establishment of clearly defined physical exclusion zones around base station antennas, which delineate areas within which exposure guidelines may be exceeded, to prevent the public from exposure radio frequency radiation above the ICNIRP guidelines. These exclusion zones relate to an area directly in front of and at the height of the antenna. The report did not recommend the introduction of a minimum distance between masts and existing development and we have no plans to introduce such a requirement.

 TETRA mast development is subject to the normal telecommunications planning arrangements in place throughout England. Our revised Planning Policy Guidance Note 8 'Telecommunications' (PPG8) states the Government's policy on telecommunications development.
<P>

<a name="20226w29.html_para4">In particular, we attach great importance to minimising the impact of telecommunications development on the environment. Our policy is to encourage mast and site sharing and to make good use of existing buildings and other structures for the siting of antennas. We also encourage the use of sympathetic design and camouflage. Particularly in designated areas, the aim should be for apparatus to blend into the landscape.
<P>

<a name="20226w29.html_para5">It is for operators and local authorities to consider together what might be the best location and design solution for an individual mast.

 Decisions on spending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are matters for the appropriate devolved Administration.

<a name="20226w29.html_para8">DTLR manages &#163;81.2 million of the &#163;100 million Road Haulage Modernisation fund in England, and &#163;2.9 million for increased enforcement effort in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="20226w29.html_para9">In England &#163;52 million has been allocated in the first two years of the fund to four areas; retrofitting vehicles through the Clean Up scheme, fuel efficiency advice, driver training initiatives and a self help pilot scheme.

<P>
<a name="20226w29.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Two bids were submitted to help key workers in Worthing and Adur in response to the first bidding round for Starter Home Initiative funding. The bids proposed to help five key workers in Worthing and five in Adur and Horsham. Both bids were unsuccessful.
<P>

<a name="20226w29.html_para10">The Round 2 bidding guidance issued on 16 January invites bids by 14 March 2002 to administer the Starter Home Initiative equity loan scheme to help key workers in a number of high demand areas. Adur and Worthing are not specifically targeted, but bids are sought to help 33 police in Sussex.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions for what reason no starter home initiative bids from organisations within Worthing and Adur were successful in the recent round.  [37132]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w29.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Since the value of Round 1 bids far outweighed the available Starter Home Initiative (SHI) funding it was necessary to concentrate resources on the most cost effective bids in those areas where the need for the scheme was greatest. The main factors taken into account in making allocations were: the relative need for SHI based on house prices, incomes and assessments of recruitment and retention difficulties for key worker groups in different areas; and the cost effectiveness of competing bids. Taking into account all these factors, the two bids submitted for Worthing and Adur were unsuccessful.

 Over the five years from 1996 to 2000 specialist chest and occupational physicians participating in the Surveillance of Work-related and Occupational Respiratory Disease (SWORD) and the Occupational Physicians Reporting Activity (OPRA) schemes for the surveillance of occupational respiratory diseases have seen an estimated 4,046 cases of mesothelioma and 434 of lung cancer which they attributed to asbestos exposure, virtually all occupational. Nearly all these cases will eventually have been fatal.
<P>

<a name="20226w29.html_para11">Not all such cases are seen by the SWORD/OPRA network, and the mesothelioma register records that a total of 7,123 people have died from this cause over the five years from 1995 to 1999 (data for 2000 not yet available). The epidemiological evidence suggests that almost all these will have been caused by asbestos

 The Health and Safety Executive has over the years taken advice and commissioned research from a wide range of scientists working in this area. It has also kept the relevant scientific literature under review. In this context it has taken account of the conclusions of the following more recent key reports; Asbestos, Effects on Health of Exposure to Asbestos (Doll and Peto) 1995; Fibrous Materials in the Environment (Institute for Environment and Health) 1997; the 1998 World Health Organisation report on white asbestos; and the 2000 Hodgson and Darnton paper on the quantitative risks of mesothelioma and lung cancer in relation to asbestos exposure. All are published and copies of the report are available in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<a name="20226w30.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 No. Planning Policy Guidance Note 25 issued in July 2001 already advises that flooding is a material planning consideration and that, where flood defences are needed because of a development, their provision and maintenance should be fully funded as part of the development. The report by the steering group for "The flood defence funding review" published on 13 February by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs concluded that it is difficult to justify replacing these arrangements before they have a chance to demonstrate their value.
<P>

<a name="20226w30.html_para0">Developers are advised to carry out an assessment of the risk of flooding to their proposed development and its impact on flooding elsewhere and to submit this with the application for planning permission. Advised as necessary by the Environment Agency, a local planning authority should consider that assessment alongside other material planning considerations in determining whether permission should be granted. It is for purchasers to make such inquiries as they consider necessary to determine whether a property they are considering purchasing is at risk of flooding.

 It is not this Government's policy to set housebuilding targets. The new annual rates of regional housing provision and their distribution are set through Regional Planning Guidance. These are kept under regular review by the regional planning bodies.

 Local authority debt is held and managed centrally within each authority. For the purposes of determining the Housing Revenue Account's (HRA) contribution to the cost of overall debt, a notional level of HRA indebtedness is calculated each financial year. This is known as the HRA credit ceiling. The table sets out the HRA credit ceiling at the start of each financial year, together with the associated capital financing costs, for financial years 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02:

 It is a matter for authorities to determine how to use the resources available to them in their housing revenue account. Authorities which are proposing to establish an arm's length organisation (ALMO) to manage their stock may apply for additional resources. If they are successful and meet the necessary standard, those resources are expected to be targeted on investment in the authority's stock. We have provided resources to enable additional investment of &#163;460 million by ALMOs over the next two years.

They admitted that a mistake had been made and offered renewed assurances about the use of British built equipment in Indonesia. The Defence Attach&#233; later confirmed that the Stormer vehicles had been removed from Aceh.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will take action to make doorstep recycling available throughout the United Kingdom.  [37271]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w33.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Recycling is a matter for the devolved Administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In England, approximately 43 per cent. of households receive this service and we expect the number to increase greatly. The Government have set statutory performance standards for all local authorities, which will triple the recycling and composting of household waste in the five years to 2005&#150;06. Each authority will decide how best to meet these targets, taking into account local circumstances, but the Government encourage them to introduce or extend kerbside collection of recyclable waste, where this is environmentally and economically the best option.
<P>

<a name="20226w33.html_para2">The Government also found significant new resources for English local authorities in the last spending review, both in the general settlement and a separate fund of &#163;140 million for the waste minimisation and recycling fund. The Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly Government have also found extra resources for recycling.
<P>

<a name="20226w33.html_para3">The New Opportunities Fund has also identified &#163;50 million for the UK to support community sector waste minimisation, re-use and recycling schemes, which may include kerbside schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what reasons underlie the differences in the percentage levels of designations to Nitrate Vulnerable Zones in England, Scotland and Wales; for what reason the criteria used for the designation of rivers has changed since 1996; what consultation there was with the agricultural sector on this change; what representations she has received on the financial impact on farmers who are to implement this directive; and if she will give financial assistance to enable them to do so.  [34492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w33.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The difference in the scale of Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) proposed in England, Scotland and Wales are due mainly to differences in rainfall, the pattern and intensity of agricultural activity, and the nature of the soil and geology.




<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 2002 : Column 1195W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20226w33.html_para8">Changes have been made to the criteria for identifying nitrate polluted rivers and other waters, so as to protect the water environment and not just drinking water supplies. These changes, and changes to the methodology used to identify areas for designation as NVZs, are based on legal advice about the requirements of the Nitrates Directive following a European Court of Justice decision in December 2000 that the UK had failed to implement the directive properly.
<P>

<a name="20226w33.html_para9">DEFRA is currently consulting on proposals to implement the Nitrates Directive, through the consultation document "How should England implement the 1991 Nitrates Directive" published on 20 December 2001. One of the options is to designate new NVZs, and the new methodology on which this option is based is set out in the consultation document.
<P>

<a name="20226w33.html_para10">Representations about the financial impact on farmers are being received in response to the consultation and are being collated and analysed at the moment. It is intended to extend the farm waste grant scheme to the new areas where farmers will be required to implement measures to tackle nitrate pollution under the directive. This will make financial assistance available to those farmers facing the most significant compliance costs, in particular for the construction of new slurry storage. The grant rate is currently 40 per cent. (the EU State Aid Rules maximum) for construction or upgrade of storage facilities up to an investment ceiling of &#163;85,000. We are currently considering offering 50 per cent. in less favoured areas, as permitted by the EU State Aid Rules. From experience in current NVZs, the average cost of new slurry storage construction to comply with Action Programme measures is between &#163;30,000 and &#163;40,000.

 A contract was awarded on 8 November 2001 to a consortium to capture and digitise all land parcels registered under the Integrated Administration and Control System. The work is in progress and is due to be completed by December 2003. A prototype of the database to hold the digitised field data has been prepared and will be further developed over the coming months.

<a name="20226w35.html_wqn6"><B> Sandra Gidley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 31 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 477W, on cameraria ohridella, if she will state <i>(a)</i> how close cameraria ohridella has spread towards the UK and on what date this was, <i>(b)</i> what the rate of spread towards the United Kingdom is and <i>(c)</i> what action the Government plan to take to prevent transmission across the channel; and whether she estimates that the disease is likely to have spread to the UK by the spring.  [35820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w35.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Since it was first detected in Macedonia in 1985, cameraria ohridella has spread rapidly across Europe and is now present in the Netherlands where it was found in 1999 and in France and Belgium where it was found in 2000.
<P>

<a name="20226w35.html_para2">Although the natural rate of spread of the moth is quite low, passive carriage on vehicles from infested areas is a highly effective and speedy means of dispersal, which explains the recent expansion of range across Europe. Because of this, it is not considered practicable to try to prevent its spread through the imposition of phytosanitary controls. Transmission to Britain is considered highly likely, although it is not possible at this stage to estimate when this might happen.
<P>

<a name="20226w35.html_para3">As I indicated previously, in my answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Leyton and Wanstead (Harry Cohen) on 25 October 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 362W, the Forestry Commission will shortly publish an exotic pest alert which will be sent to foresters, local authority tree experts and others. In addition to providing a colour-illustrated guide to the biology and symptoms of the moth, it will ask readers to report any sightings so that these can be investigated without delay.
<P>

<a name="20226w35.html_para4">May I also draw the hon. Member's attention to the Forest Research Annual Report for 2000&#150;01 (HC 247), copies of which are in the Library of the House. The report gives a detailed account of the information known to date about this pest, an assessment of the level of threat posed to this country and the control options that have been assessed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many staff in her Department, agencies and non-departmental public bodies receive paid leave to undertake union duties; how many days they are allocated; and what has been the cost to public funds in each of the last four years.

 The Forestry Commission has a programme of social research to assess the value of woodland in urban areas.

<P>
<a name="20226w37.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Of the &#163;1.962 billion figure, &#163;1.5 billion reflected the advancement of direct grants due to Railtrack in future control periods. The long-term savings resulting from this advancement of grant will be one of a number of factors to be taken into account in this year's review of the Ten Year Plan.

<a name="20226w38.html_spnew8"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 As I told the hon.

This equates to &#163;169.3 million in net present cost terms, discounted at 6 per cent. in real terms and assuming 2.5 per cent. inflation. On the same basis, the services element would amount to &#163;212.48 million over the operating period. This equates to &#163;50.864 million in net present cost terms, discounted at 6 per cent. in real terms and assuming 2.5 per cent inflation. However, as its name implies, there is a single unitary payment for the provision of serviced accommodation so there is no services payment by HMT to Exchequer Partnership.

 At the financial action task force plenary meeting in Hong Kong, China made good progress in taking forward the FATF's work on terrorist financing.
<P>

<a name="20226w38.html_para4">The FATF plenary was followed by a successful global terrorist financing forum, attended by almost 60 jurisdictions from FATF, FATF-style regional bodies and the OGBS, as well as nine international organisations. The

<P><I>26 Feb 2002 : Column 1213W</I><P>
forum stressed the importance of all jurisdictions adopting and implementing the eight special recommendations on terrorist financing issued by the FATF in October 2001. The forum called on all jurisdictions in the world to participate in a self-assessment exercise against the special recommendations on the same terms as FATF members.
<P>

<a name="20226w38.html_para5">The FATF confirmed that in June 2002, it will initiate a process to identify jurisdictions that lack appropriate measures to combat terrorist financing.

<P>

<a name="20226w38.html_para7">However, the ability of minority creditors to litigate successfully against sovereigns in default is a serious obstacle to debt restructuring, and can exacerbate creditor co-ordination problems. Thus some form of international bankruptcy procedure may be necessary to prevent disruptive litigation by minority credits.
<P>

<a name="20226w38.html_para8">More generally, there is a need to clarify the roles of debtors, creditors and the official sector within the crisis resolution framework, in order to provide the right incentives for creditors to co-ordinate effectively during debt restructuring negotiations.

There is some discontinuity between the estimates and projections because the estimates for 1997 to 2000 are based on actual births, deaths and migration. These differed from the assumptions used when producing the projections.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the timetable and process will be for deciding on the UK's contribution to the next replenishment of the European investment bank.  [37804]<P>

<P>
<a name="20226w40.html_spnew0"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Capital increases to the European investment bank have to be agreed by the bank's board of governors, acting unanimously. There are 15 such governors, representing the 15 member state shareholders of the bank. The UK governor is the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
<P>

<a name="20226w40.html_para0">The EIB is currently nearing its maximum permitted level of exposure (for 100 billion euros of subscribed capital, 6 per cent. of which is paid in, it may have up to 250 billion euros of outstanding liabilities, ie a gearing ratio of 1:2.5). Unless the bank dramatically curtails its lending activities, there will therefore need to be a capital increase agreed this year, to take effect from 1 January 2003. Proposals put forward by the bank's staff and management committee envisage a capital increase paid for from the bank's own funds. There will therefore be no requirement for any further paid in contribution from the UK or other shareholders. This principle (that capital increases should be met from reserves) will be entrenched for future capital increases too. Nevertheless, there are implications for the UK's contingent liability, the volume of which increases in proportion to the size of the bank's exposure.
<P>

<a name="20226w40.html_para1">The decision on the capital increase will be taken at the annual board of governors meeting, which takes place this year on 4 June. Proposals are currently being considered by the board of directors, which has three UK members.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what research within the Sector Skills Development Agency has been undertaken which reviews the occupational synergy between the gas, water, electricity and telecommunications industries;
<P>
<UL>(2) if she intends to establish a sector skills council which represents all the utilities;
<P>
(3) how she defines utilities with reference to the sector skills council.  [37024]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w41.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Sector skills councils (SSCs) will be licensed in sectors where employers want one and the SSC standard is met. The licensing standard is contained in a development guide published in November 2001. A key criterion is for SSCs to have an employment base of economic or strategic significance. The Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA) will begin work in April 2002 and therefore has not undertaken any reviews of industry sectors. My Department has not defined the "utilities sector" and is looking to employers to bring forward proposals for sectors that meet the licensing standard and make sense to their industries. A Business Adviser has been allocated to work closely with interested employers to develop their proposals. Any formal expression of interest by employers to form an SSC in the utilities sector will be considered by the SSDA.

and productivity initiative. A development guide was published in November 2001 that sets out the licensing standard for an SSC. Five Trailblazer SSCs have been selected and will be licensed very shortly. The Chair of the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA) has been appointed. Other key appointments will be made in the next few weeks. The SSDA will begin work in April 2002 and will consider further proposals from employers to form SSCs.
<P>

<a name="20226w41.html_para0">Sector coverage of the SSC network will depend on employers coming forward with proposals that meet the licensing standard. A fundamental principle is that SSCs will be licensed only in sectors where employers come forward to provide influential leadership to significantly improve skills and productivity performance. The SSDA will be responsible for ensuring that essential industry, business and occupational sector-related work is delivered in support of employers and individuals in sectors without an SSC.

 The collection of such data in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales is a matter for the respective devolved administrations. The Employer Skills Survey 2001, commissioned by the Department shows that, on average, 3.6 per cent. of employers in England reported skills shortage vacancies <sup>1</sup> , whilst the figures for employers in each region were as follows:

 The available details from recorded crime data are given in the table. For assault, the total of offences of assault on a constable, common assault and racially aggravated common assault has been used; the former two categories were introduced as recorded crimes on 1 April 1998, and the latter was counted separately from 1 April 1999. The total for all homicides is given, and for violent theft, the robbery total is given. Armed robbery includes offences where air weapons were used.

Violent crime recorded by the police may therefore not necessarily be a reflection of real changes in the level of violent crime.

<P>

<a name="20226w43.html_para2">There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which expanded the offences covered, and placed a greater emphasis on counting crimes in terms of numbers of victims. Numbers of recorded crimes after this date are therefore not directly comparable with previous years.

 We have not had any consultation specifically about the location of accommodation centres with groups representing the interests of asylum seekers. My officials have had general discussions about accommodation centres with a number of groups representing the interests of asylum seekers. In addition, the White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven: Integration With Diversity in Modern Britain" sets out our proposals for accommodation centres and we would welcome comments in response to that. Officials are discussing with relevant planning authorities the best way of consulting the public and other interested parties in the areas identified as having potential accommodation centre sites.

<a name="20226w45.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Bogus caller crime is nasty and pernicious because it is targeted at the most vulnerable in our community&#151;the elderly. In April 2000 the Home Department launched a campaign, the National Distraction Burglary Task Force, in partnership with utility companies, voluntary groups, local authorities and the police. So far, Good Practice Guides and Toolkits have been produced. Campaigns are now under way in all regions across England and Wales to alert older people and their families to the problem. The Task Force also raises awareness among workers who call at older people's homes. The advice being given to older people is to remember the doorstep etiquette "Stop, Chain, Check", and not let anyone whom they do not know into their homes without a prearranged appointment. I believe that the work of the Task Force is an excellent example of central and local government co-operating with the private and voluntary sectors to combat crime.

 The police have a power under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to remove a vehicle that has been left or parked illegally, obstructively or dangerously, or that has been abandoned or broken down. This may include vehicles that have been stolen. Where a vehicle is so removed, the police have a power to require the owner to meet the costs associated with that removal and subsequent storage. The police do not charge for the storage of vehicles that they retain as evidence or for forensic examination.
<P>

<a name="20226w45.html_para0">Removal and storage costs have to be met, but we are very sympathetic to the sense of injustice that a person may feel in having to meet these costs in order to recover his or her vehicle after it has been stolen.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to increase powers of courts to issue custodial sentences for <i>(a)</i> mobile phone theft, <i>(b)</i> car-jacking and <i>(c)</i> possession of drugs with intent to supply.  [34777]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w45.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2002]:</i> The courts already have very extensive sentencing powers to deal with this kind of offending. The circumstances of the offence will determine whether a person stealing a mobile phone is convicted of theft or robbery. The latter is the more serious offence because it necessarily involves force or the threat of force. The maximum penalty for theft is seven years imprisonment and the maximum penalty for robbery is life imprisonment. Car-jacking is charged as robbery. Moreover, section 109 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 provides for an automatic life sentence for a second serious sexual or violent offence. The offence of robbery is a qualifying offence under section 109.
<P>

<a name="20226w45.html_para1">Similarly, extensive sentencing powers are available in order to provide public protection in respect of supply of drugs. The maximum penalty for possessing class A drugs with the intent to supply is life imprisonment. The maximum penalty for possessing class B drugs with intent to supply is 14 years and the maximum penalty for possessing class C drugs with intent to supply is five years imprisonment. Section 110 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000 provides for a mandatory minimum sentence of seven years for a third class A drug trafficking offence.
<P>

<a name="20226w45.html_para2">The Government share public concern about the increasing prevalence of mobile phone robbery and car-jacking and about the continuing threats posed by 



<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 2002 : Column 1239W</I><P>
drug offending. We need to protect the public from the harm that this kind of offending can inflict upon our communities. It is important that the courts treat these offences with the seriousness they deserve.
<P>

<a name="20226w45.html_para3">We are committed to making sense of sentencing. We need a new sentencing framework which will do more to support crime reduction and reparation, while meeting the needs of punishment, through the introduction of more flexible sentencing options such as a new generic community sentence and a new suspended sentence. We need to be better able to exploit the developing opportunities to work with offenders to reduce re-offending and in the new approaches to restorative justice and reparation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidance he issues to police forces on penalising cyclists who <i>(a)</i> advance over the stop line and <i>(b)</i> ride without rear lights.  [36461]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w46.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Police officers take appropriate action against cyclists who break road traffic laws in this way and who are a hazard to themselves and to other road users when they do so. We see no need for central guidance to police forces on this issue. Chief officers of police are best placed to decide the level of priority given to such offences in the light of local circumstances and other demands on police time and resources.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners who were addicts of <i>(a)</i> heroin and <i>(b)</i> cocaine continued their habits after serving their sentences in each of the last five years; and what proportion died from drug misuse in the 12 month period after leaving prison.  [36562]<P>

<P>
<a name="20226w46.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 There are currently no figures available on how many inmates coming into prison addicted to heroin or cocaine resume their habit after serving their sentences. However, the Home Office is currently conducting research in this area and aims to publish a report on the findings in the summer.
<P>

<a name="20226w46.html_para0">Similarly, there are currently no figures available on drug-related deaths among ex-prisoners. The Home Office is currently conducting research in this area and aims to publish a report on the findings in May.

<a name="20226w46.html_para4">There is no existing legal obligation on the police to make such a disclosure unless directed to do so by a court. However, the Police Reform Bill currently before Parliament includes a presumption in favour of the disclosure of information. The Bill expressly allows this duty to be fulfilled through the provision of a copy of the investigation report subject to a statutory test that will ensure no information that has the potential for causing harm is released.
<P>

<a name="20226w46.html_para5">Since 1999 the Prison Service has operated a policy of disclosure of investigation reports into deaths in prison custody to the family of the deceased. The Immigration Service would also disclose their investigation reports into deaths in immigration detention centres to the family of the deceased.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w46.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Those prisoners judged at risk of suicide or self-harm, whether in health care centres or other parts of prisons, are the subject of the "caring for prisoners at risk procedures" (the F2052SH system). Suicide prevention teams in each establishment examine this work and the quality of the procedures. The system is being reviewed as part of the Prison Service's three year suicide prevention strategy with the aim of improving the identification of those at risk and the subsequent care provided.

 Terrestrial Trunked Radio System (TETRA) base stations for the police service are installed by the telecommunications operator for Airwave, mm02 which must comply with planning regulations and health and safety guidelines.
<P>

<a name="20226w46.html_para6">The Radiocommunications Agency (RA) of the Department for Trade and Industry (DTI) is currently conducting a programme of checks on airwave base stations to ensure that the guidelines on limits of exposure are being met. The RA currently expect to publish the results obtained from the first six base stations tested on their website in mid June 2002. The extent of further work will be determined once the data obtained from these tests have been fully analysed.

The targets in the Public Service Agreement 2000&#150;01 to 2003&#150;04 commits all Home Office Directorates, including IND, to replying to 95 per cent. of public correspondence within 20 working days. Figures are not currently available for IND's present performance against the standards relating to public correspondence, but we aim to send a substantive reply to all letters as soon as possible.

 In order to meet possible need for extra capacity, the Prison Service has an overall strategy of applying for planning consent at prison sites where building more accommodation is a viable option.
<P>

<a name="20226w46.html_para8">Wymott and Garth prisons are two such sites. Planning consent has been in place to build an extra houseblock at each site since 1996. Applications have recently been made to extend this consent before it expires in order to keep all options open.

 The data show young offenders who were serving custodial sentences on 31 January 2002 and were first committed in a Greater London court. Addresses of inmates prior to custody are not held centrally. Attempting to break these figures down by constituency or Metropolitan police divisional borough would not be accurate, as young offenders are not always committed at a court within the constituency where they live.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on recruitment and retention of prison officers and other staff at Long Lartin prison.  [36767]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w47.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As at January 2002 Long Lartin prison had a total number of 514.5 unified staff against a target of 517 and 140.5 non-unified staff against a target of 141.5. The small number of vacancies will be filled shortly.
<P>

<a name="20226w47.html_para0">Long Lartin is located in a low unemployment area and while housing costs are rising this has not caused any significant problems with recruitment. Equally there is no difficulty recruiting other members of staff, with the possible exception of civilian works staff.

 On 1 November 2001, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary published PA Consulting's study "Diary of a Police Officer" which had considered what more could be done to free police officers from unnecessary paperwork and other obstacles which prevent them from spending more time in public. The study found that officers were spending 43.1 per cent. of their time in the police station.

<a name="20226w47.html_para1">In the White Paper "Policing a New Century" (CM 5326), published on 5 December 2001, my right hon.

 As part of the 2000 spending review settlement, the Government announced an extra &#163;300 million for volunteering initiatives over three years, 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04. &#163;60 million was available to other Government Departments for match funding in supporting the use of volunteers in public sector services. The funding is worth a total of &#163;120 million over three years when matched. 24 proposals were approved and are currently on course to involve an additional 290,000 volunteers in public service delivery by the end of March 2004.
<P>

<P>
<a name="20226w48.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 There are many different types of youth forum established by local authorities, statutory agencies and voluntary organisations in order to ensure that young people are involved and consulted over policies and services relevant to them. The Government maintain no records of the numbers and costs of youth fora.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has for the use of the private sector in the Prison Service.  [38401]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20226w48.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 I am placing in the Library today a report of a review which the former Home Secretary, my right hon. Friend the Member for Blackburn (Mr. Straw), asked Patrick Carter, a non-executive member of the Strategy Board for Correctional Services, to carry out on the future role of the private sector in the prison system.
<P>

<a name="20226w48.html_para0">We believe that a mixed economy of provision is essential in achieving a modern, dynamic Prison Service.
<P>

<a name="20226w48.html_para1">I am most grateful to Patrick Carter for his report, which shows how much the private sector has achieved to date providing high quality prison services at lower cost. The report also shows how well the public sector prison service has responded to the challenge of private sector competition.
<P>

<a name="20226w48.html_para2">Both the public and the private sectors are important to the future of the Prison Service. Both can show big successes that benefit prisoners and the public. I want to create conditions in which both can flourish, but in which both have to continually prove themselves. I believe the overall thrust of the recommendations of the report will achieve this. Some can be implemented straight away, but 



<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 2002 : Column 1256W</I><P>
others need further work or will have to be subject to discussions in the current spending review and our wider vision for modernising the Prison Service.
<P>

<a name="20226w48.html_para3">The proposal that under-performing prisons should be required to show how they will meet tough benchmarked standards, or face contracting out or closure, offers the potential for big improvements in performance and value for money. I announced on 19 December 2001 the first scheme of this kind, at Her Majesty's Prison Leicester and Her Majesty's Young Offender Institution and Remand Centre Reading.
<P>

<a name="20226w48.html_para4">The report also provides a welcome contribution to finding ways of bringing the aging prison estate into the 21st century. I will consider this as part of our current assessment of the options for providing a range of carefully targeted new approaches to dealing with offenders, and the spending review.
<P>

On 1 February 2002 four claimants had been sanctioned: three were from the Teesside pilot area and one from West Midlands. A slow start was expected because the measures do not apply retrospectively to breaches occurring before that date.
