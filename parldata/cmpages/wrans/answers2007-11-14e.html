 The Government never accepted that the legal provisions concerning amusements with prizes and low stake and prize gaming (in section 16 of the Lotteries and Amusements Act 1976 and section 21 of the Gaming Act 1968 respectively), were intended by Parliament to authorise gaming by machine.</p>

Under the Gambling Act, all machines purportedly offered under either section 16 or section 21 are classified as gaming machines. They are subject to the same limits on stakes and prizes, numbers, and locations as other gaming machines, there are no special categories created for such equipment, and they do not attract grandfather rights. This position has existed since the Gambling Act came into force on 1 September 2007.</p>

The National Assessment Agency (NAA) is responsible for the external marking of National Curriculum test scripts and has arrangements in place for schools to seek a review of the marking of test scripts if they find evidence that the mark scheme has not been properly applied.

OFSTED have recently amended the self evaluation form to include a section about languages enabling schools to report their progress towards the 50 to 90 per cent. benchmark. We also wrote to School Improvement Partners in July and provided them with a toolkit to help them in their role of support and challenge over languages take-up in schools where appropriate.

 We do not collect information on the average cost of a day place at an independent school, neither is it feasible to produce an estimate from the data we collect. At January 2007 the Annual Schools' Census showed fees charged by schools catering mainly for children without special educational needs fell between nil and &#163;33,974 per annum. Fees in independent schools catering for children with complex needs can be considerably higher.</p>

 The main cost of the school improvement partner programme is the cost to local authorities of deploying school improvement partners to the schools they maintain. This deployment is bound up with local authorities' wider school improvement responsibilities. Since using school improvement partners is generally more expensive than operating local authorities' previous arrangements, the Department provides a subsidy for the school improvement partner function within its funding to local authorities. For 2007-08, the cost of the subsidy is &#163;15,803,938. The school improvement partner function also has a national component, mainly focused on national accreditation of school improvement partners and on quality assurance of local management of the function. For 2007-08, the cost of this national component is &#163;7,651,200. The 2008-09 figure will certainly be lower, because in that year we will no longer have to build up the cadre of accredited school improvement partners; roll-out is due to be completed by April 2008.</p>

 The Department has not estimated the number of 17-year-olds likely to be absent from education or training in 2015, once we raise the participation age to 18. The Green Paper &#147;Raising Expectations: staying in education and training post-16&#148; was published in March, setting out our proposals for all young people to continue in learning until they are 18, and a further &#147;From policy to legislation&#148; document was published on 5 November. Copies have been placed in the Library of the House. Under these proposals, if a young person is persistently absent from learning or drops out altogether, the learning provider will be required to inform the local authority, so that guidance services can contact the young person and support to re-engage can be provided as soon as possible.</p>

The SFT already has activity underway to promote school lunches and generate demand, such as their &#145;Million Meals&#146; campaign; cooking clubs for parents and children; Disney posters in schools, and a teenage marketing campaign.</p>

 In its report &#147;Turning the Tables: Transforming School Food&#148; (published in September 2005), the School Meals Review Panel (SMRP) estimated that the revenue cost (including ingredients, labour, training, marketing and waste) of introducing the new nutritional standards for school food would be &#163;167.2 million in the first year and &#163;158.8 million a year in subsequent years. The costs are higher in year one to reflect additional expenditure on staff training. The SMRP figures assume no increase in take-up of school meals and no efficiency savings.</p>

The core of each diploma is the &#147;Principal Learning&#148; element. All students will also undertake a programme of generic learning which includes personal, learning and thinking skills and functional skills (in English, maths and information technology). diploma students will be able to personalise their learning by adding &#147;Additional and Specialist Learning&#148;, which can develop depth and breadth of study. The personalisation of each student&#146;s learning programme is a key feature of the diploma structure.</p>

If they employ a young person for more than that, without training, the young person will need to provide evidence that they are in learning before they can start employment, and the employer will need to check this. The employer will also need to release the young person from work for the equivalent of a day each week so that they can train elsewhere, and will not be required to pay them for this time.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 November 2007]:</i> Under the policy of successive governments that healthcare professions like medicine and dentistry should be self-regulating, the General Dental Council (GDC) is independent of Government. I understand that the GDC considers that tooth whitening constitutes the practice of dentistry and that only registered dentists are suitably trained and competent to carry it out. Dental professionals are required to practice within their respective professional boundaries and to only undertake work which they are trained and competent to do. Any registrant who undertakes work for which they are not sufficiently competent risks fitness to practice proceedings. However, I also understand that the General Dental Council is currently reviewing the scope of practice of dentists and dental care professionals and expects to consult on its proposals in 2008.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 November 2007]:</i> The Implementation Review Group (IRG) is an external key stakeholder group set up by Ministers to monitor and provide feedback to the Department on the implementation of the reforms.

 Some prisons undertake reception testing as part of their mandatory drug testing programme. Prisoners newly received into prison are subject to clinical health assessment, and voluntary indicative drug testing is part of that process. There is no system to test all prisoners before final release. Prisoners may be subjected to mandatory drug testing prior to release on temporary licence as part of a risk assessment. During custody prisoners can be subject to clinical testing, voluntary testing as part of a compact to remain drug free, and random or targeted mandatory drug testing.</p>

 Following agreements signed with the French Government in 2000 and the Belgian Government in 2004, UK immigration controls on Eurostar passengers from Paris, Lille, Calais Frethun and Brussels are now undertaken at those stations prior to the train departing for the UK. As a result of the introduction of these juxtaposed controls immigration officers are now able to stop individuals with false, stolen or inadequate documents or those who do not have permission to enter the UK before they can board trains to any of the Eurostar stations in Britain; this includes the new stations of St. Pancras and Ebbsfleet. The opening of these new stations does not reduce the effectiveness of juxtaposed controls. We are also able to deploy immigration officers to any UK Eurostar station to mount inbound controls, either to test the risk on certain services or, if necessary, as an emergency response.</p>

 Uzbekistan remains the only country in Central Asia to have invited and hosted the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. Following his visit in 2002, the then UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Theo van Boven, made 22 key recommendations in his report. The Uzbek authorities say they have fulfilled these. The current UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Nowak, has been unable to visit Uzbekistan to study implementation. He told the UN Human Rights Council in 2006 that</p>
<a name="71114w0018.htm_brev0"><a name="07111454000157"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;the very fact that torture is still practised systematically (in Uzbekistan) is the best proof that the recommendations have not been implemented&#148;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_221"><a name="71114w0018.htm_para4"><a name="07111454000131">The criminal justice system still convicts on the basis of confessions, with scant corroborating evidence, and thus encourages coercion. Anecdotal evidence suggests that judges continue to overlook allegations of torture made during trials. This suggests a lack of substantial progress to reduce the practice of torture. We continue to receive regular allegations of torture from victims, their relatives and human rights defenders. We have concluded, therefore, that torture and other forms of ill treatment are routine, particularly in the early stages of custody. We welcome the reforms to the criminal justice system that the Uzbek Government will introduce from 1 January 2008 to abolish the death penalty and implement a form of <i> habeas corpus</i>. The latter step is particularly key to combating torture.</p>
