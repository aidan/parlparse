To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what evaluation his Department has made of the impact of <i>(a)</i> tram and light rail schemes and <i>(b)</i> bus routes on social exclusion. [62794]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20621w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar:  </B> 
The Social Exclusion Unit's interim report, <i>Making the Connections: transport and social exclusion</i>, looks at the ways in which transport problems can reinforce social exclusion. It concluded that bus services have a particularly important role to play in tackling these. When we consider proposals for major schemes in Local Transport Plans, we take into account their likely impacts on access to the transport system and on different social groups. These can only be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many civil servants within his Department work on tram and light rail systems' policy. [62866] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20621w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Policy on major public transport schemes, including light rail, in Local Transport Plans is handled by a team of three staff. Other colleagues, including specialist economists and lawyers, assist as required.

<P>
<a name="20621w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many proposals there have been for tram and light rail systems which his Department has rejected; and if he will list them. [62860]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20621w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 New arrangements were introduced with the inception of Local Transport Plans in 1999. Proposals for new tram and light rail schemes normally need Transport and Works Act powers. If funding from my Department is essential for the project to proceed, promoters should seek a provisional view from my Department on whether the scheme passes the Government's appraisal tests which are used to decide whether a project is eligible for funding before seeking powers. Since the start of these arrangements, two light rail lines (Midland Metro extensions to Birmingham city centre and to Brierley Hill) have received a positive provisional view, a number of others are under consideration, and none have yet been given a negative provisional view.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20621w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar:  </B> 
None. However, the appraisal of tram and light rail systems takes account of five over-arching objectives: environment, safety, economy, accessibility and integration (including the extent of integration with land use and other government policies).

<P>
<P>
<a name="20621w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Spellar:  </B> 
Departmental policy on tram and light rail systems is set out in the 10 Year Plan, published in July 2000. In preparing the Plan we took account of the large number of comments we received from consultees and a wide range of other stakeholders on the Integrated Transport White Paper, published in July 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list recent Government commissioned studies which have made recommendations for road user charging schemes; and if he will make a statement. [62880]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20621w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar:  </B> 
Consultants for four Multi-Modal Studies have recommended in their Final Reports that consideration be given to the future introduction of road user charging schemes. These are the West Midlands Area MMS, West Midlands to North West MMS, North/South Movements in the East Midlands MMS and London to South West and South Wales MMS. The Final Reports are now with the respective Regional Planning Bodies who will make recommendations to Ministers. In addition the consultants carrying out the ORBIT (M25 Corridor) MMS have made provisional recommendations which include road user charging proposals.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para0">Given the practical considerations, we do not believe that a system of inter-urban road user charging for cars could be introduced this decade; accordingly the 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jun 2002 : Column 577W</I><P>
Government has no plans to do so. However, this is a subject where further work and research is needed and we will revisit it when sufficient progress has been made in clarifying the technical and practical issues involved. In the meantime, we note the arguments put forward both for and against inter-urban charging and are listening to the debate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list the bodies responsible for the maintenance and control of traffic lights in each area of the United Kingdom, including a brief description of their <i>(a)</i> function and <i>(b)</i> statutory duties. [62873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20621w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar:  </B> 
The Statutory responsibility for traffic lights in England rests with the relevant traffic authority. This will be a County Council, Metropolitan District Council, or a Unitary Authority. In London, Transport for London is the traffic authority for strategic routes, London Boroughs for all other roads. However, Transport for London control all traffic lights within the London area, regardless of whether they are the traffic authority for the roads at the junction. The Highways Agency is responsible for trunk roads.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para1">Similar arrangements apply in Scotland and Wales. The Scottish Executive and Welsh Assembly Government are responsible for trunk roads in Scotland and Wales. Local Authorities in Scotland and Unitary Authorities in Wales are responsible for other roads.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para2">In Northern Ireland, the Department for Regional Development is responsible for all roads.

The Transport Council was held on 17 June in Luxembourg. I represented the UK.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para4">I was pleased to see the adoption by the Council of two directives on passenger vessel safety. The first of these requires compliance by 2015 by all Member States with the higher standards of damage stability for ro-ro passenger ships engaged on international voyages already introduced following the <i>Estonia</i> disaster by eight EU countries, including the UK (the XStockholm Agreement"). These requirements are complementary to the International Maritime Organisation's (IMO) standard, aimed at increasing the survivability of damaged ro-ro vessels. The very large majority of UK ro-ro ferries have already been altered to comply with the Stockholm standard and those few remaining will be altered as necessary before the deadline of September 2002.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para5">The second directive on safety of passenger ships makes a number of technical amendments to the existing Directive 98/18. I would particularly draw attention to provisions bringing into Community law the IMO rules and standards on High Speed Craft and placing a duty on Member States to encourage owners to improve accessibility to their ships for people with limited mobility.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para6">The Council reached agreement on a Directive to open the market for the provision of services, including cargo handling and pilotage, in large and medium-sized ports. For service contracts, there will be maximum durations of 10, 15 and 36 years (plus a possible further 10 years), respectively, for services with no significant investment, services with significant investment in movable assets, and services with significant investment in immovable assets. In addition, I argued successfully for a 40 year period for new ports in the future. The agreed text includes a number of other significant changes, which meet many of the concerns we have had on the Commission's original proposals including protecting working conditions for port workers. The Commission said it would come forward with guidelines as soon as possible to address the important issue of competition between ports.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para7">The Council did not reach agreement on a Regulation establishing a programme (the Marco Polo programme) to succeed the PACT programme for the promotion of combined transport. The Marco Polo programme would offer Community financial support for modal shift projects, with a budget of Euro 85 million and various thresholds for different types of eligible project. I joined other Member States in arguing that there should be a reduced budget.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para8">The Commission reported on the need for further action in Europe in the field of maritime security. This would be principally within the framework of the IMO.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para9">The Council was unable to agree Conclusions on the Commission's transport White Paper of September 2001, which proposes a range of measures to address significant issues such as congestion, safety and the environmental impact of transport. During the debate I was one of a number of Ministers to reject any reference in the Conclusions to tax harmonisation. I also referred to the need to update the existing Eurovignette Directive,

<a name="20621w02.html_para13">There were Presidency Conclusions noting the large degree of support among Member States for the Single European Sky and the agreement of Member States to make progress by 2004 in line with the Conclusions of the Barcelona European Council. The Conclusions also noted the importance of Eurocontrol in the process.

<a name="20621w02.html_para14">The Council unanimously adopted a common position on a Directive on occurrence reporting in civil aviation, establishing a common framework for dealing with safety-related incidents. There was agreement on a draft Regulation requiring Member States to provide aviation statistical returns.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para15">The Commission presented a proposal on subsidy and unfair pricing by third country airlines, noting that some third countries had offered substantial financial support to their airlines, which had an impact on Community carriers.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para16">The Presidency reported on discussions over lunch about aviation war-risk insurance. The Council believed that State intervention should be limited, to avoid market restriction, but that possible mutualisation schemes should be examined.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para17">The Council reached agreement on a Directive tightening existing Community legislation on seat belt wearing. A compromise was reached on an exemption for school buses, which will last for five years. We have some concern at the lack of respect for subsidiarity in this proposal and this was made clear to the Council. In our view, it is appropriate to have a broad framework at EU level, leaving details of implementation to Member States.
<P>

<a name="20621w02.html_para18">The Council did not reach agreement on a regulation on ecopoints for the transit of HGVs through Austria. This would have allowed extension of the ecopoint system beyond the current expiry date of 31 December 2003, but not beyond 2006, pending the forthcoming adoption of legislation on EU-wide infrastructure charging. The Commission concluded that in 2004 the Ecopoint system would finish. The Presidency hoped that imminent high level discussions among key Member States would lead to a solution of the problem of Alpine transit.

Freight operators can seek to enforce EU law on the free movement of goods in the French courts, and this could include a claim for losses caused by the breach of that law.

At the Tokyo Conference in January, international donors pledged funds for the overall reconstruction of Afghanistan, including humanitarian programmes. Pledges were not broken down by sector.

Since September 2001, my Department has also contributed #8 million to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), #2 million of which was specifically for the Back-to-School Campaign in Afghanistan.

The figures in the table cover the number of individuals in households in receipt of either income-related benefits or the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), or new tax credits from April 2003, where at least one person works 16 hours or more. The effects of income tax and National Insurance Contributions, and the withdrawal of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit have also been included.<P>

The effect of tax and benefit changes introduced since Budget 1998, including WFTC, reduced the number of individuals in households facing MDRs in excess of 70 per cent. by around three-quarters of a million. As WFTC is more generous than the Family Credit that it replaced, more individuals in households benefit from it, hence the larger numbers facing MDRs over 40 and 50 per cent. in 2002&#150;03.<P>

Building on the success of WFTC, the Government will be introducing the Child and Working Tax Credits from April 2003. As the new tax credits will be more generous and inclusive than the current system of support, significantly more households will be eligible, and those currently eligible will receive more, hence a greater number will face MDRs over 40 and 50 per cent. from 2003&#150;04.<P>

From 1 January 2007, vehicle manufacturers and importers will similarly become responsible for such costs for vehicles sold before 1 July 2002, in accordance with the terms of the Directive. This will ensure that a broadly level playing field is maintained with other main car-producing EU countries, such as France and Germany.

<a name="20621w06.html_para4">The Directive require treatment facilities to meet new environmental standards when depolluting and dismantling ELVs. We intend to introduce these standards during 2003. The cost of depolluting and dismantling an ELV will offset, and may exceed, its scrap value, but this will depend upon a number of factors, including the age, marque, model and condition of the ELV, the prevailing value of scrap ferrous and non-ferrous metals and other materials at the time, and the efficiency of the treatment facility. Until 2007, and the introduction of producer responsibility for vehicles sold before 1 July 2002, Xlast owners" will continue to be responsible for the disposal of their vehicles, and will be free to negotiate their end-values with treatment facilities. Some ELVs will retain a positive value, and we would expect that new depollution and dismantling costs to be reflected in the market value of second-hand vehicles.

The important role of enterprise policy was noted, in particular: improving the regulatory environment, promoting entrepreneurship and enhancing competitiveness.

All Member States saw a role for the Industry Council in looking at environmental dossiers with a big impact on competitiveness. The UK pointed to environmental liability and fluorinated gases as two important current examples. Effective co-ordination between industry and environment Departments in Member States was also important.

The Commission remained of the view that this was needed to bolster the proposed WTO action against Korea, which all Member States support. The revised Commission proposal had reduced subsidy rates but over a longer time frame, and allowed for inclusion of Liquid Natural Gas carriers if market data for 2002 justified this. The UK and a number of other Member States maintained their opposition to a subsidy scheme and there was no qualified majority in support. The matter was referred back to the Committee of Permanent Representatives.

<a name="20621w06.html_para19"><i>Energy</i>
<P>

<a name="20621w06.html_para20">The Council considered several matters of interest to the United Kingdom. Energy liberalisation, a new coal state aid regulation and a Biofuels directive formed the main issues of discussion.
<P>

<a name="20621w06.html_para21">The key point to emerge from discussion of coal state aid was the agreement reached on a new coal state aid regulation to replace the rules in force under the ECSC Treaty, which expires at the end of July. The regulation agreement would allow for operating, closure, investment and Xexceptional cost" aid to phase out gradually by 2010, and provides for simple degressivity of the total volume of operating, closure and investment aid combined in each Member State, with an end date of 2007 for closure aid and 2010 for operating and investment aid. An investment aid provision sought by the UK has been included in the agreed text. Some Member States, regretting that the level of aid would not reduce significantly and continuously, asked the Commission to ensure that the Treaty's state aid articles were respected by Member States. The Commission will enter a declaration undertaking to ensure maximum vigilance in respect of those articles.
<P>

<a name="20621w06.html_para22">No Presidency or Council conclusions were agreed on energy liberalisation. Member States maintained their positions on the key areas of public service obligations, unbundling, market opening and the rules governing market regulation. There was general agreement on the importance of the principle of public service obligations, particularly in respect of electricity, but disagreement on the details. Some Member States favoured a wide coverage applying to all final customers. Others, including the UK, preferred a narrower definition limited to households. Most Member States supported the inclusion of some form of labelling showing the sources from which electricity had been generated. A majority favoured legal unbundling of transmission and distribution from supply and production, though most also supported a rather high <i>de minimis</i> level. There was widespread support for the separation of the accounts of eligible from non-eligible customers. Most Member States expressed support for the list of duties of national regulators set out in Article 22 of the Presidency text. A progress report on cross-border exchanges in electricity was noted without discussion.

<a name="20621w06.html_para23">On biofuels, the majority of Member States reiterated their opposition to mandatory targets. It was, however, agreed that the reference to possible proposals for mandatory targets in the review clause could stand, on the basis that a number of Member States supported the UK's declaration that they would not be bound to accept any such proposals. A few Member States expressed regret that the Council was rejecting the Commission's proposals for mandatory targets for use of fuels of agricultural origin for transport purposes, and that targets would now be indicative.

<P>

<a name="20621w06.html_para27">The Commission emphasised the importance of security of energy supply and said that a paper for the Seville Council was almost finalised. The Commission argued that Member State responses to the Green Paper had shown the need for demand side measures and for a new approach to oil and gas stocks. The Commission paper would also address the need to double the proportion of electricity generated from renewable sources. The Commission argued that nuclear power was also important, providing the only possible option for meeting Kyoto targets; that a rational approach was needed which would include a fresh look at safety and waste management, particularly in the context of enlargement; and that it was a matter of great concern that the <i>acquis</i> did not currently cover nuclear safety standards. Several Member States expressed clear anti-nuclear views; others either remained non-committal or expressed support. The UK agreed on the need to start working on the follow up to the Commission's Green Paper, but expressed scepticism about the Commission's ideas on oil and gas stocks.

The term Xrepeat repairs" is not a recognised description. It could be used for example to cover repairs carried out over a long period pending the major refurbishment of a property, or an interim repair followed shortly by major maintenance work. Both would in a sense repeat work already carried out. In neither case is the information held centrally, nor is it held in a consistent form. A large number of branches would have to be consulted to prepare a reply. This research and the identification of the information would involve disproportionate cost. Nevertheless, if the hon.

<P>
<P><I>21 Jun 2002 : Column 598W</I><P>
the Environment Act 1995, and other relevant statutory provisions and any additional requirements arising from international treaties and protocols to which the UK is a signatory. In particular, this policy includes a commitment to comply with the Government's strategy for sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="20621w07.html_para0">Guidance has been issued to all MOD acquisition officials which details the implementation of this policy and states that all timber or timber products should be procured form sustainable sources. In addition, tropical hardwood should be independently verified as sourced from forests and plantations which are managed to sustain their biodiversity, productivity and vitality, and to prevent harm to other ecosystems and any indigenous or forest dependent people. Where practicable, the use of reclaimed timber or timber products should be considered. All procurements must comply with international agreements such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) where applicable.
<P>

<a name="20621w07.html_para1">Given the size of my Department's property holdings a large number of small scale refurbishment projects are underway at any given time, many as part of larger Works Services Management contracts. It is not possible to identify all of these individually without disproportionate effort.

It is routinely made clear in such letters that the advice given does not constitute an export licence, nor does it prejudge a decision on the eventual consideration of an export licence application.
<P>

<a name="20621w08.html_para0">It is not possible to correlate F680 advice with export licensing decisions, as the processes are quite separate. For example, F680s may be seeking advice in general terms about marketing prospects which may relate partially to the export that is eventually licensed.

<i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]: </i>There is currently a fully developed industry standard, produced by the Composting Association (CA), that is available to compost producers. The high quality of this standard is more likely to be met by source-separated organic waste (commercial or household), rather than by mixed household waste.
<P>

<a name="20621w08.html_para1">The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) are working with the CA and the British Standards Institute (BSI) to convert the existing industry standard into the fast track version (Publicly Available Specification) of a full national British Standard. They anticipate this will be available in the Autumn of this year. The CA, WRAP and BSI are considering options regarding certification schemes that could be linked with the PAS to encourage users of compost to demand a product that meets this standard; 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jun 2002 : Column 603W</I><P>
this in turn will encourage producers to make the investment necessary to achieve the standard in their production process.

<a name="20621w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher:  </B> 
Attendance at the Conference was by invitation only. The Conference held three separate workshops in the afternoon, which sought to generate ideas and solutions, which could assist Government in considering different ways in which to tackle the different problems noise cause. It was felt that it would be inappropriate for the press to be present during these sessions as this might have prevented fully frank and open discussions. However, the press attended the Conference at 4.00pm both to listen to my statement to the Conference and the summaries that arose from the workshops.

The Government are fully involved in the negotiations in Europe on the review of the EC Directive on packaging and packaging waste. It has always been the UK Government's policy in these negotiations to urge a swift conclusion to the debate on the targets for the next 5-year period.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what measures the Government intends to take to ensure that the requirements of the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 are uniformly enforced across the UK. [62364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20621w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher:  </B> 
I will be looking, with my colleagues in the devolved Administrations, at the Regulations to see whether there are any amendments needed to ensure the most effective functioning of the UK's packaging waste recovery system. Any changes the Government propose to make will be included in a consultation paper to be issued this summer.

finalised at Johannesburg. Progress was made on a Programme of Action, which includes the importance of sanitation in eradicating poverty and meeting the Millennium Development Goal of safe drinking water. Broad agreement was also reached on key issues such as the urgent need to restore fish stocks and address illegal fishing, and on the important role non-governmental actors can play in achieving sustainable development. The meeting also recognised the need for a strong focus on Africa. In addition, preliminary discussions took place on elements for a Political Declaration at Johannesburg. The Programme of Action as it currently stands can be found at www.johannesburgsummit.org

</i>1. Funding figures are based on LEAs Section 52 Budget Statements (1999&#150;2000, 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02) as returned to the DfES).<P>

2. The figures cover the special schools element of the Individual Schools Budget (ISB), and Devolved Standards Fund for special schools (these are estimated for 1999&#150;2000 as devolved Standards Funds were not separately identified on the 1999&#150;2000 returns), related central expenditure on educational psychologists, statementing, SEN support services and home to school transport.<P>

3. The figures are gross of income.<P>

4. Pupil numbers are financial year averages, based on Jan Annual School Census data.<P>

In her opening speech at the British Education and Training Technology (BETT) Show in January, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out the Government's vision of how schools would be in the future, including aspects of their design. She also announced that the Department would be publishing a design guide, XSchools for the Future", which looks at ways of designing inspiring buildings that can adapt to educational and technological change. This was published in February 2002, following the publication the previous year of XInclusive School Design&#151;accommodating pupils with special educational needs and disabilities in mainstream schools."
<P>

<a name="20621w11.html_para0">Baroness Ashton is the Department's Ministerial Design Champion. She gave a speech on achieving design quality in PFI schools at a conference organised by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) last October.
<P>

<a name="20621w11.html_para1">CABE helped the Department run the Neighbourhood Nurseries Design Competition. I launched this in May 2001 and its aim was to ensure that all new buildings created are of high design quality, providing imaginative and stimulating places in which young children can learn and play. The competition was successfully completed in June 2002 and the work of the winners is being used to influence design across the early years and childcare sector.

The 2001 Research Assessment Exercise showed a strong increase in top quality research, with more 5* departments than ever before. The Higher Education Funding Council for England decided to protect funding levels for top rated departments, and my Department added #30 million to HEFCE funding for next year. The RAE is designed to determine relative quality. It is not designed to determine the quantum of money spent on research. That is a matter for the Spending Reviews.

Police forces in the West Midlands have received extra funding to make communities safer. West Midlands Police received a cash boost to step up operations against street offenders and all forces in the West Midlands, including West Mercia Police, received funding allocations based on careful assessments of their current requirements and commitments to provide an enhanced counter-terrorist capability. The overall level of funding allocated following the Budget, to police forces in the West Midland region for counter terrorism purposes, #910,000, has been made public. To break this down further in public could compromise security.

 Destitute asylum seekers can apply for support whilst their claim is being considered. The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) deals with applications for support. Asylum seekers requiring support can request subsistence and accommodation, subsistence only or accommodation only. Current levels of support are provided in the table. Where accommodation is requested this will normally be provided on a no choice basis in one of the dispersal areas. Accommodation is fully furnished and includes

<P>
<P>
<a name="20621w14.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes:  </B> 
Generally speaking asylum seekers are not allowed to work whilst their application for asylum is being considered. But under the terms of the employment concession an asylum seeker can apply for permission to work if, and only if, their application remains outstanding for longer than six months without a decision being made on it. There are no plans to amend the way the concession operates. The concession is applied across the board, to supported and unsupported asylum seekers alike.

The management of the Government Offices' own buildings comes under the Estate Strategy for the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. A good example of Government Offices responding to the Better Public Buildings initiative is the project for a new home for the Government Office for Yorkshire and the Humber. The scheme aims to be an exemplar of design excellence and sustainability.
<P>

<a name="20621w15.html_para7">The Government Offices also play an active role in encouraging better public buildings by working in partnership with other regional agents. For example, the Government Office for London procured City Hall, the new Headquarters for the Greater London Authority. This building, designed by the architects Foster and Partners, is due to be handed over to the Mayor on 24 June 2002.

Over 4,300 parish councils in England have notified the Standards Board for England that they have adopted new codes of conduct. No central records are kept of the number of individual councillors who have given an undertaking to observe the code.
<P>

<a name="20621w15.html_para9">Parish councillors are under no obligation to inform the Government or the Standards Board if they choose to resign. Around 30 parish councillors have written informing us that they have resigned in response to the introduction of the code of conduct.
<P>

<a name="20621w15.html_para10">All parish councillors are now subject to the code. On election, new parish councillors must give a written undertaking to observe the code before taking office. When a council has adopted a code, its existing members must within two months give a written undertaking to observe the code, or cease to be councillors. In those councils which have not yet adopted a code, there is no obligation on existing councillors to give a written undertaking to observe a code, although all such councillors are subject to the provisions of the national code. In Wales, these matters are the responsibility of the National Assembly for Wales.

Local authorities are responsible in law for their own decisions on procurement. It is for them to decide whether or not to procure timber products from sustainable sources. In doing so they need to have regard to achieving Best Value and abide by relevant Procurement legislation.
<P>

<a name="20621w16.html_para0">My Department has not issued specific guidance on this issue. Central Government's timber procurement policy statement is widely available and can be adapted or adopted by local authorities if they wish.

<a name="20621w16.html_para1">Over 8,200 people were helped into work through the New Deal for Disabled People pilots and building on that success we have established a national network of Job Brokers. The New Deal enables those with a health condition or disability to find and move into work and to help themselves to become, and remain, independent. And from this April we have introduced new permitted work rules in Incapacity Benefit to make it easier for people to make the first moves into work.

<i>[holding answer 19 June 2002]: </i>There are no incentives within the benefits system for young people to marry or have children at an early age.

Over 20 UK civil servants have been selected in the last year to work on new twinning projects in applicant country Ministries, making over 50 either in the countries or preparing to arrive. The UK won the second highest number of new twinning projects in 2001 (25) and has won involvement in eight more so far in 2002.

Further assistance has been provided through functional departments' budgets (e.g. Global Conflict Prevention Fund) but to provide the information requested would incur disproportionate costs.

We regularly discuss the issue of Western Sahara with the Government of the Kingdom of Morocco. My predecessor my hon. Friend the Member for Exeter (Mr. Ben Bradshaw) raised the issue during his visit to Morocco in September 2001 and when he met with Mohammed Benaissa the Moroccan Foreign Minister during his visit to London in March 2002. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary also discussed the subject with Mohammed Benaissa during his visit to London in February 2002.
