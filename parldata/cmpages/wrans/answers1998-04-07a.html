<a name="80407w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 The national museums and galleries take the greatest care to ensure that objects being acquired for their collections have not been stolen. I have no reason to believe that their procedures need to be reviewed. However, if the hon. Member has evidence to the contrary, I would be grateful if he would write to me about this.

 <i>[holding answer 31 March 1998]:</i> The current total revenues of the UK creative industries are estimated at over &#163;55 billion. There are no reliable historic data on the contribution of the creative industries to gross domestic product. In 1995, the last year for which such information is available, the contribution net of inputs ("valued added") was around &#163;25 billion, approaching 4 per cent. of gross domestic product.

 I arranged a meeting with my counterparts from Luxembourg and Austria last Thursday. This was the first opportunity that I and my European colleagues have had to discuss the important contribution that sport can make to social and economic development within Europe.

 Derbyshire County Council is the only authority (out of 433) for which I am proposing a cap limit, which would require it to reduce its budget requirement. Other authorities have set budgets and council taxes within the provisional limits which I set.
<P>

<a name="80407w02.html_para2">I have proposed a cap for the Council which I consider, on the basis of all the information available so far, to be reasonable, appropriate and achievable in all the circumstances of the authority.
<P>

<a name="80407w02.html_para3">The capping principles for 1998/99 are set out in the Limitation of Council Tax and Precepts 1998/99 (2 February 1998). They are subject to a general proviso that no authority is to be designated if its budget requirement is no more than &#163;15,000 above the limit

implied by these principles. I have placed copies of this document in the Library of the House. The main points are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) The City of London, Inner London boroughs, and Shire Districts are able to increase their budget requirements by 1.5 per cent. or the increase in their SSAs for all non-police services, whichever is the greater;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) Outer London Boroughs, Metropolitan Districts, Unitary authorities and the Isles of Scilly and Shire Counties are able to increase their budget requirements by 3 per cent. or the increase in their SSAs for all non-police services, whichever is the greater;</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="80407w02.html_para4">Authorities budgeting more than 12.5 per cent. above SSA are subject to a cash freeze.
<P>

<a name="80407w02.html_para5">In accordance with section 54 and 56 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, I have therefore decided to designate Derbyshire County Council. The amount that I am proposing should be the maximum amount calculated by that authority as its budget requirement for 1998/99 is &#163;468.757 million.
<P>

<a name="80407w02.html_para6">This decision demonstrates that we are taking our commitments on spending very seriously. The authority now has 28 days, starting today, in which to inform us whether or not it accepts its proposed cap. If it accepts, the cap will be confirmed by notice and the authority can set a revised lower budget. The budget we are proposing means &#163;3.9 million reduced expenditure for Derbyshire so Band D council tax bills will be cut by around &#163;17 million.
<P>

<a name="80407w02.html_para7">If the authority challenges, it must propose an alternative amount together with its reasons for doing so and will have the opportunity to meet with Ministers to explain its case.
<P>

<a name="80407w02.html_para8">Once we have considered all the available information we shall propose a final cap which will be included in an Order, a draft of which will be debated by the House of Commons. If the draft Order is approved, a final cap is set by notice and a revised budget and council tax must then be set by the authority.

 The Main Estimates published today include provision on Class VI, Vote 4 (Local Government and regional policy, England) of &#163;2 million in 1998/99 for preparing for the Greater London Authority. This sum reflects the best forecast that can be made at this stage of the total costs in 1998/99 as a whole. No expenditure can be incurred before the Main Estimates are approved in July. No spending will take place unless Londoners vote in favour of the proposals for a Greater London Authority in the Referendum on May 7. There will be no significant expenditure on preparing for the Greater London Authority until Parliament has approved the principle of the legislation providing for the new authority's establishment.

<a name="80407w03.html_para3">As part of a series of decisions on the future scope of regulatory reform, I am announcing today that the proposed legislation to establish the Financial Services Authority (FSA) as a single regulator will include powers enabling it to regulate mortgage business. We will be monitoring the Council of Mortgage Lenders (CML) Mortgage Code which was introduced in July 1997, to see if that, on its own, is capable of protecting mortgage borrowers to the standard the Government are determined to see achieved.

The Treasury will also look to the Department of Trade and Industry and the Office of Fair Trading to monitor the guidelines for non-status market lenders and brokers, and agreements under the Consumer Credit Act 1974. In addition, the Treasury will look to the FSA for an assessment of the likely costs of activating the reserve power, to assess whether they would be commensurate with any potential benefits.

It is too soon to decide whether the Code, on its own, is capable of protecting mortgage borrowers to the standard that the Government are determined to see achieved.

<a name="80407w04.html_para12">We intend that a right of action for damages for private persons will attach to the Financial Services Authority's rules, except financial resources rules and others specified by the Financial Services Authority.

To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will make a statement about the public sector benchmarking project.  [38515]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80407w05.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 I am launching today a new phase of the Public Sector Benchmarking Project, designed to help public bodies share best practice more systematically with each other, with the private sector and, ultimately, with the most successful government bodies in other countries. This project uses the widely recognised European Business Excellence Model. Self-assessment against the Model promotes continuous improvement and customer focus, and facilitates benchmarking with the wide variety of other organisations using the Model.

<a name="80407w05.html_para0">I have placed copies of the evaluation report on the first two years of the project in the Libraries of the House and it is also available on the Cabinet Office Internet site, at www.gtnet.gov.uk/co/cohome.htm. It is clear from the report that participation has brought great benefit to the 100 organisations involved in the project so far, and has enabled comparison particularly with the private sector in a way which was previously impossible. Six organisations involved have already achieved a score of over 450 points against the Model, which is comparable to those achieved by winners of the several regional quality awards. 60 organisations have already expressed interest in participation in this new phase, even before details could be circulated.
<P>

<a name="80407w05.html_para1">The project has so far primarily targeted Next Steps executive agencies and the larger non-departmental public bodies. Experience with a range of other public bodies has demonstrated that the Model can be of equal value in other sectors. The new phase is therefore open to any organisation in the wider public sector, and my officials will be working closely with other departments and representative bodies to encourage uptake of the project, for example among police forces, local government, and the health and education services. We will develop and emphasise the clear links between the Business Excellence Model and agencies' ministerial targets; with other quality schemes used in the public sector, particularly Charter Mark, Investors in People and ISO 9000; and with the White Papers and guidance recently or shortly to be published on Better Government, Best Value, market testing and contracting out in central government, Opening Up Quangos, The New NHS, and Excellence in Schools.
<P>

<a name="80407w05.html_para2">There has been considerable international interest in the project. I am keen to promote this and build on the work already done, so that we can share best practices between national public sectors. My officials will work with their counterparts abroad and in the European Commission to facilitate international comparisons, and with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in its setting up of an International Benchmarking Network for the public sector.

Provisional estimates, for the previous month, are published earlier at the beginning of each month in the Advance Energy Statistics Press Notice. Longer runs of data and information relating to duty rates are published annually in the Digest of UK Energy Statistics. The very localised nature of petrol pricing means that meaningful regional analyses has to be based on very small regions.

 The Government have welcomed the European Commission's Renewable Energy White Paper.

The Review is considering all forms of new and renewable energy, including solar power. I am expecting officials shortly to present me with a number of options. I will make an announcement later this year. In the meantime my Department will continue with its assessment of different solar PV systems in a variety of buildings, under its New and Renewable Energy Programme.

 For the fourth successive year the total return on the Commissioners' investments has exceeded the independent benchmark. Provisional figures 



<P>
<P><I>7 Apr 1998 : Column: 164</I><P>
for 1997 show the total return on the Commissioners' assets was 19.7% against the WM All Funds benchmark of 16.5%. This reflects sound strategic and tactical investment choices as well as the current high market values of UK equities. The value of the assets at 31 December 1997 was &#163;3,481 million (&#163;2,976 million in 1996). Income was &#163;135 million (&#163;146 million in 1996) which represented an underlying increase after taking into account special dividends and other one-off items of &#163;3.9 million in 1997 compared to &#163;15.1 million in 1996. The Commissioners' total expenditure in 1997 in support of the Church was &#163;130.6 million (136.2 million in 1996).
<P>

<a name="80407w07.html_para2">With the support and cooperation of the rest of the Church and, in particular, because of the generosity of the parishes, the Commissioners have been able to restore a balance between assets and distribution levels. They have also been able to rebalance their investment portfolio towards long term total return with a broader spread of risk. Both these factors have underpinned the strong investment performance of recent years.
<P>

<a name="80407w07.html_para3">A six year programme of reducing distribution levels was completed in 1997 and parishes now bear a greater responsibility for the financial support of their clergy. Parishes now meet 62% of the clergy pay bill (&#163;160 million in 1997) with the Commissioners meeting only 15%. Parishes started to contribute towards clergy pensions from 1 January 1998 following the introduction of the new pensions arrangements made possible by the Pensions Measure which was passed by this House last year.
<P>

<a name="80407w07.html_para4">This continuing acceptance of responsibility and extra generosity from the parishes will enable the Commissioners to continue to fulfil their core responsibility of supporting the Church's ministry in poorer areas of the country for this and successive generations.

These estimates included capital costs of necessary upgrading of the buildings and rent and rates over a two year period. The costs covered office accommodation required by the Parliament.

advanced standing within the new qualifications framework. In our response to the Garrick Report, published on 25 February and available from the Library of this House, we welcomed this recommendation. The Government believe that higher education providers should give more consideration for entry into second year for candidates with appropriate combinations of A levels and, in due course, Advanced Highers. However, as this is for the institutions themselves to consider and take forward, no estimate has been made of the cost.

 The National Curriculum sets out the minimum requirements for drugs education in schools. Beyond this, it is for individual schools to decide on their drugs education programmes in the light of their needs and circumstances.
<P>

<a name="80407w09.html_para3">The Department for Education and Employment is making &#163;7 million of support available to all local education authorities in England in 1998-99, through the Standards Fund programme, to assist primary and secondary schools and the youth service to deliver effective education about drugs, including alcohol and tobacco. In addition, as part of its &#163;1.9 million annual grants programme, the Home Office Drugs Prevention Initiative is supporting work in a limited number of schools in developing their drugs education programmes. The results of this work will be disseminated nationally over the course of this year.

<P>
<a name="80407w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government's proposal to place a duty on local authorities with social services and education responsibilities, to formulate and implement an annual youth justice plan covering the provision of youth justice services and youth offending teams, was set out in the consultation paper "New National and Local Focus on Youth Crime", published in October. Sixteen local authorities commented specifically on the proposal for a youth justice plan. Overall, they gave a broad welcome to the proposal and commented on the need for proper links between youth justice plans and other local plans, in particular, the children's services plan drawn up by local authorities and the policing plan issued by police authorities. A summary of the responses to the consultation paper was placed in the Library on 15 December 1997.
<P>

<a name="80407w09.html_para4">The proposal for a youth justice plan was reflected in the White Paper "No More Excuses--A New Approach to Tackling Youth Crime in England and Wales", published in November, and is now contained in clause 37 of the Crime and Disorder Bill.

<a name="80407w09.html_para5">The preparation of youth justice plans and their relationship with other local plans will be addressed in guidance to local authorities and the other relevant local agencies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80407w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Clause 36 of the Crime and Disorder Bill places the responsibility for establishing youth offending teams on the local authority with education and social services responsibilities in the area. Youth offending teams will therefore be accountable to that local authority for the way they discharge their statutory duties.
<P>

<a name="80407w09.html_para6">In practice, we expect youth offending teams to be accountable to a group of chief officers from the local authority and from those agencies placed under a duty by clause 36 to co-operate with the local authority in

establishing a youth offending team. They are the police, the probation service and the health authority. This group will in turn account to the local authority, the police authority, the probation committee and the health authority. It is expected that where there are two tiers of local authority, there would be consultation with the District Authorities and to ensure coherence with the work of Crime Prevention Partnerships and the work of Drug Action Teams.
<P>

<a name="80407w09.html_para7">Clause 37 of the Bill also places a duty on local authorities, after consultation with the police authority, probation committee and health authority, to formulate and implement an annual youth justice plan covering the provision of youth offending teams and youth justice services. This plan will be published and submitted to the Youth Justice Board established under clause 38, which will be able to hold the local authority and the other agencies to account for the arrangements for teams and services in their area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80407w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We intend to introduce statutory regulation of the private security industry as soon as possible but pressures on Parliamentary time constitute an obstacle to early legislation, as we warned would be the case when we pressed the last Government for early legislation before the election. We have recently completed a consultation exercise with the industry and others on the best way to provide a comprehensive, effective and streamlined system for the whole of the private security industry. It is clear from the responses that there is general support for our approach from the industry itself, as well as from other respondents, and we hope to put forward firm proposals for regulation later this year. Our aim is to build a consensus behind legislative proposals in order to be able to move more quickly and effectively as soon as Parliamentary time becomes available.

 Airline liaison officers are selected from within an Immigration Service management grade (Chief Immigration Officer) on the basis of experience and suitability against well defined criteria. After selection and before posting, airline liaison officers attend a training course devised and run by the Immigration Service Carriers Liaison Unit, the office responsible for managing the airline liaison officer network. They are also provided with a manual which contains operational guidance and instructions. Airline liaison officers are instructed to contact the Carriers Liaison Unit for advice and guidance whenever necessary.

 Following a policy review, I have accepted the Passport Agency's recommendation that, on the grounds of improved security, of making child abduction more difficult, of facilitating travel and of maintaining the Agency's efficiency and effectiveness, all children should be required to hold their own passport. This change in policy will take effect from 5 October 1998, when the Agency plan to begin introducing a new, more secure British passport. Children already included on their parents' passports will not be affected by this change until the passport is changed.

<P>
<a name="80407w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce today that the Government have accepted all the main recommendations of the Community Fire Safety Task Force.
<P>

<a name="80407w11.html_para0">We have pledged quite clearly our determination and commitment to providing safer communities. The fire service has a vital role to play in helping to achieve a safer society, not just by fighting fires, but by reducing the number of fires, deaths and casualties.
<P>

<a name="80407w11.html_para1">The Community Fire Safety Task Force were established to advise on a new strategy for England and Wales to reduce significantly the incidence of fire in the home. The report they produced last November was welcomed as an enormous opportunity both for the Government and the fire service to reduce the pain and suffering caused by dwelling fires.
<P>

<a name="80407w11.html_para2">I made it clear when the report was published that we wanted to hear the views of chief officers, fire authorities and the Unions, all of whom have a crucial role to play in translating the strategy into action. I am pleased to say that the response to the Task Force report has provided a strong mandate for almost all of their key proposals and for a refocusing of effort towards prevention and safety.
<P>

<a name="80407w11.html_para3">I am writing to those same organisations today to explain how we intend to take the strategy forward. In particular, I want to see the efforts of Government, fire authorities and other local agencies integrated and co-ordinated as the Task Force recommended, so that the whole effort achieves more than the sum of its parts. We shall be taking steps to put these arrangements in place shortly. I also accept, with the strong endorsement of the fire service, the recommendation that community fire safety should be made a statutory duty.
<P>

<a name="80407w11.html_para4">Community Fire Safety must become a core activity of the fire service, and we must work in partnership with other agencies and with business to eliminate preventable fires. The success of this approach will mean a safer society for us all.

<a name="80407w13.html_para1">The HSS Executive has been promoting awareness of HPSS Year 2000 issues since 1996. The HPSS programme is broadly in line with the GB timescale and the requirement for regular updates on progress will fall into line with GB from the next return date which is due in June 1998. It is not expected that compliance of all equipment will be achieved by the December 1998 target date. Preparations should however be complete in time for the millennium.

 The Access to Health Records Act 1990 requires that charges should not exceed the cost of making a copy and posting it, and guidance to National Health Service organisations has made it quite clear that the actual cost is the maximum that should be charged. The actual cost will differ from case to case and can be determined only by the specific organisation involved. Recommending a charge greater than the actual cost in

 All breast screening units currently take two mammographic views of the breast at a woman's first visit to the screening programme, and it is open to them to use two-view mammography at subsequent screening rounds.

<a name="80407w15.html_para6">The cancer screening evaluation unit, which is funded by the Department, is currently reviewing the advantages of two view mammography for all screening rounds. This review is due to be completed later this year. We will assess the case for requiring all units to take views at every screening round in the light of the findings of this review. This assessment will also take account of the outcome of research currently being carried out into other changes that might be made to improve the quality of the service offered to women. This research covers extending

<P>
<P>
<a name="80407w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The breast screening programme was introduced in 1988, and so far it has greater experience of taking and reading mammograms at a woman's first screen than at subsequent screens. In addition, since August 1995 all breast screening units have been required to take two mammographic views of the breast at a woman's first screen. Both these factors are likely to underlie the higher standardised detection ration for the first round of screening relative to subsequent rounds.

 In 1991 the General Medical Services Council of the British Medical Association issued guidance to general practitioners through local medical committees, reminding them of their obligations under their terms of service.

 The Children Act and guidance set out local authorities' responsibilities in respect of drawing up care plans for, and reviewing the care of looked after children, including disabled children. In August 1995 the Department announced easements to the Arrangements for Placement of Children (General) Regulations 1991 which govern a series of short-term respite care placements.

The report of this work will be made available for wider dissemination. In October 1997 I announced an additional &#163;9.548 million to tackle the pressures of emergency hospital admissions and to reduce delays in discharging patients. The management of these additional resources has meant that health authorities and social services have needed to work more closely together to address local priorities and improve joint planning and co-ordination of service delivery.

<a name="80407w19.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Llwyd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what initiatives are being pursued to educate young people in Wales about substance misuse.  [37370]

<a name="80407w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 "Forward Together", a five-year strategy to combat drug and alcohol misuse in Wales, has been in place since 1996. A Welsh Advisory Committee on Drug and Alcohol Misuse advises the Secretary of State on the implementation of the strategy. The Welsh Drug and Alcohol Unit, on contract to the Welsh Office, assists in the implementation of the strategy. The Unit provides practical and administrative support to those involved in combating drug and alcohol misuse.
<P>

<a name="80407w19.html_para10">Within the framework of "Forward Together", a Strategic Prevention Action Plan (SPAP) has been developed and widely disseminated in Wales. The SPAP will raise awareness and increase the level of preventive action for the population as a whole as well as targeting specific groups such as parents, young people and children. All schools, drug and alcohol agencies and other relevant organisations have been encouraged to work to support the Plan.
<P>

<a name="80407w19.html_para11">As part of the overall strategy several free bilingual resources are being distributed to those working in the field of prevention with young people. These include "50/50"--a bilingual magazine designed for young people and their parents; "The A Files"--a CD size alcohol leaflet for young people; and "Let's Talk"--a series of collectable postcards with a complimentary poster for young people.
<P>

<a name="80407w19.html_para12">The Department has issued circular guidance to Schools, "Drug Misuse: Prevention and Schools" (Ref 54/95). In partnership with health and social services, police and the community, schools have a responsibility to consider their response to drug misuse through appropriate education, including the teaching of certain aspects as part of National Curriculum, and through appropriate management of incidents on school premises. In support of this work, the circular guidance advocates that each school should have a drug prevention policy, to ensure that young people know and understand the risks of drug taking and alcohol misuse and have the knowledge and skills to resist.

 Welsh language provision is an integral part of my proposals for lifelong learning in Wales as set out in the Green Paper <i>"Learning is for Everyone"</i> which I published on 2 April. Individual further education institutions are responsible for monitoring student retention/completion rates on Welsh for Adults courses and for taking any necessary action. Student retention/completion will continue to be monitored in the context of all quality assessments, and during 1998 a specific study will be undertaken by OHMCI on behalf of the Further Education Funding Council for Wales.

 The provision of grant aid to abattoirs is prohibited by EC State Aid restrictions except under certain specific conditions, including the abandonment of 125 per cent. of existing capacity in the same region. This effectively means that it is very difficult for the Government to provide financial support to small scale abattoirs in rural areas.

Friend the Member for Bridgend (Mr. Griffiths), was also present.
<P>

<a name="80407w20.html_para1">I convened the Council expressly to consider the Commission's proposals, published on 18 March, for changes to the EU Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in the framework of Agenda 2000. The Council debate on this vital issue was held in open session, and was thus available in full to the media and to other interested parties. There was also an important political dimension to the debate: reforming the CAP in tandem with changes to the EU's future financing provisions and to its regional and structural policies are essential steps to prepare for further enlargement of the European Union. It is significant that the formal opening of the enlargement negotiations with six applicant countries took place in Brussels on the same day.
<P>

<a name="80407w20.html_para2">A wide range of views on the Commission's CAP reform proposals was expressed in the Council. No Minister denied that there was a need for reform to take place, or that the process should begin forthwith. I was able to conclude that the UK Presidency would now begin an intensive programme of technical examination of the Commission's proposals, leading to a further discussion in the Agriculture Council in late May.
<P>

<a name="80407w20.html_para3">I was also able to establish, as President of the Council, that there was unanimous agreement amongst Member States to defer until 1 January 1999 implementation of last July's Commission Decision on Specified Risk Materials. During this period measures taken by Member States on a national basis to protect the health of their populations will be maintained.

To date, some 325,000 tonnes of MBM has been produced as a consequence of the rendering of OTMS animals, of which some 314,000 tonnes is currently in store, the remainder having been incinerated.

 <i>[holding answer 6 April 1998]:</i> Provided the meat originates from approved establishments in Canada, is accompanied by the necessary official certification and is not rejected following completion of veterinary checks at a border inspection post, meat from Canadian pedigree fresians, and other bovine animals, will be allowed to enter the European Community. The sale of beef for human consumption from animals originating in Canada which are over 30 months old at the time of slaughter is, however, prohibited by the Fresh Meat (Beef Controls) (No. 2) Regulations 1996.

On this basis it is not envisaged that there would be significant compulsory redundancies should the decision be made to relocate the work undertaken at the Norwich laboratory to York.

<P>
<a name="80407w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 April 1998]:</i> In discussions on the original Agenda 2000 proposals, the Agriculture Council agreed in November last year that maintaining the status quo in the CAP could lead to an increase in intervention stocks. In view of this, the Council called upon the European Commission to frame formal legislative proposals which would, amongst other things, reduce price-support measures. This would reduce the importance of intervention as a management tool, which is its main purpose.
<P>

<a name="80407w22.html_para0">The Commission's proposals for reform, which were presented to the Agriculture Council on 31 March, included cuts in the beef, cereal and dairy support prices and the abolition of intervention for the beef sector. While accepting the need for reduced price support, some Member States have argued that, without full compensation, some of these price reductions go too far.

No low level flying is permitted over the Sheffield urban area, or any other major conurbation. Records of flying at medium level--between 2,000 and 24,000 feet--are not maintained so it is possible that there were aircraft in the area at medium level.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80407w24.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 There are no plans at present to change the funding rules for primary schools in this respect. Under Local Management of Schools, Local Education Authorities are responsible for devising and revising the formula used to allocate funds to schools. Some Authorities use pupils' entitlement to free school meals, which is triggered when a parent is in receipt of income support or income-based job seekers allowance, to allocate additional funding to schools. Families transferring from income support to family credit lose their entitlement to free school meals. Authorities may therefore need to consider whether their formulae should reflect this.
<P>

<a name="80407w24.html_para4">However, I understand that Oldham LEA's LMS formula uses entitlement to clothing grant rather than free school meals as the proxy for distributing additional funding to schools. Pupils from families in receipt of family credit or income support are automatically entitled to clothing grant. The change in benefit entitlement should not therefore affect Oldham schools' funding.

<a name="80407w24.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Government strongly support the International Labour Organisation's proposal for a new Convention to eliminate the most intolerable forms of child labour. The UK will be actively involved in negotiating the new instrument during the ILO Conferences in 1998 and 1999. The UK has already committed &#163;200,000 to the ILO's International Programme on the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC) to finance work in Asia to combat trafficking of women and children. The Government will announce further contributions to this worthwhile programme in the coming weeks.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Education and Employment has asked me to reply to your question on the funding of Jobclubs over the next three fiscal years and how this has been affected by New Deal. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Employment Service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our planned expenditure on Jobclubs will be &#163;24 million in each of the next three fiscal years.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In some areas we have also been looking at the advantages of combining some of our programmes, such as Jobclub and Jobplan, and delivering them through Programme Centres, which provide a one stop shop with greater scope for the more efficient use of resources and individualised packages of help for people.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The funding allocated to Jobclubs and Programme Centres reflects the likely demand among those people aged 25 and over who have been unemployed for six months or more. This takes account of the fact that many young people who might previously have depended on this provision will now be able to take advantage instead of the much more extensive extra help provided by New Deal.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>My District Managers have recently undertaken a consultation exercise with local New Deal partners, with regard to our mainstream programmes, to determine which types of provision will be most effective to meet the needs of each locality. Where local partnerships decide that Jobclub or Programme Centre places should form part of the New Deal Gateway, they can purchase additional places on these programmes using New Deal funding.</FONT></UL>
