services are too long and do need to be tackled, not least to ensure
that referrals to such services are not diverted via ear, nose and
throat departments (which are covered by 18 weeks) to benefit from the
18-week maximum wait that will apply by December 2008. Work is under

Colin-Thom&#233;'s role on 18 weeks is to lead engagement with the
clinical community, act as national lead for the clinical leads of
particular specialty areas, co-chair the 18-week stakeholder group and
provide advice on implementation issues as they
arise.</p><p><a name="06071876005712">The 18-week
pathway stakeholder group is made up of nominees from a range of
national organisations, senior clinicians, managers and patients. It is
intended that the group should normally meet monthly, alternating
between the full group and a subset made up of the strategic health
authority leads for 18 weeks. The subset met for the first time in
June. The full group should meet for the first time in
September.</p><p><a name="06071876005713"><b><a name="06071876006176">Mr.

basic infrastructure, poor governance and drought, much of
Afghanistan's productivity has been lost or re-directed towards poppy
cultivation and drug trafficking. As 70 per cent. of the population are
rural, agriculture provides the best opportunity for alternative income
generation.</p><p><a name="060718120000043">Helmand
province was once one of the most agriculturally advanced and
productive areas in Afghanistan. It might have the potential to be so
again. For examples, the DFID-funded Research into Alternative
Livelihoods Programme (RALF) is looking at the export potential of
grapes, tomatoes, mushrooms egg plants and okra in Helmand and has made
contacts with raisin importers, organic and fair trade. The programme
is also evaluating at least 10 different small scale agri-processing
industries such as tomato paste
production.</p><p><a name="060718120000044">Growth in
small and medium enterprises and construction has the potential to
bring new employment opportunities in all 34 provinces of Afghanistan.
DFID supports the Micro Finance Investment Support Facility Programme,
which provides much needed credit for investment in agriculture,
manufacturing, retail and service industries. To date, the programme
has brought financial services for some 161,000 people in around half
of the provinces of
Afghanistan.</p><p><a name="060718120000045">The
development of Afghanistan's natural resources could also provide
alternative jobs. Afghanistan possesses energy and mineral resources,
many of which are underdeveloped, such as coal, gas, oil, precious
metals and semi-precious stones. DFID is funding the British Geological
Survey to strengthen the Afghan Geological Survey to develop and

high occupancy vehicles but they are speed restricted which could
therefore impede the flow of traffic in the HOV lane. A key

[85822]</p><p><a name="060718120000336"><b><a name="060718120000496">Dr.
Ladyman:</b> The portal provides the user with two choices for
assessing the costs of car travel. One is &#145;fuel costs&#146;;
including exceptional costs such as tolls, ferry charges and congestion
charges, and the other is &#145;total running costs&#146; which
take into account the cost of owning a
car.</p><p><a name="060718120000337">Transport
Direct&#146;s purpose is to give users an impartial series of travel
options and to enable them to select choices that meet their needs.
Market research strongly indicates that motorists are overwhelmingly
interested in seeing information about the &#145;point of use&#146;
of costs of their car. Therefore the default is to display the fuel
costs and other direct costs. Showing full costs as the default would
result in this functionality not being used by the majority of
motorists, thus negating any potential effect on their travel
choice.</p><p><a name="060718120000338">Users do have
the option to select an estimate of the total running costs. This is
based on advice and information provided by the major motoring
organisations and provides a figure which reflects the total cost of
motoring, on a per mile basis. If the user chooses this option, then
fuel costs, the exceptional costs and the total ownership costs are
displayed.</p><p><a name="060718120000339"><b><a name="060718120000497">Chris
