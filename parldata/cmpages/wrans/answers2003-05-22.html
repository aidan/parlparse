<i>[holding answer 13 May 2003]:</i> The new biodiesel rate of 27.10 pence per litre was chosen to maintain the 20 pence per litre duty differential with ultra-low sulphur diesel. The Government offers lower duty rates for less environmentally-damaging fuels by offering duty differentials relative to the main road fuels. These differentials are intended primarily to reflect the relative environmental benefits of the fuels in question. In determining the size of the duty incentive for biodiesel, the Government has taken into account principally the environmental benefits of the fuel, which amount to approximately 55 per cent. carbon emissions savings on a lifecycle basis, as well as a range of other benefits offered by the fuel, including fuel security benefits and the potential to encourage the recycling of waste products.

 The Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 provides extensive new powers for police and customs officers to seize the proceeds of all crimes, including drug trafficking. This is often the working capital for organised gangs, and recovering those proceeds will prevent them being used to fund further criminal activity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30522w01.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The UK has a legally binding target under the Kyoto Protocol to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2012. In addition, as set out in the Climate Change Programme published in 2000, the UK has set a domestic goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. by 2010. The Energy White Paper, published in February 2003 reaffirmed this goal and the expectation that more than half of the emissions reductions in the Climate Change Programme&#151;around 10 MtC by 2010&#151;would come from energy efficiency.
<P>

<a name="30522w01.html_para1">The Energy White Paper sets out the measures which the Government is taking forward to achieve these reductions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30522w01.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B>

<a name="30522w01.html_para4">This analysis does not take into account the way in which the new tax credits will respond to rises in income, described in detail in The Child and Working Tax Credit. The new tax credits only respond to rises in income in the current year of more than &#163;2,500, disregarding the first &#163;2,500 of any risk. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.
<P>

<a name="30522w01.html_para5">Figures are cumulative. This table shows marginal deduction rates for working households in receipt of income related benefits or new tax credits, where at least one person works 16 hours or more a week and where higher earnings would lead to reduced benefits or tax credits. They include the marginal effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax benefit.
<P>

<a name="30522w01.html_para6">As a result of the Government's reforms, over half a million fewer low-income households now face marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. than did so in April 1997. The increase in the number of households facing marginal deduction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. is primarily due to the introduction of tax credits, and more recently the extension of support to workers aged 25 or over without children.

 In order to prevent the spread of Avian Influenza (AI) from the European Union to the UK the Department has taken the following steps.

These Declarations make it a criminal offence to import live poultry and hatching eggs into England from both the Netherlands and Belgium. A further Declaration was issued on 9 May 2003 prohibiting the import of live poultry and hatching

<P>

<a name="30522w03.html_para3">The Government have also banned the import from the Netherlands, Belgium and from the Land of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany of fresh, unprocessed and non-heat treated poultry manure and litter. EU legislation does not permit trade in fresh poultry meat if it was obtained from poultry originating in established surveillance zones in those countries.

<a name="30522w03.html_para6">Table eggs do not present a high risk of spread of disease. Any risk would be of mechanical transmission of virus on eggs, packaging or means of transport. Controls in force in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany provide good safeguards against this risk and a ban on imports would be disproportionate.
<P>

<a name="30522w03.html_para7">Defra has reminded egg and poultry producers in the UK about the need for stringent biosecurity measures at all times. To minimise the introduction of AI into their flocks by means of faecal contamination, poultry producers should ensure that their boots, clothing, equipment and vehicles are disinfected. Access by wild birds should be minimised, for instance by clearing up feed spillages. Officials have asked poultry producers in the UK to be vigilant for any signs of respiratory disease in birds and contact their local veterinary office immediately if they have any concerns.

 The Carbon Trust is a private company created in April 2001 to take the lead on energy efficiency in the business and public sectors, and to support the development of the low carbon sector in the UK. The Trust has already done much valuable work in developing its three main programme areas and is taking a proactive role in the energy efficiency arena in its role as the main source of energy efficiency information and advice for the non-domestic sector. An initial impact assessment programme for the Trust is being developed and should provide preliminary results over the summer.

 One cause of the decline in salmon stocks may be increases in river temperatures resulting from natural factors or human activities. This could reduce the survival or reproductive success of the fish. The tags used in the study record temperature and transmit the fish's position, allowing scientists to investigate whether or not adult salmon show temperature preferences during upstream migration. This is of particular relevance to the spring-running multi-sea winter salmon in the Avon, which are resident in freshwater for many months prior to spawning. The results of this work will be used to provide advice to Government and other organisations dedicated to the conservation and sustainable management of salmon stocks, on the potential impacts of habitat management practices and climate change on salmonid populations.
<P>

<a name="30522w05.html_para0">Between 1985 and 1990 more than 400 salmon were tagged with radio transmitting tags in the Avon estuary. The great majority of these fish entered the Avon and were tracked migrating upstream to their spawning areas. 45 were reported caught by anglers, which is consistent with recapture rates elsewhere of conventionally tagged fish. No radio-tagged fish were found dead in the river. This suggests that tagging salmon with radio tags has a negligible influence upon their natural behaviour or survival.
<P>

<a name="30522w05.html_para1">Both riparian owners and angling interests were consulted through the Environment Agency, who discussed the work with the Chairman of the Avon and Stour Fishery Association; riparian interests were sent a copy of a letter from CEFAS explaining the purpose of the work and the methods to be used. The Chairman of the Wessex Salmon and Rivers Trust, and English Nature, were also consulted.

 There are a number of European fora attended by my officials and those of the other Member States at which issues relating to veterinary medicines are discussed and at which issues relating to their supply may be raised. In particular, European Commission proposals to amend medicines legislation, including one to require a prescription for all medicines for use in food-producing animals, are currently being discussed in a series of Council Working Groups. This year the Working Group has met twice each month except February when there was one meeting. My officials are seeking to modify the Commission's proposal to enable a flexible approach to the distribution of veterinary medicinal products that takes advantage of existing national practices, so long as consumer protection and animal welfare can be demonstrably assured.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the outcome was of the Competitiveness Council held on 12 to 13 May; what the Government's stance was on the issues discussed, including its voting record; and if she will make a statement.  [113979]

<P>
<a name="30522w07.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Minister for Employment Relations, Industry and the Regions, represented the UK at the Competitiveness Council on 13 May 2003.
<P>

<a name="30522w07.html_para0">The council adopted conclusions on Industry Policy in an Enlarged Europe, which were discussed at the Competitiveness Council on 3 March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30522w07.html_para1">The commission introduced its new Communication on Innovation Policy. Among other things it highlights the EU's continued underperformance in turning ideas into commercially successful products and services. The commission emphasised that new models and marketing methods were as important as exploiting technological research. Key characteristics of EU policy should be an emphasis on diffusion, and seeing the world from a business perspective. Other important elements were innovation in the public sector, regional diversity and the challenges of diversity.
<P>

<a name="30522w07.html_para2">The UK welcomed the communication, while expressing some disappointment that the commission had not done more to integrate research and innovation policy. The communication could also have gone further in promoting the role of competition. A light touch was needed in applying the open method of co-ordination.
<P>

<a name="30522w07.html_para3">Many similar points were made in discussion on the commission's Action Plan for increasing spending on Research and Development to 3 per cent. of GDP. Member states particularly stressed the need for fiscal and other incentives, and more flexibility over state aid. This area was of equal importance to accession states; Slovenia was interested in the question of policy co-ordination and how to make markets work better.
<P>

<a name="30522w07.html_para4">Commissioner Liikanen presented the commission's 7th Report on the situation of world shipbuilding. The report highlighted that the difficulties in world shipbuilding are growing, as evidenced by a further decrease in orders for new vessels in the major shipbuilding regions in 2002. The commission stressed that the most important market segments for EU yards developed negatively. For EU producers, order intake in 2002 was down by 50 per cent. compared to 2001. Investigations into Korean yards show that there were large-scale subsidies, and the commission was working closely with industry representatives on the challenges the sector currently faces, and would report by the end of the year. The French and Spanish delegations, supported by Germany and Portugal urged the commission to extend the temporary defence mechanism and include liquid gas carriers. France also pressed for the commission to open a WTO dispute procedure against Korea.
<P>

<a name="30522w07.html_para5">In introducing the Communication on European Defence&#151;Industrial and Market Issues the commission argued that the industrial aspects of defence equipment supply were important for EU competitiveness. The fragmented state for the EU market needed to be overcome, and consolidation should be encouraged by an appropriate regulatory framework which would promote cost-effectiveness. Commissioner Busquin supported this with a plea for more civil/military synergy in R&D. A number of member states were 



<P>
<P><I>22 May 2003 : Column 903W</I><P>
cautious. The UK gave a broad welcome but said detailed examination would be needed, including inter-governmental work on key issues.
<P>

<a name="30522w07.html_para6">The council considered a draft resolution which broadly supported the commission's Green Paper on European Space Policy and better co-operation between the commission and the European Space Agency. After a comprehensive discussion, and concerns raised by the Italian and German delegations, details on the form and scope of such an agreement were deleted. The resolution was then agreed.
<P>

<a name="30522w07.html_para7">Wide-ranging proposals for regulation of chemicals were presented by the commission. Commissioner Liikanen recognised the need to strike a balance between public health and environmental objectives on the one side, and competitiveness on the other and stressed the commission's effort to ease the burden on SMEs and respond to industry concerns. A number of member states, including the UK, intervened to warn of major concerns over the effect on competitiveness and the danger of moving chemical production outside the EU, and emphasised the need for impact assessment and for the Competitiveness Council to keep the issue under review. The Italian delegation said that the legal base included Article 95, which meant that the Competitiveness Council should lead on the dossier, and indicated that this would feature highly on the agenda during their presidency.
<P>

<a name="30522w07.html_para8">The commission also presented their latest report on the Life Sciences and Biotechnology Strategy, stressing three key priorities: more effective use of intellectual property rights; the need to implement EU legislation on GMOs; and improved access to finance.
<P>

<a name="30522w07.html_para9">Ministers discussed the arrangements for selecting the site for the new International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER). All member states apart from Spain agreed with the draft council conclusions supporting the commission's approach that a single EU candidate site should be selected to compete subsequently with the non-EU sites. Spain argued that the EU would stand a better chance if both EU sites (French and Spanish) were put forward together. The presidency was forced to abandon formal conclusions, and summed up that all Spain could accept the suggested process, which would be based on an objective criteria and expert input.

 I have no plans at present to introduce a system of licensing for garages or motor dealers.

<P>

<a name="30522w08.html_para2">The new code will implement a set of minimum standards of customer service through a process of audit checks and other compliance measures, including mystery shopping. Consumers will have a mechanism for having complaints dealt with and have access to independent arbitration where a matter cannot be resolved with the garage, Participation in the Code will be open to businesses that are not members of trade associations.
<P>

<a name="30522w08.html_para3">At the core of the new code is an independent advisory group, including representatives from trading standards and the National Consumer Council, which will help design and approve a strong compliance system to ensure that participating garages meet the Code standards.

 The Post Office is working to ensure their services are as accessible to as many customers as possible. In the short term the Post Office intends to improve current PIN pads by fitting a guard over the buttons to help guide customers. I understand that this will be done as soon as possible. In the longer term they intend to look at technological options to provide a secure alternative to PIN pads for people unable to use them.

 As I said in my reply to the question referred to by the hon. Member, the timetable for state aid clearance is a matter for the European Commission. DTI continues to work closely with the Commission to ensure that the questions and issues they raise are responded to as quickly as possible. We are confident we have a strong case and we hope to have approval in due course. The &#163;450 million of support for the rural post office network runs from April 2003 to 2006. Post Office Ltd. will administer the fund within the guidelines and parameters set by Government.

"the EU now has operational capability across the full range of Petersberg tasks, limited and constrained by recognised shortfalls."
These shortfalls particularly affect speed of deployment and level of risk for larger scale, higher-intensity tasks. Ministers endorsed the launch of ECAP Project Groups, in which participating member states will work on implementing selected solutions identified by the ECAP Panels. Ministers welcomed the first meeting of the EU-NATO Capability Group, which will help to ensure that EU efforts on military capabilities are coherent and mutually reinforcing with the work in NATO, as well as proposals in the context of the Convention for an EU defence capabilities development and acquisition agency. Ministers also noted the significant progress on ESDP since their last formal meeting in November 2002, and in particular, agreement on the Berlin Plus arrangements with NATO and the launch of the first military ESDP operation in Macedonia. The full Conclusions from the General Affairs and External Relations Council will be placed in the Library in the House shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the impact of this year's council tax increases upon <i>(a)</i> council tax benefit expenditure and <i>(b)</i> the numbers of households subjected to council tax benefit restrictions.  [111758]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30522w11.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our estimated forecast for council tax benefit expenditure in 2003&#150;04 is &#163;3,387 million. This is &#163;130 million more than if average council tax had increased by the same rate as in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="30522w11.html_para1">The amount of council tax benefit paid to households in properties in council tax bands F, G or H is restricted to the amount payable for council tax band E, regardless of the amount of council tax payable. An increase in council tax would not therefore have an impact on the number of existing benefit recipients subject to restrictions. The impact of council tax increases on the number of households that might make a new claim for council tax benefit, who would subsequently be subject to restrictions, is estimated to be negligible.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked Alexis Cleveland to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what procedure the Pensions Agency has in place to alert husbands and wives to the enhanced pension for wives when a husband reaches 65; and what checking they do to ensure that the enhanced pension is received. Due to annual leave I am replying on her behalf.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A claim package is sent out approximately four months prior to a customer approaching State Pension age (age 65 for a man, age 60 for a woman). This package includes an invitation to claim (form BR833) and a letter of expected entitlement (form BR33M/W). This package is issued to all customers based on whether they have entitlement based on their own National Insurance contributions.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Form BR833 informs a married man that if his wife is 60 or over a claim form can be sent to him for her to complete to claim State Pension based on his contributions. Also on form BR33M issued to a man it alerts him that his wife can claim State Pension on his National Insurance contributions. It asks him to advise her to claim if she has a reduced rate State Pension of her own or none at all.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no facility to invite claims from married women based on the National Insurance contributions of their husbands.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is no checking system because customers reaching State Pension age do not have to claim but can defer receipt of their State Pension for up to 5 years to receive increments added to their basic entitlement.</FONT></UL>

1. The estimates in Table 1 are based on potential claimants eligible to Pension Credit rather than actual claimants.<P>

2. Column 3 relates to the proportion of households eligible to Pension Credit out of the total number of pensioner households for that age group.<P>

3. The estimates were calculated for all pensioners using the department's Policy Simulation Model based on the Family Resource Survey data for 2000&#150;01 projected forward to 2003&#150;04. This shows around 3.6 million households entitled to pension credit.<P>

4. The Policy Simulation Model excludes all pensioners in nursing or residential care homes. This is because the Family Resource Survey data does not contain information on these cases. We estimate that just over 200,000 pensioners in care homes will be entitled to Pension Credit. This means that total pension credit entitlement for 2003&#150;04 is estimated to be about 3.8 million households.<P>

5. The figures in the table were rounded to the nearest 50,000 cases. The figures may not add up due to rounding.<P>

 The free pension credit application line became operational on 7 April 2003. The main purpose of the application line is to take applications for pension credit, but it will also deal with inquiries. Staffing levels for the application line have been based on a careful assessment of the likely numbers of applications for pension credit. A phased and measured approach to taking on applications will help to ensure that staffing levels are appropriate for the level of applications at any time.

 It is planned to increase the number of secure residential care places for children from 15 to 16 by 2005. Based on a recent inspection by the Social Services Inspectorate no substantial increase is proposed as it is anticipated that the Department's plans for an expansion in the general residential childcare sector will reduce the pressure on the need for secure care places.

<a name="30522w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 There are currently 15 secure care places provided for children in the care system at Shamrock and Linden House, Lakewood, Bangor. The cost of providing these places in 2003&#150;04 will be approximately &#163;1.8 million.
<P>

<a name="30522w15.html_para5">In 2002 the Social Services Inspectorate carried out an assessment, which resulted in a business case being made to replace the existing accommodation and to expand the secure care places from 15 to 16.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30522w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Since 1998 this Government has allocated more than &#163;20 million to fund victims' initiatives. More than &#163;6 million&#151;around 30 per cent.&#151;of this has gone to pay the core running costs of victims' groups. This is in recognition of the valuable work that victims' groups do and I continue to press the case for more money for victims' initiatives. In allocating any further such funding that may become available I will of course have regard to this work. Equally, I must take into account the fact that many victims do not align themselves with victims' groups.

<P>
<a name="30522w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Justice Peter Cory was appointed by the British and Irish Governments in May 2002 to carry out an investigation into six cases where collusion has been alleged. The judge is independent and his work programme is a matter for him.
<P>

<a name="30522w16.html_para0">As Justice Cory made clear in his third progress report to the British and Irish Governments in April, he has already completed his work on the cases of Patrick Finucane, Robert Hamill and Billy Wright. These reports are being stored securely by the Canadian authorities until the conclusion of his investigation. The judge has indicated that he is on schedule to complete his report in the Autumn. The Government is very grateful to Justice Cory for taking on this important task and remains committed to co-operating fully with his investigation.

 Tube Lines have announced that, for the Jubilee, Northern and Piccadilly lines, within the first 12 months of the contract they will be cutting delays by nearly 10 per cent., saving passengers some 430,000 hours. They have also improved the cleaning regime implementing deep cleans of trains and stations much more frequently than before. At the same time they are beginning the long-term work to upgrade the lines and increase capacity, including additional rolling stock for the Jubilee Line to increase train lengths from 6 to 7 cars, and awarding a contract for new signalling systems for the Jubilee and Northern Lines to allow a substantial increase in the service capability on these lines. These new signalling systems should be in place by 2009 and 2011 respectively.

 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2003]:</i> Congestion on inter-urban trunk roads can be measured in a number of different ways.

<a name="30522w18.html_para5">The Board have advised on a package of improvements to tackle car crime, reduce car dumping and ensure that every vehicle has a traceable keeper. As a consequence of the Board's advice, a range of proposals were announced by my hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State (David Jamieson) today that will significantly tighten the registration and licensing system, and make it much easier to deter and detect motorists who fail to insure or tax their vehicle. It will also be easier to trace the keepers of abandoned vehicles. The measures announced include; the registered keepers of vehicles remaining legally responsible at all times for taxing their vehicle, offenders will be penalised from the record when their tax-disc expires or Statutory Off-Road Notification lapses. Those that fail to comply will face a new automatic &#163;80 penalty. Determined offenders could face a minimum &#163;1,000 fine if taken to court.

 Commitments from the World Summit on Sustainable Development (WSSD) Plan of Implementation, such as action on illegal logging and sustainable tourism, have been incorporated into the delivery of the FCO's Public Service Agreement (PSA) for the period 2003&#150;06. In particular FCO PSA target 7 seeks to "Make globalisation work for sustainable development in the UK and internationally (and particularly in Africa) by promoting democracy and the rule of law, good economic and environmental governance, and security of long term energy supply, measured by specific underlying targets." FCO programme funds, including the new Global Opportunities Fund, will be used to support work in pursuit of this target.

 The information requested is set out in the following table, however, we hold no records centrally on local staff nationality and this information could be provided only at disproportionate cost. We have therefore provided the total number of local staff in each visa section. The figures reflect staff year full time equivalents i.e. two officers working part time at 50 per cent. equals one full time officer.

services with local oral health needs through local commissioning of the service. This would enable local flexibility to be built into the system.
<P>

<a name="30522w22.html_para5">It is also the intention of the Bill that providing oral health services to national health service patients becomes a more attractive option to general dental practitioners by making it possible to pay them differently. The current item-of-service remuneration system is widely recognised as the main reason for dentists' disaffection with NHS work as they are paid only for treatments rather than oral health care. Under this proposed approach, the whole dental team would be better able to advise patients on improving their oral health allowing further improvement of the quality and patient focus of their care. In addition, NHS dentists and other members of the dental team will increasingly become part of the NHS family, participating in local dental public health programmes and benefiting from primary care trust (PCT) support networks and in due course, to NHS occupational health services. By contracting with a PCT, dental practices will receive a more secure and predictable income in return for a longer term commitment to the NHS.
<P>

<a name="30522w22.html_para6">All stakeholders are being kept abreast of the proposed changes. The patients forum has met officials and is broadly supportive. A working group, led by the Department's Director for Patient Experience and Public Involvement and including patient representatives, will undertake a review of the charging regime. To improve patient experience of NHS dentistry, each PCT will be required to publish information about the primary dental services in its area.
<P>

<a name="30522w22.html_para7">A series of events for dentists was held by the NHS Modernisation Agency earlier this year. The events were designed to explain the proposals in "NHS dentistry&#151;Options for Change" and to encourage their involvement. Workshops for PCTs are being run by the national primary and care trust development programme and the Department of Health. In addition, learning events are being provided for local dental committee representatives by the British Dental Association, together with the NHS Modernisation Agency.

<a name="30522w22.html_para8">The legislation before Parliament proposes transitional arrangements under which a dentist already providing general dental services must be offered a new GDS contract, the terms of which would include remuneration.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the response I gave my hon. Friend the Member for Burnley (Mr. Pike) today.
<P>

<a name="30522w22.html_para11">General dental practitioners are independent contractors and, as such, are free to choose whether they wish to provide national health service or private dentistry or a combination of the two. However, very few practices are exclusively private, with only about 5 per cent. offering no NHS treatment. Under their NHS terms of service, dentists who stop offering NHS services are required to complete any outstanding treatment on the NHS or notify the appropriate primary care trust if this is not possible.
<P>

<a name="30522w22.html_para12">A number of initiatives have been introduced in recent years to encourage dentists to continue to offer dental treatment on the NHS:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The commitment payments scheme was introduced in 2000 to encourage dentists' commitment to the NHS. Dentists who have offered NHS treatment to patients for five years or more and who have a certain level of NHS commitment receive extra payments. Dentists in England earned an extra &#163;23 million under the scheme in 2002&#150;03.
<P>
<BR>
&#163;10 million was made available between 1997&#150;99 under the Investing in Dentistry scheme to allow dentists to increase their NHS commitment or start new practices in areas of poor access.
<P>
<BR>
A Dental Care Development Fund of &#163;4 million was made available in 2000&#150;01 along with &#163;6 million Dental Action Plan money in 2001&#150;02 to allow practices to grow and treat more patients.
<P>
<BR>
A Modernisation Fund of &#163;35 million was made available in 2001&#150;02 for practices to expand or improve their premises.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30522w22.html_para13">Where dentists withdraw from providing NHS dentistry, PCTs can apply to the Secretary of State for agreement to fund salaried general dental practitioners under Section 56 of the 1977 NHS Act. Any such applications recently received have been given a positive response.
<P>

<a name="30522w22.html_para14">In addition, a number of dental access centres (DAC) have been set up primarily in areas where access to NHS dentistry is difficult. Patients do not have to be registered to receive treatment in a DAC.

 Recovery plans were developed by the north Cheshire health community, including the north Cheshire hospitals national health service trust. Those plans were reviewed by the Cheshire and Merseyside strategic health authority (CMSHA) and after they were seen to be failing, a revision was requested in October 2002, which is now subject to a review by the Audit Commission. No money was to be transferred from other NHS trusts in north Cheshire. However, the CMSHA has facilitated brokerage from other organisations elsewhere in Cheshire and Merseyside to ensure that there is no impact on services in north Cheshire and to facilitate local developments.

 From 1 April 2003, the Department of Health assumed budgetary responsibility for prison health care in England, other than at contractually managed establishments. There has not, historically, been a separate budget for health care within overall prison service expenditure but the total Home Office baseline costs for 2002&#150;03 were identified as &#163;117.7 million. This baseline was transferred to the Department of Health, which will, over the next three years, make further resources, rising to around an extra &#163;46 million a year by 2005&#150;06, available to improve prison health services.
<P>

<a name="30522w23.html_para5">Prisons which receive prisoners directly from court undertake a full health assessment on a prisoner's first reception into prison custody. There is, at the minimum, a primary health care service at every establishment.

Most will also have some of a range of other services, such as in-patient facilities in a health care centre and dental, optical, mental health, substance misuse, genito-urinary and communicable disease services. Prisoners with physical or mental health problems which cannot be satisfactorily treated within the prison setting are admitted to hospital.

 Waiting time statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. It is therefore not possible to identify any 'breaches' of the waiting time targets using the data from the answer given on Wednesday 9 April 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 334W. HES provides counts and waiting times for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period, whereas the

Also, HES calculates the waiting time as the difference between the admission and decision-to-admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.

 Provisional figures for 2002&#150;03 show that of &#163;747 million DFID bilateral spend in Africa, approximately &#163;113 million was directly in support of the health sector, some 15 per cent. of the total. This figure will represent an underestimate as some development assistance instruments, for example direct budget support to national Governments, support a range of national programmes, including health, without us necessarily being able to identify the specific level of support to each of the sectors.
<P>

<a name="30522w25.html_para5">Similarly, in an increasing number of African countries, DFID is providing general health sector budget support to the overall national health plan. In many situations, we believe this to be a better approach than financing specific ring-fenced initiatives within the health sector. For this reason, it is no longer possible, or indeed appropriate, to specify the proportion of DFID funding in Africa allocated to primary health care and reproductive health services. We would, however, expect both primary health care and reproductive health services to be priority components of the national health plans to which we provide sector budget support. However, we do continue to support specific primary health care and reproductive health services investments in a number of African countries where budget support is not appropriate.

The other 18 (Cameroon, Chad, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Sierra Leone and Zambia) have reached Decision Point and are receiving interim relief on their debt servicing payments.

We expect the Democratic Republic of Congo to reach its Decision Point in the coming months, and the Central African Republic, Comoros and Cote d'Ivoire to do so later this year but, in some cases, this will depend on progress towards peace. The other countries (Burundi, Congo Republic, Liberia, Myanmar, Somalia, Sudan and Togo) are a long way from qualifying, as they are affected by conflict or have serious governance concerns.

 The timetable for revising Regional Spatial Strategies and Local Development Documents will vary considerably depending on the nature of the document. The timetable for the former will be agreed between the Regional Planning Body and the Government Office. Each local planning authority will be required to prepare a Local Development Scheme which will set out the timetable for the preparation of Local Development Documents. The Scheme must be submitted to the Secretary of State who may direct amendments to it as he thinks appropriate.

 There has been no suspension of the Right to Buy in any area, but nine local authority areas in the South East Region were included in the Housing (Right to Buy) (Limits on Discount) (Amendment) Order 2003&#151;Statutory Instrument 2003 No. 498&#151;which came into effect on 27 March 2003.

<P>

<a name="30522w27.html_para10">The Order lowered the maximum Right to Buy discount available to tenants from &#163;38,000 to &#163;16,000 in 41 areas under the greatest housing market pressure as evidenced by high levels of homelessness and high local house prices. This was determined on the basis of two measures:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>homelessness&#151;reflecting high demand for social housing. Using information provided by local authorities themselves in their regular Housing Investment Programme returns, the number of homeless households in temporary accommodation was compared with the number of local authority lettings and nominations to Registered Social Landlord dwellings given to households who were not homeless. A high value for this ratio indicates high homelessness and/or a low number of available lettings.
<P>
<BR>
house prices&#151;reflecting the demand for private housing and affordability. The Land Registry lower quartile house price for the third quarter of 2002 was used, to indicate likely availability for first time buyers.

<a name="30522w29.html_para1">There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which would have had the effect of increasing the number of offences counted. Similarly, some police forces adopted the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard in advance of its national implementation on 1 April 2002, and this may also have tended to increase the number of crimes counted, particularly in 2001&#150;02.

 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2003]:</i> Waiting times for residential rehabilitation and the other main types of treatment services in all Drug Action Team (DAT) areas are regularly monitored by the National Treatment Agency (NTA). Waiting times for the treatment of heroin addiction are not recorded separately from waits for other drug problems.
<P>

<a name="30522w29.html_para2">The latest available figures are taken from the DAT Annual Returns submitted in April 2003 and reflect the position in December 2002. Initial analysis indicates that average longest waiting time for residential rehabilitation was 7.1 weeks.
<P>

<a name="30522w29.html_para3">The following table sets out the waiting times for the main types of treatment in each DAT area.

<a name="30522w30.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Home Office's contribution to total managed expenditure consists of the total of spending under resource and capital budgets, less non-cash items in annually managed expenditure.

 All schools make use of temporary contracts for teachers. These are mainly used as occasional cover for teachers who are absent on sick leave. Temporary contracts also give schools greater flexibility to respond to local circumstances in meeting their staffing needs.

<P>
<a name="30522w33.html_spnew8"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Our White Paper "The future of higher education" proposes a number of measures which address concerns about student debt, particularly for students from low income families. In particular, from 2004/05 around 30 per cent. of students will benefit in full from the new HE Grant of &#163;1,000 per year and a further number will receive a proportion of &#163;1,000. The grant will be additional to the loan but students can choose to reduce their loan take up, including costly commercial loans, and hence their future debt.
<P>

<a name="30522w33.html_para5">From 2006/07 the abolition of the requirement to pay upfront fees and new university bursary schemes to support lower income students will also help reduce the need to borrow. The Government will continue to means test the first &#163;1,100 contribution to fees; at present only 40 per cent. of students pay the full contribution. In 2001/02, 43 per cent. of students received a full grant to cover tuition costs and 16 per cent. received a partial grant, institutions that wish to charge higher, variable fees will be required to enter into an access agreement with the Office for Fair Access (OFFA). The access agreement will cover proposals to extend the bursaries and other financial arrangements they will offer, such as subsidised accommodation, travel, books, study aids etc.
<P>

<a name="30522w33.html_para6">Student loans will continue to be offered at highly subsidised rates. Unlike commercial debt or mortgage there is no interest charged other than inflation. From 2005 the threshold at which students start to pay back will be raised from &#163;10,000 to &#163;15,000, helping new graduates and lower earners. This makes debt repayments lower and more affordable and repayments will continue to be income contingent. The new Student

<a name="30522w33.html_para9">The HEFCE have allocated &#163;265 million to institutions in 2003&#150;04 for widening access and improving retention. This figure recognises the additional costs of supporting students from non-traditional backgrounds and thereby increases the likelihood that they will complete their courses successfully. We expect HEFCE to come forward with further proposals for 2004/05 on how they intend to implement White Paper proposals on funding HEIs who are not making progress on improving completion rates.
