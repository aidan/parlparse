To ask the Chairman of the Accommodation and Works Committee what is the timetable for the connecting up to the PDVN of the remaining parts of the Palace of Westminster.  [31534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew0"><B> Sir Sydney Chapman: </B> 
 The timetable for installation of the Parliamentary Data and Video Network (PDVN) has been planned to coincide with other work such as the new fire detection system, asbestos removal, electrical rewiring and the voice alarm system. The majority of Members' offices will be provided with full access to the PDVN by the end of 2000. However, it has been decided that some areas, such as the offices in Commons Court, St. Stephen's Tower and Norman Shaw South should be connected to the PDVN when they are refurbished. These areas are scheduled for refurbishment after completion of Portcullis house.
<P>

<a name="80226w01.html_para0">To assist occupants of offices in areas of the estate which are not yet connected to the PDVN, temporary connections can quickly be made available to individual hon. Members' offices on request. The Parliamentary Communications Directorate is also experimenting with a wireless system, which, if successful, might provide an additional cost-effective means of connection to the PDVN.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what was the average length of suspension police officers experienced while under disciplinary investigation broken down by police authority in the last five years;  [31589]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many police officers currently have been suspended from operational duties for <i>(a)</i> less than six months, <i>(b)</i> six to 12 months, <i>(c)</i> 12 to 18 months, <i>(d)</i> 18 months to two years and <i>(e)</i> more than two years;  [31591]
<P>
(3) if he will estimate the current average cost of keeping a police officer suspended from duty for a year.  [31590]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. Some information about suspended officers is at present being obtained from the 43 police forces in England and Wales in response to a Question from another hon. Member. When that information has been collated, I will also provide that information to my 



<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 1998 : Column: 308</I><P>
hon. Friend. The cost of any suspension would depend on the rank of the officer and at what point on the relevant pay range he or she is being paid.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 No. This report was prepared at the request of the police authority who have yet to complete their consideration of it. My right hon. Friend is the appellate authority for police discipline and should not see any material which bears on possible disciplinary proceedings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_wqn3"><B> Gillian Merron: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to ensure that investigatory reports into the running of police authorities are made public.  [31587]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 There is a general requirement for reports by Commissioners for Local Administration into complaints of maladministration by police authorities to be made publicly available under the Local Government Act 1974. However, the Local Commissioner concerned may direct that a report shall not be made available to the public if the Commissioner considers that it would not be in the public interest and the interests of the complainant and others to do so.
<P>

<a name="80226w01.html_para1">The Government are considering extending the range of information available to the public generally. Our proposals were set out in the White Paper "Your Right to Know" which was issued for consultation on 11 December 1997.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_wqn4"><B> Gillian Merron: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many investigations have been undertaken by outside police authorities into other authorities in each of the past five years; and what was the estimated cost of each investigation.  [31592]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I am not aware of any such investigations in the last five years. Outside forces carry out investigations into other forces, usually at the request of the police authority for the force of being investigated or that force itself. However, comprehensive information on the number of any such investigations and on their cost is not held centrally.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_wqn5"><B> Gillian Merron: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the handling of grievances made by serving police officers, by police authorities; and what steps he intends to take to ensure that there is consistency across police authorities.  [31588]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The management of individual grievances and the provision of effective procedures is a matter for chief constables within the balance of tripartite responsibilities for the management of the police service. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary review police force personnel procedures as part of their Inspection 



<P>
<P><I>26 Feb 1998 : Column: 309</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what financial benefit would accrue to PA Consulting if the PFI contract for providing information technology services to his Department were to be awarded earlier than the proposed date in the current timetable.  [30283]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 PA Consulting have been engaged to provide independent professional advice so as to ensure that we achieve best value for money from the Private Finance Initiative (PFI) contract for information technology services. We are taking all necessary steps to avoid any potential conflict of interest. These include an agreement with PA Consulting that they will not take part in any consortium bidding for the PFI contract.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many doctors have been <i>(a)</i> prosecuted and <i>(b)</i> convicted since 1984 for assault arising from carrying out a cosmetic surgical procedure for which they were unqualified or were incompetent. [30387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Court proceedings information held centrally cannot identify such cases from other offences of assault. However, anyone who attempts to perform a cosmetic procedure, but who is not competent to do so, would expose himself to the risk of civil, and possibly criminal, liability, and to the possibility of professional proceedings for misconduct.
<P>

<a name="80226w01.html_para2">If criminal proceedings are brought for such an offence of assault then they may be instigated under either the more general legislative powers of the Offences Against the Persons Act 1861 (OAPA61) or the Medical Act 1983, section 49--pretending to be registered by taking name or title of a medical practitioner. We are aware of one prosecution in 1996 under the latter provision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_wqn8"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what powers he intends to give the proposed young offender teams; and if he will make a statement. [30290]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Youth offending teams will play a key role in working with young offenders in the community from point of arrest to completion of sentence. Under clause 30(6) of the Crime and Disorder Bill <i>[Lords],</i> youth offending teams will co-ordinate the provision in their area of the youth justice services set out in clause 29(3) and carry out the functions assigned to the team in the youth justice plan formulated by the local authority under clause 31(1).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if his Department possesses <i>(a)</i> water cannons and <i>(b)</i> equipment designed to be adapted into water cannons.  [31266]




<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Neither the Home Office nor police forces in England and Wales possess such equipment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what research he has commissioned on the <i>(a)</i> benefits and <i>(b)</i> disadvantages of replacing CS spray with sprays based on CR.  [31268]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Several possible incapacitant agents, including CR, were considered before CS sprays were adopted for police use. CR was rejected because not enough is known about its chronic health effects and its carcinogenic and genotoxic potential. It also poses particular problems in relation to decontamination because it retains its irritant characteristics in water. The simple decontamination procedures employed for CS involving the use of copious volumes of water would exacerbate the extent of contamination when used against CR.

<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the estimated cost to date of the police investigation into the alleged perjury of Mr. Jonathan Aitken.  [31081]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Commissioner informs me that approximately 61 officer days have been used so far. The nature of the inquiry has meant that it has not been possible to cost the police time more accurately. The Commissioner also tells me that the investigation is continuing and is being pursued as expeditiously as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how he plans to ensure that known football hooligans are prevented from travelling to France during the World Cup.  [31090]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government are determined to do everything possible to prevent the disruption of the World Cup by football hooligans. Offenders who have been convicted of a football-related offence and made subject to a restriction order by the court are required to attend a designated police station during the period in which matches are taking place. British police, including the Football Unit of the National Criminal Intelligence Service, have established a close working relationship with the French authorities. They will ensure that all relevant intelligence about the movement of potential troublemakers is made available to the French police so that those who might want to cause trouble are identified or monitored to prevent disorder occurring.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what is the anticipated average time for payment of compensation between the submission of a claim and its authorisation in respect of the handing in of .22 target pistols; and what has been the average time achieved to date for the payment of compensation; [31084]

<UL>(2) what is the total amount <i>(a)</i> claimed and <i>(b)</i> paid out to date under the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997; and what is the anticipated cost of administering the scheme in the first 12 months of operation.  [31079]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 As at 20 February 1998, a total of &#163;36.7 million had been paid under the statutory compensation scheme for large calibre handguns and the ex gratia payment scheme for small calibre pistols voluntarily surrendered. The total amount claimed will not be known until all claims and applications have been examined.
<P>

<a name="80226w02.html_para0">The average processing time for claims and ex gratia applications dealt with from the start of the scheme has been 13.8 weeks. It is not possible to say at this stage what the average processing time will be for claims under the new statutory surrender scheme for small-calibre pistols. Work will begin on these claims as soon as the overall work position permits.
<P>

<a name="80226w02.html_para1">The central administration costs of all three schemes in 1997-98 are &#163;6.4 million including &#163;3.4 million in direct grants to police forces in England, Wales and Scotland.

<P>
<a name="80226w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B>

Within that dialogue it agreed to continue to raise the cases of individuals, encourage Chinese engagement with the UN's human rights instruments and develop and expand the EU-China cooperation programme. It looked forward to an early and fruitful visit to China by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. In view of the first encouraging results of the EU/China human rights dialogue, the Council decided that neither the Presidency nor Member States should table or co-sponsor a draft Resolution at the next UN Commission on Human Rights (CHR). The EU's opening statement at CHR will refer to the human rights situation in China. If the situation arose, the Council agreed that EU delegations should vote against a no-action motion.

They want the definition to be broadened to include all products currently sold legally in the UK as 'yoghurt'. The Government fully support this approach.

[30944]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 No. Given the flexibility of the EC rules which apply to charges for veterinary inspections and controls, as well as likely differences in circumstances prevailing in other Member States, and differences in exchange rates, any such comparisons could be misleading, incomplete or inaccurate. As I explained in my previous reply on 12 February 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>373</i> it is the responsibility of the European Commission to ensure that individual Member States comply with their Community obligations.
<P>

<a name="80226w03.html_para5">So far as Great Britain is concerned, I am satisfied that the charges levied by the Meat Hygiene Service in respect of its hygiene inspection are consistent with EC rules, and with the objective that it delivers value for money in the provision of efficient and high quality services.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will assess the factors underlying the lack of correlation between retail prices and ex-farm prices of agricultural products over the last year.  [30836]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Agricultural raw material costs represent a small proportion of the retail value of most food products. Costs of manufacturing, marketing and distribution are collectively of greater importance. As a consequence, changes in ex-farm prices of agricultural commodities have only a small influence on retail food prices. In the short term, this relationship can be further weakened by a variety of factors which may delay the transmission of price changes through the marketing chain.

 The National CJD Surveillance Unit conducts an epidemiological analysis of CJD and nvCJD cases reported to it in the United Kingdom. This includes details of the diet and occupational history of patients and has shown no evidence of any link between any form of CJD and milk from cows with BSE.
<P>

<a name="80226w03.html_para6">It is also of note that in kuru, which is a form of CJD believed to be transmitted through cannibalistic practices in Papua New Guinea, there is no evidence of transmission from mother to child after cannibalism ceased. This includes instances where mothers showing clinical signs of the disease were suckling infants. Cows' milk from cattle with clinical BSE has been tested for the presence of infectivity by injection into the brain of mice and by feeding to mice and has not transmitted disease. As a precaution in 1988 one of the first steps taken was a prohibition on use of milk from clinical BSE cases other than for feeding her own calf.

<a name="80226w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The voluntary agreements on the use and emissions of hydrofluorocarbons concluded in 1996 between the Government and the five principal user-sectors were drawn up to help meet our original commitment under the Framework Convention on Climate Change to return emissions of greenhouse gases to 1990 levels by the year 2000. The agreements have been welcomed by industry and reviews of the first year of the impact have been completed. Although it is yet too early to assess the quantitative impact of the voluntary agreements, overall GWP-weighted emissions of hydrofluorocarbons from the UK are expected to fall by around 65 per cent. between 1990 and 2000. HFCs have now been included in the basket of gases for which legally binding targets for the period 2008 to 2012 were agreed in Kyoto. The Government will be consulting on means to achieve their target later this year.

 There is no specific definition of "brownfield" land but it is usually taken to mean land previously developed for urban uses. These uses include residential, transport and utilities, industry and commerce, community services, previously developed vacant land and derelict land. The table gives estimates for England of the percentage of new dwellings (excluding conversions) built on land that was previously developed for urban uses. It also shows the percentage of land for new housing that was previously developed. The figures are for each year from 1989 to 1995 (the most recent available).

Although they often identify a number of minor irregularities, these can generally be dealt with immediately or through normal maintenance procedures. Any irregularities found in ramp checks are drawn to the attention of the foreign aviation authority concerned. Where more serious problems are identified, aircraft are detained until the problems are solved, and, if necessary, permits for further flights by the airline are refused. The results of these checks were generally satisfactory and very few serious problems identified.

 The Civil Aviation Authority commissioned a four year research programme by the Cranfield Impact Centre. This study showed that forward facing child safety seats, secured by a static lap belt, could provide a higher level of protection for children between the ages of 6 months and 3 years than supplementary or lap belts. As a result, since August 1991 the CAA has allowed UK airlines to permit children within that age range to be carried in appropriate car type safety seats.

A copy of that letter has been placed in the Library. Among other things, that letter explains why he agreed with the independent Panel that held the Examination in Public that the Stevenage proposal represented the most sustainable solution to meeting housing need in the County, including in relation to transport infrastructure. It is now for the County to consider the various representations it has received on its proposed modifications. The Secretary of State retains his powers to direct modification or to call-in the plan up until the time it is adopted.

 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1998]:</i> The cases of life sentence prisoners in Northern Ireland are normally reviewed by the Life Sentence Review Board at the ten year point of sentence but in some cases this review can take place earlier where the individual circumstances warrant such action. The cases of those sentenced to be detained during the pleasure of the Secretary of State are normally considered at the eight year stage of sentence. Again this may be earlier where the circumstances of an individual case suggest that it would be appropriate.

<a name="80226w08.html_para5">There are no set criteria for life sentence reviews. Each case is considered on its own individual merits. However, before the Review Board will recommend to the Secretary of State that a provisional release date should be set, it must be satisfied that the offender has served a period sufficient to reflect the gravity of the offence and that release would not present an unacceptable risk to the public.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The maximum funding per participant on the Environmental Task Force within New Deal in Northern Ireland is &#163;1,300 which equates to a maximum weekly fee of &#163;50 for a 26 week placement. In addition, &#163;750 per participant is paid as a training fee.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>When determining the level of management fee applicable in Northern Ireland the Training and Employment Agency took into account its current experience of funding similar activity under Action for Community Employment (ACE) and the pilot Community Work Programme (CWP) and the existence of an infrastructure of voluntary/environmental groups already delivering Government funded programmes. The level of fee represents a significant enhancements on those paid within ACE and CWP. For comparison purposes the maximum funding in respect of 10 participants over a 26 week period is &#163;8,320 (CWP), &#163;10,218 (ACE) and &#163;20,500 (New Deal Environmental Task Force).</FONT></UL>

 Retirement Pension has been paid on a weekly basis since it was introduced in 1948. We have no plans to change the basis for payment, although we have, of course, promised to consider all representations on the future of the basic State pension received as part of the Pensions Review.

 I understand that, during the initial unfurling of the roof fabric for the Millennium Dome, which will account for only 10 per cent. of the roof installation schedule, there will be a 12 mph wind speed restriction. For the remainder of the operation, work can be carried out safely in wind speeds of up to 35 mph. The installation of the roof fabric is planned to start in April 1998, with a strict safety regime in place. Throughout the construction of the Dome, the New Millennium Experience Company's contractors will work closely with the HSE to ensure that the highest safety standards are applied to working practices in all weather conditions.

To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will make a statement on the age of retirement in the Civil Service; and to what extent <i>(a)</i> policy and <i>(b)</i> the guidelines issued vary between Departments.  [31107]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w11.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 The minimum retirement age for civil servants (i.e. the earliest age at which they can retire with full superannuation benefits) is 60 and staff have a right to retire then. However, government departments and agencies are free to set the normal retirement age for their own staff (i.e. the age at which they have to retire). This can be above 60. Departments and agencies must ensure that they apply their policy consistently to all staff at broadly the same level and they must be satisfied that staff retained beyond age 60 meet the normal standards of health and efficiency. In making such decisions, they will take into account all relevant factors such as the needs of management, present availability of staff and projected staffing requirements.
<P>

<a name="80226w11.html_para4">This policy is set out in Section 11.3 of the Civil Service Management Code, which sets the regulations and instructions to all departments and agencies regarding the terms and conditions of service of civil servants. Since departments and agencies can determine their own age retirement policies, some variation may occur, but must remain consistent with the Code.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w11.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 In England and Wales, there are currently 16.5 million registered titles out of an estimated total of some 22 million. The number of registered titles increases each year through the compulsory provisions which requires the registration of all conveyances and transfers of freehold land, and land held under leases for a term of more than 21 years. From 1 April 1998, the Land Registration Rules 1997 will extend the compulsory 'triggers' to include assents, vesting deeds, conveyances by way of gift, conveyances pursuant to a court order and first legal mortgages. This will accelerate the increase in the number of registered titles. However, land on which there is no change of ownership (such as that held by local authorities) may not be registered at all unless a voluntary application is made. It is, therefore, not possible to make any prediction on when all land in England and Wales will be registered.

<a name="80226w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Galbraith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 February 1998]:</i> The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) Health Variations Programme of interdisciplinary research aims to improve understanding of the health inequalities which currently exist between socio-economic groups in the UK. The Programme has two Phases, and 13 projects are underway in Phase 1.
<P>

<a name="80226w12.html_para0">The 2 projects which are being taken forward at the University of Bristol focus on housing and community health, and on methods for studying socio-economic position and health in different ethnic groups. Both projects are ongoing. Their findings will contribute to the research outcome of the overall Programme scheduled for completion in 2001. Thereafter, ESRC will undertake an assessment of the Programme to which the UK health departments will have access.
<P>

<a name="80226w12.html_para1">The work of the ESRC in the area of health inequalities is welcome and will inform the Government's continuing policies for tackling health inequalities, a task to which they have given their full commitment.

[31392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The decision to end pre-school education vouchers has not in itself had any effect on revenue support grant for individual authorities. All grant funding for the education of children in the pre-school year under the Education (Scotland) Act 1996 will continue in 1998-99 to be outside Aggregate External Finance. However, &#163;13.6 million has been transferred from AEF into the pre-school education grant programme in 1998-99 to prevent the double funding of local authorities for pre-school education places.

<P>

<a name="80226w13.html_para3">I took this opportunity to explain briefly to colleagues my intention to attend the EMI Council on 3 March, and to remind Ministers of the importance of ensuring compatibility of national legislation with the Treaty requirements for EMU. I also notified colleagues of my intention to organise a meeting with the Social Partners on the wider implications of the single currency around the 19 May ECOFIN.
<P>

<a name="80226w13.html_para4">It was agreed that the Commission should examine the possibility of arrangements enabling the European Investment Bank to lend to Bosnia and to report back to the Council.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 The Government are keen to see PPPs develop between public corporations and the private sector, thereby accessing private sector expertise and finance to improve public services. The potential additional resources that could be addressed in this way will depend on the form of such partnerships.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w13.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 A penalty charge is incurred for the late filing of a return, not for a dishonoured cheque. But any taxpayer whose cheque is returned unpaid may be charged interest on the tax due until such time as payment is made in an acceptable form.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the workings of the PFI rules in the case of London and Continental Railways and the Channel Tunnel Rail Link; and what plans he has to review those rules.  [30938]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 The Channel Tunnel Rail Link project's difficulties are largely due to the unrealistic assumptions made by the London and Continental Railways' management about the Eurostar business in its bid, which should have been recognised by the last Government, but was not. As a result, this project is facing particular financial problems that are not relevant to other PFI deals.
<P>

<a name="80226w13.html_para6">With regard to PFI more generally, this Government commissioned an independent review of the policy as soon as they took office, and are currently in the process of implementing the 29 recommendations that resulted. I have every confidence that the new structures, processes and guidance we are putting in place will lead to increasing numbers of PFI contracts being signed, representing value for money for the taxpayer and welcome business for the private sector.

[31221]<P>

 VAT legislation in European Community is subject to the unanimous agreement of all 15 Member States under Article 99 of the Treaty. The Schengen Agreement does not affect this requirement.

 The Tax Law Rewrite project aims to bring clarity to our direct tax legislation, making the tax system more accessible to taxpayers and their advisers. The project is continuing to make good progress. The publication today of a second Technical Discussion Document, which takes forward the debate on 'purposive drafting', is a further milestone towards a clearer and more user-friendly tax system. Copies of the document have been placed in the Libraries of the House. 'Purposive drafting' describes a variety of techniques for making the underlying purpose of a block of legislation clearer to the reader.
<P>

<a name="80226w14.html_para0">I am keen that anyone with an interest takes this opportunity to comment on the role purposive techniques might play in rewriting tax legislation. The Government believe consultation with all those involved in taxation is the key to the success of the project to rewrite tax law. The publication of this document does not necessarily mean that the project will employ any of the approaches described in it. But we will keep the matter under review.

We have made &#163;50 million available to the Out of School Childcare Initiative over the next five years; in 1998-99 this will create 20,000 new places.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will issue guidance to education authorities and governing bodies concerning the purchase of British beef; and if he will make a statement.  [29913]<P>

<P>
<a name="80226w15.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I see no reason to issue further guidance. Responsibility for determining the content of school meals rests with LEAs and the governing bodies of grant maintained schools. Measures are in place to ensure that beef that is legally supplied for catering purposes should pose no risk to health.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment by what percentage he estimates real expenditure per pupil in Worcestershire will change in the next financial year; and if he will make a statement.  [29914]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w15.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The real terms change in the level of expenditure per pupil in Worcestershire depends on budget decisions taken by the County Council. Worcestershire's education SSA for 1998-99 represents an increase of some &#163;7 million or 3.9 per cent. in cash terms after allowing for the effects of local government reorganisation.

 Information about the local education authority area from which assisted pupils originate is not collected centrally. There are no schools participating in the assisted places scheme in the North Lincolnshire LEA area. Two schools participate in the East Riding of Yorkshire LEA area with 196 assisted pupils the current academic year 1997-98 and an estimated 166 assisted pupils at the start of the next academic year 1998-99.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is his policy on surplus places in schools; and if he will publish the numbers and percentages of surplus places in each local education authority in England.  [32053]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80226w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The focus of all our policies is raising standards. Surplus school places represent a poor use of resources, particularly where schools with surplus places are performing poorly or where parental preference is not being met elsewhere in the authority. The supply of, and demand for, places must be brought more closely into balance so that parental preference can be maximised and good quality education can be provided in the most cost-effective manner. The Audit Commission has drawn attention to this issue and, with District Auditors, is promoting good practice. Authorities should review their performance and, in line with Audit Commission recommendations, should focus initially on schools with 25 per cent. or more surplus places, having particular regard to standards at those schools.
<P>

<a name="80226w16.html_para0">The annual survey of surplus places provides the Department with an opportunity to monitor action by each authority. In the light of results of the 1997 survey, we will be writing to all local education authorities with schools with high levels of surplus, and the Funding Agency for Schools, asking for a detailed response on the justification for continuing to maintain such schools, particularly where performance is poor and there is evidence that parental preference for school places is not being met elsewhere in the authority. The Department recognises that authorities will want to take into account any unusual circumstances, for example geography and social make-up.
<P>

<a name="80226w16.html_para1">The following tables relate to the position as at January 1997 and set out the numbers of surplus places by local authority area, separately for primary and for secondary, together with the proportion that these represent of total capacity. In line with the approach we will be taking, they also include the numbers of schools which at that date had a surplus of 25 per cent. or more, and at least 30 surplus places, together with the proportion that these represent of the total number of schools. The data are drawn from the returns made during 1997 by local education authorities in respect of their schools and by the Funding Agency for Schools in respect of grant-maintained schools in stage 2 and 3 authority areas. Data on surplus places in the 376 grant-maintained schools in stage 1 authorities are not available. These returns indicate that there were just under 774,000 surplus school places in January 1997, representing 10 per cent. of the total capacity of 7.6 million places. There were also 2,696 schools with

<P><I>26 Feb 1998 : Column: 365</I><P>
surplus of 25 per cent. or more and at least 30 surplus places, representing 12 per cent. of the total number of schools.

(19) Actual surplus is defined as the difference between capacity and number on roll for all schools where capacity exceeds number on roll.<P>

(20) Schools with less than 30 surplus places are not included.<P>

(21) Secondary surplus figures for Hammersmith and Fulham do not take account of pupils registered at some secondary schools but who attend solely the William Morris Academy, which falls outside the scope of the return. To include such pupils would understate the surplus place position in the schools covered by the return.<P>

(22) Stage 1 = LEA has sole responsibility for planning the supply of school places.<P>

Stage 2 = LEA and the Funding Agency for Schools share responsibility for planning the supply of school places.<P>

<a name="80226w17.html_para4">Information on the number of employees in employment in the film industry is available only for some of the last 10 years because the data source, the Census of Employment, was run on a biennial basis until 1995: it then became the Annual Employment Survey.
<P>

<a name="80226w17.html_para5">Changes in Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) mean that the information for September 1991 onwards, based on SIC 1992, is not directly comparable with the information for earlier years which is based on SIC 1980.
