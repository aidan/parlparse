To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when the results of the Institute of Advanced Legal Studies hypothetical exercise on fast track costs will be published; and if he will make a statement.  [26255]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I expect to publish the research in conjunction with a consultation paper on costs in the fast track after Easter.

<P>
<a name="80204w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department which firms are participating in the KPMG research on legal services without the benefit of legal aid; when the research will be published; and if he will make a statement.  [26256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 A number of firms were randomly selected to be consulted by KPMG in the preparation of the business case for a solicitor's firm to undertake money claims under conditional fee agreements without requiring their clients to pay money in advance. The firms were asked to participate in strict confidence and I cannot, therefore, name them.
<P>

<a name="80204w01.html_para0">When KPMG's report has been received, a decision will be taken about publication.

<P>
<a name="80204w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will review the statutory time limit on the right of mortgagors to pursue shortfall debts after judgment.  [27423]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government do not intend to conduct a separate review of the statutory time limit applicable to mortgage debts. A comprehensive review of the law of limitation periods has already been undertaken by the Law Commission, with a view to simplification and rationalisation of the law. In January this year, the Commission published a Consultation Paper seeking the views of interested parties on its provisional proposals for reform. We will consider the recommendations made when the Law Commission completes its Report. The Government do not plan to modify the law relating to limitation of actions before then.

obtained through the exercise of compulsory powers having regard to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in Saunders v. United Kingdom.  [27920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The Government propose to bring forward legislation when a suitable opportunity arises to ensure that the domestic law which was in issue in Saunders v. United Kingdom is fully compatible with our obligations under the European convention on human rights. As an interim measure, I have today promulgated to prosecuting authorities guidance about the handling of cases where the evidence available to the prosecution includes answers obtained by the exercise of compulsory powers.
<P>

<a name="80204w01.html_para2">A copy of the Guidance has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Its effect is that answers obtained pursuant to a procedure which includes the power to compel answers, whatever the investigative or regulatory regime, cannot be used in subsequent criminal proceedings as part of the prosecution case except for the very limited purposes of proceedings for offences arising out of the giving of the evidence (eg. perjury). The Guidance therefore covers not only evidence obtained by the exercise of powers under Section 434 of the Companies Act 1985, which was in issue in Saunders v. the UK, but also evidence obtained under analogous powers. In addition, the guidance restricts the use by prosecutors of compulsorily acquired answers for the purpose of cross-examination.
<P>

<a name="80204w01.html_para3">The Lord Advocate is to issue similar guidance in Scotland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 As I set out in the Press Notice I released on 30 July, having received the network of Green Ministers following the Election, we gave them the following powers and responsibilities:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>they now support the Cabinet Committee on the Environment (ENV) chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister;</FONT></UL>

<P><I>4 Feb 1998 : Column: 641</I><P>
railway stations are unstaffed overnight; and if he has any plans to require railway stations to be staffed at night. [26244]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w01.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Comprehensive details of station staffing are not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. All train operating companies are signatories to the industry wide Ticketing and Settlement Agreement (TSA) which includes the ticket office opening hours for staffed stations. Operators' licences and the franchise agreements require compliance with the TSA. The TSA specifies 14 stations where ticket offices are open for 24 hours a day. There are no requirements on operators to staff areas of stations other than the ticket offices specified in the TSA. The Government's proposals for the long term reform of the railways will be set out in our White Paper to be published later in the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government encourage development and re-use of brownfield sites in the North West region principally through the application of Regional Planning Guidance (RPG13) which informs the production of development plans within the region.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w01.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Following a report by a member of the public of a fish kill in Hoghton Bottoms on 24 January, the Environment Agency undertook an investigation and confirmed the kill, the location of which has been identified as a point immediately downstream of industrial premises. The reaction of the fish indicates that they were killed by toxic material but the Agency is carrying out a full investigation to identify the nature and source of the incident. On completion of that investigation, the Agency will consider further action and will issue a statement.

<a name="80204w01.html_para5">Following the European Commission's presentation at the last Environment Council, we look forward to seeing the formal proposals for revision of this Directive, and hope to have a preliminary discussion of this at the June Environment Council. I shall be pressing for ethical and wider public interest considerations to be taken properly into account in authorisation procedures.

<a name="80204w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 There is no specific definition of brown-field land but it is usually taken to mean land previously developed for urban uses. These uses include residential, transport and utilities, industry and commerce, community services, previously developed vacant land and derelict land. The table gives estimates for England of the proportion of land for new housing that was previously developed for urban uses, for each year from 1985 (the earliest available) to 1995. The average figure for the period was 42 per cent.

<a name="80204w03.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Motor Cars (Driving Instruction) (Appeals) Rules 1969 provide for the Secretary of State to appoint an appeal board to hear cases brought by driving instructors who fail a check-test, and that the board report their findings and make recommendations to him. Schedule 3 to the Road Traffic Act 1988 provides that the members of such an appeals board must be independent of the Department.
<P>

<a name="80204w03.html_para0">In practice, the board submits a report to the Chief Executive of the Driving Standards Agency, who is authorised to issue a decision only in accordance with the report's recommendation. If he does not accept the board's recommendations, the case is decided by

However, my Department has recently commissioned a research project to look at the way driving instructors are trained and tested. I will look carefully at any conclusions, including those relevant to appeals procedures, when the findings are available in two to three years' time.

 The Government do not produce projections of new housing as such. Strategic Guidance for London Planning Authorities (RPG3), published in May 1996, included a London-wide figure of 234,100 households as the minimum level of housing to be provided over the period 1992-2006. This figure is broken down by Borough, but not by tenure or source of provision. RPG3 also indicates that it is for Boroughs to assess housing need in their area, including affordable housing need, and then to set out strategic policies in their Unitary Development Plans indicating how this need will be met over the plan period.

 The current legal drink-drive limits for the member states of the European Community, defined as milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood, are listed in the table. A number of member states are likely to reduce their limit from 80 to 50mg per 100ml in the near future. The Danish Parliament has passed the necessary legislation but not yet brought it into force; in Germany, legislation is currently before the Federal Parliament and we understand that Spain is also considering such a reduction.

 Factors that determine the destructive effect of a nuclear weapon are: the yield and design of the weapon; the accuracy of the delivery system; the nature and construction of the target; the geographical characteristics of the surrounding terrain; geological conditions in the target area; the height of weapon burst; the weather conditions at the target. The United Kingdom would only ever contemplate the use of nuclear weapons in extreme circumstances of self-defence.

 We are looking for constructive and open partnerships with Governments overseas.

Instead, we will focus our support on those within government and civil society who are working for change.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 While access to safe water supply has increased steadily over the last 25 years, adequate sanitation coverage in developing countries has remained roughly constant with more than half the population lacking the most basic provision. The health implications are severe; there are more than 3.3 million deaths each year due to diarrhoea, most of these are children under five. This equates to one child dying every ten seconds.
<P>

<a name="80204w05.html_para0">We welcome the new emphasis being put on sanitation and hygiene awareness by the World Health Organisation, UNICEF and others. My Department is fully behind this initiative. This year we have agreed to provide an additional one million pounds to UNICEF for water and sanitation projects in Africa. Our expenditure on water and sanitation is increasing but we do need to put more emphasis on sanitation. New guidance on water and sanitation programmes, which stresses the importance of integrating water, sanitation and hygiene education, is under preparation. These efforts directly support the achievement of the goals of the World Summit for Children relating to providing universal access to safe sanitation.

 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1998]:</i> I decided to replace Miss Anne Bullen as my Diary Secretary when it became apparent that we could not establish a relationship of trust and that I could not have confidence in her. It would not have been appropriate, in those circumstances, for her to have continued to work in my office. Miss Bullen ceased to work as my Diary Secretary on 27 June, but her contract was not terminated. She was paid up to its expiry on 7 November.

 We are appalled at the reports of the atrocities committed by the Lords Resistance Army (LRA) against the Acholi people in the north of Uganda. We condemn these atrocities unreservedly. We recognise the right of the Government of Uganda to conduct legitimate security operations to protect its people from LRA terrorism, provided that these operations are conducted with due respect for internationally recognised standards for human rights. We believe there is not a purely military solution to the problems of northern Uganda. At a meeting with President Museveni in June 1997, the Minister of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Manchester, Central (Mr. Lloyd), urged him to pursue opportunities for dialogue as a means of ending the conflict. We repeated this message in bilateral contacts with the Ugandans during the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in October 1997. The President has since announced an intention to table legislation which would permit an amnesty for anti-government forces that lay down their weapons. We welcome such a step which could be a valuable contribution to encouraging a peaceful end to the conflict.

<P>
<a name="80204w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 As for all other EU Member States, trade relations between the UK and Poland are governed by the EU/Poland Europe Agreement. The Agreement provides the framework for Poland's gradual integration into the EU. The trade provisions of the Agreement have been in force since March 1992.
<P>

<a name="80204w07.html_para3">Under the terms of the Agreement, the EU and Poland will gradually establish a free trade area, within a ten year period, and in accordance with the provisions of the World Trade Organisation (WTO). The Agreement is subject to periodic examination by the WTO's Committee on Regional Trade Agreements.
<P>

<a name="80204w07.html_para4">Tariffs are being dismantled asymmetrically, reflecting the different levels of economic development of the two parties. While Poland has until the end of 1999 to abolish tariffs on EU industrial products, Polish goods already enter the EU duty free.
<P>

<a name="80204w07.html_para5">Trade in agricultural products is subject to different arrangements, based on increasing mutual concessions on a product-by-product basis.
<P>

<a name="80204w07.html_para6">The Department attaches considerable importance to the strict implementation of the provisions of the Europe Agreement in order to reduce the barriers to trade between the UK and Poland. This is essential in order to assist Poland with the completion of its economic transition and its preparations for accession to the EU.

A final account is not yet available for the remedial work which commenced in 1997 supported by the award of a further grant of &#163;101,190. However, the tender cost indicates that the comparable cost of lime harling is &#163;25,644. No estimate was made of the cost of including cement in the lime harl mix as this was considered an inappropriate material on the very soft original sandstone walling of this building.

<a name="80204w09.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has to regularise the availability of concessions on television licences in relation to second homes which are <i>(a)</i> mobile caravans, <i>(b)</i> static caravans and <i>(c)</i> dwellings; and if he will make a statement.  [25755]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 Under the current television licence fee regulations, a licence for a person's main address also covers the installation and use of television in a vehicle, vessel or touring caravan and, provided that there is no simultaneous use at the licensed address, in a static caravan. If television is installed in a permanent structure second home, a separate licence is required. The Government have no plans to change these arrangements.
<P>

<a name="80204w09.html_para2">However, the Government's Agreement with the BBC provides for a review of the arrangements for funding the BBC after 2002. The Government intend to conduct such a review well before that date and to include in that review a detailed consideration of the question of concessions.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if he will authorise the introduction of television licences <i>(a)</i> with a monthly or quarterly validity, and <i>(b)</i> with a monthly refund of unexpired time; and if he will make a statement.  [25756]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 The Government have no plans to introduce short term licences. The licence fee is a payment for permission to use television at a particular address rather than for a service provided. It is payable in full, regardless of the amount of television watched or the length of time for which the licence is required. Even if this were not so, the administrative costs of issuing short term licences and checking that use ceased at the appropriate time would be considerable, and could well require a corresponding increase in the licence fee.
<P>

<a name="80204w09.html_para3">Responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system, including the determination of refund policy, rests with the BBC. At present, refunds are available for full, unexpired quarters of the validity of a licence. In setting its refund policy, the BBC has considered the administrative costs and the interests of all licence fee payers.

<a name="80204w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 Ticketing for the 1998 World Cup Finals is a matter for the football authorities. I understand that 60 per cent. of tickets have been allocated to the French domestic market, 20 per cent. to FIFA approved travel agencies, and 20 per cent. to FIFA itself. Most of the tickets earmarked for FIFA for each game will be allocated to supporters of the competing countries' teams. I am concerned about inadequacy of World Cup tickets and have discussed this with the FA. I know that both it and the Scottish Football Association are doing everything that they can in making representations to FIFA to maximise the number of World Cup tickets available for English and Scottish supporters. The Government will continue to support the FA in its efforts to secure additional tickets.

Procedures for awarding licences are set out in the Broadcasting Act 1990. Under the terms of that Act, the licence for a particular area must normally be granted to the highest bidder, and the Commission must include in the terms of the licence, and thereafter enforce, the undertakings made by the successful applicant on the timing and coverage of the services provided.

<a name="80204w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Public funds have been used to carry out a number of activities arising directly from the beef export ban including: the introduction of legislation and enforcement arrangements to prohibit exports and to control permitted exports; the preparation of the ECJ case questioning the legality for the ban; and the development of proposals for the gradual removal of the ban. These activities involve a number of Government Departments and Ministers and it is not possible separately to identify costs associated with this work. Government expenditure on BSE related measures over the period 1996-97 to 1999-2000 is forecast to be around &#163;3.7 billion.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will estimate the amount of regulatory costs experienced by British beef producers which is not experienced by producers in other parts of the EU.  [25239]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> There are currently no direct regulatory costs borne by British beef producers which are not experienced by producers in other parts of the EU. However inspection charges at slaughterhouses and cutting plants, in relation to the removal of Specified Risk material, will be introduced on 1 April, and are expected to cost the industry up to a maximum of &#163;48 million in a full year. The cost to producers of a cattle passport under the new cattle tracing system is expected to be in the range of &#163;5 to &#163;10: but the UK is not unique in charging producers for cattle tracing. Although it impacts on the meat industry as a whole, the removal of subsidy paid to renderers since March 1996 (worth &#163;96 million in a full year) will have significant effect on beef producers. These costs do not generally arise in other Member States because they do not experience the same high incidence of BSE as the UK. Even if they do, it is not clear whether the costs are charged to the industries concerned.

<a name="80204w12.html_para2">The MHS are required to consult with industry whenever it is proposed to change the rates (normally annually). Consultation has begun for the rates to apply for 1998-99. In addition, the Ministry has begun consultation with industry representatives on proposals to amend the Meat (Hygiene, Inspection and Examinations for Residues) (Charges) Regulations 1995 which lay down the framework for harmonised hygiene charges, as required by EC rules. Consultation is also about to begin on the proposal to require the cost of MHS enforcement of Specified Risk Material controls to be charged to industry from 1 April 1998. For both proposals a Regulatory Appraisal will be prepared and presented to Parliament assessing the impact, including cost, on the industry. Representative organisations will have an opportunity to comment, and contribute to, the draft Regulatory Appraisals during the consultations.

 We are still considering what role the EU's early retirement scheme might play in the Government's long term objectives of restructuring the livestock sector. The industry will be fully consulted when we have developed our thoughts on the restructuring plan.

<a name="80204w13.html_para0">Our initial thoughts are that any early retirement scheme would be open to beef and sheep producers. The number who could apply for such a scheme cannot be determined until the basic eligibility criteria have been set.

 This letter--and a number of others I have received from right hon. and hon.

The Government's attitude to such a measure was made clear in a debate in the House of Lords on 26 January: I am therefore now in a position to reply to the right hon. Gentleman's letter of 28 November and to the other letters we have received on the subject.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (1) if he will seek to prevent applicant countries for membership of the EU from enjoying the right to fish in EU waters other than EU waters for which they already have fishing rights after they have been accepted as members of the European Union;  [26566]

<a name="80204w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The terms of access to EU waters for fishing by new Member States are subject to negotiation and will be included in their respective Accession Treaties. The Government will aim to ensure that the fishing quotas within EU waters allocated to new Member States on accession are for the areas and stocks for which they already have fishing rights. This is consistent with the established principle of relative stability.

 Beef consumption varies seasonally and in response to many factors so the effect of any single action is unlikely to be identified separately. However, the vast majority of letters received about the ban have justifiably expressed continuing confidence in British Beef.

 Schools educational projects are funded by the European Union's SOCRATES programme, which is administered in the UK by the Central Bureau for Educational Visits and Exchanges. In 1997 the UK's allocation was 5.3 Mecu (&#163;3.7 million). This enabled 1,681 UK schools to participate in transnational partnership projects. In addition 4,572 head teachers and teachers received funding to update or diversify their foreign language teaching skills; to make study visits; to make project planning visits to schools, or to receive in-service teacher training.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has made no such assessment. The Jean Monnet Project is implemented by the European Commission without direct involvement on the part of EU Member States.

<a name="80204w14.html_para10"><i>Letter from Peter Mathison to Mr. David Rendel, dated 3 February 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to respond to your recent Parliamentary Questions about the Benefit Integrity Project (BIP).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BIP is looking again at designated Disability Living Allowance (DLA) awards. Information is gathered on a questionnaire designed to provide a full picture of a person's care and mobility needs. Those receiving the higher rate of the mobility component combined with the highest rate of the care component are visited by a specially trained visiting officer while those receiving the higher rate of the mobility component combined with the middle rate of the care component are sent a questionnaire by post. If the information provided suggests that a change of circumstances has occurred which may affect entitlement to benefit the case is passed to an independent Adjudication Officer (AO) for review. Reviews are carried out under adjudication rules which apply to all DLA awards.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Some awards in the designated categories will expire during the period of the BIP. When a short-term award of DLA is approaching its renewal date a renewal claim form is sent to the recipient. It would clearly be inappropriate to require completion of a BIP questionnaire as well. So, in renewal cases AOs have been advised that the integrity of the benefit should be secured by seeking further evidence from the most appropriate source. When the completed form is returned and medical evidence has been obtained the claim is passed to the AO to determine--as if it were a new claim to benefit.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As at 31 December 1997, the BIP had examined 40,615 cases of which 25,638 were postal enquiries, 7,515 were visits and 7,462 cases had been dealt with on renewal. Of the total cases dealt with 7,717 have had benefit reduced/stopped, 978 have had benefit increased and 31,920 have been unchanged.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Of 33,153 cases dealt with by post or by visit, 4,365 have had benefit reduced/stopped, 736 have had benefit increased and 28,052 have remained unchanged.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Of the 7,462 cases dealt with on renewal, 3,352 have had benefit reduced/stopped, 242 have had benefit increased and 3,868 have remained unchanged.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Decisions about entitlement to DLA are made by independent AOs. The first recourse of a person who is dissatisfied with an AO's decision is to ask for a review by a different AO. If the person remains dissatisfied they have the right of appeal to an independent Appeal Tribunal. Cases examined as part of the BIP are subject to the same rules as any other DLA case.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Data is not available on the number of people who have asked for a review of the AOs decision. However at 31 December 1997, of 4,365 cases dealt with by post or visit which have had benefit reduced or stopped, 842 requests for review have been cleared of which 174 have had their benefit increased, and of 3,352 cases dealt with on renewal which have had benefit reduced or stopped, 525 requests for review have been cleared of which 120 have had their benefit increased.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As at 31 December 1997, 311 Appeals have been received but no cases have been heard by the Independent Tribunal Service. Appeals data cannot be broken down further until the outcome of the appeal is known.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BIP was set up in response to the recent Benefit Review of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) which found that as much as 0.5 billion a year, in DLA, may be being paid to people who are not entitled to receive it. The purpose of the project is to update the information held for DLA customers. Over the next two years, specially trained staff will make enquiries by postal questionnaire or home visit in over 400,000 cases to establish whether DLA is paid correctly.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BIP obtains an up to date statement of a person's circumstances by post or at a visit. All the information gathered is recorded on form DLA 250, which was reviewed by groups of disabled people and their representatives in June 1997. Form DLA 250 is based on the standard DLA claim form.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As at 30 November 1997, of the 27,511 cases looked at the percentage which have not been changed at all is 84.9%. The percentage of cases where the care component has not been changed is 85.3%. This similarity reflects the relatively small proportion of cases which have been changed. The percentage of awards reduced from higher rate care to medium rate care is 1.1%, to lower rate is 0.3% and to nil rate 0.6%. The percentage of awards reduced from middle rate to lower rate is 3.1% and from middle rate to nil rate is 7.1%.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Approximately 40 cases have been referred to a fraud officer as a result of BIP activity. DLA is no different to any other benefit and we will prosecute if that is the appropriate action.</FONT></UL>

These are staff with a background in benefits administration who have also undertaken visits on a range of benefits on behalf of the DOs. Before undertaking any BIP visits all visiting staff, including those in Wales, received a specially designed five day training course, which included sessions on the background to DLA, an opportunity to practice visiting and interviewing skills, an explanation of how to deal with difficult situations and a session delivered by the Disablement Income Group on the special considerations which need to be borne in mind when visiting disabled people.</FONT></UL>

 The Benefit Integrity Project is a discrete exercise involving people with certain awards of Disability Living Allowance. It is designed to collect accurate, up-to-date information about beneficiaries' care and mobility needs through a programme of home visits and postal enquiries extending over two or so years. It makes sense that we periodically check that people are getting the right money. This sort of inquiry is routine in other benefits such as Income Support, Invalid Care Allowance and Jobseeker's Allowance.

From April 1997 the IS lone parent premium was replaced by the higher rate of family premium for lone parents. The figure provided for the family premium (lone parent) does not include those lone parent customers who are pensioners nor those registered sick who qualify for a higher rate premium such as a pensioner or disability premium.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what the state pension for <i>(a)</i> a single person and <i>(b)</i> a couple will be in 1998-99; what it would have been in 1998-99 if the pension had been uprated by the higher of the retail prices index or earnings; and what estimate he has made of (i) the gross additional costs of such increases in pension and (ii) the net cost after savings in (1) means-tested benefits and (2) increased Treasury receipts from income tax.  [25300]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The value of the standard rate of basic State Retirement Pension in 1998-99 will be &#163;64.70 for a single pensioner under 80, and &#163;103.40 for a pensioner couple under 80. If uprated by annual growth in the Average Earnings Index (whole economy) to September 1997 the rates would be &#163;65.05 and &#163;103.95 respectively.
<P>

<a name="80204w16.html_para0">The estimated additional cost for uprating contributory Retirement Pension and all linked benefits by earnings would be &#163;200 million. The net costs after savings in means-tested benefits would be &#163;150 million. It is only possible to estimate the extra receipts from income tax in respect of Retirement Pension and not the linked benefits. The net cost after doing so is &#163;130 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will include in her spending reviews consideration of a free contribution credit for workers with earnings below the lower earnings limit for <i>(a)</i> statutory maternity pay, <i>(b)</i> contributing jobseekers and <i>(c)</i> basic retirement pension; and if she will estimate the spending consequences of the introduction of such credits.

 The Comprehensive Spending Review demonstrates that the Government are committed to a far-reaching overhaul of the Social Security system that will modernise the welfare state and prepare it to meet the challenges of the 21st century. Based on our clear objectives of promoting work incentives, reducing poverty and welfare dependency and strengthening community and family life, the review is examining the purpose and nature of each major component of the system. The review is not due to complete its work until the summer and no options have been ruled in or out at this point. It is still too soon to anticipate the outcome.
<P>

<a name="80204w17.html_para2">Class 1 National Insurance contribution credits may assist people to qualify for basic Retirement Pension and contributions-based Jobseeker's Allowance. These credits are currently available to people with earnings below the lower earnings limit who work for less than 16 hours a week and are available for and actively seeking employment or who are receiving Disability Working Allowance or Invalid Care Allowance. Class 3 credits are available to those receiving Family Credit to help them qualify for basic Retirement Pension. Those caring for a severely disabled person or receiving Child Benefit may also be eligible for Home Responsibilities Protection, which reduces the number of qualifying years of paid or credited contributions required for a basic Retirement Pension.
<P>

<a name="80204w17.html_para3">Statutory Maternity Pay is paid by employers to employees who on average, had weekly earnings at or above the lower earnings limit who had been continuously employed for at least 26 weeks up to the 15th week before their baby is expected.

<i>Notes:</i> 1. The figures are based on information from the 1995-96 Family Resources Survey (FRS). The 1995-96 survey is the latest for which data are available. 2. The estimates are based on sample counts which have been adjusted for non-response using multi-purpose grossing factors which control for region, Council Tax Band and a number of demographic variables. Estimates are subject to sampling error and to variability in non response. 3. Estimates are based on the distribution of gross earnings of all individual employees with non-zero earnings (not including the self-employed). 4. Proportion of earnings spent on occupational pensions includes contributions (including additional voluntary contributions) made by individuals, but does not include any contribution to occupational pensions made by the employer. 5. The figures for National Insurance are net of any contracted-out rebates. The figures for occupational pensions are the amounts the employee actually pays. <P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w18.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 This Government are committed to the introduction of a Freedom of Information Act. I recently published "Your Right to Know"--a White Paper--which set out our proposals for such an Act, and on which I have invited the public's views. The White Paper will be followed, later this year, by the publication of a draft Bill for further public consultation.
<P>

<a name="80204w18.html_para0">We have already taken a number of concrete steps to promote greater openness in government. These include, for example, the requirement for all National Health Service Trusts to hold their meetings in public, and all executive and advisory Quangos to produce and make publicly available annual reports.

<P>
<a name="80204w18.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Rhodri Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster when he will publish the factual and background material relevant to the production of the White Paper, 'Your Right to Know', promised in his oral statement of 11 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1184.  [27985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w18.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 I have today published a document containing substantial factual and background information which contributed to the formulation of the Government's proposals set out in "Your Right to Know: Freedom of Information". Copies have been placed in the Library of the House. As with the White Paper itself, the document will shortly be published on the Internet, on the Cabinet Office (Freedom of Information Unit) home page: http://www.open.gov.uk/m-of-g/foihome.htm.
<P>

<a name="80204w18.html_para1">The document is based on material in the papers submitted to the Cabinet Sub-Committee, CRP(FOI), which was established to work on Freedom of Information policy. As such it reflects, in addition to straightforward factual and statistical information, many of the arguments, ideas and proposals expressed in the general debates about openness and Freedom of Information in recent years. Obviously, these contributed to the formulation of the Government's policy on FOI set out in "Your Right to Know": but they do not in themselves constitute Government policy, and should not be interpreted as doing so. Inevitably, some of them were taken up and developed further, and feature in "Your Right to Know"; others do not. Nevertheless, I hope that the document will both contribute generally to our policy of open government and, in particular, will be helpful to those who wish to take up the Government's invitation to submit their comments and views on "Your Right to Know".

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 1998]:</i> Charities contribute a great deal to society and this is reflected in their favourable tax treatment. However, the system can be complex and charities have for some time called for a review to reduce the administrative burden on them, freeing them to concentrate on their charitable activities. That is why the Chancellor announced a review of the taxation of charities on 2 July 1997. The Review provides an opportunity to see if we can produce a system which better reflects the needs of charities today.
<P>

<a name="80204w19.html_para0">In the first phase of the review, charities and other interested bodies were invited to submit their views. Almost 2,500 replies were received on a broad range of issues. Officials are currently evaluating these suggestions, and the Government will set out possible options for change in a consultation document to be published in the Spring.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply, as Director of the Office for National Statistics, to your recent question on estimates of GDP per head for the regions of England.

Estimates of GDP per head for the Government Office regions of England for the years 1986 to 1996 were published in the article <i>Regional Accounts 1996: part 1</i> starting on page 33 of the January 1998 edition of <i>Economic Trends</i>, which is available in the House of Commons Library. A copy of this article is attached. Estimates for 1997 are not available.
<BR>
You will wish to note that the article presents figures on two bases for London and adjacent regions--table 1 allocates the incomes of commuters to where they live, whereas tables 3 and 8 allocate such income to where they work. The workplace based estimates are available only for alternate years and up to 1995. The regional figures published by Eurostat, the Statistical Office of the European Communities, are also workplace based.

However, the arts and creative industries are neither easily found nor adequately covered in the existing official data and work is under way to clarify the extent of their contributions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what progress has been made and what further action is planned in respect of measures to enforce zero tolerance of criminal activity. [26483]<P>

<P>
<a name="80204w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 "Zero tolerance" policing is one of the tactics available to the police to tackle criminal activity. Many forces have adopted effective strategies to tackle those local crime and disorder problems which impact on the quality of life of their local communities. We have given our full support to such strategies, whether they operate under the term "zero tolerance" or not. The findings of the Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary thematic inspection report on police community and race relations, published in October 1997, showed that there is strong support for policing which involves effective targeted action on quality of life issues.

<a name="80204w21.html_para4">We are also taking steps to tighten the law in a number of areas. The Crime and Disorder Bill will ensure the criminal justice system is better equipped to deal with anti-social and disorderly behaviour, including petty criminality amongst young offenders. First, anti-social behaviour orders will provide protection from harassment and neighbourhood disorder. They will prohibit specified conduct and may be made on anyone over the age of ten. If their terms are breached, criminal sanctions will be available. Second, joint responsibilities will be placed on the police and local authorities in every area to work in partnership with other agencies and in consultation with the local community to develop and implement strategies to reduce crime and disorder. Third, the Bill includes a range of measures to prevent and tackle youth crime, including powers for local authorities to establish night-time curfews on children

 &#163;9 million will be available in 1998-99 to support closed circuit television (CCTV) schemes in England and Wales. The bulk of the budget will be required to see through to completion schemes which were approved prior to the General Election. There are eight schemes in this category in Wales. Crime reduction partnerships in Wales will also be able to bid for a share of at least &#163;1 million available for new schemes under round 4 of the CCTV challenge competition which will give priority to imaginative and innovative schemes. The deadline for bids is 27 March.

<a name="80204w21.html_wqn4"><B> Dr. Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in relation to the concessionary arrangements for same sex couples outside the immigration rules of 13 October, what consideration he gave to the practice in other countries and if he will list those countries; what qualifying periods are operated by those countries for same sex relationships to be treated in the same way as opposite sex relationships; and if he will make a statement. [26781] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Some consideration was given to other countries' policies in relation to same sex relationships. However, immigration policy is a matter for each country to decide. We have developed a policy which we consider to be appropriate to the United Kingdom, and have not based it on any other country's system. 
<P>

<a name="80204w21.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Harris: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many couples have applied under the concessionary arrangements outside the immigration rules announced on 13 October; and, of those couples, how many have been same sex couples. [26779] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Statistics are not kept in the format requested. However, in the final quarter of 1997, approximately 80 applications for leave to remain were received under the unmarried partners concession: about 30 of these were same sex applications. Approximately half of both same sex cases and heterosexual cases have been granted. There have also been about 10 admissions to the United Kingdom under the concession.

<a name="80204w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It has been a fundamental principle of the Immigration Rules that someone already settled in the United Kingdom may bring their spouse into the United Kingdom to join them, subject to meeting clear tests as to the genuineness of the marriage and the financial capacity of the couple. The policy which was announced on 10 October is a concession outside the Immigration Rules for those unmarried partners who are legally unable to marry. This retains the special position of marriage. There are no current plans to incorporate this concession into the Immigration Rules.

<P>
<a name="80204w22.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on trends in crime in rural areas; and what measures the Government are taking to tackle crime in rural areas.  [27120] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 According to the most recent research--the 1996 British Crime Survey--rural communities are at considerably less risk of burglary, vehicle-related theft, vandalism and contact crime. 3.9 per cent. of homes in rural areas were burgled in 1995 compared to 6.3 per cent. in urban areas and 10.3 per cent. in inner cities. In addition, there is less fear of crime. 15.2 per cent. said they were worried about being burgled, compared with 23 per cent. living in urban areas and 32 per cent. living in inner cities. Despite their older age profile, those surveyed said they felt safer on their local streets. 23 per cent. said they felt fairly or very unsafe walking alone after dark, compared to 33 per cent. in urban areas and 45 per cent. of inner city dwellers.
<P>

<a name="80204w22.html_para0">We recognise that rural areas can suffer the twin problems of a less obvious police presence and longer response times to emergency calls. The most effective way to deal with rural crime is for the police and local community to work together in partnership.




<P>
<P><I>4 Feb 1998 : Column: 722</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80204w22.html_para1">The Crime and Disorder Bill will provide for new statutory duties for local authorities and the police to create an effective results-orientated framework for local action to tackle local problems. The nature of these problems will vary significantly from one area to another, and it is the Government's intention to allow maximum flexibility to reflect this. Rural areas, in common with urban and inner city areas, will benefit from this approach.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will release the report of the investigation compiled as a result of the Operation Countryman exercise. [26749]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80204w22.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Operation Countryman was an investigation into allegations of corruption, made in 1978, against officers in the Metropolitan Police and the City of London Police. The investigating officer was from Dorset Constabulary. Investigating officers' reports are as a class regarded by the courts as subject to public interest immunity. Separately, we are considering issues of discipline in the light of the recent report by the Home Affairs Select Committee.
