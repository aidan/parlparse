To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many regulations originating from the EU have been implemented by the Department over each of the last five years.  [120860]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Cabinet Office has been partially responsible for the implementation of one EU Directive in the past five years. The Women and Equality Unit, formerly part of Cabinet Office, implemented the Burden of Proof Directive (EC Directive 097/80/EC). However, the relevant statutory instrument, which came into force on 12 October 2001, was laid before Parliament by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and Minister for Women, who has overall responsibility for women and equality issues.
<P>

<a name="30714w01.html_para0">Directive 97/80/EC has effect in relation to the UK by virtue of Council Directive 98/52/EC, and is implemented in the UK through the Sex Discrimination (Indirect Discrimination and Burden of Proof) Regulations 2001. Its aim is to ensure that any measures implementing the principle of equal treatment are made more effective, thereby providing victims of sex discrimination with effective access to justice. The Directive also defines the concept of indirect discrimination.
<P>

<a name="30714w01.html_para1">EC Regulations are, in general, directly applicable in the member states, without the need for further incorporation into national law. However, some Regulations require UK measures to make them workable and enforceable.
<P>

<a name="30714w01.html_para2">The total number of EC, ECSC and Euratom Regulations made over each of the last five years is estimated to be:

<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w01.html_wqn1"><B> Chris Grayling: </B> 
To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many <i>(a)</i> non-departmental public bodies, <i>(b)</i> Government agencies and <i>(c)</i> other public sector bodies were receiving funding from the Government in 1997; and how many are doing so in the current financial year.  [124955]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Information on non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), including the amount of Government funding each receives, has been published annually in the Cabinet Office "Public Bodies" publication. Data for the 1,128 NDPBs in operation across the UK as at 1 April 1997 are published in "Public Bodies 1997". The latest available data are available in "Public Bodies 2002". Copies of these publications are held in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="30714w01.html_para6">All Executive Agencies are Government funded, with the exception of Trading Funds, which are established using Government funds, but which become self-financing through their commercial activities. The June 1997 List of Ministerial Responsibilities shows 137 Executive Agencies and 87 are shown in the October 2002 List. These publications are held in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="30714w01.html_para7">Information on other bodies funded by Government is not collected centrally and can be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if he will make a statement on the basis for his assessment that it was prejudicial to the safety of the state to allow the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration to investigate whether Cabinet Ministers have ever had any conflict between their private interests and their public duties.  [125679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Government have made clear that they believe personal information provided by Ministers to their civil servants should be treated in complete confidence. The decision to issue a notice in this case was taken because the Government concluded that the release of certain personal, private information would not be in the public interest.

To ask the hon. Member for Gosport, representing the Speaker's Committee on the Electoral Commission whether the Electoral Commission is examining the case for changing the method of ordering candidates' names on ballot papers at elections.  [125423]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Viggers: </B> 
 Yes. In its report, "Ballot Paper Design", published last month, the Commission indicated its concern that alphabetical discrimination could exist in multi-seat elections, while acknowledging that the information available at present was inconclusive.




<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 2003 : Column 3W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30714w01.html_para8">The Commission intends to support further research to establish the extent of the influence of alphabetic discrimination prior to making a final recommendation to the Government. In the meantime it has recommended that legislation be introduced to enable the piloting of alternative listing methods in order to assist in determining the impact of the present arrangements.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what action the Department is taking to boost humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan.  [124618]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w01.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID allocated &#163;44 million to support humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan last year. For the financial year 2003&#150;04 we have allocated at least &#163;5 million. This will be focused on aid to returning refugees and internally displaced persons and vulnerable, particularly women-headed, households. These are the largest groups in continued need of humanitarian assistance.
<P>

<a name="30714w01.html_para9">The humanitarian situation has improved over the last 12 months with good rainfall over the winter and early spring. This has ameliorated the effects of the persistent drought.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w01.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID intends to make publicly available in the next few weeks a short summary document on its overall strategy for the Great Lakes region. The individual strategies for Angola, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, and Rwanda will be available at around the same time.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what research he has commissioned into <i>(a)</i> the annual cost and <i>(b)</i> the numbers involved, if widows who married officers after they had retired from the Service were included in the Colonial Widows and Orphans Pension Schemes.  [125227]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w01.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 No research has been commissioned into the annual cost or the numbers involved. Such information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The accuracy of DFID's records on contributors to the various Colonial Widows and Orphans Pensions Schemes is entirely dependent on the individuals concerned, keeping us informed of any changes in their marital status. Our records are, therefore, not necessarily up to date in respect of marriages which took place after the contributor's retirement.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development if the Department will take steps to ensure that aid channelled through the EU that has until now been spent in the 10 EU accession states will from 2004 to 2006 be spent instead in <i>(a)</i> sub-Saharan Africa and <i>(b)</i> south Asia on <i>(i)</i> development and (ii) water, sanitation and hygiene improvements towards the Millennium Development Goals.

 From 2004, the Pre-Accession budget will continue to provide funding for Bulgaria, Romania and Turkey. Unallocated funds within the budget are being retained to handle any possible additional funding requirements for any new candidates up to 2006.
<P>

<a name="30714w01.html_para10">In 2004, Cyprus and Malta will join the Union and Turkey will move from the External Relations to the Pre-Accession budget. This will free up &#163;150 million annually in the External Relations budget for new commitments.
<P>

<a name="30714w01.html_para11">Earmarking a sensible margin to support Iraq's reconstruction and the Middle East Peace Plan are a UK priority for the 2004 budget. The UK is also pressing for increased commitments to low income countries in Asia, particularly Afghanistan and support for the Global Health Fund, which would both help increase the European Commission's development budget poverty focus.
<P>

<a name="30714w01.html_para12">Assistance for sub-Saharan Africa is provided primarily through the European Development Fund (EDF), a separate off-budget fund replenished directly by member states contributions.

 The EC NGO co-financing committee does not have a fixed membership, but consists of delegates drawn from each of the 15 European Union member states. Since 17 April 2003, delegates from the 10 EU accession states have also been invited to attend most EU committees, including the NGO co-financing committee, as participating observers. The UK is usually represented on the EC NGO co-financing committee by one or two members of staff from the Information and Civil Society Department of DFID.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w02.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 We do not have a bilateral government-to-government aid programme to Cuba nor do we have plans to develop one. As a member of the EU we support the EU Common Position on Cuba which requires the Government of Cuba to enhance democracy and safeguard human rights as a pre-condition for establishment of a formal framework agreement. This Common Position is now under review as part of a range of measures that the EU has implemented in response to the recent deterioration in human rights.

<a name="30714w02.html_para0">The promotion of human rights underpins DFID's strategy in Afghanistan. All our work seeks to promote human rights, and to improve Afghans' ability to participate in civic and political life. DFID aims to achieve this by supporting specific activities, such as livelihoods and humanitarian projects aimed at helping the most vulnerable, while also supporting the development of a democratic, inclusive state that can provide security and basic services to its citizens.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what aid has been given to agencies to provide support and assistance to victims of human trafficking for sexual reasons; what discussions she has had with <i>(a)</i> European and <i>(b)</i> other counterparts on the issue; and if he will make a statement.  [124848]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w02.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The trafficking of people is part of a wider set of issues related to the migration of poor people to better their lives, and to their vulnerability to national and international smugglers and traffickers. Trafficking is an international problem requiring co-ordinated action. DFID's role is to work to eliminate the poverty and social injustice that can lead to such abuse. Through our programmes to promote sustainable development and end poverty, DFID is helping to reduce the circumstances that give rise to this appalling trade, and which make women and children especially vulnerable. With other Government Departments, we are supporting the efforts of Governments and international agencies to strengthen social protection and justice in line with the international treaty framework covering these issues.
<P>

<a name="30714w02.html_para1">For example, in south-east Asia, we are supporting the International Labour Organisation's work to reduce the trafficking of women, many of whom would enter the sex industry, in Laos, Thailand, China (Yunnan), Cambodia and Vietnam. It involves a number of activities to raise awareness and prevent the trade. In the Balkans we recently supported the International Organisation for Migration in training the various agencies dealing with the victims of trafficking, including police, social workers and the legal profession, in order to create and disseminate models of good practice.

 DFID has so far committed &#163;154 million in the current crisis&#151;including &#163;35 million announced on 26 June in response to the United Nations Revised Humanitarian Appeal for Iraq of 23 June. Most of this finance is channelled through organisations such as United Nations agencies, the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement and NGOs, which have the capacity

<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w02.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Reliable statistics for homeless people and those living in temporary accommodation in Iraq are not available. It is estimated that, before the recent conflict, between 600,000 and 800,000 people were displaced in the north of Iraq, mainly from Kirkuk and Mosul, by the Saddam regime's Arabisation policies and inter-ethnic fighting; and between 100,000 and 300,000 Shia people were displaced in the south following the Gulf War and state-sponsored drainage of the marshes. Assessments are being made of displacement that has resulted from the recent conflict. These include Arab families who were living in homes now being reclaimed by returning Kurds; and a number of families rendered destitute by war damage and looting.

<P>

<a name="30714w02.html_para5">In 2000, the World Health Organisation and UNICEF estimated that 48 per cent. of people in rural areas and 96 per cent. of people in urban areas had access to clean drinking water. The International Committee of the Red Cross has worked well with other humanitarian organisations, the UK military and local authorities to repair water facilities and provide water by alternative means while supplies have been disrupted, primarily by looting, after the recent conflict. The situation in many parts of the country, including Basra, Kirkuk and Mosul is now improving. Baghdad is now receiving 70 to 90 per cent. of its pre-war water supplies.
<P>

<a name="30714w02.html_para6">Electricity installations did not sustain significant damage during the recent war, but power supplies are very variable as a result of previous lack of maintenance and subsequent looting and sabotage.

 EU and Mediterranean partner trade ministers meeting in Palermo on 7 July 2003 agreed to extend the system of pan-European cumulation of origin to the Mediterranean partners (Algeria, Cyprus, Egypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon, Malta, Morocco, Palestinian Authority, Syria, Tunisia and Turkey). Cumulation of origin means goods can be processed using inputs from any source within the Euro-Mediterranean area, and take advantage of the system of preferential tariffs, which currently exists between Europe and the Mediterranean partners. As such, it should help to foster economic integration between Mediterranean partners and with Europe, enable goods to be produced more efficiently through sourcing the cheapest inputs, and encourage economies of scale. A subsequent assessment of the effectiveness of this agreement will eventually be possible.

<a name="30714w03.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development pursuant to the answer of 4 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 432W, if he will list the countries whose poverty reduction strategy papers now include sanitation, water supply and hygiene as a result of pressure from her Department.  [124442]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w03.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) are intended to be country-driven and owned, based on broad participation in their design, implementation and monitoring. PRSPs provide a focus for joint donor efforts, and so it is not possible allocate particular elements of countries' PRSPs to the actions of any one donor. DFID participates in formal and informal donor networks around PRSPs, has co-funded World bank-led workshops and has been active on PRSP preparation committees and working groups.
<P>

<a name="30714w03.html_para0">DFID's strong commitment to achieving debt relief and poverty reduction in the world's poorest countries means that we are working actively with their Governments to support production of PRSPs. We are also supporting the consultative process that the PRSP requires, to ensure the strategy is built on broad-based consensus in which the poor have a voice. The majority of DFID country offices support the national PRSP process by promoting official or Government participation. We also give direct support to civil society to strengthen the impact of public action on poverty, and to encourage progress towards the Millennium Development Goals. DFID has worked with the World bank on the Poverty Reduction Strategy Sourcebook. This is a guide to assist countries in the development of poverty reduction strategies and includes advice on issues such as health, education, infrastructure, water and sanitation, macroeconomic policy, gender and the environment.
<P>

<a name="30714w03.html_para1">DFID also supports major multi-lateral initiatives, such as the Water and Sanitation Program, that work to support national Governments and civil society in national PRSP processes. Research undertaken by the Water and Sanitation Program of Full and Interim PRSPs in Sub-Saharan Africa has found that treatment of water and sanitation is not comprehensive and often inconsistent. In particular, sanitation and solid waste management received inadequate attention. Also, despite the significant continuing work on sector reforms (e.g. decentralisation, rural and urban water and sanitation), their incorporation in the country PRSP initiatives requires considerable strengthening. 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 2003 : Column 10W</I><P>
The Uganda PRS was a notable exception having good coverage of water and sanitation issues, and serves as an illustration of good practice.
<P>

<a name="30714w03.html_para2">DFID has also commissioned a research and advocacy project in sub-Saharan Africa that is being undertaken by the Overseas Development Institute (ODI) and WaterAid. The project is investigating how resources allocated to water supply and sanitation in PRSPs in five countries in sub-Saharan Africa (Kenya, Malawi, Zambia, Madagascar and Uganda) are converting into actual expenditure on water and sanitation, and will make recommendations to improve the poverty reducing impact of this work. This will be completed in 2004 and is an important opportunity to support the building of sustainable improvements in local capacity in a way that is consistent with nationally owned poverty reduction strategies.

<a name="30714w03.html_spnew3"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK has supported the French Africa initiative to the G8, which recognises the damaging effects of agricultural subsidies on African economies. Discussions around the French initiative during the recent G8 summit at Evian were also important to reiterate the importance of finding solutions to the commodities' problem and to improve the way in which preferential access into developed countries' markets operates for the benefit of developing countries.
<P>

<a name="30714w03.html_para5">In the WTO, the UK is committed to reaching agreements on long-term agricultural trade rules, which are fair and non-discriminatory. These multilateral rules should aim to create the stable conditions necessary for the private sector to make long-term investment in developing countries' agriculture. In this context, the draft agricultural trade framework agreement (put forward by Stuart Harbinson) proposes that developed countries phase out all export subsidies within 10 years.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w03.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Edwards: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development what proposals her Department has for providing greater opportunities for poor countries competing for access to heavily protected markets in the developed world. [124319]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w03.html_spnew4"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government believe that the current round of trade negotiations in the World Trade Organisation (WTO) will provide the best opportunity for improving developing country access to protected agricultural and non-agricultural markets in the developed world. Along with commitments to improve market access, the negotiations also aim to tackle developed countries' high levels of trade-distorting domestic support and use of export subsidies, which harm developing countries.
<P>

<a name="30714w03.html_para6">At the fifth Ministerial meeting of the WTO in Cancun this September, Ministers will assess progress towards achieving the 'development' agenda set out in Doha in November 2001. This includes an assessment of the merits of already tabled proposals on market access. Specifically, the EU is pushing for an overall average tariff reduction of 36 per cent. in the agriculture negotiations, and a reduction of tariffs on non-agricultural goods to a maximum of 15 per cent. The EU is also pushing for all developed countries to fulfil their commitment to grant duty and quota free access for all products excluding arms originating in least developed countries.
<P>

<a name="30714w03.html_para7">To ensure that trade rules benefit all individual developing countries, any new rules will have to consider the particular needs of countries in terms of development, food security and poverty reduction. For example, the current draft of WTO agricultural trade rules includes a number of special and differential provisions for developing countries, such as lower (subsidy and tariff) reduction commitments and longer implementation periods. Some provisions also aim to protect developing countries' food security by naming "special products" which would be subject to less market opening.
<P>

<a name="30714w03.html_para8">The UK is a strong advocate of trade reform and a supporter of special and differential rules for developing countries. The recently agreed package of CAP reform is 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 2003 : Column 12W</I><P>
important in delinking subsidies from production which will help reduce the unfair competition against third parties, particularly developing countries.

 As part of its continuing dialogue and consultation with UK non-governmental organisation and campaigners working on trade and development issues, DFID held its biannual open day to discuss these issues on 26 June 2003 and I spent an hour with campaigners to listen to their concerns about the expansion of the WTO negotiating agenda to include new issues such as investment. I also answered questions on the Government's position on various trade issues in the run up to Cancun. In addition to these formal consultations, DFID officials are in regular contact with campaigners to discuss the details of current policies and proposals.

To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development if the Government will press its partners in the developed world to commit to quota and tariff-free access to European and US markets for all imports from low-income countries in Africa.  [124321]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w03.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK was one of the strongest advocates of the EU Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative, which allows duty and quota-free access into the EU for imports from Least Developed Countries.
<P>

<a name="30714w03.html_para9">The UK is also very active within the G8 in finding ways to implement the Africa Action Plan, which include commitments to improve all existing preferential schemes, so as to ensure that these effectively benefit the targeted countries.
<P>

<a name="30714w03.html_para10">In the WTO, the UK supports the Commission's proposal that 50 per cent of imports from developing countries into the developed countries should be duty free&#151;including those from African low-income countries.

<a name="30714w03.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Government are working for faster progress in the Doha round, especially on the issues that matter most to developing countries: agriculture, Trade Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) and public health, and special and differential treatment. For example, we are in dialogue with the US and the pharmaceutical companies in order to find a way forwards on TRIPS and public health.
<P>

<a name="30714w03.html_para11">The agreed package of reforms to the EU's Common Agricultural Policy is an important step towards making global trade in agriculture fairer for developing countries. In the context of the WTO negotiations, now

that the EU has moved on agriculture, others must be prepared to follow suit. We hope that the CAP deal will inject new momentum into the Doha round.

<P>
<a name="30714w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Department is committed to encouraging good design and this is done principally through our involvement in standards work. The placing of accessibility features in standards ensures that all products of that type include them. We actively participate in drafting key standards. A major conference was held earlier this year by the European Standards Bodies in conjunction with the Commission to promote inclusive design.

<P>
<a name="30714w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 DTI officials have regular discussions with manufacturers of radio receivers on the development of digital radio technology, applications and markers. Although UK sales of digital radio receivers have increased in recent months, the market is still at a very early stage. We expect to see a greater range of receivers on offer over the coming months, including those with larger clearer screens, which will make digital radio programmes more accessible to all, including visually impaired people. Options being considered by manufacturers for the figure include digital radios with audio guides which read alound what is currently displayed as text.
<P>

<a name="30714w04.html_para11">Access to digital radio services is not limited to the current range of digital radio receivers. Many digital radio services can also be accessed by digital television receivers and computers, providing a greater range of options for the visually impaired and others.

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2003]:</i> The choice of which generating plant to use to meet their contracts with electricity suppliers is a commercial matter for the electricity generating companies.
<P>

<a name="30714w04.html_para13">Electricity generators face limits imposed by the environment Agency on a variety of emissions with environmental impacts. Examples of emissions limited by the Agency in this way include sulphur dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, emissions of which are generally higher from coal plant than from other types of generation.
<P>

<a name="30714w04.html_para14">Coal fired generation also produces higher levels of carbon dioxide emissions than most other forms of generation. The Agency does not set limits for emissions of carbon dioxide from power stations. However, a trading scheme for carbon dioxide emissions is due to be launched by the European Union in January 2005. This scheme will cover all fossil fuelled power stations and will give generators direct financial incentives to reduce carbon emissions.

 Responsibility for the provision of mobile telephones for official purposes and for payment of the associated call charges was devolved to individual directorates, agencies and NDPBs at the end of March 1993.

This contract provides a call-off arrangement for DTI users at advantageous prices ensuring that the Department obtains good value for money. Due to the devolved responsibility for mobile telephone management the only information that can be provided at non-disproportionate cost is expenditure with DTI's main suppliers of mobile telephony.

 The Forestry Commission, working with others, are currently undertaking a Woodfuel Resource Study, which will quantify the resource from traditional forests, sawmill co-product, arboricultural arisings and short rotation coppice. Defra and the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) have funded studies on the quantity and location of recovered wood.
<P>

<a name="30714w06.html_para1">As a result of market pressures, the forestry industry has been investigating alternative end uses for its products. The forest industry regards energy generation using wood as an important new market to explore.
<P>

<a name="30714w06.html_para2">I am aware that generators are also investigating the possibilities presented through the use of non-wood materials as a source of biomass for use in co-firing. At present, large co-firers are testing the feasibility of using wood as well as imported olive cake and palm oil husks.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government are providing support for the use of wood waste as a biomass fuel in a number of ways, as outlined in reply on 24 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 683W and 26 June 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 927W. This will help to deliver the Government's policy objectives on national energy production. The support schemes do not apply to other uses of wood waste.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what research she undertook prior to the introduction of the Renewables Obligation into its impact on the wood panel industry.  [125170]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We carried out three full consultations on the Renewables Obligation before its introduction on 1 April 2002. The first consultation paper, "New and Renewable Energy: Prospects for the UK for the 21st Century", was issued in March 1999 and was accompanied by Supporting Analysis produced by ETSU . The report presented an up to date status report on new and renewable energy and flagged up issues concerning forestry wastes and also the socio-economic implications of renewables.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w06.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Bellingham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent discussions she has had with representatives of the wood panel industry regarding the impact on their supplies of basic raw material of electricity generators using wood residues as a green fuel.  [125171]<P>

co-firing under the Obligation for UK Forestry, and, in particular, the potential for using by-products from existing wood industries. Working groups continue to meet.
<P>

<a name="30714w06.html_para3">It is hoped that this initiative, if successful, will have the dual benefit of reducing imports and making more biomass available for a larger market in the UK, thereby helping to stabilise prices.
<P>

<a name="30714w06.html_para4">We understand from the forestry industry that it can meet demand from power generators from existing surplus forestry material.

<P>
<a name="30714w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No estimate has been made of the effect of lighting the whole of the motorway network. Research has shown that where motorway lighting is provided the number of reported accidents can be reduced by about 8 per cent. and can result in a reduction of night-time personal injury accidents by as much as 30 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30714w08.html_para6">Lighting is generally only provided where there are particular problems and where the economic assessments show the cost of installation and operation of lighting is exceeded by the benefits of reduced night-time accidents. At present, approximately 30 per cent. of motorways are lit.

<P>
<a name="30714w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department is only responsible for road projects in England outside London. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State's, statement to this House on 9 July made clear our commitment to improving the nation's roads and other forms of transport, in both the immediate and the longer terms.
<P>

<a name="30714w08.html_para7">The Government's Target Programme of Improvements currently contains 72 major trunk road improvement proposals tackling congestion, providing safety benefits and relieving communities of traffic. Since June last year, 12 other major trunk road schemes have been opened. A number of other major trunk road improvements have been proposed, mainly through the multi-modal study process. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State's announcement covered 11 of these studies. The Highways Agency have been asked to do further development work on over 30 road proposals, includingactive traffic management and other technology related improvements on various parts of the motorway and trunk road network. Similar work is 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 2003 : Column 32W</I><P>
also being carried out on other projects following our responses to eight other multi-modal studies within the last two years.
<P>

<a name="30714w08.html_para8">Since December 2000, over 60 major road schemes, often bringing safety and quality of life benefits, have been proposed by local authorities and received provisional or full approval by the Government to proceed. We are expecting around 20 further such proposals to be submitted as part of this year's Local Transport Settlement process.

<P>
<P>

 There is not a backlog of maintenance on motorways and trunk roads in England.
<P>

<a name="30714w08.html_para9">On local roads the maintenance backlogs were estimated in 2000 as &#163;2 billion on carriageways and footways, &#163;750 million on bridges and other structures, and &#163;1
<P>

<a name="30714w08.html_para10">billion on street lighting. Since then the Department, through the Roads Liaison Group, has been developing better inventory systems and condition indicators that will allow more accurate and up to date estimates to be made of backlogs.
<P>

<a name="30714w08.html_para11">The Government is committed in the 10 Year Plan for Transport to tackling all the backlogs in local road maintenance by 2010 and is providing &#163;31 billion of funding over the Plan's period for this purpose.

 The changes to the lottery announced on 3 July 2003 include proposals to make it easier to apply for funding, to involve the public in how lottery money is spent and to make sure it's spent wisely. This should encourage people to play the lottery which, in turn, will provide revenue for the good causes and benefit all areas. Since the introduction of the 1998 Lottery Act and changes to policy directions, distributors have increasingly focussed on areas of social and economic deprivation including seaside resorts. The National Lottery has funded, and continues

 Sustainable tourism is relevant to all tourism areas, including coastal resorts, historic and modern cities, rural areas and man-made visitor attractions. We set out the policy framework necessary to achieve progress in the Tomorrow's Tourism strategy. To implement sustainable tourism requires action by a wide range of partners, including Government Departments and their agencies, Regional Development Agencies (RDAs), local authorities, the tourism industry and organisations with environmental, conservation or social exclusion remits. Actions initiated by DCMS include giving VisitBritain a remit to market England to encourage domestic tourism and the 'Fitness for Purpose' initiative to provide customers with a firmer assurance that hotels, and the restaurants within them, are fit for trading. RDAs are promoting sustainable tourism as part of their enhanced role in the 



<P>

strategic leadership of tourism, which links with their statutory remit for sustainable development. Local authorities can help promote sustainable tourism through spatial planning and approaches to visitor management and Business Links provide practical guidance to tourism businesses on matters such as energy efficiency and reducing waste. Everyone has something to contribute towards achieving sustainable tourism in every part of the country and it is in everyone's interest to do so.

 Access All Areas is a nation-wide award scheme run by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Launched in May 2003, the scheme runs until September, and aims to recognise and congratulate small businesses and organisations, of all types, which offer accessible and innovative services for disabled people. Through DWP's efforts the scheme has been promoted by VisitBritain, both on its web site and in an e-mail newsletter sent to 200,000 tourism businesses, and by the Tourism Skills Network, who advertised the award on its web site. DCMS sponsors VisitBritain as the lead body for tourism, and has communicated Access All Areas to those responsible for accessible tourism in England's regional tourist boards.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 In October 2004 the final phase of Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 comes into force. Organisations that provide a service to the public, which includes most small businesses in the tourism sector, are required to tackle physical features that make it impossible or unreasonably difficult for a disabled customer to use their service.
<P>

<a name="30714w10.html_para4">However, the DDA only requires service providers to make "reasonable" adjustments. The Act allows flexibility for service providers in considering how to make their services accessible to disabled people. All circumstances would be considered when interpreting what is "reasonable", including the cost of an adjustment, its practicality, and the extent of a service provider's resources. What might be considered reasonable for a national hotel chain may not be so for a small guesthouse. Financial incentives should not therefore be needed, apart from the clear business case for providing good service for disabled people and their family and friends, whose overall annual spending power is estimated at &#163;45 billion.

In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests, which would have had a longer 



period in which to contract the disease. Also, the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.<P>

 Regarding general consumer information on organic food, no evaluation is available since the possibility of providing such information is still under consideration.

<a name="30714w11.html_para8">On the marketing of organic and other quality agricultural products under the Rural Enterprise Scheme, funding is offered to individual businesses or representative organisations to assist with marketing initiatives. These projects are commercial in nature and the information is treated as confidential. Expected outcomes from these, and all other Rural Enterprise Scheme projects, are considered as part of the scheme's application assessment process against published aims for the scheme and to ensure that the Government investment achieves good value for money.

 The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) does not make the decision to remove children from the care of their parents or guardians, or hold hearings on future guardianship. Court hearings are held to determine these questions. A CAFCASS practitioner represents the interests of a child during proceedings. The court considers all the evidence before it, including CAFCASS reports, and makes the decision about the child's future. At the end of April 2003, CAFCASS were dealing with 12,245 public law cases (care, adoption, freeing orders and guardianship) that were at various stages between application and final hearing.

On each occasion we emphasise that hostage taking is wrong and that those holding hostages should free them at once. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary last raised the matter with Iranian Foreign Minister Kharrazi on 6 February 2003 and my hon. Friend the Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr. Mike O'Brien) raised it with Syrian Foreign Minister Shara'a during President Al-Assad's visit to the UK on 16 and 17 December 2002. We have also raised the issue with Hizbollah.

 The United Kingdom is already one of 27 countries whose nationals benefit from the US Visa Waiver Programme when travelling to the US on a full British passport for a visit of less than 90 days. Officials are in discussions with their US counterparts to ensure that the maximum number of UK nationals will continue to benefit from the programme following the introduction of tighter US entry requirements over the next couple of years.

 Officials are in contact with a number of different organisations in Morocco and in Western Sahara, including the Forum for Truth and Justice.

However, the Forum's section in Western Sahara had been inoperative and effectively without a membership for over a year.

We are aware of specific cases involving individuals previously associated with the dissolved section, for example, Ali Salem Tamek whose case officials have raised with the Moroccan authorities.

The service will provide coverage of both Chambers, sittings in Westminster Hall, and some Select and Standing Committees. Audio and video coverage will be available for any committees that are televised. Audio-only coverage will be provided for most other committees. Therefore, if a committee chooses to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny, or if a special committee is appointed for that purpose, it is likely that its proceedings will be webcast either in audio-only or both in audio and video.

 There is currently no accurate, reliable data in existence within the United Kingdom or the European Union. A Home Office research study 'Stopping Traffic' (Police Research Series 125, published in 2000) indicated that there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This was estimated at between 140 and 1,400 per year but it was impossible to make a more accurate assessment of numbers. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that this was on a large scale compared with other European countries.
<P>

<a name="30714w16.html_para2">The Nationality, Asylum and Immigration Act 2002 created a new offence of trafficking for the purpose of controlling someone through prostitution, the relevant sections of which came into force on 10 February 2003.

Forming an accurate estimate of the levels of trafficking in people is problematic given the reluctance of the victims of trafficking to report to the police.

 The White Paper "Secure Borders Safe Haven", published last year, set out a comprehensive approach for supporting the victims of trafficking. It included a commitment to make arrangements for victim protection and support.
<P>

<a name="30714w16.html_para4">In March this year we established a pilot scheme, working with Eaves Housing, a voluntary sector organisation, to provide support and assistance to victims of trafficking to enable them to make an informed decision about co-operating with the authorities. The pilot scheme will initially run on a trial basis for a period of six months so that we can evaluate its impact.
<P>

<a name="30714w16.html_para5">Under the terms of the scheme victims are referred to Eaves housing by the police, via a voluntary organisation or self-referred. There is an assessment made of their needs and they get information about the consequences of co-operating with a prosecution. Their immigration status is considered, and it is recognised that if they co-operate with the authorities then it may be appropriate to allow them to remain in the United Kingdom. This assessment is made on a case by case basis. If they decide to return home, arrangements are made through the International Organisation for Migration, which has a well established voluntary assisted return programme, to assist the woman to reintegrate back into her home society.

This approach encompasses legislation, enforcement, victim support and international co-operation. In the context of this last point, the UK has been working hard to push trafficking up the international agenda. We were at the forefront of work to draft the United Nations trafficking protocol and subsequent EU framework decision on trafficking. We have been closely involved in Europol's work to counter trafficking including establishing a joint intelligence sharing team with Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands on Bulgarian trafficking gangs. The UK also hosted the first EU prosecutors conference on trafficking last year and are closely involved in follow up work. We are also actively shaping EU consideration of

 Some part-time members of the Royal Irish Regiment have experienced a delay in receiving their annual bounty for the training year 1 April 2002 to 31 March 2003. In some instances this was due to a computer programming error that has now been rectified.

For those that remain outstanding, payment has, in some instances, been delayed due to the soldiers training year being extended, or as a consequence of processing delays due to soldiers leaving the Regiment.

The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister set out views on the use of social clauses in contracting in Annex C of Circular 03/2003, "Local Government Act 1999: Part 1&#151;Best Value and Performance Improvement".

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is keen that all funded schemes continue. However, Government funding for warden schemes was awarded on a short-term basis, and it was clear from the start that this financial support would only be for a limited period. Additionally, local authorities have requested that we reduce area-based initiatives, in order that they have more flexibility in how they spend their own funds. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister already has examples of local authorities and housing associations that are mainstreaming schemes.
<P>

<a name="30714w18.html_para7">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working closely with all schemes in the development of their future sustainability plans. Events are being held and guidance has been produced for scheme managers.

<P>

<a name="30714w19.html_para1">This is why Jobcentre Plus training is strongly focused on basic skills and more appropriately targeted training, ensuring that this is linked to the labour market rather than just a qualification. Our evidence suggests that a Level 2 qualification is not, in general, the most significant milestone in terms of employability. There is a much bigger difference in terms of employment rates between those with no qualifications and a qualification of any kind, and particularly between those with or without basic skills, than between Level 2 and lower qualifications.

 We have received no recent representations from disability organisations about the rules which treat periods of hospital in-patient treatment separated by no more than 28 days as a single period for the purpose of determining when payments of disability living allowance or attendance allowance can be made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w19.html_spnew8"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 None. We believe that the current rules are fair. The changes we have made ensure that for most people the benefits they receive for every day living are not touched while they are in hospital. This recognises that hospital in-patients are likely to have on-going costs of maintaining their homes. Disability living allowance and attendance allowance, however, help with the disability-related needs of severely disabled people. These needs are met by the national health service when the recipients are in hospital, and so payment of these benefits stops after 4 weeks. Entitlement to carer's allowance can continue throughout breaks in care for holidays or for hospitalisation of the carer or disabled person. Provided the DUVAA remains in payment, these breaks can total 12 weeks in a period of 26 weeks.

The order in which households are contacted has been designed to produce a controlled and measured build up of applications, evenly distributed throughout the UK. The households to be contacted before October represent a cross section of the pensioner population, including pensioners of all age groups and likely levels of eligibility for pension credit. By June 2004, all pensioner households will have been contacted. As part of a separate exercise, The Pension Service also began in April to write to pensioners to invite them to convert to direct payment into an account.

The sample may under-represent certain types of schemes, for example smaller schemes. These data have been broadly adjusted to reflect economic conditions in June 2003 using assumptions about the investment policies of the schemes involved: figures for a different date could well give different results depending on movements in market conditions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what changes have been made to the basis for minimum funding requirement since May 1997; and what effect the changes have had on the demonstrated level of funding of a typical pension scheme.  [124023]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w21.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The actuarial basis for the minimum funding requirement (MFR) is kept under review by the Faculty and Institute of Actuaries. They have recommended two substantive changes to the basis since May 1997, and both were implemented. From 15 June 1998 the factor for the equity market value adjustment, which generally applies to the calculation of liabilities for scheme members below pension age, was reduced from 4.25 per cent. to 3.25 per cent. and the gross yield on the FTSE Actuaries All-Share Index was replaced with the net yield on the same index. From 7 March 2002 the factor for the equity market value adjustment was further reduced, from 3.25 per cent. to 3.00 per cent. The changes were intended to address movements in the strength of the MFR test resulting from changing economic and demographic trends. In addition to these changes there have been a number of minor technical amendments to the actuarial guidance which governs the calculation of a scheme's MFR liabilities.
<P>

<a name="30714w21.html_para2">It is not possible to define a typical pension scheme, but estimates <sup>1</sup>  about the effect of these changes on the aggregated MFR funding levels of all schemes subject to the MFR have been prepared by the Government Actuary's Department. These indicate that the change which took effect from 15 June 1998 may have increased aggregate funding levels against the MFR by around 5 per cent. and that the change which took effect in March 2002 may have further increased aggregate funding levels against the MFR by around 3 per cent.

<a name="30714w21.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Randall: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what part of his Department has special responsibility for <i>(a)</i> assessing the impact of rodenticides on non-target wildlife, <i>(b)</i> producing guidelines on good practice in the use of rodenticides and <i>(c)</i> ensuring that rodenticides are used in accordance with legal requirements.  [124635]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive has recently taken over responsibility from DEFRA for the registration and assessment of rodenticides under the Control of Pesticides Regulations. Five Government Departments are signatories to these regulations, DWP, DEFRA, DH, Scottish Executive and the National Assembly for Wales. The policy lead for vertebrates and wildlife issues remains with DEFRA. Rodenticides will be among the first chemicals to be reviewed under the EU Biocidal Products Directive next year and controls 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 2003 : Column 84W</I><P>
under this Directive will replace those that currently exist under the Control of Pesticides Regulations. HSE is the Competent Authority for the Biocidal Products Directive in the UK. The evaluation of products includes an assessment of the possible effects to non-target species.
<P>

<a name="30714w21.html_para4">The HSE has produced guidance on the safe use of rodenticides on farms and holdings, and is currently compiling specific guidance for the safe use of rodenticides in urban areas. A copy has been placed in the Library. Information and advice for the user of a rodenticide on how a product should be applied is given on the product label, and is specific for each product.
<P>

<a name="30714w21.html_para5">The enforcement of the Control of Pesticides Regulations is split between the relevant enforcing bodies, which include HSE, Local Authorities and DEFRA. Which authority carries out the enforcement action is dependant on whether the product was used by a member of the public or someone employed to carry out a treatment, where the product was used and whether people, animals or the environment could have been affected by the treatment. The HSE free leaflet 'Reporting Incidents of Exposure to Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines' (INDG14) provides advice to members of the public on which body to contact and is available from HSE Books. A copy has been placed in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what recent research has been conducted on the MMR vaccine.  [123719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w23.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 Primary MMR research has not been undertaken in Northern Ireland, mainly due to the small size of our population. However large studies addressing the issues of MMR safety and effectiveness have been carried out in the UK and other European countries. The most recent of these is a Danish study which was published at the end of 2002. This study looked at the effects of MMR in over half a million Danish children. The study concluded that there was no link between MMR and autism or any other neurodevelopment disorders.

<a name="30714w23.html_para0">DHSSPS receive advice on immunisation policy from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) who keep all national and international research under regular review. The JCVI continues to recommend the use of MMR vaccine for all children.

 The Northern Ireland Housing Executive, in line with other public sector bodies, does not monitor the community background of contractors to which it awards work. However, there is a requirement that all contractors sign a Fair Employment Declaration which must be submitted with each tender. The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland monitors contractors' compliance with current employment legislation.

<a name="30714w24.html_para7">20 per cent. of the carer's grant is earmarked for children's services. It is a matter for local authorities to determine local needs and distribute the carer's grant as they see fit. For this reason, information about how much money each local authority spends on services for children in general, and children with a learning disability, is not held centrally. Details about how many children with a learning disability from each social services authority took short breaks funded by the carer's grant are also not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="30714w24.html_para8">In 2001&#150;02, 52,481 families were supported by children's services using the carer's grant. Before this date we did not collect data on the breakdown of spending of the carer's grant between children's and adult's services. This information will continue to be collected in future years.

<a name="30714w24.html_wqn5"><B> Bob Spink: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many individuals have studied successfully for the Chair of Governors award; and if he will make a statement on his policy on attracting, training and supporting school governors.  [125021]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Since June 2000, 21 governors from Essex, Cambridgeshire, Lewisham and Thurrock have been awarded the BTEC Higher Certificate for the Chair of Governors award developed by Essex LEA.
<P>

<a name="30714w24.html_para9">My right hon. Friend's policy on attracting, training and supporting school governors is to empower local education authorities and schools to deliver high quality support locally. The Department's school governor recruitment strategy offers support to locally based governor recruitment activities by LEAs and schools. We have produced the Help Schools Help Children information leaflet which promotes governorship and a supporting toolkit which offers advice and guidance on recruitment activities as well as publicity materials which can be adapted for local use. My Department also funds the School Governors' One Stop Shop which was established in November 1999 to recruit governors with business and management skills for inner city schools in Excellence in Cities (EiC) areas. In September 2002 this remit was extended to a number of other areas known to have serious vacancy problems.
<P>

<a name="30714w24.html_para10">Under my Department's National Strategy for Training and Supporting School Governors the first priority was to develop a National Training Programme for New Governors to ensure that all governors have the information they need to fulfil their statutory functions. The programme, which is delivered by LEA governor trainers, has been operating since September 2001. A Clerks' National Training Programme, developed for the Department by Consortium 52, a partnership involving LEAs in the North West, North East and Yorkshire and Humberside regions, together with the local diocesan bodies, is being rolled out to LEAs this summer. The programme supports a national job description for clerks, agreed after extensive consultation last year, and should increase awareness of this important role as well as ensure that clerks have the necessary skills and knowledge to support governing bodies effectively.
<P>

<a name="30714w24.html_para11">The third strand of the strategy is a National Development Programme for Heads and Chairs, which is currently being developed by the Eastern Leadership Centre (an Affiliated Centre for the National College of School Leadership) in partnership with governor services in nine eastern region LEAs in association with local Anglican and Catholic dioceses. The programme will provide skills training for chairs as well as joint development for heads and chairs linked to supporting a school improvement activity in the participants' schools, to develop joint leadership and effective team working. The Programme is due to be delivered to the Department at the end of March 2004.
<P>

<a name="30714w24.html_para12">All of these programmes build on existing good practice, provide mixed media resources, and offer self study as well as taught course materials to cater for a wide variety of preferred learning styles and access arrangements.

 Good quality child care helps to enhance outcomes for children. A skilled and qualified child care workforce is essential to meet our objectives to increase the availability of high quality child care for all age groups.
<P>

<a name="30714w25.html_para0">We provide for the training of child care workers through the Learning and Skills Council, and through funding allocated to local authorities and their Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships. It is for local LSCs and local authorities to assess needs in their areas and develop plans to ensure the training delivered best meets them. We issued joint guidance with LSC to encourage local planning for workforce development.
<P>

<a name="30714w25.html_para1">A national child care recruitment campaign has been running since 2000 to encourage people to consider a career in child care. It includes television and media advertising, a variety of customised information and materials, a national order line and a website with order facility. Local authorities promote careers in child care using a range of materials and events, working with local partners such as Jobcentre Plus, Careers Services, providers and sector organisations to provide practical help to potential recruits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w25.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 Prior to April 2003, cross border disputes arose typically because of differences between local education authorities' (LEAs') eligibility criteria and grant distribution. Guidance issued by the Sure Start Unit encourages LEAs to make reciprocal arrangements or otherwise to consider funding on a case by case basis. Nursery education funding is now allocated to LEAs through their Education Formula Spending Share. This is calculated on the basis of the latest data on pupil numbers and reflects provision for all children taking up a free place, regardless of where they live. From April 2004, there should be no need for reciprocal arrangements since all LEAs will have a statutory duty to provide a free nursery education place for every three year old whose parents want one.

 The Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS) does not make the decision to remove children from the care of their parents or guardians, or hold hearings on future guardianship. Court hearings are held to determine these questions. A CAFCASS practitioner represents the interests of a child during proceedings. The court considers all the evidence before it, including CAFCASS reports and makes the decision about the child's future. At the end of April 2003, CAFCASS were dealing with 12,245 public law cases (care, adoption, freeing orders and guardianship) that were at various stages between application and final hearing.

 <i>[holding answer 26 June 2003]:</i> The Government are allocating resources to develop children centres, and to create 43,000 new child care places&#151;&#163;435 million in this spending review period, including &#163;317 million capital. Local authorities are responsible for deciding how and where children's centre services will be delivered. The majority of centres will be developed from sure start local programmes, neighbourhood nurseries and early excellence centres.

Local authority strategic plans are due by mid October 2003; we cannot estimate what proportion of centres will be fully funded by DfES until these are received.

 The National Literacy Strategy (together with the National Numeracy Strategy) has transformed standards in our primary schools and the 2002 test results at age seven and 11 were the best ever. Nationally, 75 per cent. of pupils achieved level four or above in the 2002 Key Stage 2 English tests, 10 percentage points more than in 1998. Compared to 1998, about 60,000 more 11-year olds achieved the expected level for their age in English.

<a name="30714w26.html_para7">The achievement gap between high and low performing schools and local education authorities (LEAs) has also narrowed significantly.

In addition, the programme of work set out in the strategy document involves a major focusing of national programmes (including, for example, the academies programme) on London&#151;so that there will be very significant new investment in London over the next three years.

 The funding which is to be allocated for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 to each region will be finalised in September 2003. Government Offices for the Regions will be able to take decisions on how funding for local millennium volunteers activity in 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06 is to be distributed within their regions. These decisions will take account of regional needs and will be informed by local discussions with key partners as well as the outcomes of a review of the formula which will determine the allocation of funds to each region. In making their decisions in late autumn, Government offices will take into account existing provision, the needs of young people, particularly those at risk, and the coverage across their region.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to the oral answer of the Prime Minister to the hon.

[123152]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w28.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2003]:</i> The number of regular teachers in the maintained sector in England increased by 24,800 between January 1997 and January 2003 (provisional). The number of teachers with Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) rose by 12,500. The number of teachers with professional qualifications obtained in countries outside the European Economic Area and instructors with special qualifications or experience of particular skills or subjects rose by 8,500. The remaining 3,800 of the increase is comprised of mature career-changers working towards QTS while working as teachers on employment-based training routes like the graduate teacher programme. These routes, which were first established in 1998, already provide over 10 per cent. of all newly-qualified teachers. Since autumn 2000, the earliest date for which these data are available, over 5,000 teachers on employment-based training programmes have been awarded QTS. Almost 900 of those have gained QTS since January 2003.

Of the 24,800 increase 5,800 were in the maintained nursery and primary phase, 17,600 were in the maintained secondary phase and 1,400 were in maintained special schools, pupil referral units or education elsewhere.

<P>
<a name="30714w28.html_spnew2"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The Department of Health is responsible for the provision of eye checks undertaken by local primary health care teams in accordance with professional advice. The principal threats to eye health and impaired vision development should be detected, at or before school age, through health development checks or through a visual screening on school entry. Older children may develop myopia (short sight) which is usually recognised when they complain of difficulty seeing clearly at distance. Since the onset of myopia commonly occurs between the ages of nine and 16 it is not possible to identify optimum ages for screening. Children may "pass" a routine screening examination only to find problems within the next few months. Whenever parents or carers suspect that there is a problem with their child's sight they should take them to an optician. All children up to the age of 15 are entitled to free sight tests, as are children aged 16&#150;18 if they are in full time education.
<P>

<a name="30714w28.html_para2">The Special Educational Needs Code of Practice provides practical advice to local education authorities, maintained schools and others on carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for children's special educational needs, including for children with visual impairment. The Code aims to promote consistency of approach, but, within its guidelines, it is for schools and LEAs to determine appropriate intervention based on an assessment of each child's individual needs and circumstances.

 The Teenage Pregnancy Strategy national campaign was launched in October 2000 with advertisements, aimed at boys and girls aged 13&#150;17, running in popular teenage magazines and local independent radio. The campaign is supported by a freephone advice line and website. Local materials are also available for use by local teenage pregnancy strategies.
<P>

<a name="30714w28.html_para6">In the tracking survey carried out as part of the independent national evaluation of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy, over 70 per cent. of 13&#150;17 year olds recognised the advertisements, a level of recall associated with television advertising. The early success of the campaign was also recognised in the first annual report of the Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy (2001). Since October 2000 the freephone advice line has advised over 8 million young people, around 50 per cent. of who were boys.

<P>
<a name="30714w28.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 The most recent data for 2001 shows a 10 per cent. reduction in the under 18 conception rate and an 11 per cent. fall in the under 16 conception rate since 1998, the baseline year for the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. Participation of teenage parents in education, training or employment has doubled from 16 per cent. to 33 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30714w28.html_para7">These are early encouraging signs of progress towards meeting the Government's target to halve the under 18 conception rate by 2010 and increase to 60 per cent. the participation of teenage parents to reduce their long term risk of social exclusion.
<P>

<a name="30714w28.html_para8">However, evidence suggests that it takes many years to bring out the societal and behavioural changes required. That is why the Government have set out a 10-year Strategy.

 Further to the discovery of the use of hydrolysed proteins from non-chicken origin in chicken products on sale in the UK in late 2001, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) undertook a co-ordinated enforcement exercise with 20 local authorities. The exercise targeted those companies and products where use of hydrolysed proteins of non-chicken origin had previously been found. The results indicated that of the 25 formal samples taken, 12 tested positive for non-chicken DNA (either pork or in one case pork and beef).
<P>

<a name="30714w30.html_para3">The FSA is taking action to reduce the use of hydrolysed proteins of non-chicken origin in chicken products. As a result of the enforcement exercise, local authorities are taking follow-up action with the importers and suppliers of mislabelled chicken products, and will be making regular checks. The companies using these hydrolysed proteins can be identified from the licensed health marks used on these products, therefore the FSA is also working closely with the Dutch authorities to increase sampling and inspection of these manufacturers. Formal action has recently been taken against five Dutch processors. Following FSA pressure, the European Commission has agreed to improve rules on labelling of meat products with added water, but the FSA is calling in addition for a limit on added water of 15 per cent. and a ban the use of non-poultry proteins in this type of poultry product.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps he will take to improve the treatment of those suffering from acute personality disorders.  [124877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30714w32.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Government are committed to improving the care, treatment and management of people with personality disorder. One component of the work is the provision of appropriate assessment and treatment services for the small number of people with severe personality disorder (probably less than 2,500 nationally) who pose a continued risk to others. New facilities, in both prisons and secure psychiatric hospitals, will evaluate what the most effective methods of treatment are and consider how people can be helped back into society. This is known as the Dangerous and Severe Personality Disorder (DSPD) Programme.
<P>

<a name="30714w32.html_para2">In addition, "Personality disorder: no longer a diagnosis of exclusion"&#151;policy implementation guidance for the development of services for people with personality disorder&#151;was published by National Institute for Mental Health in England in January 2003. This guidance builds on standards four and five in the national service framework for mental health and sets out how services for people with personality disorder should be developed. It brings this often neglected and isolated area of mental health into focus for the first time.

 Clinical assessment of need is the key to effective ward organisation. "Mental Health Policy Implementation Guide on Adult Acute Inpatient Care Provision" (2002) and "Safety, Privacy and Dignity in Mental Health Units" (2000) provides the principles of achieving such effective organisation in detail.
<P>

<a name="30714w32.html_para3">The guides state that the focus should be on admission to the most appropriate setting in line with the patient's needs within a whole system approach. It also reiterates the need to have clear admission and bed management protocols in place, as well as the necessary clinical governance arrangements to monitor and address concerns in respect of unmet needs.

 Under the Care Standards Act 2000 the National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) is responsible for the regulation of independent health care and social care. The term 'independent health care' refers to private or voluntary establishments or agencies that provide care by medical practitioners, and such providers are registered as independent hospitals, independent clinics or independent medical agencies. Subject to Parliamentary approval of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill, the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection (CHAI) will take over responsibility for the regulation of independent health care from April 2004.
<P>

<a name="30714w33.html_para2">The NCSC is also responsible for the regulation of care homes in which nursing is provided, and nurses' agencies, but these are classified as social care and responsibility for their regulation will transfer to the Commission for Social Care Inspection from April 2004.

 In implementing the national strategy for sexual health and HIV, the Department of Health has published a sexual health promotion toolkit, which provides practical advice to those working in the field of sexual health promotion with young men, to ensure that they are proactively targeted and that services are open and welcoming. Also, the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy recognises that increasing the involvement of boys and young men in decisions about sexual health is crucial and young men are, therefore, included in all aspects of the strategy. The Department is also funding the Men's Health Forum to investigate men's perceptions and attitudes towards chlamydia and to identify the best way to target men, both with information and for screening.

 Stamp duty receipts processed by the Belfast stamp office, the only stamp office in Northern Ireland, amounted to &#163;55 million in 2002&#150;03. However this does not reflect the total amount of stamp duty (including Stamp Duty Reserve Tax ("SDRT")) paid by residents of Northern Ireland. SDRT on share transactions is collected via the CREST electronic settlement system and information on the geographical location of the underlying share transaction is not maintained.

<P>
<a name="30714w36.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 In common with all constituencies in the UK, Pendle has benefited from the stability created by this Government's new macroeconomic frameworks and reforms of productivity and labour market opportunities. This has, for example, resulted in a 23 per cent. fall in Pendle's claimant count unemployment, and an 88 per cent. fall in its long-term claimant unemployment, since April 1997.
<P>

<a name="30714w36.html_para0">As at November 2002, 3,428 families in Pendle were receiving the working families tax credit and 75 disabled people were in receipt of the disabled person's tax credit (now both replaced by the working tax credit and the child tax credit).
<P>

<a name="30714w36.html_para1">In addition, in 2003&#150;04 Pendle shire district council received a 12&#189; per cent. increase in formula grant from central Government, while the North West Development Agency's indicative allocation increased by 5.4 per cent. between 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="30714w36.html_para2">Pendle's constituents will also benefit from the Government's public services reforms and the &#163;61 billion increase in spending on public services over the next three years which was announced in Spending Review 2002.
