<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The future of the Multinational Brigades in Kosovo will be decided in the light of the major review currently being undertaken by NATO of its operations in the Balkans. The review, entitled the Joint Operational Area Review, will be discussed by NATO Foreign Ministers later this month. We welcome the review and remain committed to maintaining a military contribution to NATO peacekeeping in the Balkans. The form that this contribution will take has yet to be decided.

<P>
<a name="20514w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Preparations for this November's NATO Summit in Prague include work on a range of issues (including NATO's command and force structures, enlargement, resource management and Headquarters structures and processes) with organisational implications. I discuss these issues on a regular basis with NATO colleagues. We also work to ensure good contacts with the EU in relevant areas.

 None. We are working closely with allies and with NATO staffs to develop a capabilities improvements programme to build upon NATO's Defence Capabilities Initiative at the Prague Summit in November, and it is likely that improvements in airlift will continue to be a key objective. The existing European Airlift Co-ordination Cell already provides a means of sharing airlift capacity among a number of European countries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions whether a change in the material used to fill the package to be used to transport the mox fuel from Japan to Sellafield from argon gas to water requires the flask to be re-certified, proven and tested in compliance with the IAEA Safety Series 6 Regulations of the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials.  [54365]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The certificate of approval ceases to have effect in the event of any alteration to the composition of the package, the package design or in any of the facts stated in the application unless the Competent Authority confirms the certificate notwithstanding the alteration.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if the approval process for the shipment and the transport package for the mox fuel due to be returned from Japan to Sellafield has assessed the level of risk and consequences for all reasonably foreseeable incidents that could arise in United Kingdom territorial waters and during docking, handling and onward transport from Barrow to Sellafield, including <i>(a)</i> fuel criticality events, <i>(b)</i> flask drop and impact incidents, <i>(c)</i> fire and/or

<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The approval process assesses against the performance standards and test conditions prescribed in the recommendations of the International Atomic Energy Agency, which establish standards of safety designed to provide an acceptable level of control of the radiation, criticality and thermal hazards to persons, property and the environment, taking into account routine, normal and accident conditions of transport.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what role parish councils will play in the revised planning procedures envisaged by the Government for <i>(a)</i> major infrastructure projects and <i>(b)</i> other planning applications.  [56032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w01.html_spnew14"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Local planning authorities are required to consult or notify various organisations and bodies. This includes parish councils that have asked to be notified of certain applications. We are concerned that the present arrangements for consulting expert bodies on planning and other cases are not working as effectively as they might. The distinction between statutory and non- statutory consultees has become blurred and consultation can often be a source of delay.
<P>

<a name="20514w01.html_para1">One option proposed in our consultation paper "Planning: Delivering a Fundamental Change" is to clarify the basis of determining whether bodies should be statutory consultees and reduce their number. Decisions about which bodies might in future be statutory consultees will be made in the light of the consultation. The consultation paper also contains a number of proposals to promote better engagement of local communities in shaping the future development of their areas.
<P>

<a name="20514w01.html_para2">We have proposed the introduction of a new procedure which would enable Parliament to make a decision in principle on certain major infrastructure projects. It is for Parliament to determine how this procedure might operate and how representations from interested organisations, such as parish councils, might be considered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am announcing today the names of 10 local authorities with whom my Department will work on the development of PFI schemes. There will be five schemes providing additional social housing and five for joint service centres.
<P>

<a name="20514w02.html_para0">The authorities proposing the housing schemes are: Birmingham city council, London borough of Brent, London borough of Harrow, Slough borough council and Warrington borough council.
<P>

<a name="20514w02.html_para1">These schemes aim to provide additional social housing. They will help to increase the supply of affordable housing, help regenerate areas of low demand or provide housing for vulnerable groups.
<P>

<a name="20514w02.html_para2">The authorities seeking support for joint service centres are: Leeds city council, Manchester city council, Newcastle city council, North Tyneside council and Shropshire.
<P>

<a name="20514w02.html_para3">The purpose of these schemes is to give local communities improved access to a wide range of information and services and to integrate the information and services to be provided by the local authority with other local agencies.
<P>

<a name="20514w02.html_para4">We were impressed with the quality of all the bids received and it was a difficult choice as to which schemes were selected.
<P>

<a name="20514w02.html_para5">I congratulate those authorities which were successful in this round. We look forward to working with them to fully develop these bids into value for money projects.
<P>

<a name="20514w02.html_para6">Whether any of the above schemes ultimately proceed will depend on authorities working up business cases which satisfy the scrutiny of the interdepartmental project review group (PRG), which considers all local government PFI schemes seeking central Government support. Endorsement by PRG is essential before schemes can be put out to tender.
<P>

<a name="20514w02.html_para7">The total value of the PFI credits that will be allocated, if all these schemes are endorsed and proceed to contract signature, is &#163;100 million.

 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> Our "Road Safety Strategy" commits us to keep the driving test up to date. Since 1999, we have added 10 minutes more general driving to the practical car driving test so candidates can be assessed driving on higher-speed dual carriageways and rural roads wherever possible. Also, candidates who commit more than 15 less serious driving faults, as well as those who commit serious faults, fail the driving test.

 Parking dispensations and waivers are a matter for consideration by local traffic authorities as part of their overall parking policies. In London, a Health Emergency Badge (HEB) already exists for doctors and others involved in primary healthcare (such as nurses, midwives and health visitors). It can be used when the HEB holder is undertaking emergency or urgent work with patients away from the badge holder's normal base allowing them to park without payment in paid for parking places, in residents' bays and, if no alternative parking spaces are available, on yellow lines.
<P>

<a name="20514w02.html_para12">The HEB scheme does not allow holders to park their vehicles in a dangerous or obstructive manner. Further details about the HEB scheme may be obtained from the Association of London Government Transport and Environment Committee, First Floor, New Zealand House, 80 Haymarket, London SW1Y 4TZ.

 Recruitment and retention of public transport workers and their pay rates are the responsibility of the relevant transport operators. It is for them to manage their services to deliver the various performance targets set by the transport authorities within the context of the Government's policies. Measures to improve performance are taken as necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w03.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 From June 2001 the Transport Act 2000 provides a standard minimum requirement for concessionary travel in England and Wales. This ensures half fares for pensioners and disabled people on local buses, with no charge for the pass. Local authorities may make more generous provision at their discretion.
<P>

<a name="20514w03.html_para1">Following the introduction of the standard minimum requirement a survey taken last autumn shows that over half of authorities had a more generous scheme than previously and 17 authorities had introduced a concessionary fares scheme when none previously existed. Six areas provide free travel for pensioners.

moneys by local authorities in respect of revenue raised by them from parking meters and paid parking schemes; what the basis is for such restrictions; and if he will make a statement.  [55798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Section 55 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 requires local authorities to keep an account of income and expenditure in respect of designated on-street parking places. This section restricts expenditure of surplus on-street parking income to making good any charges against an authority's general fund, provision and maintenance of off-street parking, highway improvements and public transport schemes. There are no restrictions on the use of surplus income from authorities' off-street parking facilities.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w03.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Greg Knight: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what powers he has to prevent local authorities in England and Wales from issuing a greater number of residents parking permits than the number of residents parking places that have been made available by such local authority.  [55796]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Local traffic authorities have powers to introduce traffic management schemes on their roads, including residents' parking schemes, by means of traffic regulation orders (TRO) made under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. The Secretary of State has a reserve power under the provisions of Part 1 of Schedule 9 to the 1984 Act to intervene in the making of a TRO in a case where he believes that an authority is not satisfactorily discharging its duty under section 122 of the Act to secure the expeditious, convenient and save movement of vehicular and other traffic and the provision of suitable and adequate parking facilities on and off the highway.
<P>

<a name="20514w03.html_para2">The purpose of a residents' parking scheme is to ensure residents have preferential access to on-street parking in their area over others, such as those commuting into the area. Given the limited supply of kerbside parking space and possible multiple care ownership in individual households, an authority has to judge the balance between supply of spaces and the number of permits issued in drawing up a scheme. In practice a residents' parking scheme may not necessarily guarantee permit holders access to a parking space, but could be better than having an uncontrolled parking free for all.

 My Department has no plans to do so. Some local authorities already collect and monitor statistics relating to diversity and equal opportunity issues. However, this does not currently include religious affiliation of staff. In 2003 legislation against discrimination of grounds of religion or belief will come into force in order to comply with our responsibilities under the employment directive. All employers, including local authorities, will need to consider how best to meet their responsibilities under this legislation.

<a name="20514w04.html_para2">The primary responsibility for avoiding fatalities arising from work-related accidents and ill health rests with employers and workers.

 The Commonwealth debt initiative does not apply to Bangladesh.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to go as far as their talents and efforts will take them. The Learning and Skills Act 2000 sets out the statutory provision for the assessment of young people with learning difficulties and disabilities and the Connexions Partnerships will deliver that requirement. From April 2002, where a Connexions Partnership is not operational, the local careers service is required to draw up action plans for all statemented young people who are in their final year of compulsory schooling and who intend to leave school for further education or training. From the academic year starting September 2002, Connexions Partnerships, where operational, will be expected to conduct assessments for all young people with learning difficulties and disabilities (whether or not they have statements) who are in their last year of compulsory schooling, who are over compulsory school age but under 25, or if they are receiving or are likely to receive post-16 education or training or higher education.
<P>

<a name="20514w05.html_para6">Under the Learning and Skills Act 2000, the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) has a specific responsibility to help young people and adults with learning difficulties and/or disabilities (LDD). For those learners who wish to pursue a programme of further education, the LSC provides funding to enable colleges to provide the learning support necessary to ensure individual learners have access to their chosen programme of study, for 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 2002 : Column 531W</I><P>
example, to provide a signer to support a deaf/hearing impaired learner. Where learning needs are more complex or specialised, the LSC will work with Connexions and other agencies to secure appropriate boarding accommodation as part of a much broader learning package. Although most young people with learning difficulties should find their educational needs can be met locally, some will need to be placed in specialist colleges away from their home area. Connexions Partnerships can make flexible arrangements in the best interests of young people so that someone at a specialist college may be supported by a personal adviser from either their home or host area. We will ensure that Connexions and the LSC work together with learning providers, social services departments, health authorities and other support agencies, to ensure that young people with profound and complex learning difficulties have access to an appropriate mix of personal care and learning provision.
<P>

<a name="20514w05.html_para7">The Government have also demonstrated their commitment by introducing Part IV of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 as amended by the Special Educational Needs and Disability (SEND) Act 2001. From September 2002, it will be unlawful for bodies responsible for the provision of further education, higher education, adult and community learning and youth services to discriminate against disabled students or other disabled people by treating them less favourably than others. The Act covers everything from physical disability, hearing and visual impairment, to mental health problems and dyslexia. The Government have made &#163;172 million available over 2002&#150;04 to support the implementation of the Act; this will enable responsible bodies to raise awareness of and make any adjustments necessary to meet the needs of disabled people. Additional funding, guidance and support will be made available through organisations such as the Disability Rights Commission, the LSC and the Higher Education and Funding Council for England.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to the oral answer to the hon. Member for Bolton, South-East (Dr. Iddon) of 25 April 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 448, on the Learning and Skills Council, what the cost is of bringing funding for the education of 16 to 19 years olds in further education colleges in line with that of school sixth forms. [55276]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2002]:</i> Given the different ways in which schools and colleges are funded and the very much broader remit of colleges, comparisons on the funding of the education of 16 to 19 year olds are far from straight forward. My Department is currently considering the best basis for making sound comparisons. The Government remains firmly committed to bring up the level of funding of colleges towards that of school sixth forms. However, as we have repeatedly made clear, this will take time and must be done as resources allow.

 Five Trailblazer Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) were announced in December 2001. The expression of interest from the tourism and hospitality industry was not selected in this instance. However, non-selection as a trailblazer does not preclude a sector from submitting an expression of interest to form a SSC.

<a name="20514w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2002]:</i> The School Standards and Framework Act 1998 placed a duty on local education authorities and schools to ensure that infant classes for five, six and seven-year-olds taught by one teacher were limited to no more than 30 pupils by September 2001 at the latest. The legislation does allow the limit of 30 to be exceeded in certain circumstances. Such circumstances include, for example, the admission of an infant outside of the normal admission round, and for whom there is no other suitable school nearby, or on the direction of an admission appeal panel.
<P>

<a name="20514w07.html_para0">The January 2002 annual schools census found that out of a total of 61,527 infant classes, 329 (0.5 per cent.) classes containing 10,398 children, were reported as containing 31 or more pupils on the day of the count. Of these classes 249 contained 31 or more pupils because of reasons permitted by the legislation. Over 99 per cent. of all infants are now in classes of 30 or fewer.

<P>

<a name="20514w07.html_para4">The principles of the Learning and Skills Council's (LSC) common funding approach are based on extensive consultations since 1999.
<P>

<a name="20514w07.html_para5">The funding system is designed to be transparent, objective, and flexible enough to cope with different modes of learning. Key elements are: national base rates weighted to reflect the higher costs of some forms of training; rewarding achievement; additional funding recognising disadvantage factors; and an uplift to reflect the higher cost of delivery in London and related areas. The foremost principle is that funding follows the learner.
<P>

<a name="20514w07.html_para6">The Real Terms Guarantee given to sixth forms means that their funding will be maintained relative to 2000&#150;01 funding levels, provided pupil numbers are maintained. The Learning and Skills Council has calculated two figures for each sixth form&#151;its adjusted RTG and its LSC formula allocation&#151;and the school will receive the higher of the two. The Financing of Maintained School Regulations 2002 have been amended to ensure that sixth forms funded through the LSC formula see some benefit. For 2002&#150;03 schools should gain a minimum of one third of the difference between the RTG and the formula allocation, where that allocation is higher. We intend to amend the regulations further for 2003&#150;04 to ensure that such schools have a minimum two-thirds gain in that year.

<P>

<a name="20514w10.html_para5">An important part of this relationship is the Indo British Partnership (IBP), which was created in 1993.

 The UN Secretary-General did not commission the report from Professor Koechler. Professor Koechler's report was written on behalf of the International Progress Organisation. His assertion that the Lockerbie appeal verdict was "not a victory for justice" impugns the Scottish legal system which gave al-Megrahi a trial that met the highest standards of fairness. The Lockerbie trial demonstrated the crucial role of the criminal justice system in responding to terrorism.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what clinical tests for foot and mouth disease were carried out by departmental vets in England to establish the existence of foot and mouth prior to 20 February 2001.  [52313]<P>

 Any person who suspects the presence of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in an animal or its carcase is legally obliged to notify MAFF/DEFRA without delay. In England and Wales in the period 1 January 1999 to 20 February 2001, there were four occasions on which a private veterinary surgeon sought a second opinion from a departmental veterinary officer in order to rule out foot and mouth disease or consider whether to treat the case as a suspect. Three were in 1999 and one in January 2001. In all four cases, clinical examination by a departmental VO ruled out the possibility of FMD without the need for laboratory tests. The last of these cases was on 1 January 2001 in Lostwithiel, Cornwall. It resulted from a post mortem inspection from a private veterinary surgeon of two sheep. The veterinary surgeon did not suspect FMD but requested confirmation from a veterinary officer from Truro Animal Health Office. A visit to inspect the carcases took place the same day. Both the veterinary surgeon and the veterinary officer were confident that FMD was not present. This list excludes the discovery of suspect FMD at Cheale's abattoir by an Official Veterinary Surgeon of the Meat Hygiene Service on 19 February 2001, which was confirmed as FMD the following day.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the recent European Commission's Food and Veterinary Office report on the implementation by the French authorities of European rules on protective measures against BSE in France; what discussions she has had with <i>(a)</i> her French Government counterpart and <i>(b)</i> the European Commission about the report's findings; and if she will make a statement on the continuing French ban on imports of British beef.  [51455]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is the European Commission's responsibility to ensure that member states take adequate steps to follow up findings from the reports of Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) missions, to make certain that appropriate and timely corrective actions are taken and necessary improvements achieved. In the past, the Commission has prepared infringement proceedings as a result of the FVO's findings against member states which were considered to have taken inadequate steps to implement EU rules relating to BSE. It should be noted, however, that the initial response of the French authorities to the FVO's recent inspection suggests that serious attention is being paid to following-up the mission's findings, so as to rectify the deficiencies that the visit identified.
<P>

<a name="20514w12.html_para2">The Secretary of State continues to make it clear to both French Ministers and Commissioner Byrne that France should respect the 13 December 2001 judgment of the ECJ, which judged that the French ban was illegal. France should lift its ban on imports of British beef as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Operational responsibility for flood defences rests with the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards. I understand that the Environment Agency has reinstated and returned to their original level all of their flood defences that were damaged in autumn 2000. The agency has also investigated to a pre-feasibility stage all those defences that were identified as requiring enhancement and, where

<P><I>14 May 2002 : Column 555W</I><P>
appropriate, they have been included in capital investment programmes. Information is not readily available on this basis for local authorities and internal drainage boards.
<P>

<a name="20514w12.html_para3">This Department provided contributions of &#163;16.35 million to the Environment Agency and &#163;1.0 million to internal drainage boards in respect of emergency costs and repairs following the autumn 2000 floods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I plan to reduce the risk of flooding by investing in effective flood warning arrangements and in flood and coastal defences in the highest risk areas. This Department provides grants for flood and coastal defence capital works, and associated studies, which meet essential technical, economic and environmental criteria and achieve an appropriate priority score. However as the bulk of expenditure is ultimately met by taxpayers, both DEFRA and the operating authorities have a responsibility to ensure that value for money is obtained when funding works. Further to increases in the last two Spending Reviews, additional funding of &#163;51 million over the four years from 2001&#150;01 was announced in November 2000 following the severe flooding. In all DEFRA flood and coastal defence funding is set to increase from &#163;66 million in 2000&#150;01 to &#163;114 million in 2003&#150;04. Funding for future years will be considered in the Spending Review process. Responsibility for deciding which projects to promote and their timing rests with the operating authorities. The operating authority for each area draws on its local knowledge to decide what needs to be done.
<P>

<a name="20514w12.html_para4">Local authorities take the lead in providing emergency support to those affected by flooding and the costs so incurred may be eligible for refund under through Bellwin Schemes that are administered by the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions. The Government do not, however, provide direct financial support to those affected by flooding as it is generally an insurable risk. We are working with the insurance industry to help ensure the continued widespread availability of affordable flood cover.

 There are no plans to recruit State Veterinary Service (SVS) veterinarians during 2002&#150;03. The Government are determined to ensure that the SVS has the ability to operate with maximum efficiency and be able to respond rapidly to any emergency. For this reason, plans are being put in place to recruit additional staff should the need arise.

 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> At the inception of the UK Emissions Trading Scheme, the Government offered &#163;215 million to encourage organisations to take on voluntary binding emissions reductions targets for their greenhouse gas emissions. This incentive money was allocated to organisations through an auction in March. 34 organisations bid into the final round, taking on binding emission reduction targets totalling 4,028,176 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO <sub>2</sub> e) by the end of the five years of the scheme. The auction cleared after nine rounds at a price of &#163;53.37 per tonne of CO <sub>2</sub>  equivalent emission reduction. After tax, and when related to the reduction from the baseline for each year, this equates to about &#163;12.50 per tonne.

 It is difficult to separate out the effects of either of these events and estimates will depend on a range of assumptions. The best estimates that we have made, in conjunction with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport is that foot and mouth imposed economic costs of some &#163;3.1 billion on UK agriculture and the food industry (of which some &#163;2.6 billion was met by the Exchequer). In the case of businesses dependent on tourism the economic losses were estimated at between &#163;2.7 billion and &#163;3.2 billion as a result of estimated loss of revenue of &#163;4.5 billion to &#163;5.3 billion. The overall losses to the economy will have been much smaller than these estimates as expenditure on trips to the countryside (by UK visitors) which were foregone because of foot and Mouth appear to have largely been replaced by spending elsewhere in the economy, either in alternative tourist locations or on goods and services unrelated to tourism.
<P>

<a name="20514w14.html_para1">There are no comprehensive estimates of the effects of the events of 11 September on tourism or farming. However the International Passenger Survey reports that overseas residents' total expenditure on visits to the UK was down by 19 per cent. for the three months September to November 2001 and 13 per cent. for December to February 2002 compared to the same periods in 2000.

<a name="20514w14.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2002]:</i> The Department has made inquiries via the British embassies. Five member states appear to have sufficient treatment facilities to deal with all their fridges. It appears that four, like the UK, are complying with the regulations as they have plant operating which can partly meet their requirements and are exporting the remaining fridges. Five member states do not appear to have plants currently which can remove CFCs from insulation foam and are either storing or exporting them, or do not meet the regulation.

 DEFRA does not currently collect data on the rearing methods employed by individual duck producers or on the use of medicinal antibiotics in intensive systems. Antibiotics for ducks are licensed under the Medicines Act 1968 and are only available to counter disease on prescription from a veterinary surgeon.
<P>

<a name="20514w14.html_para2">Ducks are not kept in cages in the UK. Ducks must be kept in accordance with the Code of Practice on the Welfare of Ducks. The detailed recommendations for feed and water are: the birds should have easy access to adequate fresh feed each day, and have fresh water at all times; consideration should be given to the provision of water troughs which are deep enough to allow the ducks to get their heads completely under water; whatever feeding and drinking system is used sufficient trough space for feeding and drinking should be provided to prevent undue competition for feed or water; stale or contaminated feed or water should not be allowed to accumulate and should be replaced immediately; and efforts should be made to minimise the risk of drinking water freezing. The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2000 also requires that all animals must be fed a wholesome diet that is appropriate to their age and species.

 The Department's approach to agriculture is set out in our aims and objectives and in the recently published document "Working for the Essentials of Life".

<P>

<a name="20514w15.html_para0">We are currently taking this forward by seeking to reduce production subsidies through CAP reform and by consulting on improving dietary and nutritional advice. Oilseed rape is one of a number of crops that can meet farmers or consumers choices in these circumstances. Available figures indicate that the value of oilseed rape production to UK farmers is around &#163;275 million (including arable area aid payments) and that it accounts for about 2.6 per cent. of all agriculturally productive land or approximately 8.5 per cent. of the area of land on which arable area payments are claimed).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action the 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 2002 : Column 564W</I><P>
Government have taken since 1997 to prevent the killing of highly endangered species for bushmeat.  [53652]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Most endangered species are protected by national law in all the countries they inhabit; they are also protected internationally under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). While this Government cannot intervene directly in the protection of wildlife abroad we can and do make every effort to help other countries develop and implement their own wildlife protection measures and those required under CITES.
<P>

<a name="20514w15.html_para2">For instance, since 1997, concern about the increasingly unsustainable nature of the bushmeat trade and its effects on endangered species led to my Department raising the issue within CITES, which resulted in the establishment of a bushmeat working group to help central and west African range states develop and implement their own solutions. We have contributed &#163;55,000 to the working group to help the range states participate and to support the recruitment of consultants to revise and harmonise their own wildlife policies and legislation. UK work also takes place through the Convention on Biological Diversity, particularly through the forestry work programme recently adopted by parties.
<P>

<a name="20514w15.html_para3">We have also funded research. The results of one project, analysing existing knowledge and expertise on the bushmeat trade, highlighting gaps in data and understanding, and making recommendations on further action, have now been published and we hope that they will be of particular benefit to the CITES bushmeat working group. We have also provided &#163;248,000, through the Darwin Initiative, to the Durrell Wildlife Conservation Trust and Wildlife Conservation Research Unit to provide a model of the bushmeat problem in general and develop an integrated solution to the over-exploitation of wildlife in lowland forest areas in Africa.
<P>

<a name="20514w15.html_para4">Endangered species particularly at risk from the bushmeat trade include gorillas, chimpanzees and bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees), and unsustainable trade in bushmeat will be one of the issues addressed by the United Nations Environment Programme's new Great Ape Survival Programme (GrASP). My Department and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office have contributed &#163;175,000 to GrASP, some 10 per cent. of the total amount sought by UNEP. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office plans to make a further donation and our embassies and high commissions overseas have been providing logistical and political support to GrASP.
<P>

<a name="20514w15.html_para5">The Department for International Development (DfID), while primarily concerned with helping to eradicate world poverty, also recognises the need to address concerns about the pressures on endangered species of the bushmeat trade. DfID's concern about bushmeat is focused on the impact of the hunting, selling and consumption of bushmeat on the food security and livelihoods of poor people. For instance, DfID has supported the implementation of forestry laws in Cameroon giving communities the rights to manage their forest and wildlife resources. DfID feels the best way to encourage a sustainable bushmeat trade in Cameroon is to include it as part of a package of reforms strengthening the governance of natural resource management generally.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what savings public sector pension schemes are predicted to make from the projected growth in single pension households on a like for like basis; and what the estimated costs are of introducing unmarried partner pensions across the public services.  [55474]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 The Government set out their policy regarding the provision of unmarried partner pensions in their Green Paper "A new contract for welfare: Partnership in Pensions" (Cmnd 4179, December 1998): if the membership of a public service scheme wanted to extend eligibility for survivors' pensions to unmarried partners and were prepared to meet the additional costs, the Government would be prepared to consider how practicable arrangements could be devised for providing this within a statutory scheme.
<P>

<a name="20514w16.html_para22">An important factor underlying this policy is cost. Estimates by the Government Actuary's department show that the additional cash cost for introducing unmarried partner pensions across the public services could range from &#163;350 to &#163;1,000 million a year for the future service of current members, depending on the definition of dependent partner adopted and any restrictions imposed on the availability of benefit. There would be significant additional capitalised costs associated with any wider extension of unmarried partner benefits, for example, to cover past service.
<P>

<a name="20514w16.html_para23">Estimates of any potential savings public service schemes might gain from the projected growth in single pension households could be derived separately only at disproportionate cost. The expected change in family structures, however, is just one of a number of factors which influence the long-term costs of the public service schemes. Many of these factors are expected to result in an increase in long-term costs, with increased life expectancy of pensioners being highly significant.

 In 2001&#150;02 the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions paid nearly &#163;5 million in grants through the Powershift programme to help to meet the costs of converting vehicles to run on liquefied petroleum gas (LPG).

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> The Department for Work and Pensions was formed in June 2001 from the former Department of Social Security and parts of the Department for Education and Employment. We are currently undertaking a fundamental overhaul of the welfare system, transforming it from a passive organisation paying out benefits to an active system that fights poverty, creates opportunity and helps people become self-sufficient and independent. This is making a significant contribution to the Government's overall objectives of:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>eradicating child poverty in 20 years, and halving it within 10;
<P>
<BR>
promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age while protecting the position of those in greatest need; and
<P>
<BR>
combating poverty and promoting security and independence in retirement for today's and future pensioners.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20514w19.html_para2">Child benefit is now worth &#163;15.75 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.55 a week for other children: nationally about 7 million families receive child benefit, and in Stalybridge and Hyde 11,565 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="20514w19.html_para3">The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.2 million. Nearly three quarters of working age people are in employment and in Stalybridge and Hyde the proportion in employment currently stands at 75.5 per cent. Unemployment is at levels last seen in the early 1970s. Our new deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, disabled people, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. Nationally well over 600,000 people have been helped into work by the new deals and in Stalybridge and Hyde over 1,300 have been helped into work.
<P>

<a name="20514w19.html_para4">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. This winter (2001&#150;02) we have made available a winter fuel payment of &#163;200 for each eligible household to help with their heaviest fuel bill. We estimate that around 15,700 older people in Stalybridge and Hyde have received a payment this winter.
<P>

<a name="20514w19.html_para5">We want all pensioners to have a decent and secure income in retirement and to share fairly in the rising prosperity of the country. Our first priority has been to help the poorest pensioners.




<P>
<P><I>14 May 2002 : Column 580W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20514w19.html_para6">From April 2002 we will be spending an extra &#163;6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of our policies. This includes &#163;2.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners.
<P>

<a name="20514w19.html_para7">3,500 pensioner families in Stalybridge and Hyde are receiving the minimum income guarantee which helps our poorest pensioners. Some 14,600 pensioners in Stalybridge and Hyde will benefit from this year's increases in the basic state pension of &#163;3 a week for single pensioners and &#163;4.80 for couples. Those over 75, of whom we estimate there are about 6,300 in Stalybridge and Hyde, may qualify for free TV licences.
<P>

<a name="20514w19.html_para8">Other reforms include the new pension credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings and the introduction of the state second pension from this April. Both of these initiatives will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners. We have also announced that from October 2003 benefits currently reduced after a hospital stay of six weeks will not be reduced until 13 weeks. This will benefit both pensioners and people of working age.

 Jobcentre Plus and its predecessor the Employment Service has always involved the private sector in delivering its programmes for unemployed people.

<a name="20514w20.html_para1">Its contracted provision including programme centres, worked based learning for adults, basic employability training, short intensive basic skills courses and basic skills independent assessments is largely delivered by contracts with the private sector.

In addition, the private sector lead in the delivery of the New Deals in ten areas of the country and there is currently a competition under way for future private sector led New Deal contracts in these areas together with two new areas. In all Jobcentre Plus has several thousand contracts with over 1,000 providers to deliver programmes for individual jobless people. These providers are drawn from the private, voluntary and public sectors; we know that the majority, probably about three quarters of the total are private sector organisations.

 Most people will automatically benefit from the state second pension without having to do anything new or different.

This includes parents as well as carers.
<P>

<a name="20514w20.html_para4">We have produced information both on our website and as a leaflet to inform these two groups about the state second pension and to outline any action they may need to take to build up entitlement. We are also currently conducting promotional activity for carers and parents about state second pension, which includes press advertising in national and local press and relevant magazines, and direct mail to relevant advisory organisations. The costs for the current phase of the activity (from March to May 2002) are estimated at &#163;750,000, but will be subject to some revisions as the publicity activity is still ongoing.

 Since 1997 in London, youth unemployment has fallen by 44 per cent. and long-term unemployment has been cut by three quarters.
<P>

<a name="20514w20.html_para10">The Department's policies have played an important part in this success. Up to January 2002, the New Deal for Young People had helped 43,765 young Londoners off benefit and into work and New Deal 25 plus had helped 16,612 long-term unemployed people into jobs across the capital.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w20.html_spnew9"><B> Malcolm Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> Income-related benefits are not generally payable to, or in respect of, people who are resident abroad, regardless of whether they are in a monogamous or polygamous relationship.
<P>

<a name="20514w20.html_para12">However, when a person or their partner goes abroad temporarily, Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance already in payment may continue to be paid for the first four weeks of absence. This may be extended to eight weeks if the reason for the absence is to accompany a child for medical treatment abroad.
<P>

<a name="20514w20.html_para13">In Housing Benefit (HB), entitlement may continue in respect of each member of the household if there is a temporary absence from home of up to 13 weeks: this rule would include, for example, trips abroad to visit relatives or friends. But if the temporary absence is for more pressing reasons, for example medical treatment, HB can continue for up to 52 weeks. This more generous provision recognises the importance of HB in keeping roofs over people's heads.
<P>

<a name="20514w20.html_para14">These temporary absence rules apply in all HB cases, including those involving polygamous marriages. To make an exception for the latter would be discriminatory.
<P>

<a name="20514w20.html_para15">The amount of benefit payable includes personal allowances for the benefit recipient and one partner at the appropriate couple rate and, for each other partner, the difference between the higher rate for a couple and the higher rate for a single person. In general there is no financial advantage to claiming for those in polygamous marriages. Having separate claims for a couple and for other members of the marriage would normally result in more benefit being paid. Benefit entitlement for any additional partners is restricted to an allowance which is less than the rate for single people.
<P>

<a name="20514w20.html_para16">People in polygamous marriages are not entitled to contributory Social Security benefits in respect of their marital partners.

 The information available is based on local authorities' reported Weekly Benefit Savings (WBS) where fraud has been established. This information has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20514w21.html_para0">Tightening of the WBS criteria in 1998 was followed by a large reduction in the WBS achieved by local authorities in 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000. To address this, increased rates of additional subsidy were made payable to Local Authorities and a reduced level of penalty was introduced in April 1999.

<a name="20514w21.html_para1">In January 2000 the Department announced that it would replace WBS over 2 years from April 2001 with a new anti-fraud incentive scheme that gives greater financial rewards to local authorities for preventing and detecting overpayments and for punishing fraud.

 The Department for Culture Media and Sport is fully committed to sustainable development and promotes environmental sustainability through many of the public bodies it sponsors. These range from Royal Parks, which provide many examples of good practice, to the Science and Natural History museums which are increasingly instrumental in promoting public understanding of, and engagement with, sustainable development. On 30 April 2002, DCMS held a major conference at the Science Museum for representatives of all its sectors to create greater understanding of sustainable development issues and raise awareness of how each can respond to the challenges involved.
<P>

<a name="20514w22.html_para0">The Department does not directly operate funding schemes; applications for awards, mainly for lottery generated funds, are made to its non-departmental public bodies. Since 1998, DCMS has recommended to lottery distributors that the grants they award further the objectives of sustainable development, covering environmental, economic and social aspects. Bids are judged against the 15 quality of life indicators of the UK Sustainable Development Strategy (1999). As records of unsuccessful bids are not kept by distributors, there is no means of listing which bids were turned down.

 I understand that my hon. Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office will be writing to my hon. Friend about this matter shortly.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement on the backlog of immigration cases in the IAA; what the backlog is of cases waiting for decision by an immigration adjudicator; and what the average length of time was for a case to be dealt with from receipt from the Home Office to the hearing in the last 12 months.  [54500]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w23.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The IAA, as of the end of March 2002, was dealing with 4,114 adjudicator appeals, 36 leave to appeal applications and 39 substantive tribunal appeals in relation to immigration cases (not including family visit visas). In each instance, this level of work in progress is within or in line with expectation and hence does not amount to a backlog.

<a name="20514w23.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Open Government White Paper (Cm2290, July 1993) states that "Records relating to the Royal Family will be treated in the same way as all other records and only closed for longer than 30 years if they fall into one or more of the three criteria governing closure" (9.22). That practice still applies and the closure criteria used for public records relating to the Royal Family are therefore the same as for all other records. Any public record dating from before 1945 should now be open unless it is subject to one of the closure criteria, requiring a longer period of closure, in which case it will be re-reviewed when the closure period is due to come to an end.

 QinetiQ Ltd. are the contractors who are responsible for the technical aspects of the 1901 census online. Since the closure of the site QinetiQ have been carrying out technical enhancements and, once this work is completed, rigorous testing will be undertaken on all aspects of the system. The enhancements are intended to make the site sufficiently robust to permit general Internet access and are being carried out with a sense of urgency. However, the most important consideration is to ensure that the service is re-launched successfully. The service will again be made available at designated service centres as part of the general re-introduction of the site. General on-line searches will be available as soon as practicable following testing and availability at the service centres.

As the construction of the prison has not yet started it would be possible to change the specification to incorporate any changes required by the review, including the fitting of sprinklers.

 The proposals in the White Paper "Policing a New Century: A blueprint for Reform" set out a radical and ambitious programme of reform, with the overall aim of reducing crime and the fear of crime and tackling anti-social behaviour. The Government believe that the special constabulary has a key role to play in the fight against crime and the fear of crime. We are accordingly introducing a range of measures to improve the recruitment and retention of specials. These include improvements to the recruitment, training, conditions, management and deployment of specials&#151;focusing their role on intelligence-led patrolling and local crime reduction initiatives.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2002]:</i> We have targeted significant levels of resources at forces through the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) to recruit 9,000 officers over and above forces previous recruitment plans in the three years to March 2003. We made available &#163;58.9 million in 2000&#150;01, &#163;151.7 million in 2001&#150;02 with provision of &#163;244.0 million in 2002&#150;03 and &#163;272 million for 2003&#150;04 to meet the estimated continuing cost of officers recruited through the CFF.

Spending Review (SR) 2000 provided a further &#163;30 million for next year. Police authorities receiving the grant must demonstrate in their annual policing plans each year how the resources are used to enhance rural policing and crime reduction and community safety in rural areas.

<a name="20514w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Since we announced in February last year that Standard and Enhanced Disclosures would be issued free by the Criminal Records Bureau in the case of volunteers, we have received some representations in favour of the provision of funding, principally to meet start-up expenses, and overhead costs of processing individual applications. Estimates by a number of organisations as to what such costs might be&#151;whether the organisation would be acting on its own behalf or, as an umbrella body, countersigning applications at the request of others&#151;have varied very considerably, depending upon a range of factors including the size of the organisation and the number of applications to be processed.
<P>

<a name="20514w26.html_para9">We have considered the representations very carefully but are not persuaded that it would be appropriate for Government funding to be made available for this purpose. In guidance for umbrella bodies, the bureau has urged that any charges made for providing the service should be kept to a minimum. Organisations wishing to use an umbrella body are advised to inquire about, and to compare, any such charges.
<P>

<a name="20514w26.html_para10">We have been determined that all those wishing to access the Criminal Records Bureau's service should have ready means of access. To assist bodies for whom registration in their own right is not appropriate, the bureau has encouraged others to register as umbrella bodies. Up to 23 April 2002, a total of 713 bodies had so registered, including 422 who are prepared to act as "open" umbrella bodies&#151;i.e., countersign applications at the request of others outside their own circle or sector (but possibly subject to a geographical restriction stated by the umbrella body on registration). The Bureau maintains a record of umbrella bodies by geographical area, which shows that there are good numbers of such bodies in each, with the exception of mid-Wales and north Wales where numbers are lower. But organisations seeking the services of an umbrella body are not confined to their own area. Voluntary organisations needing to find an umbrella body should access the Criminal Record Bureau's website www.disclosure.gov.uk, which has an umbrella body search facility, or contact the Criminal Records Bureau direct on 0870 90 90 811. Organisations are continuing to apply for registration, and the number of umbrella bodies will increase. Officials are exploring means of developing the network further.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to provide funding to local retail crime prevention initiatives in <i>(a)</i> town and <i>(b)</i> secondary shopping centres.  [53500]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced on 27 June last year the provision of &#163;15 million over three years from the capital modernisation fund to assist small retailers in deprived areas to improve the security of their businesses. &#163;3 million was available in 2001&#150;02 financial year, with a further &#163;6 million in both 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="20514w27.html_para0">This money, which is being spent on schemes identified by regional crime reduction directors, in conjunction with Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, will be used to help small retailers to improve security. This will be achieved by employing a variety of interventions, 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 2002 : Column 606W</I><P>
including enhancing the security of individual premises and improving the environment of shopping centres. Nearly 3,000 shops in 114 retail schemes in some of the most deprived areas in England and Wales benefited from first year funds. More shops will be assisted in the next two years.
<P>

<a name="20514w27.html_para1">The Home Office has also supported work undertaken to establish retail crime partnerships by funding a consultant post for the past two years. The consultant has worked closely with the British Retail Consortium to produce a definitive guide on how to establish and run a retail crime partnership and encouraged retailers and other stakeholders in main shopping centre areas to establish partnerships to tackle retail and related crime.
<P>

<a name="20514w27.html_para2">Funding totalling &#163;223,000 was also given to aid retail crime reduction initiatives under various programmes administered by regional crime reduction directors in the financial year ending 31 March 2002 and a further &#163;86,500 of funding is expected to be disbursed via regional crime reduction directors specifically for retail crime reduction initiatives in the current financial year.
<P>

<a name="20514w27.html_para3">Other funding under the Crime Reduction Programme, such as the &#163;170 million for schemes for the installation of closed circuit television, particularly in town centres will help to reduce shop theft as well as other types of crime in the locations where it is installed. Other initiatives such as the street wardens schemes will also be of benefit to retailers in the areas where they operate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Home Office does not collect information about the cost of retail crime. The British Retail Consortium conducts an annual retail crime survey and the most recent one, published in June 2001, estimated the total retail crime losses in the United Kingdom at &#163;1,481 million in 2000, compared to &#163;1,461 million in 1999. The same survey also indicated that retailers spent &#163;626 million on crime prevention measures in 2000 compared with &#163;554 million in 1999.
<P>

<a name="20514w27.html_para4">The survey of crime affecting retailers and manufacturers announced by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary on 23 April 2002, the results of which should be available next spring, will also provide up to date information about crimes against retailers.

 No applications have been received to impose child curfew schemes under section 14 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Sections 48 and 49 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which took effect on 1 August 2001, extended the upper age limit to 15 and allowed the police, as well as local authorities, to initiate schemes. Local areas are assessing the implications of these changes and we know that local consultation is taking place.

Although operational policing matters in Burnley, Oldham and Bradford, are the responsibility of the Chief Constables of Lancashire, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire respectively, I recognise the importance of the police to providing an effective response to racially motivated crime.

 I agreed an Emergency Fund of &#163;500,000 to support local volunteer bureaux and Councils for Voluntary Service facing imminent closure or the substantial loss of core services due to funding cuts. The crisis situation was identified by the National Association of Volunteer Bureaux (NAVB) and the National Association of Councils for Voluntary Service (NACVS) on behalf of their members. The Fund is administered by NAVB and NACVS. Applications were invited from NAVB and NACVS member organisations and assessed by an independent panel using criteria agreed by Government. An announcement detailing which agencies have been awarded grants will be made before the end of May 2002.

<P>

<a name="20514w29.html_para9">However, the JCVI sub-group concluded that there is a greater body of evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of the Lister strain rather than for the New York City Board of Health strain, and that the smallpox vaccine has been challenged in the field more often by the more severe form of smallpox "variola major" with the strain chosen by the UK Government. The JCVI sub-group also recommended that using a different strain of vaccine from that used in the United States offered the greatest safeguard if difficulties arose with the production of either strain ensuring that the alternative strain could act as a fall-back.

information about independent health care services to the Secretary of State for Health and to the public, but as it has been operating only since 1 April, it has not yet had time to gather this information.
<P>

<a name="20514w30.html_para3">We have announced our intention to establish a new tough independent healthcare regulator/inspectorate, the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection which will have responsibility for inspecting both public and private health care sectors.

 The NHS plan sets out our intention to increase numbers of staff across the healthcare professions. The targets for increasing the size of the workforce include 6,500 more therapists and other health professionals by 2004 over the 1999 baseline. Occupational therapists are included in this target and 



<P>
<P><I>14 May 2002 : Column 620W</I><P>
there are 1,250 more working in the national health service now than there were in 1999. "Delivering the NHS Plan", published in April 2002, sets out the expected increase in the workforce. It is expected that there will be 30,000 more therapists and scientists (including occupational therapists) between now and 2008.
<P>

<a name="20514w30.html_para4">The NHS plan also sets a target for 4,450 more therapists and other key professional staff entering training each year by 2004. Overall since 1996&#150;97 the number of places available to train as an occupational therapist has increased by 427 (44 per cent.) This will continue to rise as we make further progress towards achieving the NHS plan target.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The prescription information was obtained from the Prescription Cost Analysis (PCA) system and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions dispensed in the community, i.e. by community pharmacists and appliance contractors, dispensing doctors, and prescriptions submitted by prescribing doctors for items personally administered in England. Total prescriptions include not only prescriptions originating from general medical practitioners in England but also from hospital doctors, nurses, and dentists, provided they were dispensed in the community. Also included are prescriptions written in Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man but dispensed in England. The data do not cover drugs dispensed in hospital or private prescriptions.<P>

2. Opioid analgesics are those drugs defined in the British National Formulary (BNF) paragraph 4.7.2, "Opioid analgesics". The opioid drugs used in substance dependence are contained within the BNF section 4.10, and are methadone, buprenorphine and naltrexone. <P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20514w31.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Patients should not be charged for photodynamic therapy where it is being provided as an integral part of their national health service treatment.
<P>

<a name="20514w31.html_para1">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence is currently conducting an appraisal of photodynamic therapy. In the meantime, we have asked NHS bodies to continue with local arrangements for the managed introduction of new technologies where guidance from NICE is not available at the time the technology first became available. These arrangements should involve an assessment of all relevant factors including the available evidence on effect.

<P>
<a name="20514w31.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 2002]:</i> A study sponsored by the Macular Disease Society in 2001 estimated that there were 182,000 people with age-related macular degeneration with a best eye visual acuity below that judged appropriate for certification as blind or partially sighted. Around 10 to 15 per cent. of those will have the 'wet' type of the condition, for which photodynamic therapy is intended as a treatment. However, it is not possible to say in how many cases the treatment would be effective. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is currently appraising the effectiveness of the treatment. We are expecting the NICE guidance to be issued to the national health service in July, providing there are no appeals.

 All local authorities with social service responsibilities submitted their Quality Protects Management Action Plans (MAPs) to the Department of Health by the end of January. The Social Services Inspectorate has now completed its evaluation of the MAPs and I have considered their findings. The MAPs from all 150 local councils have reached an acceptable standard.

 Allocations to health authorities are based on an overall assessment of the resources required to cover inflationary pressures and deliver national targets. Allocations to health authorities 2001&#150;02 were made net of 2 per cent. efficiency savings (equivalent to around &#163;800 million). This means that health authorities needed to achieve the efficiency target to fully fund delivery of national targets and inflation. It is not possible to separately identify the savings made by national health service trusts.

 <i>[holding answer 29 April 2002]:</i> Hepatitis C is a blood-borne virus that is transmitted mainly through direct blood to blood contact. Currently the greatest risk of acquiring hepatitis C infection in the UK is through the sharing of blood contaminated needles and injecting equipment among injecting drug users.
<P>

<a name="20514w33.html_para0">Previously transmission occurred through transfusion of contaminated blood or blood products before the introduction of donor screening and of viral inactivation of plasma products.

<a name="20514w33.html_para1">Health care and laboratory workers are at risk of infection by occupational exposure to the blood of infected patients. Infection may be passed from mother to baby and by sexual intercourse but these are generally considered to be less efficient modes of transmission.

 <i>[holding answer 29 April 2002]:</i> The Department does not hold information centrally on the number of patients who have or who are receiving treatment for hepatitis C infection. In October 2000, the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) issued guidance to the national health service on the use of Ribavirin and Interferon Alpha in the treatment of hepatitis C. Health authorities and primary care trusts are under a statutory obligation set out in directions, which came into force on 1 January 2002, to provide appropriate funding for treatments recommended by NICE.
