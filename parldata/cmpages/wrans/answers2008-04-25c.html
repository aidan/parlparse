 The Government are aware that imports of subsidised biodiesel from the United States are having a negative impact on the competitiveness of the UK biofuel industry. The Government cannot, however, act unilaterally to resolve the problem. We have urged the European Commission to find a solution, and have lobbied the US authorities to make the necessary legislative changes so that US biofuel subsidies are limited to US domestic sales. The Commission has said that it will consider initiating a countervailing duty investigation on receipt of a properly documented complaint from the European biodiesel industry, and is expecting to receive such a complaint imminently.</p>

<a name="80425w0002.htm_brev13"><a name="08042576003556"><ul><p class="tabletext">I know you have continued to express your very close interest in the future of Alderman Blaxill School, a local authority school in your constituency, on a number of occasions. I am writing to follow up our meeting on 5 February, and to confirm what was discussed&#151;including the specific information you requested in your Parliamentary Question of 28 January 2008 (Official Report, column 32W) I am sorry that I have not been able to write sooner&#151;and what has happened since. First may I say that I was grateful for your very positive comments about your visit to Afghanistan on the Armed Forces Parliamentary Scheme and your acknowledgement that, regardless of some media coverage, morale was exceptionally high and the atmosphere among our troops wholly positive.</p>
</ul><a name="80425w0002.htm_brev14"><a name="08042576003557"><ul><p class="tabletext">I hope you found the meeting a good opportunity to pass on your views on the future of Alderman Blaxill School. I reiterate that the best possible education for all children in this country is at the heart of this Government's plans. I made the point to you that the MOD does not lead on education in the UK, although we are responsible for Service schools for children from Service families who are living overseas. For Alderman Blaxill School, it is the local authority that leads but with a responsibility to consult all those with an interest. This includes the local Service community, both through direct consultation and through their representatives in an Armed Forces context, the local chain of command. For that reason I was pleased that Colonel Tony Phillips, the Deputy Garrison Commander in Colchester, and Lieutenant Colonel (Retired) Ray Housley, the Army Welfare Service lead for these matters in Colchester, were able to join us for the meeting. It was clear that there is close contact between you and Colonel Phillips on a range of local issues. This is the right basis of Ministry of Defence (MOD) involvement in an issue like planning for local schools; it is the local chain of command who understand the local conditions and can, on a daily basis, look out for the best interests of their people.</p>
</ul><a name="80425w0002.htm_brev15"><a name="08042576003558"><ul><p class="tabletext">In turn you made some good points about the importance of pastoral support in schools, not least for Service children. I agree with you; that support will need to be strong whatever the shape of education is in Colchester in the future. We may have some good practice to offer here from our experience with Service schools overseas within our Service Children's Education (SCE) Agency. This is being considered by the Service Children In State Schools (SCISS) forum, which is run by and for head teachers from schools in England with a significant population of children from Service families. They are developing a booklet that will offer a range of advice and best practice to schools, so that they can offer the best possible support to Service children. The forum has the support and involvement of both MOD and Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) officials. The guidance will be made widely available, for example through teachernet, the key DCSF online resource for all teaching professionals in England.</p>
</ul><a name="80425w0002.htm_brev16"><a name="08042576003559"><ul><p class="tabletext">At our meeting you heard that Colonel Phillips was fully satisfied with the approach of the local authority on plans for Alderman Blaxill School, in relation to the engagement that had occurred and the consultation that had been planned and undertaken. He felt that Service families had had every opportunity to understand what was being proposed and to comment on it. The MOD cannot, of course, take a central view on all proposals for the future of individual schools in UK. But we do expect there to be good local interaction, so that Service families affected can be confident that their voices can and will be heard. I am confident that this has happened in this case, and I hope you were reassured on that point by Colonel Phillips.</p>

representatives of the circumstances of Alderman Blaxill and Thomas Lord Audley Schools and that a recommendation had been made to consider their replacement with an Academy. The local authority wanted to ensure that Service families affected could be made aware of any subsequent proposals and involved in any consultation. A second meeting was held on 17 October 2007 between Lieutenant Colonel Housley and Mr Wright. The aim of the meeting was for the consultation process to be explained and the consultation documentation described. There was also some discussion of the best way to encourage engagement with Service families. Finally, I can confirm that there were no Ministers or Essex County Councillors at either of the meetings.</p>

I should add that the Garrison staff worked to make this happen, although this did not involve further meetings with the local authority. Since our meeting we have been waiting for the results of the consultation but at this time I have little to pass on. There has been telephone contact between Colchester Garrison and local authority staff which has confirmed that the consultation had drawn 236 responses. It is not possible to state how many of those were from Service families but the local authority have noted strong interest from Service families at meetings held during the consultation period. Like you, we look forward to hearing the outcome of the consultation in due course.</p>

I hope that you are reassured that the MOD has played a proper part in ensuring that Service families have a free and open opportunity to make their views known on the future of the school, although the responsibility for deciding on that future does not lie with the MOD.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 April 2008]:</i> The purpose of the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) is to support the provision of infrastructure needed to support the development of an area. This infrastructure could be at the regional, sub-regional or local level, including at parish level. The Government's initial proposals for the process of identifying the infrastructure are set out in the Community Infrastructure Levy document of 24 January which is available in the House Library.</p>

 The planning process remains the route by which eco-town proposals would be decided. In some cases the principle of development has already been established in the local development framework, in others this may involve reviews of and/or new development plans coming forward, and in some cases revised regional spatial strategies (RSS). We expect the RSS reviews announced in the Housing Green Paper (which depending on the region will be prepared between now and 2011) to test the longer term issues that arise from the eco town proposals&#151;such as the ultimate size of new settlements. RSS reviews are informed by and incorporate the regional transport strategies, which will take into consideration all proposals for growth.</p>

 The Communications Act 2003 does not require specific quotas of dedicated children's programming. However, the programming commitments of licensed public service broadcasters are set out in their statements of programme policy and they are required to consult and take account of the views of Ofcom on proposals for significant changes to those. In performing its functions, the BBC Trust is also required under the Charter and Agreement to have regard to the purposes of public service television broadcasting set out in section 264 of the Act, including that related to the provision of children's programming, and has currently undertaken to provide CBeebies, a channel for very young children, and CBBC, for the pre-teen audience.

 Successive Governments have regarded Tibet as autonomous while recognising the special position of the Chinese authorities there. We have consistently informed the Chinese government of our view that greater autonomy should be granted to the Tibetans. But like all other EU members, we do not advocate Tibetan independence. We have emphasised that the current political difficulties in Tibet can best be resolved through dialogue between the Chinese government and the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama has stated publicly that he opposes violence and does not seek independence, but greater autonomy for Tibet. We consider that this provides a basis for a negotiated settlement to the issue of Tibet.</p>

 Civil unrest over economic and social issues is growing, especially in the south of Yemen. Most of the grievances are shared nationally: lack of jobs, the rising prices of basic commodities including fuel and food and an inadequate safety net for the genuinely needy. Some southerners are calling for secession from the north and a return to two states, as before 1990. Most Yemenis want a single Yemen and national unity remains safe. But the Government of Yemen needs to address the issues that are generating discontent in the south of their country.</p>

The detention of a person is subject to review by the Review Officer and consideration of extensions of detention from 24 hours to 36 hours is subject to the authority of a Superintendent. Any period in excess of 36 hours is subject to the authority of a magistrate. The detainee must be charged with an offence or referred to the CPS for a charging decision when the custody officer considers there is a realistic prospect of conviction. When bail is granted prior to charge, any time the suspect spends at the police station in answering bail counts towards the detention time limits set out in PACE.</p>

the context of a dynamic security situation, my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Justice and Lord Chancellor announced on 25 March that we are proposing to repeal sections 132 to 138 of the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. In moving to repeal these provisions, we are also inviting the views of Parliament on whether additional provision is needed to ensure that the operation of Parliament is safeguarded. Our view is that Parliament is well placed to decide what needs to be secured to ensure that Members of both Houses are able freely to discharge their responsibilities. We invite their views on whether additional provisions is needed, for example to keep open the passages leading to the Palace of Westminster and to ensure that excessive noise is not used to disrupt the working of Parliament.</p>

 The Efficiency and Productivity Strategy for the Police Service 2008-11, which has been agreed jointly with the Association of Chief Police Officers and the Association of Police Authorities, recognises that the police service could obtain better value from expenditure on goods and services, for example through increased collaborative procurement.</p>

These have been in place since 1992 and are regularly re-tendered. The arrangements are strongly encouraged by the Association of Chief Police Officers and HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. The most recent version (spring 2005) was designed to assist forces in rationalising the variety of models in use, to encourage standardisation and deliver further increases in value for money.</p>

 Police forces continue to evaluate the use of alternative fuels and indeed the National Association of Police Fleet Managers is applying environmental issues increasingly to future vehicle procurement on a national scale. The general trend is to move away from high carbon emission engines, including high performance vehicles. Currently, there are selective uses where non-fossil fuel vehicles can be used but these are very limited at present and are dependent on individual police force operational activities.</p>

 The police service procures vehicles using framework arrangements managed by National Policing Improvement Agency and the National Association of Police Fleet Managers. It is a legal requirement that such frameworks are procured in accordance with European Union procurement directives and United Kingdom public procurement regulations that prevent discrimination on national grounds. These framework arrangements enable police fleet managers to order vehicles and parts efficiently, thus delivering best value for money to the taxpayer. Since the safety of police officers and the public is paramount, all vehicles procured in this manner must meet demanding police specifications and are subjected to rigorous testing, including EuroNCAP safety ratings.</p>

 The military wing of Hamas (the Izz al-Din al-Qassem Brigades) was proscribed in 2001 due to its concern in terrorism. Other parts of Hamas, such as those which deal with its political and social and humanitarian activities, are not proscribed. The proscription of the Hamas Izz al-Din al-Qassem Brigades would not therefore preclude discussions with the political leadership of Hamas should circumstances favour such contact.</p>

<p><a name="st_202"><a name="08042576003243"><a name="80425w0020.htm_spnew1"><a name="08042576004062"><b>Mr. Straw:</b>
 A persistent young offender is a young person aged 10-17 who has been sentenced by any criminal court in the UK on three or more separate occasions for one or more recordable offence, and within three years of the last sentencing occasion is subsequently arrested or has an information laid against them for a further recordable offence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_223"><a name="80425w0020.htm_para1"><a name="08042576003244">Overall timeliness statistics and caseloads counts on Persistent Young Offenders (PYOs) are available from 1997 to 2007. These statistics are used to monitor the pledge to halve the average time from arrest to sentence for dealing with PYOs in England and Wales from 142 days in 1996 to 71 days.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_224"><a name="80425w0020.htm_para2"><a name="08042576003245">Counts of offenders split by the Criminal Justice System (CIS) areas of the sentencing court are not readily available. Instead, the following table presents figures split by the CIS areas where offenders were first arrested or reported. This is because local area figures are most accurately derived from the Police National Computer on this basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_225"><a name="80425w0020.htm_para3"><a name="08042576003246">The following table shows the number of PYOs assigned to the police forces in 1997 and 2007. The increase in the number of PYO convictions is broadly consistent with the increase we have seen in recent years in the number of all offences brought to justice. In the year to September 2007 there were 1.44 million offences brought to justice&#151;an increase of 44 per cent. on 2001-02. This reflects improvements in the performance of the CJS, rather than an increase in the level of crime. Recorded crime has been falling since 2003-04. The increase in those meeting the PYO definition is partly a consequence of improvements in the timeliness of dealing with such offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="80425w0020.htm_para4"><a name="08042576003247">The definition of a PYO relies on counting successive sentencing occasions for a single offender during a limited time period. Speedier operation of the youth justice system has markedly reduced the average time taken from arrest to sentence, and as a result the number of offenders who fall within scope of the PYO definition has increased. This was a particular issue from 1997 to 2002, the period during which these timeliness improvements were taking effect.</p>

 Youth Offending Teams' assessments no longer make a simple distinction between &#147;vulnerable&#148; and &#147;not vulnerable&#148;. The Youth Justice Board found that these terms were too general to provide a sound basis for decision-making. Instead, risk factors such as previous self-harm, mental health or drug dependency issues are recorded. This information is used by the Board's Placement Team to decide on the most appropriate type of accommodation for the young person in question.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_230"><a name="80425w0021.htm_para2"><a name="08042576003499">Counts of offenders split by the Criminal Justice System (CIS) areas of the sentencing court are not readily available. Instead, the table presents figures for offenders first arrested or reported in the Metropolitan police area. This is because local area figures are most accurately derived from the Police National Computer on this basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_231"><a name="80425w0021.htm_para3"><a name="08042576003500">The table shows the number of PYOs assigned to the Metropolitan police force in each year since 1997. The increase in the number of PYO convictions is broadly consistent with the increase we have seen in recent years in the number of all offences brought to justice. In the year to September 2007 there were 1.44 million offences brought to justice&#151;an increase of 44 per cent. on 2001-02. This reflects improvements in the performance of the CJS, rather than an increase in the level of crime. Recorded crime has been falling since 2003-04. The increase in those meeting the PYO definition is partly a consequence of improvements in the timeliness of dealing with such offenders.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_232"><a name="80425w0021.htm_para4"><a name="08042576003501">The definition of a PYO relies on counting successive sentencing occasions for a single offender during a limited time period. Speedier operation of the youth justice system has markedly reduced the average time taken from arrest to sentence, and as a result the number of offenders who fall within scope of the PYO definition has increased at national level. This was a particular issue from 1997 to 2002, the period during which these timeliness improvements were taking effect.</p>

HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
All Diagnoses count of episodes&#151;primary and secondary-drug related:<br>
These figures represent a count of all FAEs where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br>
The International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-IO codes used to identify a drug related diagnosis are as follows.<br>
<sup>(1)</sup>A &#145;drug&#146; can be defined, broadly speaking, as any substance that alters normal bodily function. Therefore, all codes relating to noxious substances and solvents have been included. It is not possible to identify in ICD-10 all diseases caused by drugs (legal or illegal) and there is no way to guarantee, that the admission was drug related. For example, a patient admitted for inguinal hernia surgery may also be dependent on a drug.<br>
