 The Big Lottery Fund was launched on 1 June 2004 following the administrative merger of the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) and the Community Fund. The National Lottery Bill, currently before Parliament, will establish one new body, which will replace the two existing Funds and the Millennium Commission and have responsibility for distributing half the money for good causes from the National Lottery. The Big Lottery Fund will build on the achievements of NOF and the Community Fund, but will be a genuinely new body. There will be much more opportunity to involve the public in priority setting, getting local people actively involved in improving life in their communities.

 The impacts of free trade in agricultural products on biodiversity will be largely determined by the subsequent business decisions made by farmers. Prior to reform of the Common Agricultural Policy, production decisions were influenced by the subsidy regime. To monitor and evaluate the impacts of changes in farmers&#039; production decisions, Defra will establish a range of improved monitoring processes including an &#039;observatory&#039; function. This will look at the environmental impacts of the reforms as a result of changes in farm practices and production levels. We have commissioned a scoping study to help us define this function and are currently considering options for delivering it.

<sup>(1)</sup>In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak.<br>

By 2008, half of all parents of primary aged children will be able to access the child care offer. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with voluntary and private sector providers, including local child minders.

<a name="stpa_28">The core offer for secondary schools includes study support and enrichment activities, widespread community use of school&#039;s facilities, family learning activities, swift and easy referral from every school to a wider range of specialised support services for pupils and a child care guarantee, or youth offer&quot; available between 8 am and 6 pm on weekdays. By 2008, at least a third of all secondary schools sites will be open year round and beyond the school day offering a range of interesting activities for young people. All schools will be doing so by 2010. Provision could be available in a local school, in a neighbouring school or on a different site, provided by the school or in partnership with

voluntary and private sector providers, including local child minders. We will also be testing out demand for a formal child care guarantee that is 8 am to 6 pm particularly for children aged 11&#150;12.

<a name="50208w08.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_29">Schools will need to adopt new and innovative approaches to recruiting and deploying staff to ensure there is a staffing structure appropriate to the extended services they wish to deliver. Schools should look at the expertise both within the school and locally to determine who can best deliver each aspect of extended services. This will include working effectively with other services and with the voluntary, private and community sectors. In some cases school staff, such as support staff and teaching assistants, will already have the relevant skills and experience and may want to help deliver some of the services such as child care.

<a name="stpa_30">The Government will be producing a strategy for the children&#039;s workforce shortly, following up the vision in Every Child Matters: Change for Children&quot;. This will include national and local action to ensure we can attract and retain the right people at all levels in this workforce, including those in extended schools. It will include simpler and more rewarding career pathways, alongside better workforce planning locally and more focused use of investment that is already being made to improve the knowledge and qualifications of people in different roles. We will also promote greater focus on good leadership, management and supervision. Remuneration levels will remain, for most of these workers, a matter between them and their employer.

<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_31">The Department have already committed around &#163;50 million over the period 2003&#150;04 to 2004&#150;05 for the development of extended schools, with the money targeting areas serving disadvantaged communities. Just under &#163;44 million of that &#163;50 million was paid via the Standards Fund (including &#163;2.8 million made available by the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit and &#163;1.8 million from the Home Office) and &#163;6.8 million was paid through the Sure Start General Grant. In addition to this &#163;14 million from the Young People&#039;s Fund element of the Big Lottery Fund has been made available to 78 local authorities over three years from 2004&#150;05 to support the development of extended schools across their areas. In the financial year 2005&#150;06 my Department will make available just over &#163;107 million to support the development of extended services in both primary and secondary schools in all local authorities. In later years we will provide further sums including funding to support the development of school based child care. An announcement will be made in due course.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_32">Funding to support the delivery of extended services, including the school age child care offer can be used flexibly by local authorities for both capital and revenue purposes to help overcome barriers that they may face in developing extended services. This can include minor capital works such as refurbishment of reception or play areas, and revenue funding, for example, to support a senior management post that might work across a cluster of schools to develop extended services. The funding is aimed at kick- starting the delivery of extended services but over time, these services should become self&#151;sustaining within existing funding strands or through charging. Schools can charge for some services such as community use of the schools premises 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Feb 2005 : Column 1385W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
and child care. In the case of school based child care, parents, who are eligible, can claim part of the cost through the child care element of the working tax credit. Some services such as study support and other curriculum-related enrichment services will be developed by schools making best use of their existing baselines. Other services such as health and social care should be supported by budgets that support those services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_33">My Department is supporting local authorities to work with schools, local child care providers and local partners in delivering the extended schools programme in logistical ways too. In 2002, the DfES published extended schools guidance that provides information and advice on a range of legal, financial and practical issues. The Extended Schools Prospectus, trailed in the Prime Minister&#039;s speech to the Daycare Trust on 11 November, will set out the vision for extended schools to schools, local authorities and stakeholders in health, social care and the private and voluntary sectors. It will include a core document that will be supported by a number of on-line know how leaflets that draw on the practical experience of schools already delivering services. These will include case studies, &#039;how to&#039; advice, &#039;hints and tips&#039; as well as emerging evidence of the impact on child outcomes. The prospectus and know how pack will be made available on the web, so that new issues can be addressed as they emerge. The prospectus will be launched shortly. The website www.teachernet.gov.uk/extendedschools also features a number of case study examples of schools delivering extended services that schools and other interested parties might use to draw upon key lessons. The DfES has also appointed ContinYou to run The Extended Schools Support Service (TESSS) to support and advise schools and LEAs developing an extended schools approach, and which includes advice on developing links with the community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w08.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_34">My Department is very committed to research on extended services and child care in schools. We have in progress an evaluation looking at the impacts of full service extended schools on children, their families and communities; a nationally representative survey of schools to measure the prevalence and characteristics of extended services and child care; and an evaluation of an Extended Schools Childcare pilot. Initial findings from these projects will be published by the Department in summer 2005, autumn 2005 and spring 2006 respectively.

1.Price Base: Real terms at 2003&#150;04 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 30 September 2004.<br>

2.Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of education SSA/EFS settlements and exclude the pensions transfer to EPS and LSC.<br>

3.Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES Departmental Expenditure Limits relevant to pupils aged 3&#150;10 and 11&#150;15 and exclude EM As and grants not allocated at LEA level.<br>

4.The pupil numbers used to convert &#163; million figures to per pupil are those underlying the SSA/EFS settlement calculations plus PLASC 3-year-old maintained pupils and estimated 3&#150;4 year-olds funded through state support in maintained and other educational institutions where these are not included in the SSA pupil numbers.<br>

5.Rounding: Figures are rounded to the nearest 10.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assistance the UK will provide to the South East Asia region in establishing a tsunami early warning system.  [213280]</p>








<p><a name="st_92"><a name="50208w10.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 There is strong political will, both within the Indian Ocean region and internationally, to establish a tsunami Early Warning System in the Indian Ocean. This will involve countries in South East Asia and around the Indian Ocean working together to produce a workable and well co-ordinated system, building on those components already in place. The immediate need is for the countries in the region to determine the nature and organisation of the system they want.

<p>
<a name="50208w10.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_41">A recent meeting organised by the Thai Government in Phuket reached a strong consensus on some important features of an early warning system for the region. It should: be designed and owned by countries in the region; build on mechanisms that already exist; and warn against multiple hazards, such as tropical storms and storm surges as well as tsunamis. It was also agreed that the UN should co-ordinate the development of the system and that investment should focus, not just on highly technical solutions, but on educating, and communicating any warning to, coastal communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w10.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_42">The UK stands ready, if needed, to provide support to an early warning system once countries of the region have made progress on the design of a system. However, if there are other donors willing to provide all the finance needed&#151;as looks likely&#151;the UK is also willing to step aside and focus its resources on other equally important but less well funded measures to reduce the impact of disasters. Chief among these is the need to help developing countries of the region build on and enhance their own capacity to manage and reduce their risk to disasters.

 Local probation areas have always liaised with local communities in order to identify work which can usefully be undertaken by offenders.

 Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: Housing (PPG3)&quot; explains that local authorities requirements for car parking, especially off-street car parking, are a significant determinant of the amount of land needed for new housing. In the 1990s, car parking 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>8 Feb 2005 : Column 1442W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
standards for housing became increasingly demanding and were applied too rigidly, often as minimum standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w24.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_151">With this in mind, PPG3 says that local authorities should have parking standards which allow for significantly lower levels of car parking provision where appropriate. For example, this could apply to developments:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83">in locations like town centres where services are accessible by walking, cycling or public transport;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_85">involving the conversion of housing or non-residential buildings where off-street parking is less likely to be successfully designed into the scheme.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w24.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_152">PPG3 advises that parking policies should be framed with good design in mind while recognising that car ownership varies with income, age, household type and location. The Planning for Housing statement of 17 July 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 53WS, explained that car parking standards should result in an average of 1.5 off-street car parking spaces per dwelling over an authority&#039;s area. As this is an average, this does not mean that the Government expects all dwellings in new developments to have 1.5 car parking spaces. Policies which would result in higher levels of off-street parking, especially in urban areas, should not be adopted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50208w24.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_153">To help the development of appropriate standards, the Government are carrying out research to consider how varying levels of car parking can be achieved in ways consistent with their policies on sustainable residential environments. We aim to publish this research in summer 2005.

 The Stroud local plan sets out detailed planning policies and proposals for Stroud district for the period to 2011 and is being prepared in accordance with the adopted Gloucestershire structure plan second review which sets out broad, strategic planning policies for the county.

Regional planning guidance for the south-west (RPG10) was approved in 2001 and became the regional spatial strategy on commencement of the new Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act. RPG10 covers the period 1996&#150;2016 and is being reviewed as part of the preparation of a new regional spatial strategy (RSS) for the south west.

 Coventry city council and Centro receive funding for transport schemes through the joint West Midlands Local Transport Plan (LTP). The most up to date information we have is taken from the LTP Annual Progress Report for 2003&#150;04. Excluding maintenance, the allocation to the West Midlands LTP for that year was &#163;51 million of which Coventry&#039;s share was &#163;5.251 million.

<a name="stpa_167">The Annual Progress Report does not specify spending in particular areas but it shows that &#163;70,000 was spent specifically on miscellaneous facilities for the disabled across the city. Most of this would have involved the provision of facilities such as dropped kerbing. However, many other highway improvement and bus corridor schemes would routinely include provision for the disabled. For instance improvements to traffic signals, where these include works to pedestrian facilities, would also involve measures such as tactile paving and audible warnings.

<a name="stpa_168">Last year we gave approval to a &#163;28.8 million funding contribution to the Coventry Primelines major scheme, which aims to improve bus services throughout the city.

The debate concentrated on the identified priorities: negotiations on the financial framework for the budget of the EU during the period 2007&#150;13; the Lisbon strategy; freedom, justice and security; and the launching of the preliminary works for the application, after its ratification, of the treaty establishing a constitution for Europe. The AOP was previously discussed and agreed at the December GAERC. Copies are available in the Library of the House. The Council also took note of the programme of work of the new European Commission which was presented by Jose Barroso, President of the European Commission.

We, along with France, Germany, the Netherlands, Austria and Sweden, believe that the priorities of an enlarged Union can be met within a budget of 1 per cent. EU gross national income. This is sufficient to meet the challenge of cohesion provided that resources are focused on priorities&#151;namely the poorest member states.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps he plans to take to reduce waiting times for treatment for patients with <i>(a)</i> cancer and <i>(b)</i> brain cancer who are initially referred non-urgently but are identified as suffering from cancer.  [212213]</p>








<p><a name="st_304"><a name="50208w34.html_spnew2"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The NHS Cancer Plan sets out our strategy to reduce waiting times for cancer patients. A target of one month from diagnosis with breast cancer to first treatment was introduced in December 2002. 98 per cent. of patients with breast cancer were treated within this standard in the last quarter (July to September 2004). From 2005, there will be a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancer patients, including brain cancer, which will ensure that those patients who were non-urgently referred but subsequently diagnosed with cancer receive prompt treatment. Progress towards this target is being achieved through increased investment, additional staffing levels, installing new and replacement radiotherapy and diagnostic facilities and streamlining care processes through the Cancer Services Collaborative&#151;Improvement Partnership.

4.From November 2002, the methodology for producing these figures was changed to allow statistics to be published much sooner. This has resulted in a small increase in the reported caseload. This is because some cases which have actually terminated but have not yet been updated on the computer system are now included.<br>
