<P>
<a name="70728w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The suppliers' proposals were evaluated using a number of criteria under the headings business fit, viability and commercial assessment.
<P>

<a name="70728w01.html_para0">The criteria for the evaluation of the options within the proposals remain to be defined. They will include the closest attention to the proposals' impact on Prison Service staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many options are currently being considered in regard to Operation Quantum which are either <i>(a)</i> privately run, <i>(b)</i> mixed economy and <i>(c)</i> in partnership; and what assessment he had made of the most cost-effective option. [10090]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 This information is treated as commercial in confidence, being part of a competitive procurement between a number of suppliers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the effects which implementation of EC directives 80/181 and 89/617 has had on the ability of the police to identify suspects. [10335]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The implementation of these directives represented the final stage of the process of replacing imperial units with metric units as the primary system of measurement. We have no evidence that the adoption of metric units has affected the ability of the police to identify suspects.

<a name="70728w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Information is not held centrally on the time taken by the police to investigate reported breaches of the criminal law. The length of time taken to conduct an investigation will vary depending on the circumstances of the case. There are non-statutory time guidelines agreed by all the criminal justice agencies that cover each stage of the process from granting of police bail to commencement of a Crown court trial. Where a person is granted police bail with a duty to return to the police station, the maximum time guideline is three weeks unless a protracted investigation or other compelling consideration is involved. The Government are determined to cut delays in the criminal justice system, starting with a speeding up of youth justice.
<P>

<a name="70728w01.html_para2">The new criminal offences created by the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 came into force on 16 June 1997 and it is too soon to make any assessment of the time taken to deal with offences under the Act.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Flynn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what guidelines his Department issues to pet shops and traders on the sale of exotic pets; and if he will make a statement; [10787]
<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to introduce licences for those keeping exotic animals not defined by statute as dangerous; and if he will make a statement. [10784]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Department has not issued guidelines to pet shops about the sale of exotic pets. The Pet Animals Act 1951, as amended in 1983, controls the sale of all animals as pets from pet shops. The Act requires any person keeping a pet shop to be licensed by the local authority.
<P>

<a name="70728w01.html_para3">Before granting a licence, the authority must satisfy itself that the animals are kept in accommodation that is suitable and clean, that they are supplied with appropriate food and drink and that they are protected from disease and fire. The local authority may inspect licensed premises at all reasonable times.
<P>

<a name="70728w01.html_para4">There are no plans to introduce licences for those keeping animals, including exotic animals. The welfare of exotic animals kept as pets is provided for under the Protection of Animals Act 1911, which makes it an offence to ill treat or cause any unnecessary suffering to any domestic or captive animal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Maclennan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on what grounds the letter dated 20 July 1996 supplied by the assistant registrar Mohammedan of marriage and divorces, Nairobi is considered deficient as documentary evidence of the divorce in Kenya of Fatuma Njoki Ali Juma; and what further documentary evidence he requires. [10988]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The immigration and nationality directorate has no reason to doubt the genuineness of the divorce certificate in question, but inquiries have been complicated by the fact that when Fatuma Juma applied for entry clearance to join her current husband she told the entry clearance officer in Nairobi that she had not previously been married.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 1997 : Column: 3</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70728w01.html_para5">Having considered all aspects of the case, the immigration and nationality directorate does not now propose to remove Fatuma Juma as an illegal entrant.

<P>
<a name="70728w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will establish a system whereby released prisoners who have served long sentences prior to the Court of Appeal finding them to have been wrongfully convicted may receive counselling and other help in making necessary readjustments following their release.

<a name="70728w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 July 1997]:</i> Following their release from prison in any circumstances, the responsibility for meeting the health care needs of individuals lies with the national health service. It is open to anyone wishing to receive counselling support following release to seek a referral through his or her general practitioner. Alternatively, in cases of wrongful conviction where it has been established that an individual

<P><I>28 Jul 1997 : Column: 4</I><P>
qualifies for payment of compensation, he or she may apply for an interim payment to help alleviate any immediate financial difficulties or to pay for private counselling or other care. Prison Service discharge procedures include giving prisoners advice about the support services available to them and the probation service is expected to provide resettlement advice or help to released prisoners who ask for it.

<a name="70728w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Ieuan Wyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what studies his Department has evaluated into the correlation between attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder and juvenile crime; if he will make it his policy to ensure that juveniles convicted of more than three crimes should be assessed for ADHD by a medical practitioner competent in the pharmacological treatment of this condition; and if he will make a statement; [10506]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will introduce measures to ensure that <i>(a)</i> the police and <i>(b)</i> the Crown Prosecution Service obtain an assessment for attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder for children and adolescents convicted of more than three crimes; and if he will make a statement. [10505]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The incidence of hyperactivity, attention deficit and impulsivity at ages eight to 10 years has been found independently to predict future juvenile convictions. This finding arises from work by the Cambridge study of delinquent development, which was largely funded by the Home Office. Of course, the causes of juvenile delinquency are complex and wide ranging and hyperactivity is only one of many indicators. Research indicates that the following factors are particularly significant: being male; being brought up by a criminal parent or parents; living in a family with multiple problems; experiencing poor parenting and a lack of supervision; poor discipline in the family and at school; experiencing failure and disaffection at school; associating with delinquent friends; and having brothers and sisters who offend.
<P>

<a name="70728w02.html_para0">However, the Government are developing policies to bring about early identification of social and medical factors which may act as a trigger to delinquent behaviour or increase the likelihood of misbehaviour, not least by the inquiries at the "final warning" stage which we intend should lead to targeted intervention. The findings of the Cambridge study and other evidence of delinquent development will be taken into account as we draw up plans for the final warning which we intend to include in the Crime and Disorder Bill later this Session.

he has made of the proportion of the cost of detention centres accounted for by such young people; and if he will make a statement. [10538]

 Detention centres and youth custody centres were replaced by young offender institutions in 1988.
<P>

<a name="70728w02.html_para1">No such assessment has been made. The reports of two surveys of prisoners' mental health undertaken by the Institute of Psychiatry include findings about the prevalence of mental disorder in young men, although data on young women were not collated separately from data on adult women.
<P>

<a name="70728w02.html_para2">The first survey, the report of which was published by the Home Office in 1991 and entitled "Mentally Disordered Prisoners", estimated that 33 per cent. of sentenced male young offenders could be diagnosed as suffering from some form of mental disorder, including harmful or dependent use of substances, excluding cannabis. The corresponding figure for unsentenced young men in the report of the second survey, published by the Home Office in 1996 as "Mental Disorder in Remand Prisoners", was 53 per cent.

<P>
<a name="70728w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 25 July 1997]:</i> The Official Secrets Act 1989 protects only a very narrow range of information and only if the disclosure is likely to cause damage. We have no plans to repeal the Act since this would risk allowing disclosures which might harm the national interest.
<P>

<a name="70728w02.html_para4">With regard to a public interest defence, the 1989 Act is not concerned with embarrassing disclosures; it is concerned with disclosures that give rise to specific kinds of harm to the national interest. It is difficult to envisage how a public interest defence could be appropriately deployed in this narrow and specific set of circumstances. A person who knowingly harms the public interest so seriously that a prosecution under the Act would be justified should be criminally liable and it is difficult to see circumstances in which that harm could be disregarded because of the motives of the individual. If a prosecution is brought, the court is able to consider all the circumstances of the case in imposing an appropriate sentence and motivation would be a factor to be included in that consideration.
<P>

<a name="70728w02.html_para5">There is no question of a Crown servant needing to risk criminal penalties to bring suspicions of wrongdoing to the attention of higher authorities.

 The Chancellor's letter of 6 May to the Governor setting out the new monetary policy framework states that the four members of the Monetary Policy Committee appointed from outside the Bank will be allowed to engage in other activities only if they do not give rise to a conflict of interest and that they must seek the Chancellor's approval before so doing. They will provide the Bank with a full list of any outside activities. All the other members of the committee are subject to the Bank's terms and conditions of service for staff, which prohibit any activities that might lead to a conflict of interest. In the light of these provisions, there is no need for a register of interests for the members of the committee.

<P>

<a name="70728w04.html_para3">As set out in the 1996 and the 1997 Budgets, the real values of the control total, in 1995-96 prices, for the next two years respectively are &#163;254.8 billion and &#163;256.6 billion; and &#163;252.3 billion and &#163;252.2 billion.
<P>

<a name="70728w04.html_para4">In his Budget announced on 2 July, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced significant real increases for key priorities in 1998-99--NHS spending of 2&#188; per cent. and for current spending on UK schools of 2&#190; per cent. despite the higher inflation we inherited from the previous Government. We have also provided extra resources, as we also promised, under welfare to work and the capital receipts initiative which, as we have always made clear, would be additional to the control totals.
<P>

<a name="70728w04.html_para5">We will meet our obligations on these key priorities, but we will not lose sight of the need to keep a firm grip on inflation through the new framework for monetary policy and a close control on how we, as a Government, spend people's money. Cash planning without automatic inflation adjustments has been a key principle of spending control for two decades. It is not right to accommodate higher inflation by automatically increasing cash plans.

 The two Departments work closely together on matters of mutual interest, including the effects of agricultural policies on developing countries. We are collaborating on a study to examine how reform of the common agricultural policy can be of benefit to developing countries.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Phenylbutazone is currently being evaluated within the European Union for the purpose of fixing a maximum residue limit. If an MRL cannot be set, in principle the administration of phenylbutazone to a food-producing animal would not be permitted. However, in that event, the United Kingdom would use a procedure agreed with the European Commission--if a horse is not destined for human consumption, an MRL will not be required. Phenylbutazone could therefore continue to be authorised for use in horses in the United Kingdom. There would be a requirement that the product should be clearly marked to indicate that it cannot be used in any animal intended for human consumption.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 For sheep and goats, EC directive 92/102 has been implemented by the Sheep and Goats (Records, Identification and Movement) Order 1996. This legislation requires that sheep and goats going for export must have an ear tag or tattoo indicating their country of origin and a flock or herd mark either of the consignor of the sheep for export or of a previous keeper of the animal. The legislation provides for a system of identification and

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 It is unlikely to be in the United Kingdom's interest to press for additional European Community expenditure of this kind. EC requirements on the wording of plant passports have not altered since 1993, but separate EC legislation on suppliers' documents for certain plant material was implemented in 1995. This is being applied flexibly by allowing suppliers to choose the most appropriate way of providing the information that is not already given on plant passports, in order to minimise costs.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The United Kingdom's milk quota in the three-year period starting April 1994 was about 14.2 billion litres. Our total liquid milk consumption was about 5.5 billion litres. However, taking account of processed dairy products, we were about 90 per cent. self-sufficient in butter fat.

<P>
<a name="70728w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Abattoir returns indicate that around 90 per cent. of animals slaughtered under the over-30-months scheme so far this year were cull animals--cull cows and bulls.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The average weight of cattle entering the scheme to date has been of the order of 580 to 590 kg. On that basis, a saving of around &#163;12 to &#163;18 per animal could result from the imposition of the maximum weight limit. However, the actual savings that arise will depend on the weight and number of animals entering the scheme in the future.

<a name="70728w05.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 My colleagues and I have had several meetings with representatives of the farming industry since 1 May. There was no specific consultation on the reduction in the compensation rate for cull cows and the introduction of a maximum weight limit before the European Commission made its proposals, which the Government supported. However, Ministers are fully aware of farmers' concerns over the state of the industry and their views on the over-30-months scheme in particular.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of the reduction in public expenditure from the introduction of reduced grants for the slaughter of over-30-month-old cattle in each of the next three years; and what assessment he has made of the effect of the reduction on farmers.[10632]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w05.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The effect of the change in the over-30-months scheme will depend on the number of animals entering the scheme and their payable weights. Gross scheme expenditure is likely to be reduced by &#163;35 million to &#163;40 million in a full year.
<P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will make a statement on the consultations which he carried out prior to his decision to limit the level of vitamin B6 in dietary supplements; when he expects to complete the consultations currently under way; when he expects to consult other EU members on his proposals; and if he will invite the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment to review the evidence which led to his decision, with particular reference to research which produced different results to that on which his decision was based. [10631]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government's decision to limit the level of vitamin B6 in dietary supplements sold under food law was based on advice from two independent committees, the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment--COT--and the Food Advisory Committee. In formulating this advice, the committees took account of information 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 1997 : Column: 21</I><P>
supplied and views expressed by organisations with an interest in the subject matter. The organisations were invited to submit data on the safety of vitamin B6 to the COT which were considered before the committee finalised its advice. Their views on the possibility of a voluntary limit of 10 mg of vitamin B6 per daily dose were sought by officials from this Department as part of the FAC's consideration.
<P>

<a name="70728w06.html_para0">The Government were aware of the views that had been expressed by interested organisations when we considered the advice of the FAC. Our decision to accept that advice was announced on 4 July. On 23 July, my hon. Friend the Minister for Public Health and I met representatives of organisations who were unhappy with the proposed limit to listen to their concerns. I have also written to the National Consumer Council, the Consumers Association and the National Food Alliance, none of which had expressed reservations about the decision, to give them the opportunity to comment.
<P>

<a name="70728w06.html_para1">Further consultation with interested parties will take place once the regulations required to implement the proposed limit have been drafted. The European Commission and other member states of the European Union will be given an opportunity to comment on the proposed regulations at the same time.

<a name="70728w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Article 12 of EC regulation 258/97 concerning novel foods and novel food ingredients provides that member states may restrict or suspend the trade of such foods--those containing, consisting of, or produced from, genetically modified organisms--within its territory, where, as a result of new information or a reassessment of existing information, that state has detailed grounds for considering that the use of such food endangers human health or the environment.

 This Department has received a number of letters, including from local authorities, about the licensed landfill sites in which the carcases of cattle suspected of being affected with BSE--heads previously removed for diagnosis and subsequent incineration--were disposed of between 1988 and 1991. No BSE suspects have been disposed of by landfilling since 1991 when sufficient carcase incineration capacity came on stream to process the number of cases that were coming forward.
<P>

<a name="70728w06.html_para3">The Environment Agency has responsibility for the supervision of landfill sites in England and Wales which are licensed under part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The objective of the licensing system is to ensure that waste is disposed of without harming the environment or human health. In fulfilment of its supervisory role, the Environment Agency has carried out a qualitative assessment of all the landfill sites that took BSE suspects, taking into account the number of carcases buried, the degree of containment and the proximity of water sources. On the basis of those findings, it then carried out a further, more detailed quantitative assessment of a selection of sites which were judged to be typical of those sites judged to be most vulnerable.
<P>

<a name="70728w06.html_para4">The study calculations show that the likelihood of the most exposed individual ingesting, in one year, sufficient material to cause infection as a result of the landfilling that took place ranges from one in 1 million years to one in 10,000 million years, depending on local circumstances. In reality, however, the risk to the general public in each case will be well below the level of risk to the most exposed person. The agency believes that the risks assessed for the six sites studied in the quantitative assessments should be representative of the full range of risks posed by all 59 sites. A list of these was sent to each of the relevant Members of Parliament.

 The Government are committed to the maintenance of a strong defence industry which is a strategic part of our industrial base as well as of our defence effort. Defence exports can also contribute to international stability by strengthening bilateral and collective defence relationships in accordance with the right of self-defence recognised by the UN charter, but arms transfers must be managed responsibly, in particular so as to avoid their use for internal repression and international aggression.




<P>

<P>

<a name="70728w07.html_para3">It will be important to avoid a situation in which our policy of seeking to prevent certain regimes from acquiring certain equipment is undermined by foreign competitors supplying them. We will therefore work for the introduction of a European code of conduct, setting high common standards to govern arms exports from all EU member states.
<P>

<a name="70728w07.html_para4">Licences to export strategic goods are issued by the President of the Board of Trade and the export control organisation of the Department of Trade and Industry is the licensing authority.

These include the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Defence and the Department for International Development.
<P>

<a name="70728w07.html_para5">The present Government were not responsible for the decisions on export licences made by the previous Administration. We do not, however, consider that it would be realistic or practical to revoke licences that were valid and in force at the time of our election.

The criteria will also be applied when considering advance approvals for promotion prior to formal application for an export licence and licence applications for the export of dual-use goods when there are grounds for believing that the end user of such goods will be the armed forces or the internal security forces of the recipient country.
<P>

<a name="70728w07.html_para7">The criteria will constitute broad guidance. They will not be applied mechanistically and judgment will always be required. Individual applications will be considered case by case.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Criteria used in considering conventional arms export licence applications</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. An export licence will not be issued if the arguments for doing so are outweighed by the need to comply with the UK's international obligations and commitments, or by concern that the goods might be used for internal repression or international aggression, or by the risks to regional stability, or other considerations as described in these criteria.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>The United Kingdom's international obligations</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. An export licence should be refused if approval would be inconsistent with:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the UK's international obligations and commitments to enforce United Nations, Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe and European Union arms embargoes, together with any national embargoes or other commitments regarding the application of strategic export controls;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the UK's international obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the biological weapons convention and the chemical weapons convention;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) the UK's commitments to the international export control regimes--the Australia group, the missile technology control regime, the nuclear suppliers group and the Wassenaar arrangement;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) the EU common criteria for arms exports, the guidelines for conventional arms transfers agreed by the permanent five members of the UN Security Council, and the OSCE principles governing conventional arms transfers;




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>28 Jul 1997 : Column: 28</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) the UK's commitment not to export all forms of anti-personnel land mines and their components.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="70728w07.html_para8">
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>The United Kingdom's national interests</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. Full weight should be given to the UK's national interests when considering applications for licences, including:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the potential effect on the UK's defence and security interests and those of allies and EU partners;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the potential effect on the UK's economic, financial and commercial interests, including our long-term interests in having stable, democratic trading partners;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) the potential effect on the UK's relations with the recipient country;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) the potential effect on any collaborative defence production or procurement project with allies or EU partners;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(e) the protection of the UK's essential strategic industrial base.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Human rights and internal repression</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. The Government:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) will take into account respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms in the recipient country;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) will not issue an export licence if there is a clearly identifiable risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. For these purposes equipment which might be used for internal repression will include:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) Equipment where there is clear evidence of the recent use of similar equipment for internal repression by the proposed end user, or where there is reason to believe that the equipment will be diverted from its stated end use or end user and used for internal repression;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) Equipment which has obvious application for internal repression, in cases where the recipient country has a significant and continuing record of such repression, unless the end use of the equipment is judged to be legitimate, such as protection of members of security forces from violence.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6. The nature of the equipment proposed for export will also be carefully considered. Certain goods have more obvious potential for use in internal repression than others, such as armoured personnel carriers specifically designed for internal security. In other cases, there may be prima facie reasons for believing that a particular equipment might be used in such roles in certain circumstances. Any proposed export which is to be used by the recipient country for internal security purposes should be considered particularly carefully.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>7. Internal repression includes extra-judicial killings, arbitrary arrest, torture, suppression or major violation of human rights and fundamental freedoms. In some cases, the use of force by a Government within their own borders does not constitute internal repression. The use of such force by Governments is legitimate in some cases, for example to preserve law and order against terrorists or other criminals. However, force may be used only in accordance with international human rights standards.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>International Aggression</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>8. The Government will not issue an export licence if there is a clearly identifiable risk that the intended recipient would use the proposed export aggressively against another country, or to assert by force a territorial claim. However, a purely theoretical possibility that the items concerned might be used in the future against another state will not of itself lead to a licence being refused.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>9. When considering the risk that the country for which arms are destined might use them for international aggression, the Government will take into account:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the existence or likelihood of armed conflict between the recipient and another country;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) a claim against the territory of a neighbouring country which the recipient has in the past tried or threatened to pursue by means of force;




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>28 Jul 1997 : Column: 29</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) whether the equipment wold be likely to be used other than for the legitimate national security and defence of the recipient.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="70728w07.html_para9">
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Regional stability</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>10. The need not to affect adversely regional stability in any significant way will also be considered. The balance of forces between neighbouring states, their relative expenditure on defence, and the need not to introduce into the region new capabilities which would be likely to lead to increased tension, will all be taken into account.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Other criteria</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>11. In assessing the impact of the proposed export on the importing country and the risk that exported goods might be diverted to an undesirable end user, the following will be considered:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the legitimate defence and domestic security interests of the recipient country, including any involvement in UN or other peacekeeping activity;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the technical capability of the recipient country to use the equipment;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) whether the purchase would seriously undermine the economy of the recipient country, taking into account its public finances, balance of payments, external debt, economic and social development and any International Monetary Fund/World bank-sponsored economic reform programme;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) the risk of the arms being re-exported or diverted to an undesirable end user, including terrorist organisations--anti-terrorist equipment would need particularly careful consideration in this context.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>12. The following factors will also be taken into account:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) the risk of use of the goods concerned against UK forces;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) the need to protect UK military classified information and capabilities;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) the potential for the equipment to be a force multiplier in the region;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(d) the risk of reverse engineering or technology transfer.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>13. In the application of all the above criteria, account should also be taken of, for example, reporting from diplomatic posts, relevant reports by international bodies, intelligence, and information from open sources and non-governmental organisations.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Reporting to Parliament
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To ensure full transparency and accountability to Parliament, the Government will report annually on the state of strategic export controls and their application, thereby providing for parliamentary consideration of the application of the criteria. The Government will also inform Parliament of any changes to the criteria.</FONT></UL>

<a name="70728w09.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 I am today launching a public consultation on the roads review. This seeks views on the role which the trunk road network should play in our integrated transport strategy. Our general approach is to look at the transport problems which lie behind proposals for roads schemes and then to seek solutions which are environmentally sustainable. We invite comments on how we should respond to increasing congestion. We intend to bring a fresh approach to the process of making decisions on the roads programme. We will take a more strategic view and judge proposals on the criteria of accessibility, safety, economy, the environment and integration--which we are adding to the four manifesto criteria as it is fundamental to our whole approach to transport policy.
<P>

<a name="70728w09.html_para0">A further key aspect is the development of an investment strategy for the trunk road network. The consultation invites contributions to this process. Other issues raised include where responsibility should lie for the trunk roads; how trunk roads investment should be planned in the future as part of strengthened arrangements for co-ordinating the planning of land use, economic development and transport at the regional level; and funding of the trunk road system. The Government remain committed to seeking ways for the private sector to contribute to the provision of transport infrastructure

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The inspector's recommendations on the Birmingham northern relief road should be accepted and the scheme approved. This is a nationally strategic route of the first importance.

The full reasons for this decision are set out in the decision letter, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House. It is now up to the concessionaire to show what the private sector can do and deliver this vital project quickly.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The A13 Thames gateway schemes will be taken forward. These will provide the transport infrastructure needed for regeneration of east London and docklands. They will help improve accessibility to areas of east London including the Royal docks and the lower Lea valley where key development sites are capable of generating significant job opportunities.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The M66 Denton Middleton contract 3 and the A564 Derby southern bypass contract B will go ahead. Both are final links necessary to unlock the full benefits of much larger projects. The M66 scheme is the final six-mile section of the strategic Manchester motorway box. The Derby southern bypass is similarly the final section in a strategic east-west route.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We will honour the commitment given by the previous Government to the Channel Tunnel Rail Link Bill Committee to use all reasonable endeavours to see that the M2-A2 widening works are completed within the period of the construction of the CTRL and that the construction arrangements of the two projects are co-ordinated to minimise disruption to the public. This scheme will facilitate integrated road and rail investment and services, for example by encouraging full use of Ebbsfleet station on the CTRL.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The M62-M606 link roads will be considered further in the main review. An early decision is not required on transport grounds.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The A40 scheme in the west of London would have the effect of encouraging car commuting where public transport alternatives exist. This would not be justified and the scheme will therefore be cancelled. Alternative solutions to local problems will be sought.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Having reviewed the Cumbria-Bradford, south midlands and Weald and Downland projects on transport grounds against our criteria, we have concluded that the individual schemes in these projects do not merit priority over many similar schemes which are to be considered in the main review. The schemes which made up these projects will be considered in the main review.

<a name="70728w10.html_para0">More stringent emission standards for new and existing buses together with improvements in fuel quality should bring significant improvements in bus emissions. Further improvements in the quality of diesel fuel from 2000 were recently agreed by the Government with their European partners with yet further improvements anticipated from 2005. These measures will further reduce exhaust emissions from all buses. In addition, even tighter emission standards for new buses to apply from 2000 will be prescribed under EU proposals which are expected to be published shortly. Meanwhile, the Chancellor has announced his intention of extending to buses the vehicle excise duty incentive scheme for vehicles that meet more stringent emission requirements.

 Data on emissions from different models of passenger cars in connection with MOT test standards are already publicly available. There are some practical problems about making type approval data available in a useful form, not least because many type approvals are done in other EU countries, and the information is therefore complicated and expensive to collate. But we accept the principle of publishing this data and have asked officials to see how this can be achieved.

<a name="70728w10.html_para1">The costs of any additional training and testing required by these changes will in many cases be borne by new drivers who first obtain a goods vehicle licence on or after 1 January 1997 before they take up employment in the road haulage industry. But some costs are involved for the industry, particularly where employers meet the expense of additional qualifications required by their existing work-force. In the longer term, we would expect the new requirements to lead to better trained and qualified drivers, which will benefit the industry, as well as bringing more general road safety benefits.

 There is no United Kingdom-France bilateral agreement governing the discharge radioactivity, although such an agreement concerning exchange of information in the event of accidental releases of radioactivity does exist.

<a name="70728w10.html_para3">The UK and France are, however, both signatories to various international conventions and treaties, and are active participants in the work of the many international organisations concerned with radioactivity. Most important is the Euratom treaty under which both the United Kingdom and France are legally bound to adhere to standards of protection from radiation, and to the provision of information on transboundary effects of radioactive waste disposal, including discharges from the La Hague nuclear reprocessing plant.

 As regulation of nuclear installations is a matter for national authorities, France was not required to, nor did it, supply the United Kingdom Government with information concerning the 1989 developments at La Hague. However, under article 37 of the Euratom treaty, member states are required to supply general data to the European Commission relating to any plan for the disposal of radioactive waste, including discharges, in whatever form as will make it possible to determine whether the implementation of such plan is liable to result in the contamination of the water, soil or air space of another member state. Data concerning the plan for disposal of waste from the UP3 and the UP2-800 reprocessing plants at La Hague were provided by the French authorities to the Commission on 1 March 1989. United Kingdom experts assisted the Commission in its evaluation. The Commission opinion, that no contamination significant from the point of view of health would result, was published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Communities</i> dated 10 August 1989, copies of which are in the Library of the House.<i></i>

<a name="70728w12.html_para0">When the rough sleepers initiative in central London began in 1990, voluntary agencies estimated that between 1,000 and 2,000 people were sleeping rough in central London. Monitoring arrangements for the initiative include counts of people sleeping rough, undertaken twice a year by voluntary sector homelessness agencies. The latest count for which figures are available, in November 1996, found 286 people in the central London areas covered. Information from previous counts, which began in March 1992, is as set out in the table, which also includes information on counts in Whitechapel and the City and parts of the W1-W2 postal district.

 A licence is required to keep any animal of a species listed in the schedule to the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976. The issuing of licences and the day-to-day administration of the Act are the responsibility of the relevant local authority. The Department does not keep information on the number of licences issued under the Act.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 25 July 1997]:</i> Waste disposal authorities, under the Environmental Protection Act 1990, have a duty to arrange for the disposal of controlled waste collected in their area by waste collection authorities. Authorities do not, however, have a duty to dispose of waste from premises used for agriculture. Farmers, as producers of such waste, should aim to recover or reuse such waste where possible or arrange for it to be disposed of at a licensed waste facility. We are considering whether further legal controls are necessary to ensure that waste producers manage their waste responsibly and dispose of it sensibly. Currently, general guidance is provided to farmers in codes of good agricultural practice for the protection of air and soil, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food has recently invited bids for a project to develop and test a manual to help farmers minimise waste, including silage bag plastic.

 The Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 places duties on employers, usually the local education authority or governing body in schools, for the health and safety of their employees and anyone else on the premises. Employers are responsible for ensuring the safety of all pupils, and schools must have a written health and safety policy.
<P>

<a name="70728w13.html_para0">Circular 14/96, which was sent to all schools and LEAs in England in October 1996, offered advice on their legal responsibilities for pupils with medical needs. The Department has also produced good practice guidance to help schools put their own policies and procedures in place. Individual decisions about giving medication are best made at the local level.

<a name="70728w14.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Provision for children with special educational needs, including those whose needs arise from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, is a matter for local education authorities and schools, which must have regard to the code of practice on the identification and assessment of special educational needs. The forthcoming Green Paper on special needs will set out ideas for improving provision across the whole range of special needs. It will emphasise the importance of early identification and co-operation between statutory and voluntary agencies and parents, factors which are of particular relevance to children with ADHD and their carers. Following consultation, the Department will draw up an action plan to take forward the Green Paper's proposals.
<P>

<a name="70728w14.html_para0">My right hon. Friend has received no representations from the National Association of Head Teachers regarding classroom behaviour difficulties. The previous Secretary of State received a number of representations from the association on this matter. I refer the hon. Member to the reply he received from the then Minister on 26 June 1995, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>503-504</i>. The Department has not evaluated research on attention deficit disorder, although officials from the Department have met a number of ADHD groups and discussed with them research in this area, and professional bodies, including the Royal College of Psychiatrists, have issued guidance based on research evidence. We have no current plans to commission further research on ADHD.

<a name="70728w14.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Older students are less likely to repay loans because of the shorter time they will work after graduation, but they are more likely to have access to other funds, such as savings or commercial loans. There is no age limit for the means-tested mandatory award. The Government note the recommendations of the national committee of inquiry into higher education on age limits for loans and will bring forward detailed proposals in the autumn.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w14.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Of students funded by the Further Education Funding Council in colleges and external institutions in the 1995-96 academic year in England, 884,000 part-time students paid all their tuition fees and 173,000 paid part of their tuition fees. The total tuition fees paid by these 1.057 million part-time students was &#163;111 million in the same academic year. All the figures are provisional.

 We are developing with the Local Government Association guidance to local education authorities on behaviour support plans which will make specific reference to look after young people. We are supporting research for the Who Cares? Trust and Calouste-Gulbenkian Foundation, which will expand knowledge of good practice in the education of these young people.
<P>

<a name="70728w14.html_para1">We are aware of the difficulty for some children when their home environment militates against the completion of homework tasks. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport has issued a White Paper--"The People's Lottery"--which sets out proposals for the use of midweek lottery funds to support out-of-school-hours activities including homework clubs. These clubs will provide a place and adult support to help pupils complete homework tasks.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service (ES) policy on opening hours is to allow for flexibility in service delivery. ES Regional Directors and District Managers agree with Jobcentre Business Managers hours of opening to suit local circumstances.

Only a very few offices are in fact part-time.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In addition we encourage local initiatives to open Jobcentres in the evening or on a Saturday to meet the particular needs of the local labour market, for example for Job Fairs or Open Days where local employers and programme providers are available to give information to clients.

 Sustainable development will be at the heart of the forthcoming White Paper. My Department's principal aim is to contribute to the elimination of poverty in poorer countries. We intend to work to enable poor people to realise their rights to human development and achieve sustained improvements in their living standards. This will involve promoting sustainable economic growth, access to essential social services and protection of the global and national environment. A key part of our agenda will be to seek greater policy coherence in our approach to developing countries, both within the UK and with international development partners.
<P>

<a name="70728w15.html_para0">The White Paper will also reflect the Government's commitment to the targets contained in the report of the Development Assistance Committee of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, "Shaping the 21st Century". These include the target that every country should have a current national strategy for sustainable development in the process of implementation by 2005, so as to ensure that current trends in the loss of environmental resources are effectively reversed at both global and national levels by 2015. At the UN General Assembly special session in New York last month, it was agreed that all countries should have sustainable strategies in place by 2002. We regard these targets as compatible and my Department hopes to work in partnership with developing countries on the preparation of such plans.

The CE marking demonstrates conformity with the relevant essential health and safety requirements of the regulations and the duty to ensure that the machinery is in fact safe for users. The cost of compliance will depend on the cost of bringing the machinery into conformity with that legislation.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what progress her Department has made on the proposal in the Queen's Speech for a statutory right to claim interest on commercial debts. [11224]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Government are publishing today a Green Paper, "Improving the Payment Culture: A Statutory Right to Claim Interest on Late Payment of Commercial Debt". It sets out the Government's proposal to give small businesses the right to charge interest on late payment of commercial debts. It is proposed that this new right will be extended to all businesses after a period to be set following this consultation.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 1997 : Column: 61</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70728w16.html_para0">Late payment of commercial debt is acknowledged by many in the business community to be a serious problem, especially for small businesses which are least able to bear the additional costs arising from payment delays. The proposed legislation recognises the fundamental part small businesses play in the economy of the UK and the seriousness of any actions that unnecessarily hinder their competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="70728w16.html_para1">The right to claim interest is to be found in many other countries, especially within Europe. It is the Government's view that it is time that the right should be available in the UK.
<P>

<a name="70728w16.html_para2">The proposals are designed to act as a deterrent to late payers who have, in effect, been using their commercial creditors as a source of finance. Any late payment, like any other breach of contract, should attract appropriate sanctions. The proposed legislation will help to improve the payment culture by enabling creditors to charge interest on late payment of commercial debt at a rate to be set following consultation. Initially, this right will be available only to small businesses for use against public sector organisations and large businesses. The Green Paper sets out proposals for phasing in the extension of the right to all businesses. This is because the Government recognise that small businesses, with their more limited resources, must be given time to benefit from being paid promptly by their large creditors and to take the necessary actions to ensure that they have the systems in place to make payments on time.
<P>

<a name="70728w16.html_para3">The Government recognise that the proposed legislation alone will not solve the problem of late payment. Providing for a statutory right to claim interest is very which important. It is one element of a package of measures which we are pursuing to encourage a change in attitudes and behaviour towards a more ethical approach to payment.
<P>

<a name="70728w16.html_para4">I am delighted to say that a number of leading business representative organisations have pledged to join the Government in tackling the problem of late payment. They include the Forum of Private Business, the British chambers of commerce, the Confederation of British Industry, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Institute of Directors, the Union of Independent Companies, the Country Landowners Association and the National Farmers Union.
<P>

<a name="70728w16.html_para5">These bodies, like the Government, are committed to helping small firms to see how they can manage their finances effectively and thus benefit from the increased competitiveness which a good cash flow can bring.
<P>

<a name="70728w16.html_para6">Over the next 12 months, we will work with those bodies on a number of initiatives. These will include making available to their members and other small firms advice and information on cash flow management, further publicity for the British standard for payment and other measures such as the CBI's prompt payment code, and making the payment practices of the public sector and large firms more visible. We will also work with them to find other ways of encouraging sound payment practices so that all UK industry can enjoy the benefits of a fair payment culture.




<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 1997 : Column: 62</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70728w16.html_para7">The Government are determined to change the payment culture in the UK. It will enhance the existing requirement for plcs and their large private subsidiaries to disclose the average time taken to pay suppliers by producing league tables with the private sector.
<P>

<a name="70728w16.html_para8">The Government are also committed to improving public sector payment performance. Government Departments and agencies must pay 100 per cent. of their undisputed invoices for commercial debt on time. They will have to monitor and report on their success in meeting this stringent target.

 Ten countries of central and eastern Europe--Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia and Slovenia--have association agreements with the EU carrying the promise of EU membership on certain conditions.

In December, the European Council is expected to make a decision about the opening of negotiations.
<P>

<a name="70728w17.html_para1">The Government place a high priority on successful enlargement to the east.

<P>

<a name="70728w17.html_para2">Poland, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia and Slovenia are part of a joint DTI-FCO promotional campaign--"Open for Business in Central Europe".

five identified industrial sectors--health care, automotive, consumer goods-retailing, agribusiness and IT-telecommunications-electronics.
<P>

<a name="70728w17.html_para3">The first part of the campaign, which has now ended, involved 13 general awareness seminars held around the UK. The second stage will concentrate more on the specific sectors, with seminars, trade fairs and inward and outward missions. It will also address a number of important issues, such as getting paid, distribution and finding an agent. This will be done through three major showcases, in London, Glasgow and Birmingham-- 8, 15 and 23 October 1997 respectively. The final stage of the campaign will concentrate on investment.

<a name="70728w17.html_para4">Trade with the Baltic states is being promoted through a series of Baltic business seminars; by providing support for trade missions and advice and information both in London and in the region. Similar initiatives are being undertaken for Romania and Bulgaria.

 Changes to the expenses payable to parties and witnesses appearing before industrial tribunals were announced on 17 February 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>374</i>, and came into effect on 1 April 1997.

A formal lease will not be entered into until a full Civil Aviation Authority licence and planning permission are issued. The lease will reflect the Ministry of Defence's and the airfield operator's continued commitment to the long-term future of Society of British Aerospace Company air show.

 Our policy is that children under the age of 16 should not be treated in adult psychiatric wards.

 In 1995-96, 27 district health authorities did not meet their planned efficiency index gains. It is estimated that 49 health authorities did not meet their targets for 1996-97. Trusts are not set efficiency targets in the same way as health authorities. Health authorities and general practitioner fundholders may negotiate efficiency savings with hospitals, but information on these is not held at national level.

 Family therapy may play a part in a comprehensive treatment programme which may also include medication and other interventions. With young children and in milder forms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, family therapy may be an appropriate and effective approach on its own, for example if focused on enhancing parenting skills and helping the child learn strategies to improve concentration.

 The Department of Health has not evaluated any research into increased risks from the ingestion of the combinations of substances specified. Should there be any emerging evidence of increased risk, we would of course consider the need to do so.

<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70728w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Medicines Control Agency is aware of anecdotal reports of possible interactions between ritonavir and illegal drugs, notably methylenedioxymethamphetamine--Ecstasy. Ritonavir is a centrally authorised product and so these reports will be drawn to the attention of the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products which advises the European Commission, the licensing authority for these medicines.
<P>

<a name="70728w23.html_para0">The MCA continuously monitors the safety of all medicines marketed in the UK. This includes monitoring for potential interactions between medicines and between medicines and other substances. Pharmaceutical companies also have a statutory responsibility for the safety of the medicines they market and to provide information on safety, quality and efficacy to the licensing authority.
<P>

<a name="70728w23.html_para1">It is the responsibility of doctors to give advice to their patients about medicines they prescribe. Patients should receive sufficient information, in a way that they can 



<P>
<P><I>28 Jul 1997 : Column: 90</I><P>
understand, about their treatment, the possible alternatives and any substantial risks such that a patient can make an informed decision about treatment. A doctor has to exercise his or her professional judgment in deciding what information the patient should receive.
<P>

<a name="70728w23.html_para2">The Department's policy research programme and the national health service research and development programme are not currently undertaking any research into the possible risks of interaction between prescribed and illegal drugs.

<P>
<a name="70728w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr Milburn: </B> 
 The Medicines Control Agency is aware of the recently published survey from Australia in <i>The New England Journal of Medicine</i> suggesting that cataracts may be more common among adults using inhaled corticosteroids. The scientific evidence is currently being assessed.
<P>

<a name="70728w23.html_para3">Cataract is a progressive disease and it is difficult to assess its incidence. However, it is primarily a disease in older people and incidence increases with age.

 A link between genetically inherited enzyme status and the metabolism of certain drugs is well known and is documented in medical literature and, for relevant drugs, in the manufacturers' product information, which is authorised by the Licensing Authority. Such an effect on drug metabolism is taken into account in the development of new drugs and in post-marketing safety monitoring by the Medicines Control Agency. Also, the Medical Research Council has on-going programmes of research in this area.

 <i>[holding answer 23 July 1997]:</i> The Government submitted their first report to the UN committee on the rights of the child in 1994. A further report is to be submitted in 1999. To assist in the production of this report, the Department of Health proposes to convene a conference early in 1998 to discuss its content and format. It is likely that this conference will involve a range of organisations with an interest in children's issues, including Government Departments, representatives from the voluntary sector, local authorities and the users of services. I can confirm that the Northern Ireland Office will participate fully in the UK-wide consultation process.

<a name="70728w26.html_para3">Benefit savings figures prior to 1986 are not readily available and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Such information as is available is given in the tables.

3. The information is given in terms of weekly benefit savings deriving from activity in the given year, not public expenditure savings which could be accounted for in that year. Weekly benefit savings are calculated by taking the difference between the amount incorrectly paid to an individual and the correct amount of benefit due, following intervention of the fraud officer. This amount is multiplied by 32. Based on research which mainly covered income support, 32 weeks is the average length of time a claim would have continued if the fraud had not been detected. This multiplier is currently applied to all benefits.<P>

2. The estimates for other EU countries are based on data from "Supplementary Pensions in the European Union" published by the European Commission and "International Benefits Information Service" bulletin, April 1996.<P>

3. The estimates for the EU as a whole contains estimates of individual countries at different periods of time and so should be viewed solely as an indication of the likely order of magnitude.<P>
