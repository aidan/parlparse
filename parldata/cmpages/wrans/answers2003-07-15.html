<P>
<a name="30715w01.html_spnew0"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 There are now 47 Connexions partnerships in operation covering all of England. 31 started during the financial year 2002&#150;03. The last one started in April 2003. Ofsted have reported full inspections of six partnerships so far and initial indications are that Connexions partnerships are making progress at different rates with implementation of services. Performance was assessed as good in four of the partnerships, while the other two were rated as less effective. There is now a substantial programme of work developing performance in these two partnerships to address the concerns expressed by Ofsted.
<P>

<a name="30715w01.html_para0">Among the findings from an independent survey of 16,000 young people who had been in contact with Connexion services were the following:
<P>

An additional &#163;25,000 was allocated to each of the pathfinders specifically for childcare provision. Overall the aim of the pathfinders has been to test out various approaches used by schools and authorities in the development of family and community facilities and services on school premises.
<P>

<a name="30715w01.html_para7">The Lancashire pathfinder has built upon existing and emerging developments in community use of maintained schools in the County.

<a name="30715w01.html_para21">Lancashire is one of the Authorities that have been funded through the &#163;11.25 million Capital Modernisation Funding project to provide funding for electronic registration systems in secondary schools with high levels of unauthorised absence which was initiated by the Department in 2001&#150;02. Lancashire has received &#163;444,340 towards setting up electronic registration in 23 secondary schools including two schools (Walton High School and West Craven High School) in the Pendle constituency receiving a total of &#163;38,570. Independent evaluation has shown that, used effectively, electronic registration can significantly reduce levels of truancy within the first two years of implementation.

<a name="30715w01.html_para22">Lancashire has also participated in the nationally co-ordinated truancy sweeps, for example in December 178 truants were found. Lancashire also conducts a termly programme of truancy sweeps.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the change in the proportion of students attending university in their home towns over the last five years.  [110997]<P>

<P>
<a name="30715w02.html_spnew2"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Department does not hold information on students studying in their home towns. However, several research projects have looked at the influences on choice of institution. Comparisons from the Student Income and Expenditure Survey (SIES) in 1995&#150;96 and 1998&#150;99 show that there has been a slight increase of around 5 per cent. in the overall proportion of students living with their parents, especially among first years. Among the students surveyed in 1998&#150;99, 18 per cent. lived with their parents.
<P>

<a name="30715w02.html_para1">A student living survey carried out by UNITE/MORI in 2003 revealed that the ability to live at home during term time was a factor influencing the choice of university by 35 per cent. of those in the lower social classes compared with 26 per cent. of semi-skilled non-manual workers and 13 per cent. of those in professional and managerial social classes.
<P>

<a name="30715w02.html_para2">A study completed by the Institute of Employment Studies found that the priority when choosing an institution is for the right subject of study and course, however non-traditional applicants, particularly mature applicants and ethnic minorities gave more emphasis to reputation and quality, location and nearness to 'home'.

 Universities in the UK are independent, autonomous bodies and are responsible for deciding the range and mode of courses they offer, taking account of student demand and their institutional mission. The Higher Education Funding Council for England and its equivalent bodies in the devolved administrations allocate research funding selectively to universities according to the quality and volume of their research activity.

<P>
<a name="30715w02.html_spnew4"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) allocates teaching funding to higher education institutions (HEIs) in England through a formula relating to the number of students and the types of courses they are taking. The HEFCE has also allocated special funding for 'minority subjects' which it deems to be in national interest but which might otherwise be at risk because of the small number of students taking them.
<P>

<a name="30715w02.html_para3">Research funding is allocated to HEIs according to their success in the Research Assessment Exercise. In addition to the main allocations, the HEFCE provides

 The Farm Business Advice Service is managed by the Small Business Service (an agency of the DTI) and delivered through a network of Business Link advisers. The Service has adopted the Standards of Professional Competence for Business Link Advisory and Information Services. The Small Business Service intends to enhance the Standards of Professional Competence during 2003&#150;04. Defra's Learning, Skills and Knowledge Programme involves a review of the accreditation requirements for publicly funded advisers, following a recommendation by the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food.

<sup>(3)</sup> TB Reactors plus direct contacts<P>

<P>

<i>Note</i>:<P>

In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the Foot and Mouth Disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered in 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 It is not yet possible to make an accurate forecast of how the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) budget will be allocated between trade distorting and non-trade distorting measures since member states have discretion in implementing the various optional arrangements included in the reform agreement. Moreover decisions remain to be taken on reforms of the sugar, cotton, tobacco and olive oil regimes. However, the Government's initial estimates indicate that the EU is now close to meeting WTO demands for a 60 per cent. reduction in amber box subsidies and can fully meet the WTO proposal for a 50 per cent. reduction in blue box payments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The reform of the Common Agricultural Policy should provide direct and indirect benefits to agricultural producers in the developing world. First, the decoupling of subsidy payments from production, together with reductions agreed in some market support arrangements, will reduce EU over-production and subsidised exports of surpluses onto world markets at prices which undermine developing country markets and economies. Secondly, the impetus which these reforms should give to a successful Doha trade round will help to bring about wider development gains, not least through global action on agricultural subsidies.

[122758]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The National Air Emission Inventory ('NAEI') estimated emissions of dioxins produced by cement kilns as 2.829 and 5.684 grams in 1997 and 2001 respectively.
<P>

<a name="30715w03.html_para1">Measurements of dioxins are subject to an uncertainty of up to 100 per cent. because of the complex nature of the sampling and analysis techniques and the very low levels of emissions being monitored. The amount of cement production is not the same every year and this will also affect the figures for dioxins. As a result the numerical difference may have no statistical

<P>

<a name="30715w03.html_para2">The Environment Agency has recently taken regulatory action to decrease dioxin levels, in particular at a single cement kiln site where a reduction from 2.2 grams in 2001 to 0.3 grams in 2002 is anticipated. The Environment Agency's own provisional estimate for 2002 is 1.5 grams of dioxins.
<P>

<a name="30715w03.html_para3">European and domestic environmental regulations require that emissions limits for dioxins are set for cement production activities. The limits will reflect the benchmark values suggested by the European Commission and technical guidance produced by the Environment Agency. While excessive exposure to dioxins may be detrimental to human health, the Environment Agency aims to ensure that environmental exposures are too low for this to occur.

 Overall, the agreement reached at the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 27 June is estimated to give rise to annual net economic benefits of about euro 0.6 to 0.8 billion in the UK. The agreement does not provide for direct payments to growers for land used only for non-supported crops in the reference period. However, land needed to qualify for a direct payment under the new arrangements cannot be used to grow fruit, vegetables and table potatoes, thereby removing a potential source of additional competition that the unsupported sector was concerned would arise from the Commission's proposals.

<a name="30715w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The take up of renewable energy in the different states of the European Union is well documented (e.g. in the statistics compiled by the International Energy Agency). In addition, the European Wind Energy Association has recently published Wind Force 12, a report which assesses the current state of the European Wind Energy Market, and its potential growth. This report is available at www.ewea.org/doc/WF12.pdf. The Department has not carried out studies into the comparative costs of renewables in the different member states.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what discussions she has held with <i>(a)</i> executives of Royal Mail and <i>(b)</i> other ministerial colleagues over the decision by Royal Mail to forego the use of rail transport for the carrige of mail; what assessment she has made of the decision; and if she will make a statement.  [125985]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The department meets Royal Mail on a regular basis to discuss a range of issues including progress on the transport review. That review envisaged a continuing role for rail freight. Royal Mail has, following protracted negotiations with EWS, concluded that it cannot now proceed on the basis it originally intended, for reasons of cost.
<P>

<a name="30715w06.html_para2">The Government regret the loss of business for rail freight but stands by its policy that Royal Mail must have the freedom it needs to operate genuinely commercially.

 I have no plans to impose penalties on companies. I regard the effective operation of the shareholder voting process as an essential part of the corporate governance framework. The process involves a number of parties and I am glad to see that they are working together to analyse the process in order to make it more efficient. The Department will be monitoring developments in this area closely.

 <i>[holding answer 14 July 2003]:</i> Financial support is available to help UK shipyards win new orders through my Department's Home Shipbuilding Credit Guarantee Scheme (HSCGS). The HSCGS provides soft credit finance facilities to UK resident purchasers of ships in the form of loan guarantees of up to 80 per cent. of contract value for the construction and conversion of vessels. The HSCGS is currently under appraisal, in line with the DTI's wider review of existing business support schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what requirements there are on timber merchants to identify the source of timber imported into the UK.  [125152]<P>

 None. The Timber Trade Federation operates a code of practice and organisations like the WWF 1995 Plus Group have been set up to encourage merchants and retailers to promote business methods that are consistent with sustainable forestry practices.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w06.html_wqn9"><B> Sue Doughty: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry from which countries the UK imports timber; what percentage of the total timber import comes from each country; what percentage is from unidentified sources; and what steps the Government takes to ensure the timber is from sustainable sources in each country.  [125153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w06.html_spnew9"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 Data on the UK's imports of timber are given in the following table.
<P>

<a name="30715w06.html_para3">Statistics on UK imports of goods are compiled by HM Customs and Excise. The information is published on the basis of the country of consignment: which is normally the last country in which a commercial transaction takes place. Information on the country of consignment is comprehensive for countries outside the European Union (EU). Within the EU detailed information is collected from all but very small traders. Overall, small traders are estimated to account for 2&#150;3 per cent. of the value of UK trade with the EU, or about half that for total UK trade in goods. HM Customs and Excise do not collect from importers information relating to the precise origin of the timber, ie. whether or not the timber was forested from a legal and sustainably managed source, other than the country of consignment.
<P>

<a name="30715w06.html_para4">Comprehensive data, by country of origin are not available. The free flow of goods within the Single European Market means that information on the country of origin is not always available when goods are first imported into another European Union country and then consigned to the UK.
<P>

<a name="30715w06.html_para5">The Government have shown leadership in its strong encouragement of the European Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process. This is part of the EU's wider objective to encourage sustainable forest management and ensure that timber entering the EU is sustainably sourced. The Government are broadly supportive of the Commission's recently published FLEGT action plan and will work with other member states to ensure the Commission is able to make rapid progress.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w07.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is responsible for the licensing of civil aerodromes in the UK. Licensed aerodromes are required to take all reasonable steps to secure that the aerodrome and its immediately surrounding airspace are safe at all times for use by aircraft. As a licensing condition, aerodrome operators are also specifically required to have in place procedures for the control of bird hazards. The CAA maintains an oversight of the effectiveness of the bird hazard control activities at all UK licensed aerodromes and comments on this activity in the individual aerodrome's annual audit report.
<P>

<a name="30715w07.html_para1">Although the Department for Transport has not conducted separate aerodrome bird strike risk assessments, it has organised, and currently chairs, a working group of representatives from relevant local authorities, private land owners, the CAA and Heathrow Airport Ltd. (HAL) to consider ways of expediting effective management of the bird population and habitat around Heathrow. This builds on HAL's on-going work with the Central Science Laboratory's Bird Strike Avoidance Team to develop and implement appropriate bird strike mitigation measures. It is anticipated that the results of the group's work will, in due course, be disseminated to other aerodromes around the country.

 The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) in co-operation with police forces, local authorities and other enforcement agencies already uses a wide range of measures to tackle evasion of vehicle excise duty (VED). These include on-street enforcement, wheelclamping and the use of roadside cameras. The enforcement programme successfully

<P><I>15 Jul 2003 : Column 168W</I><P>
actioned some 820,000 cases, recovering some &#163;110 million in fines, out of court settlements and relicensing revenue.
<P>

<a name="30715w07.html_para4">This programme is being strengthened by a range of new initiatives. These include combined operations with local authorities, police forces and fire services aimed at abandoned and unlicensed vehicles, wider use of police traffic cameras, and a new "hotline" facility to allow members of the public to report offences directly to DVLA, anonymously if they wish.
<P>

<a name="30715w07.html_para5">On 22 May I announced proposals to introduce a form of continuous registration, starting in 2004. Under these proposals a vehicle's registered keeper will remain liable for licensing it until it is formally transferred to a new keeper. Enforcement will include the imposition of standard penalties, with more severe fines for determined evaders following prosecution. There will be consultation on the details of these proposals later this year.

ECHO also uses the HAC to inform member states of decisions taken under ECHO's own delegated authority both on its smallest programmes, and on those taken under the Primary Emergency Procedures for rapid disbursement (recent examples include Iraq, Algeria and the Palestinian Territories). In November of each year, ECHO presents its overall strategy for the following year for discussion by member states.

 Our information on the humanitarian situation in Liberia is provided by the United Nations and the other international humanitarian agencies that are maintaining a presence there. Although the UN has plans to return expatriate personnel to the country as soon as conditions allow, for now they are relying on information from their country staff and the international non-Government organisations. Only a few agencies have an expatriate presence in Liberia and this is limited mainly to the capital, Monrovia.
<P>

<a name="30715w11.html_para5">The reports we are receiving describe the conditions as very poor. Humanitarian activities are severely hampered by looting of vehicles, fuel, medical supplies and food by all the main parties to the conflict. There are severe shortages, especially of food and clean water. Sanitation is virtually non-existent, and with around one-third of the population now located within Monrovia, the impact on an already over-stretched infrastructure is serious. We have little hard information on the situation outside the capital.

 We provided substantial emergency assistance for Montserrat in the immediate aftermath of the volcanic crisis in the mid-1990s. This included provision of housing, essential services and infrastructure which had been lost or seriously damaged. Increasingly, our assistance is now geared towards other productive activity, which will help Montserrat towards its goal of renewed self-sufficiency.

<P>
<a name="30715w12.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development how many street children there are in Asia; in which Asian countries they are located; and how many street children there are in each country.  [123733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w12.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 It is difficult to provide accurate data on the overall numbers of street children in Asia or to provide a breakdown by country. Estimates are unreliable and coverage is patchy. According to UNICEF there are roughly about 25 million children estimated to be living on the streets in Asia. However there is no reliable information for many Asian countries. In India the Ministry of Social Welfare estimates that there are between 75,000 to 250,000 street 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 2003 : Column 182W</I><P>
children in Calcutta alone. UNICEF estimate there are 15,000 street children in Vietnam and 16,000 in Sri Lanka.
<P>

<a name="30715w12.html_para0">The fundamental cause of children living on the street is poverty. This is exacerbated by chronic hunger, lack of school places and family conflict. Between 30 per cent. to 50 per cent. of children in South Asia are malnourished. Despite improvements in education provision around 41 per cent. of children drop out of school before they reach the fifth grade. Between 30 per cent. to 55 per cent. of school age children are working. Many of these children are exploited through child labour or are involved in the sex industry. Unless these problems are addressed the problems of street children in Asia will continue to grow.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w12.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Minister of State, Department for International Development how much aid his Department gives to tackle the problem of street children in Asia; who this money is given to; and what the money is spent on.  [123734]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w12.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Urban poverty, homelessness, lack of education and the demand for child labour forces children to leave their families and live on the streets in Asia. It is important that these underlying problems are addressed as well as helping street children directly. Our bilateral programmes in Asia aim to alleviate family poverty more generally as a basis for addressing the needs of street children.
<P>

<a name="30715w12.html_para1">Many of our programmes support NGO activities that advocate for the rights of children and work directly with street children. In Bangladesh we are supporting two NGOs to provide informal education to vulnerable working children in urban areas at a cost of &#163;8 million. In Burma we have been supporting a street and working children project with World Vision a total cost of &#163;450,000. In India we are supporting a local NGO to work with child street vendors and have several other small projects in the pipeline focusing on vulnerable working children in urban areas.
<P>

<a name="30715w12.html_para2">We are providing &#163;1.6 million to Save the Children to work directly with vulnerable children in the Mekong sub region. This project aims to prevent poor rural children being trafficked to urban areas in the region for purposes of sexual exploitation and under age employment. This helps to reduce the potential for these children to end up on the street.
<P>

<a name="30715w12.html_para3">Other DFID activities also contribute indirectly to addressing the problems of street children. Improving basic education for every child is the main contribution that Asian Governments can make to reducing child poverty and indirectly to reducing the numbers of street children. Support to basic education is a major focus of our bilateral programme in Asia and in 2001&#150;02 DFID committed &#163;130 million to support this.
<P>

<a name="30715w12.html_para4">Another example is the &#163;12 million urban poverty reduction project in Cochin in India that has helped to improve basic services for poor families and their children.

 Presenting accurate data on expenditure for the water and sanitation sector is not straightforward.

<P>

<a name="30715w12.html_para6">We have only calculated figures using this method back to 1999&#150;2000.
<P>

<a name="30715w12.html_para7">In 2001&#150;02, DFID channelled &#163;1.3 billion through multilateral organisations. DFID's contribution to multilateral spend on water and sanitation is estimated at around &#163;40 million per year.
<P>

<a name="30715w12.html_para8">In 2001&#150;02, DFID provided &#163;296 million as general budget support to country governments (including sector support), which was 20 per cent. of our total bilateral programme and 10 per cent. of our entire programme. An internal exercise to allocate direct budget support notionally by sector concluded that only a small proportion (less than one per cent) went to the water sector.
<P>

<a name="30715w12.html_para9">Much of the above information is included in the National Audit Office review of DFID's work in the water sector (NAO Report No. HC351, 31 January 2003).

 It is not currently possible to calculate the percentage which tourism contributed to the gross domestic product of England in the last two financial years, due to delays in the production of National Statistics' Regional Accounts. However, the equivalent figure for the contribution of tourism to the UK's GDP in the calendar year 2001 was 4.5 per cent., and the proportion for England can be expected to be of a similar magnitude.

 In 2001&#150;02, this Department allocated to the English Tourism Council (ETC) &#163;3.8 million from the Reserve to assist the domestic recovery of tourism from foot and mouth disease; over half of that amount was then passed to the 10 regional tourist boards (RTBs) in England and much of it used for promotional activities. In addition, of the sums granted by the Department to the Greater London Authority (GLA) to promote tourism, &#163;500,000 was used for domestic marketing in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;100,000 in 2002&#150;03.

 Whether to carry out pre-legislative scrutiny on-line is a matter for decision by the Committee concerned, and the provision of facilities and funding for it are a matter for the House authorities. The Joint Committee on the draft Communications Bill found its on-line forum extremely useful, and I hope that other Committees will also choose to make use of the opportunities which Information Technology provides. I welcome work being done by the Committee Office to identify and promote good practice in this area.

The Conclusions of the Copenhagen European Council of 12/13 December 2002 noted "the European Union's willingness to lead a military operation in Bosnia following SFOR". This would of course require a prior decision by NATO to terminate its mission, as was the case when the EU took over the stabilisation role from NATO earlier this year in Macedonia. The transition of the much larger mission in Bosnia will require extensive discussions between the EU and NATO. There was a brief informal discussion of this issue, as part of the wider discussion of EU/NATO co-operation in the Balkans at the NATO Foreign Ministers' meeting in Madrid.

At other times, the EUMC and its Working Group are serviced by five Brussels-based United Kingdom military staff working for the UK

Military Representative to the EU, who also functions as the UK Military Representative to NATO. Two Ministry of Defence civilian officials are also based in Brussels to support ESDP aspects of the work of the Political and Security Committee and its preparatory groups. From time to time, specialist staff based in the UK also attend working group meetings in Brussels, for example to plan crisis management exercises or for detailed work on force development. These meetings generally do not have a fixed membership, and the numbers attending vary depending on the subjects under discussion, but the total number of UK-based MOD staff involved is about 20.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There is no "European Security and Defence Pact". Responding to the Headline Goal established under the European Security and Defence Policy, European Union member states have together already offered to make available for ESDP operations forces of greater than corps size. The General Affairs and External Relations Council in May agreed that the EU now has operational capability across the full range of Petersberg tasks, albeit limited and constrained by recognised shortfalls, which particularly affect speed of deployment and level of risk for larger, higher-intensity tasks. The number of forces which could be deployed for any particular ESDP operation would depend on the operational scenario and what member states and other countries decided to contribute.

 Coalition forces hold the maintenance of law and order as a high priority. Coalition forces continue to patrol robustly, often alongside members of around 30,000 Iraqi police who are now operational across the country. Coalition forces are empowered to arrest individuals suspected of criminal offences, and their patrols have had an effect in controlling the lawlessness and looting that in some areas immediately followed the collapse of the Ba'athist regime. United Kingdom forces are currently responsible for security and stability in the southern provinces of Basrah and Maysan. We do not hold figures for the number of civil

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the effects of 24-hour media coverage of the recent military action in Iraq on ensuring that families of casualties are informed before details are made public.  [124465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The introduction of 24-hour media coverage and the development and use of technology have changed the way that wars are reported. During the coalition, broadcasters were able for the first time to report in real time from the battlefield, and incidents which previously might have gone unreported for several hours, were in many cases seen by the embedded journalists and reported back to their news desks. And in some cases, images were broadcast live.
<P>

<a name="30715w15.html_para0">These changes have caused the Ministry of Defence to keep under review its incident reporting and casualty handling procedures. While our primary aim is always to protect the interests of families involved, it was no longer feasible to delay announcing that an incident had occurred until all the next of kin had been informed. Thus, while our first task was always to inform the next of kin of those families affected, we simultaneously released information on incidents, subject to operational security, in order to limit the 'circle of worry' of non-affected families who would be aware from media reporting that an incident had occurred. However, incident and casualty reporting is a very difficult area and all decisions were taken on a case-by-case basis.
<P>

<a name="30715w15.html_para1">We did not publish the names of fatalities until we had confirmation that the next of kin, and in some cases the extended family network, had been informed. Our Casualty staffs worked closely with media staffs to ensure that the families involved were protected from any media intrusion.

 Average figures for the classroom environment vary from 1:3 to 1:40 according to the nature of the training being undertaken. Outside the classroom, ratios vary greatly depending on local circumstances such as age, maturity of recruits, geography of establishments etc, and an average ratio is therefore neither collated nor meaningful. Individual establishments are charged with ensuring that supervisory ratios outside the classroom are appropriate for duty of care in each of these circumstances.

The Ministry of Defence has a programme of research into the effects of active sonar generally, rather than Low Frequency Active Sonar in particular, and this is ongoing.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what recent discussions he has had with the Chief Constable of the PSNI about the measures to reduce deaths through road traffic accidents <i>(a)</i> in Northern Ireland and <i>(b)</i> in North Down.  [125812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w17.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 In November 2002, I was joined by the Assistant Chief Constable with responsibility for road traffic policing in launching the Northern Ireland Road Safety Strategy 2002&#150;12. The strategy provides a major step forward in outlining the partnership approach between the main agencies: Department of the Environment (DOE), the Department for Regional Development (DRD) and Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI), in addressing the main causes of death and serious injuries, which are speed, drink-driving and failure to wear seat belts.
<P>

<a name="30715w17.html_para3">Officials in the relevant Departments and agencies, including PSNI, have been liaising closely to implement the objectives outlined in the strategy. The strategy provided for the establishment of a Road Safety Steering Group, which will oversee and monitor progress towards the delivery of the strategic objectives and targets and consider new initiatives. The Steering Group involves senior management in each of the three main organisations responsible for the delivery of the strategy.
<P>

<a name="30715w17.html_para4">Actual delivery of the activities and initiatives set out in the strategy will be co-ordinated by the Road Safety Review Group, which is chaired by a senior official in the DOE and includes representatives from Roads Service and PSNIs Road Policing Development Branch.
<P>

<a name="30715w17.html_para5">Since the launch of the strategy there have been five joint launches involving the DOE and PSNI, including the launch of the new anti-speeding campaign where the Assistant Chief Constable and I reaffirmed our commitment to road safety and to influence positively the attitudes and behaviour of all road users through education and enforcement.
<P>

<a name="30715w17.html_para6">Officials from the DRD Roads Service have regular liaison meetings with PSNI to discuss any relevant issues to do with traffic management and road safety from an 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 2003 : Column 204W</I><P>
engineering perspective. Roads Service officials have also met recently with PSNI to discuss road safety on the A2 Belfast to Bangor road in North Down.
<P>

<a name="30715w17.html_para7">As part of a major initiative on use of fixed and mobile safety cameras throughout Northern Ireland, four sites on the A2 Belfast to Bangor Road have been selected for enforcement by safety cameras and new signing for these sites was erected on 1 July 2003, superseding earlier speed camera signing. This again was undertaken by PSNI in conjunction with Roads Service and was as a result of the close liaison between the two organisations.
<P>

<a name="30715w17.html_para8">The hon. Member may be interested to note that although the number of fatalities (87) to date this year is higher than the comparable period in the last two years, the numbers of killed and seriously injured (KSI), which are the recognised road safety indicators throughout the UK, have shown a steady decline. In the first five months of this year (the last full period for which comparative figures are available) the KSI total is 581 compared with 682 for the same period in 2002 and 701 in 2001.
<P>

<a name="30715w17.html_para9">There will continue to be positive and constructive discussions not only between the DOE, DRD and PSNI, but also with all its partners in road safety to ensure safer roads for everyone in Northern Ireland. However, it is incumbent upon all road users to take personal responsibility for their action when using the roads.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate how much annual revenue would be raised from a tax on the incineration of municipal waste at &#163;35 per tonne for <i>(a)</i> all existing municipal waste incinerators and <i>(b)</i> all municipal waste incinerators for which planning applications have been made.  [125128]<P>

<a name="30715w20.html_spnew0"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Given current levels of waste disposed of by incineration, a tax on the incineration of municipal waste of &#163;35 per tonne would be expected to raise about &#163;90 million per annum. However, it is unlikely that this level of revenue would be generated, as a tax on incineration at such a rate would be expected to lead to more waste going to alternatives such as landfill. The current level of landfill tax is &#163;14 per tonne rising to &#163;15 next year, and will be increased by at least &#163;3 per tonne each year from 2005&#150;06 until it reaches a rate of &#163;35 per tonne in the medium to long term.

These include: a recruitment drive for new anti-smuggling teams and dog handlers; re-deploying existing anti-smuggling staff to target these illegal importations; transferring "meat" dogs and their handlers from Defra to Customs; instituting a programme of awareness meetings with senior Government officials from targeted risk countries, undertaking a series of training seminars for Customs staff and developing new publicity posters and leaflets for ports and airports in the UK.

 The true scale of money laundered in the UK cannot be measured directly. Global money laundering has been estimated by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as the equivalent of between 2 per cent. and 5 per cent. of world input.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking for the percentage of gross incomes paid in indirect taxes by income decile for <i>(a)</i> retired and <i>(b)</i> non retired households. (124448)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimates for indirect taxes and income are based on the analysis "The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2001&#150;02" produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on April 11th 2003 and in Economic Trends in the May 2003 edition. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons library. This includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (EPS). Due to the sampling variability of each measure, sample sizes are only sufficient to allow a breakdown to be given by quintiles for the ratio of indirect taxes to gross income, and not by decile.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A retired household in the analysis of "The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2001&#150;02" is defined as one where the combined income of 'retired' members amounts to at least half the total gross income of the household. A 'retired' person is defined as anyone in the EPS survey who is over minimum Nl pension age and is 'unoccupied' or 'sick or injured but not intending to seek work,' or who describes themselves as 'retired'.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 2003 : Column 216W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The following table shows the estimated indirect taxes as a proportion of gross income for retired and non-retired households in the UK for each income quintile where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. The table also shows the lower bands of the equivalised disposable income quintiles, which have been calculated separately for the retired and non retired households. For example, the lower bound of the 2nd quintile for the retired households is the income below which one fifth of all retired households are estimated to lie and similarly for the non-retired households. Since indirect tax tends to be a higher proportion of income for lower income bands, using different quintile points for retired and non-retired households affects the relative percentages for each quintile.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimates of indirect taxes are imputed using household expenditure given in the EPS. One drawback of comparing the incidence of indirect taxes on households at different levels of income is that, by whatever measure used, on average, recorded expenditure exceeds income apparently available for it by significant amounts at the bottom of the distribution.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Income and expenditure data recorded in the EFS are not fully compatible because they are recorded in different ways. Indeed, measured expenditure exceeds measured income for households in the lower half of the distribution.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are a number of possible explanations for this. Some households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EFS e.g. inheritance and severance payments.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income received, possibly because of timing differences.</FONT></UL>

(124450, 124451)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimates for indirect taxes and income are based on the analysis "The effects of taxes and benefits on household income 2001&#150;02" produced by the ONS and published on the National Statistics website on April 11th 2003 and in Economic Trends in the May 2003 edition. The analysis can be obtained from the House of Commons Library. This includes measures of income inequality for the United Kingdom as a whole based on data from the Expenditure and Food Survey (EPS). Due to the sampling variability of each measure, sample sizes are only sufficient to allow a breakdown to be given by quintiles for the ratio of customs or stamp duties to gross income, and not by decile.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A retired household is defined as one where the combined income of 'retired' members amounts to at least half the total gross income of the household. A 'retired' person is defined as anyone in the EPS survey who describes themselves as 'retired' or anyone over minimum NI pension age describing themselves as 'unoccupied' or 'sick or injured but not intending to seek work.'</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Customs duties are estimated from customs receipts and are allocated to households in proportion to expenditure data recorded in the EPS. Stamp duty on house purchases for owner-occupier households has been estimated in proportion to the hypothetical duty payable on buying their current dwelling (estimated from EPS data) multiplied by the probability of a household of that type moving in a given year (estimated from the General Household Survey).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The following table shows the estimated Customs duties and stamp duties paid as a proportion of gross income for retired and non-retired households in the UK for each income quintile where households are ranked by equivalised disposable income. The table also shows the lower bounds of the equivalised disposable income quintiles, which have been calculated separately for the retired and non retired households. For example, the lower bound of the 2nd quintile for the retired households is the income below which one fifth of all retired households are estimated to lie and similarly for the non-retired households.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Since indirect taxes tend to be a higher proportion of income for lower income bands, using different quintile points for retired and non-retired households affects the relative percentages for each quintile.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 2003 : Column 218W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>One drawback of comparing the incidence of indirect taxes on households at different levels of income is that, by whatever measure used, on average, recorded expenditure exceeds income apparently available for it by significant amounts at the bottom of the distribution. Income and expenditure data recorded in the EPS are not fully compatible because they are recorded in different ways. Indeed, measured expenditure exceeds measured income for households in the lower half of the distribution.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are a number of possible explanations for this. Some households with low incomes may draw on their savings or borrow in order to finance their expenditure. In these cases, expenditure is not being met from current income. Some types of receipts are not included as income in the EPS e.g. inheritance and severance payments. In some cases, the information given on expenditure is not consistent with that on income received, possibly because of timing differences.</FONT></UL>

 The National Blood Service (NBS) has no plans to publish an education programme for transfusion medicine.
<P>

<a name="30715w23.html_para0">The NBS provides training for scientific and medical staff in hospitals and has recently identified the need to train hospital nurses and midwives in various aspects of transfusion medicine. NBS is currently discussing these training requirements, which will include training on the appropriate use of blood.
<P>

<a name="30715w23.html_para1">The NBS is also establishing a network of transfusion liaison nurses who will facilitate training in collaboration with similar staff in national health service trusts. This initiative is part of the NBS response to Health Circular HSC 2002/009, "Better Blood Transfusion&#151;Appropriate Use of Blood", which is available at: www.doh.gov.uk/publications/coinh.html

<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w23.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what plans he has to strengthen the rights and protection of residents in elderly persons' care homes from eviction;  [125634]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment his Department has made of the impact on life expectancy of residents of <i>(a)</i> care home closure and <i>(b)</i> eviction from a care home.  [125635]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w23.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Department of Health recognises that moving between care homes can be difficult and stressful for any long-term resident, particularly vulnerable older people. Such moves, including ones made as a result of care home closures, should be handled as sensitively and appropriately as possible. Proper arrangements should be made for the safe and satisfactory transfer of all residents to other suitable homes. There should be adequate time for this to be done, in a way that allows both residents and their relatives a choice in where they are to move to, and which creates the minimum possible discomfort to all concerned.
<P>

<a name="30715w23.html_para2">For each resident supported under section 21 of the National Assistance Act 1948, councils should agree a contract with independent care homes that includes a statement of terms and conditions covering matters such as fees and period of notice. This is in accordance with Standard 2 of the National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People. Councils should play a part in facilitating transfers from one home to another as and when appropriate. With respect to supported residents who are transferring, councils should ensure that residents' needs are re-assessed and alternative and appropriate accommodation is arranged promptly, with due regard to the Choice of Accommodation Directions 1992.
<P>

<a name="30715w23.html_para3">With respect to residents who fund their own care, Standard 2 of the National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People also states that contracts agreed by the residents and care homes should cover fees payable, the period of notice and other matters. If, when homes close or residents transfer for other reasons, self-funding residents require advice on other homes to enter and how to go about it, councils should provide this advice. If self-funding residents lack the capacity to make their own arrangements, following an assessment of their needs, councils should take over the arrangements.

and different classes of case will be under clause 83(3) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill.  [122931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w23.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 It would be for the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) to determine any scale of fees to be paid under clause 84 (formerly 83) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill. Before making any such provision, CSCI must consult such persons as appear to it to be appropriate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what criteria the Government have set for the right of entry to be considered necessary or expedient under clause 86(1) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill; and if personal records inspected under the right of entry will be protected under the Data Protection Act 1998 under clause 85(1)<i>(a)</i>.  [122953]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w23.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Commission for Social Care Inspection will determine what conditions will be considered necessary or expedient under clause 87(1) (formerly clause 86(1)).
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w23.html_wqn8"><B> Chris Grayling: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether the CSCI will be required to give notice where it requires a person to provide it with any information, records or other items under clause 87(1) of the Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill; where a person is required to provide the CSCI with any information or records (including personal records), whether these will be protected under the Data Protection Act; and where the CSCI requires a person to provide it with information, records and other items, whether the Government will put in place safeguards to ensure that only records, with particular reference to those held on computer, which are relevant to an investigation are requested and that an individual's right to privacy is protected.  [122965]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w23.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 We expect that Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI) will normally obtain information by agreement. Where it exercises the power in clause 88 (formerly clause 87) to require the provision of information or documents, we expect that it will normally do so in writing.
<P>

<a name="30715w23.html_para4">Individuals' rights to privacy will be protected by the common law duty of confidentiality and the Data Protection Act 1998. Under clause 88 (1)(b), CSCI may only request information and documents which it considers necessary or expedient to have for the purposes of chapter 5.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate has been made of the proportion of the population of England which will require mental health treatment during their lives.  [124874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w24.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Decisions about mental health treatment and care are taken on the basis of an individualised assessment of needs by the responsible clinical team in consultation with the patient, in the light of the evidence base, the resources available, and in the context of national guidance.
<P>

<a name="30715w24.html_para8">The Office for National Statistics (ONS) is responsible for compiling, analysing and disseminating information relating to UK economic, social and demographic statistics. Their report, 'Psychiatric morbidity among adults living in private households, 2000', is available on the website at www.statistics.gov.uk. Surveys of children's mental health (1999) and the mental health needs amongst people in prison (1997) have also been undertaken by ONS and further information is available from them.

<P>
<a name="30715w24.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Department has a public service agreement to reduce the duration of untreated psychosis to a service median of less than three months (individual maximum less than six months) and provide support for the first three years for all young people who develop a first episode of psychosis by 2004. This target is being accomplished by the creation of 50 early intervention teams across the country.
<P>

<a name="30715w24.html_para9">There are currently 24 early intervention teams in England which provide quick diagnosis of the first onset of a psychotic disorder and appropriate treatment including intensive support in the early years for people aged between 14 and 35.
<P>

<a name="30715w24.html_para10">Also, NHS Direct's call handling capacity will more than double to 16 million calls annually by 2006, backed by a funding increase to &#163;182 million. Improved 24-hour access to clinical advice by telephone from home will cut the burden on general practitioners and the emergency services, including for people with mental health problems, who can obtain rapid advice from trained nurses.
<P>

<a name="30715w24.html_para11">As part of the mental health modernisation agenda, steps are being taken to increase capacity in both community and hospital based provision that will help provide quicker and more convenient services. Establishing crisis resolution services and more hospital beds as well as improving access to child and adolescent mental health services by 10 per cent. each year across the service according to agreed local priorities are among these steps.

<P>
<a name="30715w24.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The information on which to base such an assessment is not collected centrally. Needs assessment is the responsibility of local agencies as part of their service planning activity. Systematic mapping of local child and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS) provision across England was launched last year and it is intended to repeat this annually. This will provide detailed information on service provision, service activity levels and expenditure on CAMHS by provider trust and by local authority and primary care trust commissioners. Data currently available can be found on the dedicated website at www.dur.ac.uk/service.mapping/CAMH/.
<P>

<a name="30715w24.html_para12">The Government's strategy for the development of CAMHS, initiated in 1999, has made significant progress in improving the overall quality and accessibility of local services for children and young people with mental health problems. Our current central investment programme of &#163;250 million over the coming three years aims to help secure comprehensive CAMHS in all areas by 2006, in line with the objectives contained in "Improvement, Expansion, Reform the Priorities and Planning Framework 2003&#150;06" published by the Department in October 2002.

 There are no plans to do so at present.

The principal bodies that have been involved are the Food and Drink Federation, the British Retail Consortium, the British Frozen Food Federation and the Joint Food Service Industry Group.

 This Government have introduced a number of measures aimed at encouraging participation in elections. We have made it easier to register to vote and to cast a vote. We are, with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister, continuing to expand the programme of electoral pilot schemes to test innovative methods of voting at local elections. We have announced our intention, subject to parliamentary approval, to hold next year's European parliamentary, local and GLA elections on the same day, so that voters will only need to turn out once, rather than twice within a short period. All these measures are designed to increase flexibility and convenience for voters and thus encourage greater turnout. In addition, we introduced legislation to set up the independent Electoral Commission. The

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the measures in place in respect of <i>(a)</i> jobseekers allowance, <i>(b)</i> housing benefit and <i>(c)</i> other benefits to meet the needs of agency workers who are regularly unemployed for short periods of time.  [124021]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Agency workers can experience intermittent periods of employment and unemployment. The fear of finding themselves involved in a lengthy claim process and without an income during these periods of unemployment may have, in the past, discouraged many people from taking this type of work.
<P>

<a name="30715w27.html_para1">In order to assist people in these circumstances we introduced Rapid Reclaim to ensure a smooth transition from work to benefit. Rapid Reclaim is available to customers who find themselves having to reclaim Income Support, Jobseekers Allowance, Housing Benefit or Council Tax Benefit within 12 weeks of having previously claimed the same benefit. The Rapid Reclaim process allows Decision Makers to use information provided for the previous claim alongside a shorter claim form, completed by the customer, that captures any changes that may have occurred during the break in their claim. This speeds up the data collection process and so reduces the time from making a claim to receiving the first payment.
<P>

<a name="30715w27.html_para2">Rapid Reclaim is making it easier for people to take up work, that may be only short-term or through an agency, as it reduces the fear that there will be a delay in the resumption of benefits during the periods that they are off work.

 Our aim is to have an exceptions service ready from October 2004.

 Independent benefits consultancies are not subject to regulation by this Department.

<a name="30715w28.html_para1">Independent advice is also widely available free of charge through organisations affiliated to the Federation of Independent Advice Centres, Citizens Advice Bureaux and disability organisations.
<P>

<a name="30715w28.html_para2">We are also working with local authorities and organisations that represent disabled people to ensure that the right information gets to claimants.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions under what criteria the Department and its agencies authorise crisis and interim payments to those in need while benefit applications are processed.  [124617]<P>

<P>
<a name="30715w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 Interim payments are discretionary payments on account of benefit made to avoid hardship where the Decision Maker is satisfied that the basic conditions of entitlement for the benefit are met. Interim payments can be made in the following circumstances:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Where a benefit claim has been made but cannot immediately be determined and the delay is not the fault of the customer;
<P>
<BR>
2. In an emergency. This covers a variety of different situations from civil emergencies to industrial action;
<P>
<BR>
3. Where a claim has not been made in the correct manner but it is not the fault of the customer, for example because the claim form has been completed incorrectly by a visiting officer; and
<P>
<BR>
4. While an appeal is ongoing but the customer clearly has some residual entitlement to benefit.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30715w28.html_para3">Interim payments follow the same payment cycles and periods as the main benefit being claimed and are not made before the person's first benefit pay-day. The amount of any payment is recoverable from the main benefit when it is awarded.
<P>

<a name="30715w28.html_para4">Social fund crisis loans can be made to help with the day-to-day living expenses of people awaiting a first payment of benefit which is paid in arrears. Any crisis loan made under these circumstances will cover the recipient's needs until their first benefit pay-day, following which full or interim payments of benefit can be made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w28.html_spnew4"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Entitlement to disability living allowance (DLA) and attendance allowance (AA) can only be reliably established after an actual claim has been made and the care and mobility needs of the customer are assessed. There is no data available about who might be entitled to either DLA or AA if they were to make a claim. This means that currently we cannot reliably calculate the number of people receiving the benefits as a proportion of the overall eligible population.
<P>

<a name="30715w28.html_para5">However, in the five years to November 2002, the number of people receiving DLA increased by 24 per cent. and by 6.1 per cent. in the last 12 months alone. For AA the increases are 9.6 per cent. and 3 per cent. respectively.
<P>

<a name="30715w28.html_para6">The Department is taking steps to improve the take-up of the benefits in a targeted and well directed way and will continue to work more closely with partners, such as local authorities and welfare rights organisations who are better able to identify potential disability benefits claimants in an individual and focused way.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w28.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Bellingham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) what the expected <i>(a)</i> average and <i>(b)</i> total expected cost to small businesses employing fewer than 15 people is from the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003;  [124736]

(3) how many representations her Department has had from small businesses employing fewer than 15 people regarding the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003 <i>(a)</i> prior and <i>(b)</i> subsequent to their being passed; and what proportion of those representations expressed concern about a potentially adverse impact of the regulations;  [124738]
<P>
(4) how many disabled employees are expected to be affected by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003;  [124739]
<P>
(5) what representations he has received from organisations representing small and medium sized enterprises on the costs of compliance with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003; and if he will make a statement.  [125587]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w28.html_spnew5"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The Regulatory Impact Assessment on the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (Amendment) Regulations 2003, which is available in the Library, estimates that the average cost for small businesses with one to 15 employees of removing the small firms exemption in the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) is &#163;5.50, although many small employers will have no costs at all. The total cost to these small businesses will be about &#163;6 million. Of this, &#163;3.9 million is a one-off cost while &#163;2.1 million is a recurring cost, and includes &#163;0.7 million for recruitment. This does not take into account the many benefits that employers can gain from employing and retaining disabled people such as access to a wide pool of applicants, retention of skills and knowledge and better motivation more generally among the workforce.
<P>

<a name="30715w28.html_para7">There are around 1,087,000 businesses with between one and 14 employees. Within these businesses, there are around 382,000 disabled employees who will be protected from discrimination by the DDA's employment provisions as a result of the inclusion of small employers. Other provisions in the Regulations will end a number of other employment and occupational exclusions such as the police, fire-fighters and partners in business partnerships. These measures are expected to bring an additional 218,000 disabled workers within scope of the DDA.

Other respondents representing employers, such as the Confederation of British Industry and the Institute of Directors, may have taken account of views from small and medium-sized employers in submitting their replies but it is not possible to measure the extent to which their replies were informed by members with fewer than 15 employees. The majority of such responses concerned the operation of the regulations themselves. However, the IoD questioned some of the assumptions made by Government in estimating the overall costs of implementing the Directive. There have been no representations from small employers or their representative bodies on the disability regulations since they were approved by Parliament.

 The Department is currently undertaking a campaign to raise awareness of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) among all types of businesses, including those in the tourism industry. As Minister for Disabled People, I am undertaking a series of regional visits which highlight disability issues and remind employers and service providers of their duties under the Act, and these have been supported by radio advertising and press articles.
<P>

<a name="30715w28.html_para10">On 15 May 2003, we launched two major elements of this campaign; an information pack, aimed particularly at small and medium-sized enterprises. The pack contains advisory leaflets for employers and service providers, together with a video entitled 'Act Now&#151;the DDA and Your Business'. This video provides information about the duties that employers and service providers have under the Act. It shows practical examples of what some companies have done to improve access for their disabled workers and customers and the 'Access All Areas' award which aims to recognise and congratulate small organisations that have made imaginative changes to the way they provide their services so that disabled people can use them. Details of the award and an entry form are available on the website www.disability.gov.uk and are included in the information pack, which is available to any business free of charge.
<P>

<a name="30715w28.html_para11">The Department has undertaken a mailshot of the information packs to business organisations such as Chambers of Commerce, the Federation of Small Businesses, CBI Regional Offices, and local Businesslink offices. We have liaised with VisitBritain which has publicised the award on its website and in its email newsletter which reaches 200,000 tourism businesses. The Tourism Skills Network has also advertised the award on its website.

It will, for the first time, be available to partners of benefit claimants who are taking up work and taking the household off benefit. Finally we will also be piloting a new in-work credit for lone parents, also from October 2004.

2. Gross costs are calculated by the Government Actuary's Department and are consistent with Budget 2003 assumptions. It is assumed that the earnings link is restored in April 2004.<P>

3. The net costs are calculated using the DWP Policy Simulation Model for 2005&#150;06. The net cost represents the cost after allowing for any offsetting savings in income-related benefits.<P>

4. In the case where the earnings link is restored for all pensions, it is assumed that the start of the Savings Credit is increased to the value of the earnings linked basic State Pension. In the other variants it is assumed that the start of the Savings Credit is unchanged.<P>

The UK considers the restoration of the rule of law in Iraq to be a priority and will stay closely engaged with the CPA on issues of funding and assistance. In particular, the UK has deployed a senior police officer to Baghdad to assist with advising and training the new Iraq police service. In addition to this a further senior officer will deploy to Basra on 15 July to advise CPA (South). The CPA intends to hold a police contributor's conference shortly to garner support for a substantial international policing contribution, the UK is actively considering making a further part of this process.

 There is a lull in the fighting in Liberia. On 10 July, the Joint Verification Team, comprising the UN, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) and all sides in the conflict, began to verify and monitor the cease-fire. We continue to encourage all parties to respect the cease-fire and participate actively in the peace talks taking place in Ghana. The talks should lead to a negotiated political settlement and transitional government.

 President Taylor has been a destabilising influence in Liberia and the region. The UK does not see a political future for him in Liberia. We hope that he will stand down as he has promised to do. The cease-fire agreement, signed in Ghana on 17 June, included provision for the formation of a transitional government, not including President Taylor. Peace talks currently taking place in Ghana aim to agree a political roadmap, leading to free and fair elections.

 Excluding dependants, it is estimated that 195 Iraqi nationals who had sought asylum at some stage were removed in 2002. This figure includes persons deciding to leave after the initiation of enforcement action against them, and persons leaving under Assisted Voluntary Returns Programmes run by the International Organization for Migration.

<a name="30715w34.html_spnew4"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Decision making on Iraqi asylum applications was suspended on 20 March 2003 at the onset of military action. The rapidly changing country conditions meant that there was insufficient information to make a fully considered decision, either positive or negative, about an applicant's claim and whether they would qualify for asylum under the United Nations Convention.
<P>

<a name="30715w34.html_para4">We decided to resume processing of Iraqi asylum applications with effect from 16 June 2003. This coincided with a decision by the Independent Appellate Authority (IAA) to begin relisting asylum appeal hearings from the same date.
<P>

<a name="30715w34.html_para5">While there remain security and humanitarian concerns in some areas, the threat of persecution from Saddam Hussein's regime no longer exists. We did not want to keep applications on hold longer than necessary given the uncertainty this creates for the individuals concerned. Having obtained information about conditions in Iraq from a range of sources, we concluded that there was sufficient information on which to base decisions As with asylum applications from all nationalities, each case will be considered individually on its merits.
<P>

<a name="30715w34.html_para6">The United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) is currently making preparations for the eventual return of large numbers of Iraqis and is developing a return and reintegration plan. UNHCR understands that there are people who wish to return right now and is aware that we are making plans for voluntary return programmes. We are aware of their concerns and will continue to work closely with them. With this in mind, we are developing a coherent returns

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the <i>(a)</i> country of departure and <i>(b)</i> country of origin of asylum seekers who made an asylum claim at (i) Heathrow and (ii) Gatwick airports in each of the last five years.  [125185]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w34.html_spnew5"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Data is not collated centrally on the origin or the country of departure of asylum seekers, only by nationality. To obtain information on the number of people, who claimed asylum at Heathrow and Gatwick, over the last five years, would be possible only by examination of individual case-files at a disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what advice he has issued to chief constables on the <i>(a)</i> recruitment and <i>(b)</i> use of community support officers.  [122882]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w34.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The recruitment and deployment of community support officers (CSOs) is a matter for chief officers. In December 2002 the Home Office issued a "Frequently Asked Questions" document which gave some advice on these issues. The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) has also published a more detailed guidance document on CSOs, with material on both recruitment and deployment. This guidance is available to chief officers on the ACPO intranet site.

 The 27 forces who received first round Community Support Officer (CSO) funding are required to carry out a formal evaluation of their schemes.

<a name="30715w34.html_para7">It is standard practice for departments to evaluate the policy development process, including the use of consultation.

<a name="30715w34.html_para8">Details of the number of consultation documents issued in each consultation exercise are not collated on a central basis and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Also provision of full details as requested for the years 1999&#150;2000 would also incur disproportionate cost. However to give the fullest reply I can advise that the Home Office launched 19 consultations in 1999 and 28 consultation papers in 2000. Details of Home Office consultation publications can be found at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/inside/consults/index.html

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what initiatives to tackle crimes against older people his Department is responsible.  [124439]<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2003]:</i> Elderly people are far less likely to suffer crime than younger people. But in recognition that crime against older people is particularly distasteful, we have funded several schemes specifically to tackle this problem.
<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_para0">We set up a Distraction Burglary Task Force in 2000 to facilitate a multi-agency approach to reducing the problem of bogus callers and rogue traders. The task force includes people from different agencies who work with older people, such as Age Concern and Help the Aged, as well agencies such as the police. It has invested substantial resources and effort in promoting local schemes to tackle the problem, liaising with utility companies and others that need to call on the elderly, gathering data and publicising good practice both to the elderly and to those that work with them.
<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_para1">Under the Crime Reduction Programme, we funded a two-year programme (the Locks for Pensioners scheme) to provide home security upgrades for low income pensioners in areas with burglary rates above the national average. The scheme was run in conjunction with the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra's) Warm Front scheme, and, under it, over 58,000 homes received additional locks or bolts.
<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_para2">The Locks for Pensioners scheme has ended. But it is now open to Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships to fund local schemes where they identify crime against the elderly as a problem in their area. We cannot provide comprehensive data on locally funded projects for the elderly as this information is not held centrally. However, we know that interventions being implemented include improving the appearance and security of homes, sharing intelligence with all the involved agencies, educating people in crime reduction measures and providing reassurance and assistance.

 The West Midlands Police inform me that the internal investigation is drawing to a close.

<a name="30715w35.html_para15"><i>2. Community Cohesion Initiatives</i>
<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_para16">The Community Cohesion Pathfinder Programme, launched by the Home Office and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) in October 2002, aims to build examples of areas that are successfully mainstreaming community cohesion into all their core service delivery functions. The programme encompasses local authorities, the community and voluntary sector, and communities themselves. Pendle is one of the five authorities (together with Lancashire County Council, Burnley Borough Council, Hyndburn Borough Council, and Rossendale Borough Council) which make up the successful East Lancashire Community Cohesion Pathfinder. This will receive a total of &#163;285,000 to spend in the period February 2003 to October 2004.
<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_para17">The Home Office Community Cohesion Unit has worked closely with the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit of the ODPM, and through Government offices has funded community cohesion-focused activities for children and young people during the summer of 2001 and 2002 (in 2003 this has become incorporated into a single funded inter-Departmental programme). In 2001 around &#163;7 million was provided for summer activities.
<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_para18"><i>Positive Activities for Young People (PAYP)</i>
<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_para19">On 29 October 2002, the Street Crime Action Group (SCAG) commissioned the Department for Education and Skills and the Department for Culture, Media and 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 2003 : Column 275W</I><P>
Sport (DCMS) to report on the evaluation of summer activities in 2002 and on progress on simplifying funding.
<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_para20">In December, SCAG approved the key design features and objectives of the new programme based on a simplified single pot for funding. The confirmed total funding pot for 2003&#150;04 is &#163;24.7 million. The formula for the new programme, which for the first time is being developed in each Local Education Authority (LEA) area in the North West, is a national one. It is based on three indicators of need: levels of truancy, offending rates (specifically rates of robbery), and the numbers of young people aged 8&#150;19 in each area.
<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_para21">It is not possible to provide a figure for Pendle, but each Government office has the flexibility to adjust the allocations by up to 15 per cent. of the regional total. The allocation to Lancashire has been increased by over &#163;115,000 and GO-NW staff are looking to the LEA to take forward enhanced activities in east Lancashire in Burnley, Pendle and Hyndburn.
<P>

<a name="30715w35.html_para22">The Neighbourhood Renewal Unit of the ODPM and Government offices have also funded the community facilitation programme, under which regional co-ordinators have been appointed to undertake conflict resolution work where tensions are identified, and to strengthen existing capacity for conflict resolution. This programme has raised the profile of community cohesion at the regional and local level and facilitated the building of relationships and partnerships between agencies to address community cohesion and conflict. It has successfully supported the development of new approaches to addressing community conflicts.

<a name="30715w36.html_para0">The environmental sentencing review is looking at sentencing from a broad perspective and is principally concerned with the sentence given to a particular offence, rather than preventative measures taken against it. We expect the results by the end of June.

<a name="30715w36.html_para1">Specific measures to help tackle fly tipping have been proposed in the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill. If successful, the provisions will allow local authorities to stop, search and seize vehicles suspected of being used for fly tipping, and to investigate incidents to help them track and prosecute those responsible for dumping waste. The Bill will also give the Secretary of State the power to issue statutory directions to the Environment Agency and local authorities on the types of fly tipping incidents with which they deal.

<a name="30715w36.html_para2">Further research into fly tipping will be carried out later this year that will focus on better enforcement, prevention and deterrents.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 25 June 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 866W on immigration holding cells, which independent bodies are responsible for inspecting the police and immigration facilities listed; and when the last inspection took place in each case.

 Independent custody visiting is the new name for lay visiting, the well established system where volunteers attend police stations to check on the treatment of detainees and the conditions in which they are held. Unannounced visits are made at varying times of the day and night, with volunteers having immediate access to the custody area. Heathrow and Stansted police stations were visited most recently on 14 and 25 June, respectively.

<a name="30715w36.html_para5">Immigration holding rooms at ports are not at present subject to independent oversight. However, we have very recently invited Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Prisons, which performs a similar role in relation to immigration removal centres, to take on an inspection function for immigration short-term holding facilities, including holding rooms at ports, and we will be discussing with them the arrangements by which they might do so.

 The Secretary of State may make alterations to the boundaries of police areas by order under sections 32 to 34 of the Police Act 1996. He may only do so if he has either received a request to make alterations from the relevant police authority or authorities or if it seems to him that it is expedient to make changes in the interests of efficiency and effectiveness. I have received no such request from Nottinghamshire Police Authority nor am I aware of any evidence that indicates that the policing of either the city of Nottingham or the county of Nottinghamshire would be improved by creating a separate force for the city.

<P>
<a name="30715w37.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In September 1998, the Government announced a target to reduce vehicle crime by 30 per cent. over five years. The Vehicle Crime Reduction Action Team (VCRAT) was set up at the same time to develop and oversee the implementation of initiatives to meet this target. They published their strategy on 22 September 1999.
<P>

<a name="30715w37.html_para3">Their main proposals included improved security of new and used cars, improved car park security, better policing and community responses which targeted prolific offenders and crime hotspots, improved vehicle registration procedures, statutory regulation of the motor salvage industry and a publicity campaign to get vehicle crime prevention messages across to the public. Good progress is being made in implementing all these initiatives and some have been developed further. For example, work is in hand to make further improvements to vehicle registration procedures and we are working more closely with some local authorities and voluntary and community groups to get across vehicle crime prevention messages.
<P>

<a name="30715w37.html_para4">The latest published British Crime Survey shows that, from interviews in the year to December 2002, there were an estimated 2,306,000 vehicle crimes (i.e. thefts of or from vehicles or attempts). This is a reduction of 703,000 offences (23 per cent.) against the baseline of the British Crime Survey 2000 (which estimated crime in 1999).

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30715w38.html_para2">The Directorate has a budget of &#163;260 million over the three years 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06, most of which will be allocated to local authorities in support of their homelessness strategies, which they must have in place by 30 July 2003. The strategy must aim to prevent homelessness and ensure that accommodation and support are available for people who become homeless or are at risk of doing so. This funding will also assist local authorities in their efforts to tackle B&B use.
<P>

<a name="30715w38.html_para3">The Directorate is investing &#163;17 million over 2003/04/05 to support London & Quadrant Housing Trust to provide around 500 family houses for homeless households. Homes are being funded within the Housing Corporation's Social Housing Grant regime across a number of London boroughs where there are currently high numbers of black and minority ethnic households in temporary accommodation including B&B hotels.
<P>

<a name="30715w38.html_para4">Affordable housing has a vital role to play in tackling homelessness. As detailed in the Sustainable Communities Plan, &#163;5 billion is being invested in affordable housing over the next three years. This will make a further contribution to preventing homelessness and moving families out of B&B.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30715w38.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Indices of Deprivation 2000 (ID2000) have been used to determine Neighbourhood Renewal Fund (NRF) eligibility and the basis of distribution of the grant between eligible authorities. The Department decided that those authorities that appear within the top 50 most deprived districts on any of the six district level measures in the ID2000 should be eligible for the NRF. On this basis 81 authorities are eligible. It was also decided that there should be transitional arrangements for those authorities that were within the 50 most deprived areas on any of the four measures under the old Index of Local Deprivation, but are not in the list of 81 authorities that qualify using the ID2000. Therefore, a further seven local authority areas are eligible for the Fund. The 88 local authorities that are eligible for NRF and the amounts allocated to each authority in 2003/04 are listed in Annex A of the Special Grant Report 111 (SGR 111).
<P>

<a name="30715w38.html_para6">The sum to be allocated to each authority is based on a standard amount per head of population in those wards in the authority that are in the most deprived 10 per cent. of all wards nationally, with a minimum allocation in 2003&#150;04 of &#163;400,000 for any eligible authority. This relates an authority's grant funding to the severity of deprivation within its area, measured by the number of their residents living in particularly deprived areas.

This work is focused on BME households who have been accepted by the local authority as having a priority need for accommodation, but will cover issues around what the review of evidence in relation to housing and black and minority ethnic communities referred to as "so-called hidden homelessness". The current research is due to report in the Autumn and will include good practice recommendations on effective responses to homelessness for people from different black and minority ethnic groups.
<P>

<a name="30715w39.html_para29">In addition to this research, the Homelessness Act 2002 requires all local authorities to conduct a review of homelessness and have a strategy based on that review. The first strategies must be in place by 30 July this year and must aim to prevent homelessness and ensure that accommodation and support are available for people who become homeless or are at risk of doing so. Statutory and good practice guidance issued by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister emphasises the need for reviews, strategies and homelessness services to address the needs of black and minority ethnic communities.
<P>

<a name="30715w39.html_para30">Earlier this year, the Homelessness Directorate sponsored a series of seminars around the country designed to help local authorities and other agencies engage with, and address the needs of, faith and black and minority ethnic communities in conducting homelessness reviews and developing homelessness strategies and services.

<P>

<a name="30715w39.html_para31">A breakdown of homelessness amongst black and minority ethnic groups is now published quarterly with the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's regular statistical release on homelessness. The Homelessness Directorate will keep the extent of homelessness amongst black and minority ethnic communities, and the evidence base relating to that, under review.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is keen that all funded schemes continue. However, Government funding for warden schemes was awarded on a short-term basis, and it was clear from the start that this financial support would only be for a limited period. With this in mind the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is working closely with all schemes in the development of their future sustainability plans. Events are being held and guidance has been produced to assist scheme managers achieve sustainability for their warden schemes.
