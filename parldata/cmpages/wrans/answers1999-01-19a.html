<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will name the officers and staff in Land Command who recommended the transfer of HQ 101 Battalion REME from Chorley to Queensferry.  [65025]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 It is not our practice to identify individual officials in this way under Exemption 2 (Internal discussion and advice) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many officer vacancies exist in 101 Battalion REME in Chorley; and if he will estimate the number of officer posts in 101 Battalion REME that are likely to become vacant during 1999.  [65022]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 There are currently no officer vacancies at 101 Battalion REME in Chorley. It is not possible to gauge the number of officer posts in 101 Battalion REME that may become vacant in 1999, but we expect to have no difficulty achieving full staffing.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will refer back to Commander in Chief Land Command the decision to transfer HQ 101 Battalion REME from Chorley to Queensferry.  [65020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 I am satisfied that the advice that Land Command provided Ministers to inform their decision on the transfer of Headquarters 101 Battalion REME from Chorley to Queensferry was sound.

<a name="90119w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>RAF (Support Personnel)</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many technical support personnel are required to support the deployment away from existing RAF bases of flights of four or eight Tornado aircraft; and how many will be required for similar flights of Eurofighter aircraft.  [65754]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The number of technical support personnel deployed to support four or eight Tornado aircraft is dependent on several factors, including the operational requirement, the flying task, the number of hours to be worked in any one day and the amount of support available from the Host Nation. However, a flight of four or eight aircraft would be likely to generate a minimum of 82 and 144 technical support personnel respectively. An exact assessment of the numbers of technical support personnel required for Eurofighter has yet to be carried out, but preliminary studies indicate that approximately the same number of personnel will be required.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The forecast service life of the Eurofighter engine will be aligned to the predicted life of the whole aircraft, which is 25 years or 6,000 flying hours.
<P>

<a name="90119w01.html_para0">The Jaguar aircraft entered RAF service in 1973. On current plans, the Jaguar fleet, including the engines, will leave service in the later part of the next decade.
<P>

<a name="90119w01.html_para1">Modern aircraft engines are of modular design. Each module has an approved life and may be replaced during the life of the whole engine in accordance with established maintenance policy.

<a name="90119w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what service life has been achieved to date and what is forecast for Canberra aircraft in service with the RAF.  [65733]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The RAF Canberra fleet comprises two marks of the aircraft, the T4 and the PR9. The T4s entered service between 1954 and 1955 and have served some 44 years. The PR9s entered service between 1959 and 1960 and have served some 39 years. On current plans, the Canberra fleet will leave service in the early part of the next decade.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what has been the interval between major refits for HMS Ark Royal.  [65730]<P>

 The first refit of HMS Ark Royal has not yet taken place.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the forecast service life of each of the three aircraft carriers in service with the Royal Navy; and 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 1999 : Column: 393</I><P>
what will be the <i>(a)</i> design life and <i>(b)</i> design interval between major refits of the proposed replacement carriers.  [65910]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The forecast service life for HMS Invincible, HMS Illustrious and HMS Ark Royal is approximately 30 years. We plan to replace these carriers from around 2012 with two new, larger vessels. The planned service life of the new ships is a minimum of 30 years. The new carriers will not undergo lengthy major refits in the traditional sense, but will instead undergo shorter, but more frequent periods of maintenance lasting about six months every five or six years.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the average time between major refits for <i>(a)</i> Type 22 and <i>(b)</i> Type 23 ships.  [65753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Typically, the average time between major refits for RN Frigates and Destroyers is in excess of 7 years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the intended strategic purpose of the surveillance towers on hilltop sites in the South Armagh area; and what factors would be taken into account in a review of these towers.  [65998]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The primary function of the towers on hilltop sites is to protect Security Force bases in the South Armagh area and patrols conducted from them. As with all military establishments in Northern Ireland, the requirement for the towers is kept under continuous review to ensure the level of support provided to the RUC is consistent with the prevailing security situation and the assessment of the threat posed by terrorist organisations.

<UL>(2) pursuant to his answer of 15 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>458-59</i>, on special advisers, if he will list the assumed or equivalent civil service grade of each of the listed special advisers.  [65916]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Special Advisers are employed under terms and conditions set out in the Model Contract for Special Advisers. Special Advisers stand outside the departmental hierarchy and do not equate to particular civil service grades.

<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister what assessment he made of the extent to which there was a conflict of interest in the former Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the right hon. Member for Hartlepool (Mr. Mandelson), having a loan from the hon. Member for Coventry, North-West (Mr. Robinson) at a time when the right hon. Gentleman's Department was investigating the business affairs of the hon. Member.  [66456]

<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> Since the former Secretary of State was not involved in the Department of Trade and Industry's inquiries into certain allegations relating to companies with which my hon.

To ask the Prime Minister what is the current composition of the Ministerial Group on the Restructuring of the European Aerospace and Defence Industry (MISC 5).  [66847]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 As the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry may have to take decisions under the competition legislation on the proposed merger which BAe and GEC have announced in principle, I have decided that, while these issues are under consideration, it would be preferable for the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry not to participate in the work of MISC 5 in order to avoid any risk of it appearing that he had prejudged the issues involved. I have therefore appointed the Secretary of State for Defence as the Chairman of the Ministerial Group. The DTI will continue to be represented by the Minister for Energy and Industry.

 The Government make every effort to ensure that they are aware of the views of the British Muslim community and that their policies are understood by that community. My right hon.

<P>
<a name="90119w02.html_wqn5"><B> Ms Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what responses he has received to the draft Financial Services and Markets Bill; and if he will make a statement.  [66812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The response to publication of the draft Bill in July 1998 showed strong support for the creation of a single statutory regulator. There is widespread interest in ensuring that the Financial Services Authority continues to operate a fair, open and accountable manner. The Government intend to clarify and, where necessary, to amend the Bill to meet valid concerns raised on consultation and in response to the current inquiry by the Treasury Committee and the intended pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="90119w02.html_para0">In the meantime, we have decided to strengthen further the openness and accountability of the new regulatory regime. We intend to include in the Bill a statutory requirement for the FSA to establish practitioner and consumer panels, underpinning the arrangements the FSA has already put in place. We also intend to include in the Bill a requirement for the FSA to hold an annual open meeting at which the Chairman and others can be questioned on the FSA's policy and performance. The Bill will also include a requirement that the non-executive members should form a majority on the FSA Board.
<P>

<a name="90119w02.html_para1">The statutory requirements in the draft Bill for the FSA to consult on rules will be improved and will include a requirement that proposed rules and rule changes be accompanied by an explanation of how they relate to the FSA's objectives. The consultation requirements will also be extended so as to apply to standing guidance of general application.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 1999 : Column: 396</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90119w02.html_para2">The draft Bill requires the FSA to have in place arrangements for independent investigation of complaints. The FSA will be required under the Bill to consult on these arrangements. We also intend that in addition to publishing the conclusions of his investigation the investigator should be able to report on the FSA's response to any recommendations made.
<P>

<a name="90119w02.html_para3">The FSA will be accountable to Ministers and through them to Parliament. Its annual report under the Bill will be a key aspect of that accountability. The draft Bill enables the Treasury to require the FSA to report on specific matters. We will begin discussions with the FSA with a view to publishing an agreed list of matters to be covered in the report. We also intend that the Treasury should be given new powers to commission and publish periodic independent value for money audits of the FSA.
<P>

<a name="90119w02.html_para4">The draft Bill provides the Treasury with a number of powers to make statutory instruments. Drafts of key orders will be published for public consultation shortly. We will also undertake appropriate consultation on the other orders.

<P>
<a name="90119w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Contact arrangements normally work best when both parents are willing to co-operate, and in approaching the enforcement of contact orders the courts will seek to secure this. But the courts can, and will, enforce orders granting a parent contact with a child, including imprisonment as a last resort. Courts take their decisions in the best interests of the child and in the light of all the evidence and the particular circumstances of each case.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what estimate his Department has made of the total cost of introducing retrospective changes to the superannuation scheme for civil servants so as to ensure that former and current civil servants are granted pension entitlements for the years they were designated as having permanent unestablished status solely on the basis of a hearing impairment.

<P>
<a name="90119w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 No estimate has been made of these costs (or of extending any concession to the large numbers of civil servants who in other circumstances did not qualify for a pension). I am afraid that I can hold out no hope of any relevant improvement in the statutory provisions. In superannuation matters, it is rarely, if ever, possible to make changes with retrospective effect.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The distinction between established and unestablished service disappeared in 1972 when a new pension scheme was introduced. Staff serving in an unestablished capacity, including those on permanent unestablished terms, were admitted to the scheme. Their earlier unestablished service then became pensionable. There are no centrally held records of the numbers of staff serving in a permanent unestablished capacity who resigned before this change was made and who subsequently returned to the Civil Service.

<a name="90119w06.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to ensure that the London Fire Brigade can meet any additional fire risk associated with the Millennium Dome.  [66090]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The statutory responsibility for ensuring efficient fire services rests with the London Fire and Civil Defence Authority.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list each derogation from Article 8 of the Data Protection Directive 95/46/EC which he plans to provide to the Commission, pursuant to Article 8(6) of that Directive; and if he will make a statement.  [65981]

<a name="90119w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 I am not yet in a position to provide a full list. The derogations will include processing covered by paragraphs 7 and 9 of Schedule 3 of the Data Protection Act 1998, and by any order made under paragraph 10 of that Schedule. Such an order is likely to include the processing of information about criminal offences and criminal convictions for the purpose of preventing or detecting criminal offences; the processing by political parties of information about political opinions in connection with canvassing; and certain processing by the police or other investigating organisations. I am considering further suggestions made in the responses to last August's consultation exercise on subordinate legislation under the Data Protection Act 1998.

<P>
<a name="90119w06.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Cohen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list <i>(a)</i> the uses made of the Electoral Register for non-electoral purposes and <i>(b)</i> those bodies which have indicated to his review of the use of the Electoral Register for non-electoral purposes that they access the Register; and if he will make a statement.  [65967]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Home Office Working Party is continuing to examine the case for a change in the way in which the electoral register is made available for non-electoral purposes. The main uses so far identified include credit referencing, direct marketing, and the prevention of fraud and money laundering. There is also some use made by charities for fundraising, and by genealogists for research purposes.

 It is difficult to know, in any particular case, whether a subject access application has been "enforced" but in the opinion of the police, the majority

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list by each police authority area how many breathalysed drivers were deemed to have exceeded the legal limit between Christmas and the New Year in each of the last three years; and if he will make a statement.  [65873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Figures collected by the Home Office do not enable the Christmas and New Year period to be separately identified. The Association of Chief Police Officers, however, has collected figures on the number of positives tests of drivers who had been involved in collisions dealt with by the police during the Christmas Drink Drive campaign for the last two years, and these are in Table 1. Comparable figures for 1996-97 are not available.
<P>

<a name="90119w07.html_para0">The Home Office does, however, collect and publish figures for the month of December, and they are given on Table 2. Figures for 1998 are not yet available, but will be published in the spring.

The rules on travel for Ministers are the same as those that applied to the previous Administration. Travel by Ministers on Royal Air Force flights between the 16 month period between 2 May 1997 and 30 September 1998 is not directly comparable with the 12 months of the previous Administration.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State received some 30 complaints and inquiries about the disruption to power supplies caused by the storms in late December. In addition, the independent Director General of Electricity Supply for Northern Ireland, who has the statutory duty to protect the interests of consumers in respect of continuity of supply and quality of supply services provided, has received some 1,050 complaints and inquiries. The Director has sought a full and detailed report from NIE by 31 January 1999 on the company's response to the problems encountered by consumers over the Christmas holiday period. The Secretary of State met NIE on 6 January and expressed her concern about the difficulties faced by consumers. NIE agreed to provide the Secretary of State with a copy of the report being prepared for the Director. The Government have no plans to nationalise the electricity distribution system in Northern Ireland.

Our approach has been to work with established business groups, rather than with individual companies. In developing countries we have consulted with British business associations and local chambers of commerce.

 Paragraph 26.3 of the revised Mental Health Act Code of Practice, laid before Parliament on 3 December 1998, was included to ensure that visits by a child to a patient detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 are considered in relation to the child's best interests as well as the patient's, and that such decisions are recorded and monitored. The child should be treated as an individual with his or her own needs, and any decision to allow a child to visit a patient should be a positive one that it would be in their best interests.

<a name="90119w10.html_para6">Directions have already been issued to the three special hospitals regarding arrangements for visits by children. We intend to issue separate guidance as soon as possible to assist all other hospitals that take detained patients, and social services departments, in drawing up child visiting policies. This will be subject to prior consultation. Decisions on whether a child should visit will be the responsibility of the hospital managers, and hospital policies will set out the arrangements for deciding whether a child should visit a patient. Such arrangements will need to take account of the significant role that those 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 1999 : Column: 427</I><P>
with parental responsibility have in allowing such visits. Written hospital policies will also set out those circumstances when parental consent alone will be sufficient to allow a child to visit a patient, and where this is not sufficient, who else should be involved in the decision-making process.

<P>

<a name="90119w10.html_para8">Paragraph 26.3 of the Code is drafted in wide terms to ensure that all visits by children are considered in this way. In the majority of cases, decisions will be straightforward, and will not affect current visiting practices.

The funding will enable existing grant commitments to be met while the Department develops, in consultation with the Opportunities for Volunteering, national voluntary organisations and other interested parties, its overall strategy to promote volunteering and targeting of the scheme. While the strategy is being developed it would not make sense for new Opportunities for Volunteering grants to be made, committing future funding. The position from 2000-01 will be included in the consideration of the strategy.

<a name="90119w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The National Strategy for Carers, announced by my right hon. Friend, the Prime Minister last June, has been looking in depth at the needs of young carers, including, among other issues, at what action is already being taken through schools and how that can be enhanced. A United Kingdom consultative conference was held on 19 November 1998 to discuss how the needs of all carers might be better met and among the delegates present were representatives of young carers organisations. Through our national priorities guidance for health and social services authorities, we are also asking general practitioners, primary care teams and social services authorities to identify carers. We are also testing a new data collection system, the Referrals, Assessments and Packages of Care, in social services departments. Under this system, social services authorities will collect information about the assessments undertaken and carers identified. The data will be broken down by broad age group, including for young people under 18.

 <i>[holding answer 14 January 1999]:</i> British waters extend to a limit of three nautical miles around Gibraltar.

<P>
<a name="90119w13.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 January 1999]:</i> Between 1991 and 1997, Spanish fishermen entered Gibraltar waters and fished in moderate numbers, kept away from the harbour and Admiralty waters, and respected the authority of the law enforcement agencies. We have been seeking to return to that situation, including through discussion with the Spanish authorities.

 <i>[holding answer 14 January 1999]:</i> Section 10(b) of the Gibraltar Nature Protection Ordinance 1991 provides that the use of, inter alia, any seine or gill net or any pot or device for raking of sea bed, for the purpose of killing or taking any wild animal, constitutes an offence. The use of any fishing equipment other than fishing lines is therefore unlawful. Spanish fishing boats have used a variety of nets and rakes.

<P>
<a name="90119w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> In Lancashire, as elsewhere in the UK, Oftel has responsibility for safeguarding the integrity of the core telecommunications network and has established a Year 2000 project to monitor and assess the telecommunications industry's preparations. Oftel has taken steps to ensure that telecoms services are not disrupted over the millennium. All the main network operators, who are co-operating with Oftel and the Home Office, are taking the issue seriously, and have outlined their plans to meet this challenge. The main network operators already have sophisticated systems in place to safeguard the provision of emergency services over their networks and their current work on the Millennium Bug is building on the resilience already built in to these companies' systems. Oftel is keeping the preparations of the network operators under review.
<P>

<a name="90119w14.html_para0">Action 2000 is working closely with Oftel to ensure rigorous assessment programmes are in place, and a peer review of the telecom operators is already being undertaken, permitting the industry's most technically able experts to collaborate in checking peer companies' systems. It is difficult to make a precise assessment of the likelihood of interruption. Oftel expects that the principal sectors of the industry will be Year 2000 compliant during the first half of 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) if the term "average cost", with reference to flights by Ministers in his Department, refers to the average cost per passenger;  [64721]

<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w14.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 January 1999]:</i> As my answer of 19 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 838, made clear, Ministers are required under the terms of the Ministerial Code always to make efficient and cost effective travel arrangements. The rules on travel for Ministers are the same as those that applied to the previous Administration. A comparison of travel by Ministers on RAF flights between the 16 month period between 2 May 1997 and 30 September 1998 is not directly comparable with the 12 months of the previous administration.
<P>

<a name="90119w14.html_para1">The average cost contained in my earlier reply referred to the cost per trip and not the individual cost per passenger. This Department was created from the former Departments of the Environment and Transport in June 1997 and also has the additional responsibilities of the Deputy Prime Minister. A direct comparison with previous years is not therefore possible. I am advised that the total cost of Ministerial flights provided by the RAF for the Departments of the Environment and Transport in the year to 1 May 1997 was &#163;6,302. Cabinet Office was responsible for any expenditure incurred by the then Deputy Prime Minister.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much of the public and private sewerage network is currently subject to <i>(a)</i> infiltration and <i>(b)</i> exfiltration.  [65885]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w14.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Department does not collect this information. Under section 94 of the Water Industry Act 1991, sewerage undertakers are responsible for the effectual drainage of their areas and for maintaining their pipework. From meetings held with the water and sewerage industry last year, there appears to be no evidence that exfiltration or infiltration in public sewers is causing any major problems. I understand that Water UK will be carrying out research in this area later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the necessary change in investment in the sewerage system following the inclusion of the condition of sewerage assets in the new sustainable development indicators.  [65886]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w14.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Levels of investment in the public sewerage system are a matter for sewerage undertakers and the Director General of Water Services. In "Raising the Quality" (September 1998), we published guidance to the Director General of Water Services which covered sewer maintenance as well as investment in new assets. The Director General subsequently published his own forward look at the necessary investment programmes of water companies and their price implications in "Prospects for Prices" (October 1998).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the water companies OFWAT has penalised for failing to meet their targets on flooding from sewers and collapses <i>(a)</i> between 1990 and 1995 and <i>(b)</i> from 1995 to date.  [65887]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w14.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Companies' performance is reported each year in the Director General of Water Services' annual Report on Levels of Service. The 1997-98 Report shows that the proportion of properties at risk from sewer flooding more than twice in every ten years has fallen substantially from 0.13 per cent. in 1990-91 to 0.06 per cent. in 1997-98.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 1999 : Column: 442</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90119w14.html_para2">The annual Report also explains regulatory action taken in respect of companies about whose performance the Director has concerns. Where the Director has concerns over levels of sewer flooding, he requires the company to take remedial action. The Director does not currently have powers to impose fines, but has indicated his intention to take sewer flooding and other aspects of companies' past performance into account when setting price limits.
<P>

<a name="90119w14.html_para3">Sewer flooding that affects customers' properties is penalised by compensation available to customers in the Guaranteed Standards Scheme. In 1997-98, payments of up to a maximum of &#163;1,000 were made to 4,367 customers who made claims.
<P>

<a name="90119w14.html_para4">There are no targets for sewer collapses but they are taken into account when OFWAT assesses the serviceability to customers of the companies assets. Serviceability is in turn taken into account when the Director sets companies' price limits.

 There is no specific definition of 'greenfield' land. The information available relates to housing built on land that has not been previously developed. The Department's Land Use Change Statistics for England provide information on (a) the percentage of new dwellings (excluding conversions) built on land not previously developed for urban uses and (b) the proportion of land used for new housing that was not previously developed. The table shows results for the above measures for the period 1992 to 1996 (the most recent available).

<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w15.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what responses he has received to his consultation paper on a waste strategy, "Less Waste: More Value"; what is the time scale for implementation of that waste strategy; what conclusions he has reached on the subjects of <i>(a)</i> waste minimisation and <i>(b)</i> recycling; and if he will make a statement.  [65769]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government's consultation paper on reviewing the waste management strategy for England and Wales, "Less Waste: More Value", was launched by my right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment on 9 June 1998. During the consultation period over 28,000 copies of the document were distributed. The consultation period ended on 25 September 1998, by which time 652 submissions had been received by my Department, including 267 submissions from local authorities. In addition, 137 members of the public wrote to Ministers following the launch of the consultation document and its attendant publicity in the media.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 1999 : Column: 444</I><P>

"Less Waste: More Value" set out a range of options and questions on what policies the Government should pursue, in order to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>encourage, and emphasise the importance of, actions to minimise the waste that we produce (both in terms of volume and hazardousness); and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>substantially increase the recycling and composting rates for waste, as part of an integrated strategy which also addresses the issue of waste that it does not make sense to recycle.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90119w15.html_para3">We are now in the process of developing these policies, which will be published for consultation, as part of the draft of the new waste strategy for England and Wales. The Government intend to publish a draft of the new waste strategy during the Spring of 1999 and will consult with all interested parties during the Summer. We plan to publish a final version of the new waste strategy as a Command Paper before the end of 1999.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w15.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what advice he has sought regarding the strategy to be pursued to achieve the Government's waste recycling targets for Greater London; how the Government intend to achieve these targets without placing greater reliance on landfill sites; 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 1999 : Column: 445</I><P>
what is his strategy regarding incineration and the development of combined heat and power; and if he will make a statement.  [65771]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The new Mayor of London will have a duty to prepare an integrated municipal waste management strategy for London. This will have regard to the national waste strategy, due to be published later this year, and local authority waste recycling plans. In the meantime, the Government are providing London Boroughs with &#163;12 million under the Capital Challenge Programme to boost recycling levels in London.
<P>

<a name="90119w15.html_para4">Waste to energy incineration must be considered in the context of an integrated approach to waste management, which encourages waste minimisation, re-use and recycling. Where waste incineration with energy recovery is the best practicable environmental option, the potential for incorporating CHP should always be considered in order to maximise the energy which is recovered.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w15.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what role he envisages for incineration in achieving his waste strategy for London; what plans he has to place a moratorium on the development or expansion of incinerator capacity; what advice his Department will issue to local authorities on <i>(a)</i> the scale of any future facilities and <i>(b)</i> the length of disposal contracts for incineration; and if he will make a statement.  [65770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 Waste incineration is currently an integral part of waste disposal in London and in the consultation paper issued last year on the national waste strategy the Government took the view that there was likely to be a need for higher levels of incineration with energy recovery in future. We do not plan to place a moratorium on the development or expansion of incinerator capacity in London, nor do we plan to issue advice to local authorities on the scale of future facilities or the length of disposal contracts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w16.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if Her Majesty's Government support the application of the Biosafety Protocol's proposed procedures for Advanced Informed Agreement to agricultural commodities and commodities designated for processing, where such commodities contain genetically modified organisms or parts thereof; and if he will oppose any attempts in the protocol negotiations to exclude such commodities from the AIA procedures.  [66036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government's view is that the Protocol should cover the transboundary movement of all living modified organisms (LMOs), including LMOs that are agricultural commodities and commodities intended for processing. The Advanced Informed Agreement procedures should apply to transboundary movements of LMOs intended for deliberate release, including commodities. The UK is still considering its position on appropriate procedures for commodities intended for processing and will press hard for adequate coverage to secure environmental safety. Commodities that consist of non-living products of LMOs should not be covered by the protocol since the scope set out in the mandate from the Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity is to develop a protocol focusing specifically on the transboundary movement of living modified organisms.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w16.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if Her Majesty's Government supports proposals to include provisions in the Biosafety Protocol to allow countries to take socio- economic considerations into account when reaching a decision on whether to grant advanced informed agreement to allow the proposed import of a GMO to proceed.  [65963]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government consider that the basis for decision-making under the Protocol should be a scientific risk assessment, but recognise that some countries may wish to consider socio-economic aspects in reaching their decision on whether to grant advance informed agreement.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w16.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions whether his Department will support proposals to include provisions for a regime for strict liability within the Biosafety Protocol.  [65962]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Government acknowledge the importance of the issue of liability and redress in the context of damage to biological diversity and its relevance to the Biosafety Protocol. For this reason, the UK and the European Commission last year hosted a small international workshop to explore the issues arising in relation to the Protocol. The Government consider that provisions for a regime for strict liability cannot be developed in the short time remaining to complete the negotiations. I hope, however, that it will be possible at the final meeting of the Biosafety Working Group developing the Protocol to agree how the matter might be taken forward, bearing in mind the ongoing discussions in the context of Article 14 of the Convention on Biological Diversity.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 9 December 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>194</i>, over the four year period under consideration <i>(a)</i> how many driving instructors were accepted for registration, <i>(b)</i> how many of these were subsequently removed from registration within (i) six months, (ii) one year, (iii) 18 months, and (iv) two years, <i>(c)</i> what was the average period that those removed from the register had previously been registered, and <i>(d)</i> how many people paid examination fees to the Driving Standards Agency.  [65725]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w16.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 January 1999]:</i> During the four years up to 30 November 1998, 7,225 new instructors have been added to the Register of Approved Driving Instructors (ADI). Of these six have been subsequently removed as a result of failing a check test of their instructional ability following three successive check test failures. None were removed in the first 18 months of their registration. Three were removed within their first two years of registration, and the other three were removed between two and four years of registration. The average period they were on the Register was 26 months.
<P>

<a name="90119w16.html_para0">To join the register, a person has to pass a three part examination--a written test, a practical test of driving ability and a practical test of instructional ability for which the fees are currently &#163;50 for the written test and &#163;62 for practical test. During the same 4 year period, some 24,000 people started the ADI qualifying process, taking a total of 46,000 written tests and the Driving Standards Agency also conducted 58,164 practical tests (figures for the two practical tests are not compiled separately). Some of the tests would have been further attempts by unsuccessful candidates.

 The following estimates are taken from the report, "Incidence Effects of Charging for Domestic Water and Sewerage Services" published by my Department in July 1998. This reported the results of modelling work undertaken on behalf of the Department by Maxwell Stamp Plc. The figures relate to households in England and Wales where there is a choice between measured and unmeasured options. The estimates assume no consequent reduction in consumption or tariff rebalancing. The outcome depends on the tariffs adopted by companies for unmeasured and for measured charging.
<P>

<a name="90119w17.html_para0">(i) Under the current tariffs of water undertakers: 40 per cent. of households would pay less on a measured than they would on an unmeasured basis of charging. 55 per cent. of pensioner households would pay less on a measured than unmeasured basis of charging.
<P>

<a name="90119w17.html_para1">(ii) Assuming a measured basis without standing charge: 44 per cent. of households would pay less on a measured than they would on an unmeasured basis of charging. 63 per cent. of pensioner households would pay less on a measured than unmeasured basis of charging.
<P>

<a name="90119w17.html_para2">The Government's policy, reflected in the Water Industry Bill, is that domestic consumers presently charged on an unmeasured basis should have the option of requesting a measured basis of charging. The Bill would also give new rights to customers paying an unmeasured charge, to continue paying on an unmeasured basis on their present homes where they are using water only for essential household use.

<a name="90119w17.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 It is not possible to say with any accuracy how many properties are in disrepair at any one time.

<P>

<a name="90119w17.html_para3">The VOA estimate that a maximum of 15 per cent. of the total of 1.7 million non-domestic properties may fall into this category at any one point in time, and that their condition may be such that the occupiers may seek to obtain a reduction in their rate liability as a result.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked Lawrie Haynes, the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question. I am replying in Lawrie's absence from the office. You asked "Which categories of traffic he proposes to ban from the A1 corridor between Lobley Hill and North Brunton, Newcastle; if that ban will extend to the New Tyne Crossing; over what hours the ban will be in force; what alternative routes he proposes; when the ban is to be introduced; and what consultation he proposes to have with local residents and schools that may be affected".</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You will know of the considerable peak hour congestion that occurs on the A1 in Tyneside. It is felt that slow moving vehicles exacerbate this problem and we propose to introduce a ban, by means of an experimental Temporary Traffic Order this Spring.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is proposed that any vehicle which cannot attain a speed of 30mph on the level in free-flowing conditions will be prohibited from entering the A1 Gateshead and Newcastle Western By-Passes. This will include the sections between Lobley Hill, the Tyne Crossing at Blaydon and North Brunton. The ban, when introduced, will be in force between the hours of 7am to 9am and 4pm to 6pm from Monday to Friday and is expected to be introduced this Spring.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Consultations will be held with local authorities and other representative bodies with the issue or alternative routes being discussed before the ban is introduced. This temporary scheme will be implemented under the powers of an Experimental Traffic Regulation Order. During this time we will monitor the impact on traffic movements and views of any interested individuals or organisations will be welcomed. Any comments received will be taken into account before deciding whether to make the ban permanent.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to the letter of 22 September 1998 (IYR/PSO/16123/98) from the Minister for the Environment to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, if he will give examples of what has been achieved in making progress towards clean development mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol.  [65394]<P>

<P>
<a name="90119w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In Buenos Aires, Parties agreed to give priority to the clean development mechanism (CDM) within the wider work programme on the Kyoto Protocol. The aim is to have all the modalities and procedures established by the sixth Conference of the Parties (COP6--which will probably be in late 2000). The UNFCCC secretariat will convene two technical workshops on the CDM, and the other Kyoto mechanisms, before April of next year.
<P>

<a name="90119w17.html_para5">The EU will submit further proposals on the CDM to the secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change by the end of March as input to these workshops.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by how much in percentage terms <i>(a)</i> the highest rate of grant for coastal defence work and <i>(b)</i> the normal rate of grant have been reduced since 1997.  [66042]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The rates of grant available to maritime district councils for approved capital coast protection works have remained unchanged at 35 per cent., 45 per cent., 55 per cent., 65 per cent. and 75 per cent. since 1992. The formula used to determine which rate of grant is applicable to specific works was subject to significant change with effect from 1 April 1997, with a view to bringing the direct government contribution to the national programme within the range 50 to 55 per cent. The announcement of that change was made in November 1996 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 1999 : Column: 453</I><P>
by the previous administration. The only change to the formula since then was an adjustment by 2 per cent, in line with inflation, made with effect from 1 April 1998.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will publish his proposals for coastal protection co-ordination for the rest of the period covered by the Comprehensive Spending Review.  [66040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Coast protection authorities are encouraged to work within the policy framework published in the "Strategy for Flood and Coastal Defence in England and Wales". As confirmed in the response to the Agriculture Select Committee's report on Flood and Coastal Defence, the Government consider there is scope to enhance the effectiveness of the current arrangements, to improve the co-ordination that takes place and to help ensure delivery of the national strategy. This will be achieved by developing the way in which the Environment Agency exercises its current general flood defence supervisory duty and seeking to establish national targets for all operating authorities. These targets will be published in due course.
<P>

<a name="90119w18.html_para0">The Ministry's concept of Shoreline Management Plans and strategic planning was developed to encourage operating authorities to work together, to consider the impact of their schemes on neighbouring authorities and overall to improve decision-making. The first generation of such Plans is now nearing completion, and all should be published by Spring 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Ministry commissioned Halcrows, as lead consultants, to produce the "Coast Protection Survey of England"; it was published in 1994. The survey was reviewed in 1995 and 1996, but these updates showed that the rate of change in the state of defences did not warrant such frequent reviews. Action in 1997 was therefore confined to a review of authorities' plans in respect of defences identified as being in most urgent need of repair. Consideration will now be given to the future development of an asset database of all flood and coastal defences irrespective of operating authority.

<P>
<a name="90119w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Within Government, overall responsibility for climate change rests with my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister. So far as the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is concerned, I oversee policies, including the implications for flood and coastal defence, though my right hon. Friend the Minister has overall policy responsibility.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the effect of increased inspection charges on small abattoirs.  [66158]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90119w18.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government recognise that increases in veterinary supervision levels in small abattoirs will have significant cost implications for their operators, and we have received many representations on this issue. The impact on individual premises will depend on the circumstances prevailing at those premises, including the current level of veterinary supervision, the size and throughput of the premises, the complexity and standard of hygiene of operations, and the type of animal being slaughtered. We continue to keep the matter under review and, bearing in mind our EU legal obligations, to seek to minimise the impact on abattoir operators wherever possible.
