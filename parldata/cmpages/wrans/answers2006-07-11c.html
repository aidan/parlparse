20 showed Hertfordshire as the worst performing area in the weighted
scorecard, which ranks probation areas according to their performance
across the range of key indicators. The greatest areas of concern are
with performance in relation to the two key targets on OASys risk
assessments on (a) high risk offenders and (b) prolific and other
priority offenders (PPOs). Performance on both these targets was 14 per
cent. in 2005-06. The target for both high risk and PPOs is 90 per
cent.</p><p><a name="06071169002139">Performance on
the enforcement target is the worst of all the probation areas at 80
per cent. The target is 90 per cent. and the aggregate of all areas in
England and Wales was 91 per cent. Hertfordshire achieved77
per cent. on compliance against a target of 85 per cent. and an England
and Wales average of 81 per cent. Against a target of 645 completions
of unpaid work orders, Hertfordshire achieved 464 (72 per
cent.).49 per cent. of victims were contacted within the
timescale required by national standards&#151;the target is 85 per
cent. and nationally the NPS is achieving 93 per cent. The remaining
key performance indicators are at or around target with the exception
of basic skills awards where double the awards target was achieved in
2005-06.</p><br><notus-date day="10" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>10 July 2006 : Column 1689W</b><br><p><a name="06071169002140">HM

It is the responsibility of the operators to ensure
that each student employed on the seasonal agricultural workers scheme
(SAWS) has a contract of employment and that it meets the terms and
conditions of both the scheme and all appropriate employment
legislation. Monitoring activities have found that many students
employed on the SAWS are being paid as daily casual workers; a practice
which is incompatible with the terms and conditions of the SAWS
contract. The contract states that participants are to be offered work
for a minimum period of five weeks and a minimum of 40 hours work per
week. Officials sent a contract clarification letter to all SAWS
operators on 22 June 2006 confirming that SAWS students must not be
employed on daily contracts and that employment contracts must be
amended accordingly. A working group of Home Office officials and SAWS
operator representatives will now address how the operators should be
seeking to comply with the requirements and the timescales for doing
so.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071169000046">Security Industry

that of the EU, that certain terms are potentially inflammatory if used
inappropriately and there are those who wish to misrepresent Government
policies as anti-Muslim or anti-Islam. The Austrian presidency took
work on this forward with the development of a short list of key terms
and a broader EU communications strategy, which was designed to provide
a framework for discussing issues related to Islamist terrorism. The
lexicon is a living document which the current presidency may or may
not chose to expand, but, as part of the communications strategy, it is
a guide to help EU Ministers and officials express themselves clearly
and to minimise the chance of their statements and policies being

Benn:</b> Debt relief provides long-term,
predictable resources for countries to spend on improving health and
education. Recipients of debt relief under the heavily indebted poor
countries (HIPC) initiative report their expenditure on reducing
poverty (health, education, and rural and agriculture investments for
example) and these expenditures increased from an average of 6 per
cent. of GDP in 1999 to 9 per cent. of GDP in 2005 in the 29 countries
receiving HIPC debt relief.</p><br><notus-date day="11" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>11 July 2006 : Column 1731W</b><br><p><a name="06071210000531">There is
good evidence that debt relief benefits health and education provision.
For example, after receiving debt relief in 2000, Ghana increased its
expenditure on education, increasing the net enrolment ratio of seven
to 13-year-olds by 8 per cent. and the number of secondary schools from
937 to 1,024 by 2004. In Tanzania, debt relief received in 2001, helped
to increase the number of children in primary schools by over 50 per
cent., build almost 2,500 new primary schools and recruit 28,000 extra
teachers. If this rate of progress continues, Tanzania will meet the
goal for universal primary education in the next couple of
years&#151;significantly ahead of the target date of 2015. In Uganda,
debt relief has helped make possible the removal of user fees for
healthcare. As a result, the number of new out-patient consultations
has increased from 9.3 million in 1999-2000 to 24.5 million, indicating
a doubling in the use of health services over five years. Immunisation
coverage has increased from 41 per cent. in 1999-2000 to 89 per cent.
in
2004-05.</p><p><a name="06071210000532">When
fully implemented, the new multilateral debt relief initiative (MDRI)
will provide over US$50 billion of debt cancellation to up to 43
countries. Zambia has used some of its savings under MDRI to abolish
health user fees in rural areas, allowing thousands of poor people to
access free health care. Ghana also intends to use some of its MDRI
savings for health and education, and we expect other countries to make
similar commitments when their new budgets are
agreed.</p><p><a name="06071210000533">Health
and education in Nigeria will also benefit as a result of its recent
debt deal at the Paris Club. Approximately $1 billion a year that would
have been spent by Nigeria on debt service will now be channelled
through a poverty reduction fund with a focus on the millennium
development goals. As a result, the federal health and education
budgets have received an additional $167 million and $143 million
respectively in 2006. The Nigerian Government have agreed that this
will help to employ an additional 120,000 teachers and put 3.5 million
more children into
school.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06071210000007">Constitutional

Projections of the proportion of pensioner households eligible for
pension credit are sensitive to modelling assumptions and to projected
changes in the distribution of pensioner
incomes.<br>2. The
estimates shown here are the mid-points of projections taken from two
separate micro-simulation models. Modelling of the reform proposals
does not include any increase in private saving from the introduction
of personal accounts, which would reduce the numbers eligible for
pension credit.<br>3. These
projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard
guarantee credit; earnings uprating of the savings credit threshold
from 2008 to 2014; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from
2012; price uprating of the maximum savings credit from 2015; measures
to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White
Paper.<br>4.
Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010
and 2020. Estimates assume that the minimum age at which people can
claim pension credit rises in line with women&#146;s state pension
age.<br>5. Estimates are
calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004-05 National Statistics range
estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2004-05
Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in
reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as ranges,
they are subject to a margin of
uncertainty.<br>6.
Estimates of the number of pensioners eligible under the proposed
reforms are not available for each country. As explained above, the
estimates are based on taking the average of results from two separate
models, a process which would render the breakdown of estimates at
sub-Great Britain level
unreliable.<br></td></tr></table><br><p><a name="06071210001209"><b><a name="06071210001737">Christine

better skilled staff. Projects are delivering more effective results,

Nevertheless, there is still a case for further reform to improve aid
effectiveness.</p>
