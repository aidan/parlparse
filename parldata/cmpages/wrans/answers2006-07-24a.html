the Aarhus Convention is an important statement, at international
level, of the rights of the public to be involved in decisions which
have significant environmental effects. The UK&#146;s ratification of
the convention, in February 2005, demonstrates our commitment to the
importance of these principles. A comprehensive guide can be found on
the DEFRA website at:
http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/internat/aarhus/index.htm</p><p><a name="06072411000049">In
addition, DEFRA&#146;s environmental information unit (EIU) provides
advice on the convention and the Environmental Information Regulations.
The EIU has produced leaflets and posters publicising peoples&#146;
rights to access environmental information and provides detailed
guidance on the DEFRA website at
http://www.defra.gov.uk/corporate/opengov/eir/index. htm This also
links to the Environmental Information Regulations 2004 (EIRs), the
code of practice and the Aarhus
Convention.</p><p><a name="06072411000050">The code
of practice, (which was laid in Parliament in February 2005) and
guidance have been revised to take responses to a public consultation
into
account.</p><p><a name="06072411000051">Additionally,
the unit offers support to Government Departments and public
authorities on EIRs. This support includes workshops to discuss how
they can raise awareness within their authorities and provides an
opportunity to share good practice. In 2003-04, the Government&#146;s
sustainable development unit worked with the Department for
Constitutional Affairs supporting the freedom of information (FOI) road
shows programme and gave talks to public authorities around the country
explaining how to handle FOI and EIR

2006 and sets out 12 key initiatives and over 60 associated actions to
help realise optimum use of biomass as a resource. These measures
include a capital grant scheme for biomass boilers, the establishment
of a new Biomass Energy Centre to provide expert information and
advice, further grant support for biomass supply chains, and a
commitment to consider using biomass in the Government estate. We also

of the benefits that can be delivered by farming and provides funding
to farmers ad other land managers in England who deliver effective
environmental management on their land. Together with the introduction
of cross-compliance conditions under the Single Payment Scheme (SPS),
this will ensure that the English landscape continues to be protected

[87339]</p><p><a name="06072426003155"><b><a name="06072426003574">The
Solicitor-General:</b> The Public Prosecution Service conducts
all cases it prosecutes, including those on behalf of the Environment
and Heritage Service, in accordance with the Test for Prosecution. That
test is whether there is sufficient available evidence to afford a
reasonable prospect of conviction and, if so, whether it is in the
public interest to prosecute. If the evidential aspect of the test is
met, there is a strong presumption that prosecution is in the public
interest; the more serious the offence, or its consequences, the
stronger the presumption. The cost of bringing a prosecution does not
weigh in that consideration. The PPS may take into account, in
assessing the public interest, of whether the offence is of such a
nature that it is likely that the court will impose only a very small
or nominal
penalty.</p><p><a name="06072426003156">The
cost-effectiveness of prosecutions is based on the overall efficiency
of the PPS. It is not connected in any way with the fines imposed
following conviction. Such fines are not payable to the PPS. Following
conviction, the PPS will usually ask for its costs to be paid by the
defendant but whether such an order is made, and to what extent, is a
matter for judicial
determination.</p><p><a name="06072426003157">The
cost effectiveness of the PPS and what is being done to maintain and
improve efficiency is the subject of the PPS annual report and business
plan, copies of which are available in the Library of the
House.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06072426000111">Offences

Attorney-General (which includes therefore the granting of consent to
prosecute) may be exercised by the
Solicitor-General.</p><p><a name="06072426003160">It
