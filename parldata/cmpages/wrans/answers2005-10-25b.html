<p><a name="st_2"><a name="51025w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Defra has overall policy responsibility for flood and coastal erosion risk in England, funds most of the Environment Agency&#039;s flood management activities (including for flooding from the sea) and provides grant aid on a project by project basis to local authorities for their coastal defence improvement projects. Defra does not build defences, direct the authorities on which specific projects to undertake nor in general specify the materials and techniques to be used.

<p>
<a name="51025w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_3">The Government encourage authorities to consider a variety of options when considering solutions. A key point is that authorities should work with natural processes wherever possible and the use of beaches to absorb wave energy is a widely used &quot;soft&quot; technique. However, Defra does not hold information centrally on the various other techniques that might be in use and I regret that I cannot answer the question in more detail without incurring disproportionate cost.

Residual life is currently considered to be between 25 years and 1,000 years for different sections. There are secondary defences in place for the defences of lower standard which provide a minimum of 40 to 60 years residual life.

Although this is lower than some of the southern European member states who have a much longer tradition of using geographical indications and, arguably, a structure and culture of production more attuned to their protection, it does compare well with quite a number of other member states.

 The UK, together with other EU and G8 countries, has been working on solutions to the problems of illegal logging and the associated trade in illegally harvested timber for several years. This work, much of it supported by funding from the Department for International Development (DFID), has sought to understand the severity and scale of the problem, and also the consequences of possible solutions in order to inform policy development.

<a name="stpa_27">It is difficult to make exact measurements of the scale of illegal logging and estimates must be based on indirect data. The Government have therefore contributed to an international study on discrepancies in trade statistics, co-ordinated by the International Tropical Timber Organisation, as well as specific studies of the scale of illegal logging in Indonesia and NW Russia. These studies combined trade data with techniques such as remote sensing, and have also looked at the consequences of illegal logging for the economies of the countries concerned.

<p>
<a name="51025w03.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_28">The Government have also led on research to evaluate potential solutions. These studies have looked at the compliance with WTO rules of possible trade measures, the applicability of anti-money laundering legislation, and the role of improved due diligence by the financial community in evaluating forest sector investments. Studies of the impacts on markets of measures currently being implemented to tackle the problem, for example the UK&#039;s public timber procurement policy, are currently under way&#151;and these indicate that our policies are effective, not only in changing the market here, but also in improving enforcement in timber producing countries.

<a name="stpa_45">The Government take the issue of child welfare and safety very seriously. We believe we need to make safeguarding everyone&#039;s business. Encouraging all organisations to have good systems and clear guidance in place forms a vital part of this. Local and national guidance for safeguarding and promoting welfare of children is based upon the provisions set out in the Children Act 1989 and the Children Act 2004. We are currently consulting on the Government&#039;s main guidance &#039;Working Together to Safeguard Children&quot; which sets out the overarching systems and roles that different agencies play in keeping children safe.

<a name="stpa_48">The 2004/05 PE and School Sport Survey of schools in School Sport Partnerships found that cricket was the second most popular sport (behind football) for which schools had formal links with sports clubs, with 46 per cent. of schools having links with a local cricket club. The survey also found that 85 per cent. of schools provided cricket for their pupils, either in lesson time or after school. This was the sixth most popular sport provided in schools. Copies of the results of the survey have been placed in the House Libraries.

 Delaying to 2025 the introduction of a normal pension age (NPA) of 65 for members of the Teachers&#039; Pensions Scheme would not reflect Government policy or be consistent with the principles agreed at the Public Services Forum. Those principles provide for NPA 65 to be introduced for new entrants as soon as practicable; and the pension terms of existing members to be discussed in scheme specific negotiations. The estimated net present value of the savings arising from reform of the public service schemes is expected to be around &#163;13 billion over the next 50 years.

<a name="stpa_55">Savings to the Exchequer from introducing NPA 65 from 2025 have not been estimated and could be done only at disproportionate cost.

<sup>(22)</sup> Case load excludes suspended cases. Case load estimates on this basis are not available prior to 2002&#150;03.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The average weekly amount is rounded to the nearest ten pence.<br>

2. The case load estimates and average weekly amounts are financial year averages and derived from quarterly statistical data extracts. Figures for the years 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 are estimated due to lack of suitable information.<br>

3. The case load estimates exclude cases where an allowance is not paid despite entitlement due to the overlapping benefit rules.<br>

4. The expenditure figures until 2003&#150;04 are out-turn while the figure for 2004&#150;05 is estimated out-turn. The expenditure figures are based on data from the departmental accounting systems.<br>

5. The case load and average weekly amounts, when grossed up to annual totals do not precisely match the expenditure. This is because the statistical data have only five &quot;snapshots&quot; which are used to estimate annual averages. Furthermore, these snapshots fail to capture a number of new cases that are in process at any point time.<br>

6. The figures quoted are marginally different to those previously published due to methodological changes and some minor adjustments.<br>

<sup>(23)</sup> The new scheme has been in operation since March 2003, so data prior to this date is purely old scheme information and therefore overall Agency compliance by virtue of being the sole source of data.<br>

<sup>(24)</sup> New scheme data, and that for old scheme on the new IT system, for the period March 2003 to March 2004 is not robust therefore it has been excluded. It is hoped that this will be available in the near future.<br>

1. Case compliance is measured on a rolling-last-quarter basis for both schemes as this best demonstrates performance.<br>

2. Cash compliance is measured on a three-month rolling average basis as this best demonstrates performance.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup> Figures for 2004 are for the calendar year (January to December), and those for 2005 are for the period from January 2005 to August 2005.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The figures are taken from the Management Information System (MIS) computer system and are rounded to the nearest 5.<br>

2. The figures are for new claims allowed or disallowed and do not reflect any changes to the outcome of those claims resulting from any subsequent supersession, revision or appeal.<br>

3. &quot;Supersessions&quot; normally occur where there has been a change of circumstances since the date the award was made and a different decision is now appropriate.<br>

4. &quot;Revision&quot; refers to the change of an award because it is accepted that the award was incorrect.<br>

5. &quot;Reduced&quot; awards are those in which the rate of benefit payable is reduced, or the length of the award is reduced, or both on supersession, revision, appeal or following a renewal claim.<br>

6. &quot;Increased&quot; awards are those in which the rate of benefit payable is increased on supersession, revision, appeal or following a renewal claim.<br>

7. &quot;Varied&quot; awards are those in which either (a) entitlement to the care and mobility components of disability living allowance is changed on supersession, revision, appeal or following a renewal claim, but this does not result in any change to the amount of the allowance paid; or (b) entitlement is not changed on supersession, revision, appeal or following a renewal claim, but the period of the award is increased, or in the case of renewal claims, the award is for a longer period than the award made on a previous claim.<br>

8. &quot;Renewal claims&quot; are new claims to disability living allowance made by people receiving the benefit when their existing award is coming to an end. These claims enable them to renew their entitlement to the benefit and, if they remain entitled, help ensure there is no break in payment.<br>

9. Awards reduced, increased or varied by Appeal Tribunals include awards made on new claims, on supersession and on revision.<br>

These are reported to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). We do not know precisely how many companies have issued shares to UK employees in any year since 1997. This is because there are different reporting regimes for each type of tax-advantaged share scheme, plus taxed employment-related securities.

<a name="stpa_115">Published National Statistics show 6,427 companies were operating one or more tax-advantaged employee share or share option scheme in 2003&#150;04. Of which, at least 1,045 operated a scheme that was open to all-employees. Other data show that in 2003&#150;04 around 5,000 companies reported appropriations of employment-related securities subject to tax and national insurance. Many operate taxed and tax-advantaged arrangements simultaneously. For each tax-advantaged scheme, the following table contains either the total number of companies, or schemes operated by companies, where employees have been issued shares, or were granted or exercised share options:

Further details are in the Strategic Framework for Hydrogen Energy in the UK (http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/sepn/hydrogen&#95;framework&#95;full.pdf). My Department is currently developing a &#163;15 million demonstration programme for hydrogen and fuel cells and we are committed to establishing a Hydrogen Coordination Unit.

<a name="stpa_130">A &#163;312,000 grant has recently been offered to the PERA Group to support a &#163;596,000 project to develop a process for the production of hydrogen from biomass and wastes using supercritical water gasification.

<p>
<a name="51025w28.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_131">Prior to this, the DTI commissioned a study from Imperial College to assess the options for the production of transport fuels from renewable sources. This study included hydrogen production from biomass. The final report from this work is available on the DTI website (http://www.dti.gov.uk) URN 03/982.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much has been spent <i>(a)</i> within the EU and <i>(b)</i> within the UK on (i) nuclear fusion and fission research and (ii) renewable energy research in each year from 1980 to date.  [17182]</p>

 It has not been possible to collate all public expenditure and other Government support since 1980 for energy technologies in the time available at proportionate cost. However it is possible to detail direct DTI and Research Council expenditure on new and renewables, clean fossil fuels and nuclear for the years 1990 onwards. These are set out in the following tables.

Note: Several indirect measures of state support for CHP were introduced in 2001&#150;02. Of those that can be enumerated, climate change levy exemption on fuel inputs to Good Quality CHP and good quality CHP electricity outputs were valued at up to &#163;80 million per annum, while eligibility for Enhanced Capital Allowances is worth in the region of &#163;10 million per annum to the industry. Capital grants for Community Energy programme schemes were introduced in 2002&#150;03 and the spend on schemes including CHP was: &#163;427,000 in 2002&#150;03, &#163;4,315,000 in 2003&#150;04 and &#163;4,896,000 in 2004&#150;05.<br>

 The Government&#039;s main support mechanism for renewables is the Renewables Obligation (RO), which was introduced in April 2002. It is a market-based mechanism, designed primarily to support technologies that are close to the market and it will remain in place until 2027. Electricity supply companies are required to source an increasing percentage of their electricity sales from eligible renewable sources. The obligation for 2005&#150;06 is 5.5 per cent. rising to 15.4 per cent. by 2015. The Government have also allocated around &#163;500 million of support for research, development and demonstration into renewable technologies between 2002&#150;08.

 The UK has among the very best wind resources in Europe. Our view is that wind, both onshore and offshore, could easily contribute more that 10 per cent. of our electricity needs. Work undertaken by NGC indicates that 10 per cent. wind could be accommodated on the UK&#039;s transmission system with little additional cost or difficulty. Beyond that, NGC&#039;s work also indicates that 20 per cent. wind could be manageable. A view that is reinforced by experience in Denmark where wind already contributes more than 20 per cent. of electricity generation.

 Countries will qualify for debt stock cancellation by reaching Completion Point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC). By definition, Completion Point HIPCs have demonstrated a sustained commitment to poverty reduction and sound macroeconomic management that provides confidence that the savings from debt relief will be used for poverty reduction. Good governance is part of this,

<a name="stpa_153">Countries that have already completed the HIPC Initiative must demonstrate that they have maintained their commitment to poverty reduction and good macro-economic management in order to qualify for relief. They must therefore have remained current with their repayment obligations to the International Financial Institutions, and not have experienced serious lapses, including in governance, such that their IMF programmes would be at risk.

<a name="stpa_154">In addition, extra donor resources will be provided to the World Bank and African Development Bank to fully compensate for the costs of the debt stock cancellation. These resources will be allocated to all poor countries through the Institutions&#039; existing Performance Based Allocation System, thereby providing a strong incentive for good policy (including governance) and performance. World Bank and IMF staff will also continue to monitor and report on the overall efficiency of public expenditure as well as on progress in reducing corruption and enhancing transparency in recipient countries.

 The total cost of maintaining, renovating, and running Admiralty House in 2002&#150;03, 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 was &#163;345,929, &#163;216,487 and &#163;246,284.

<p>
<a name="51025w34.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_186">The operation of Admiralty House is covered by a single facilities management contract which covers maintenance, renovation, security and running costs. It is not possible, within the overall total, to separately identify the costs that arise from the three flats in Admiralty House, although for internal accounting purposes the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister meets 20.7 per cent. of the costs of the operation of the entire building. This is calculated on the basis of the floor area of the flat occupied by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, as a proportion of the total floor area of Admiralty House. The actual amounts paid by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister in each year reflect that the Office was established in May 2002, and thus did not pay costs for the whole of 2002&#150;03, and benefited from an internal accounting adjustment that reduced ODPM&#039;s contribution in 2003&#150;04. In addition there were minor works specific to the flat occupied by my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister, amounting to &#163;1,087 in 2004&#150;05 and &#163;159 to date in 2005&#150;06.

 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will meet the Hampshire fire and rescue authority to discuss the proposal for a South East regional fire control centre.  [18574]</p>




<p><a name="st_256"><a name="51025w35.html_spnew0"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 I have now announced the locations of the eight new English regional fire control centres outside London, including the one in the South East. On 16 August I made a very interesting visit to Hampshire fire and rescue authority, within whose boundaries the South East regional fire control centre will lie. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister recognises the importance of elected members as key partners in delivering this project, and will be holding a series of meetings for elected Members for every region from November 2005 into early 2006 to deal with any issues they may wish to raise. Dates for these will be published shortly.
