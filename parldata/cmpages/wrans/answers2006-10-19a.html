number of environmental benefits, with the precise benefits depending
on a range of factors, including the energy used to fertilise and
process the crop. The Government will be introducing a renewable
transport fuel obligation in April 2008 which will require all
transport fuel suppliers to ensure that a set percentage of their total
fuel sales is made up of biofuels or some other renewable transport
fuel. This will create a major new market for biofuels in the UK, and
it will be up to individual transport fuel suppliers to source their
biofuels from whatever feedstock they deem most appropriate. From the
outset the RTFO will include environmental assurance schemes to monitor
the carbon savings achieved and the impact on the wider

McNulty:</b> In 2002 the Home Office, in partnership with the
Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO), introduced the National
Crime Recording Standard (NCRS), designed to improve the quality of
crime recording in all forces. NCRS was developed following extensive
research undertaken by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO),
and Her Majesty&#146; Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC), as well as
research commissioned by the Home Office, which demonstrated wide
ranging inconsistencies in the way that forces were managing crime
reports taken from the public. NCRS is based on a number of key
principles including the requirement for forces to create incident
reports for all incidents and to record these incidents as crimes if,
on the balance of probabilities, the circumstances of the incident
amount to a crime and if there is no credible evidence to the contrary.
NCRS was designed to secure a better quality of service for the victims
of crime, particularly around reporting, and has delivered significant
improvements.</p><p><a name="06101950000321">The
Home Office, through the Police and Crime Standards Directorate, has
provided a strong lead in ensuring that forces are complying with NCRS.
A three year programme of annual external audit has been undertaken in
partnership with the Audit Commission across a wide range of crime
types, to ensure that forces are recording the crimes reported to them
accurately and consistently. In 2003 the independent audit found that
only 2 per cent. of forces were achieving a good or excellent level of
performance for data quality. Self improvement by forces, supported by
the Home Office, have resulted in an outstanding improvement in
performance. The Audit Commission&#146;s report Crime Recording 2005,
published in June 2006 found that 81 per cent. of forces are now rated
as either good or excellent, with no forces scoring poor. This
represents a significant step forward in ensuring that the quality of
reports taken from the public is robust and capable of supporting the
investigation of crime. The Home Office remains committed to
maintaining this high level of quality and fully intends to work with
forces to build upon the achievements to
date.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61019w0002.htm_wqn14"><a name="06101950000038">Miscarriages of

in Somalia, Kenya, Ethiopia and Eritrea acute malnutrition remains well
above levels that are regarded as sufficient to trigger humanitarian
interventions. We will continue to monitor these needs carefully and
respond where necessary.</p><br>

diamond company Lazare Kaplan). To complement this, we have invited
LUPP partners to submit a further proposal to DFID for our

and Spurn Point to fish for herring. The activities of these vessels
have been closely monitored by the Marine Fisheries Agency (MFA). A
French trawler was successfully prosecuted on 7 July in Grimsby for
fishing illegally inside the 12 mile limit and total fines and costs
amounted to &#163;14,750. Since this incident, no further evidence of
subsequent incursions within the 12 mile limit have been
found.</p><p><a name="06101950000476">The
MFA monitors fishing activity through a programme of inspections on
land and at sea, using the Royal Navy's Fishery Protection Squadron.
Aerial surveillance, combined with a satellite Vessel Monitoring
System, precisely records the position of all vessels over 15m in
length, including any French vessels. In recent weeks, approximately 80
per cent. of French vessels operating off the Yorkshire coast have been
inspected when their catches are being
landed.</p><p><a name="06101950000477">The
MFA will be hosting a meeting between members of the UK and French
fishing industries in London on 31 October. This will help to develop a
dialogue about practical ways of minimising interference with each
others' fishing operations, and reduce the risk of damage to fishing
gear.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61019w0004.htm_wqn12"><a name="06101950000057">Shellfish</h3><p><a name="06101950000478"><b><a name="61019w0004.htm_spnew499"><a name="06101950000661">Mr.

English crab stocks are currently assessed as being fished sustainably,
but there are growing concerns that they are at risk of being exploited
beyond sustainable limits if fishing effort continues to increase.
DEFRA will shortly be publishing a discussion paper on possibilities
for controlling effort on fishing for brown crabs. An increase in the
European Union minimum landing size for brown crabs is one of the
possible measures upon which the Department is inviting comments before
formulating more specific proposals.</p><br>

Hughes:</b> The Government's 10-year childcare strategy sets
out our commitments: to extend the free early education entitlement to
38 weeks a year across all settings; to increase the number of free
hours each week from 12.5 to 15; and to offer them more flexibly than
at present. Around &#163;3 billion per year is provided to local
authorities to fund the free
entitlement.</p><p><a name="06101962000144">The first
of those changes was implemented this year with flexibilities to help
those providers not able to extend their provision to 38 weeks.
Additional funding of &#163;82 million in each of financial years
2006-07 and 2007-08 has been made available to LAs to support the
extension to the free entitlement in private, voluntary and independent
settings.</p><p><a name="06101962000145">We are
testing the extension to 15 hours, delivered more flexibly, in 20 local
authorities next year, with a view to a full roll out by 2010. We will
conduct a full assessment of impact in the light of findings from the
Pathfinders.</p><p><a name="06101962000146">We expect
there to continue to be sufficient places available to deliver the free
early education entitlement to all three and four-year-olds. The
closure rate of child care places has fallen significantly since the
introduction of the 10-year strategy, indicating that the Government's
policy of refocusing local authority budgets towards supporting
sustainability, rather than creating new places, is working.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61019w0005.htm_wqn12"><a name="06101962000022">Student

it is a matter for the courts to determine what exactly is covered, but
obscene material in films or in newspapers is illegal, and could not
appear in a classified film, or in any publication. We have no
proposals to introduce a classification scheme for newspapers and
magazines; because of the extremely tight production deadlines
involved, it would quite simply not be possible to factor in the time
required for scrutiny. DCMS officials continue to monitor the situation

Andrews last week made clear, we want to see the support for policing
and the rule of law extend to every part of the community. This
includes endorsing fully the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the
criminal justice system, actively encouraging everyone in the community
to co-operate fully with the PSNI in tackling crime in all areas and
actively supporting all the policing and criminal justice institutions,
including the Policing Board. The political parties of Northern
Ireland&#151;including Sinn Fein&#151;have until 10 November 2006
to confirm their endorsement of the St. Andrews Agreement. Based on
intensive negotiations at St. Andrews, we believe that all parties
should be able to endorse it and to implement it in good faith,

that personal injury claims must be brought within three years from the
date of the cause of the action or the date of knowledge (if later) of
the person injured. This means that former detainees cannot bring
compensation claims now for injuries they may have received while they
were detained. In addition, prior to 1948, claims would have been
prevented from proceeding by virtue of Crown Immunity. In accordance
with MOD&#146;s policies for the selection of records for permanent

2007.</p><p><a name="06101962000497">The elections
are coming at a critical time for Bangladesh. It is essential that
these elections are seen to be free, fair, peaceful and accepted.
Recent election evaluation missions by the UN, EU and US have
consistently identified important points for the main political parties
to address to ensure elections reach the required standards. A fully
independent and competent Election Commission has a vital role to play
in compiling a complete and accurate voter list. Law enforcement
agencies will need to ensure that there is no manipulation of ballots.
The electorate should be able to exercise its democratic mandate in a
secure and peaceful way. Political parties should be allowed to
campaign freely and protest peacefully. The caretaker government
charged with overseeing the elections should ensure no political bias.
The election must enjoy the confidence of all international observers.
We will continue to take a close interest in preparations for
elections, but ultimately it is for the parties and the people of
Bangladesh to find solutions and make their elections a success. We
encourage the parties to continue talking with each other to this
end.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="61019w0009.htm_wqn8"><a name="06101962000080">BBC World

Hoon:</b> The media in Haiti is dominated by
private radio stations and while levels of state censorship are low,
there are problems such as violence against journalists and resulting
self-censorship. Press freedom was severely limited in Haiti during
former President Aristide's period in office, which ended in February
2004. While some improvements in the situation were reported in the
following months, the situation remained fragile under the interim
Government that led Haiti until this year's presidential elections.
There were a number of reports of violent attacks on journalists by
armed gangs, and of impunity for the perpetrators in that interim
period. An event of particular concern was the kidnap and murder of
journalist Jacques Roche in July 2005. Bringing those responsible for
attacks on press freedom to justice is essential and is one of the
motivations behind the UN Stabilisation Mission in Haiti's focus on the
reform of the police and judicial system. Encouragingly, the recently
elected President, Rene Preval, has also expressed his determination to
tackle this and other human rights problems in
Haiti.</p><br>

tax-free and is paid for a maximum of 52 weeks. It is payable on top of
any other in-work benefits which eligible parents may be entitled to,
for example working tax credit and housing benefit. The IWC is
primarily paid to lone parents but in April 2005, it was extended to
other eligible parents in four London Jobcentre Plus

have commissioned a full evaluation of the IWC to assess the impact of
the pilot on eligible parents, including movements off benefit and into
work. Initial findings from the quantitative evaluation are expected to
be published in February 2007. In addition, a qualitative evaluation
has explored the impact of the pilots on the attitudes, motivations and
actions of participants, and will also examine the effectiveness of
delivery. We expect to publish this report in spring

Median weekly household incomes are shown as equivalised pounds in
2004-05 prices. Equivalisation is the process by which household income
is adjusted by household size and composition as a proxy for material
living standards.<br>2. The median has
been used as the measure of the average income in the three lowest
deciles in line with HBAI conventions. This median measure is preferred
to the mean because it measures the central income of the group and for
the lowest decile it is less influenced by possibly unrepresentative
outliers.<br>3. All estimates are subject
to sampling error and response bias and small changes between years may
be influenced by these. While results for individual years may be
sensitive to the way in which household incomes are adjusted for size
and composition, the picture of changes over time is less sensitive to

in the New NHS&#146;, published in July 2003, advocated the
strengthening of communication about patients&#146; medicines between
hospitals, community pharmacists and general practitioners. The
national health service national prescribing centre (NPC), as part of
the sharing of best practice through the medicines management
collaborative, has developed guidance concerning the timely and
accurate sharing of information about patients&#146; medicines when
patients are transferred between care settings. The guidance is
available on the NPC website
at:www.npc.co.uk/mms/FiveMinGuides/index.htm. The methods by which
information is transferred is a matter for local decision. Trust chief
pharmacists, primary care trusts, general practitioners and community
pharmacists should work closely together in developing systems which
best suit the needs of their local health

is not possible to say how many women have been screened using LBC
techniques in each strategic health authority. Statistics on the
programme are collected annually, and those programmes who converted to
LBC would have done so at different times during the years of roll out.
As 72 per cent. of local screening programmes will have implemented LBC
by 31 March 2007, we would expect nearly three million women to benefit
from their cervical screening samples being processed with LBC
techniques in
2007-08.</p><p><a name="0610209000765">LBC techniques
began being introduced into the programme following a National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) technology
appraisal published in October 2003. NICE is currently considering
whether to review the appraisal based on any new evidence, which would
include evidence from the national roll-out. Strict quality assurance
and data collection are operated within the programme, and we would
expect to start seeing an effect of LBC on the rate of inadequate
samples when the statistics for 2005-06 are published in December
2006.</p><p><a name="0610209000766">Women are only
offered human papilloma virus (HPV) testing in the NHS as part of
clinical trials. As part of the pilot of LBC, which took place between
2001 and 2002, we also piloted the use of HPV testing as triage for
women with mild or borderline test results. Following the receipt of
the independent evaluation report of the HPV arm of the pilot in 2004,
the advisory committee on cervical screening set up a dedicated working
group to advise on how best to introduce HPV testing into the NHS
cervical screening programme. A protocol for HPV testing sentinel sites
has been developed, and the sites are expected to begin operations in
2007.</p><p><a name="0610209000767">There is
currently insufficient evidence to support the use of HPV testing as a
primary screening tool. In addition to the pilot, the government is
funding two large studies looking into HPV testing as a primary
screening
tool:</p><a name="61019w0016.htmbrev_353"><a name="0610209001285"><ul><p class="tabletext">trial

having heard this issue anecdotally from both health professionals and
young women, that some young pregnant women may take the message that
smoking leads to low birth weight babies and that low birth weight or
smaller babies may make childbirth less painful. It is important that
we understand what stops young women making healthy choices and tailor
our messages accordingly. In this case childbirth is no less painful if
your baby is low weight.</p><p><a name="0610209001153">The Department&#146;s advice
remains that women should not smoke during pregnancy. Women who smoke
are less likely to carry their babies to full term and there is a 26
per cent. increased risk that they will miscarry or experience a
stillbirth. Babies of smoking mothers are an average 200 g lighter at
birth.</p>
