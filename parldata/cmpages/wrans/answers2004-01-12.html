<a name="40112w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Department for Constitutional Affairs' expenditure in the 2002&#150;03 financial year for asylum and immigration was &#163;277 million. This covers the costs incurred by the Immigration Appellate Authority and the Courts and, legal aid administered by the Legal Services Commission. Of this we estimate approximately &#163;244 million was attributable to asylum and the remainder to non-asylum immigration work.

 Section 178(b) of the Licensing Act 1964 makes it an offence for the holder of a justices' licence to supply any liquor or refreshment, whether by way of gift or sale, to any constable on duty except by authority of a superior officer of the constable. Schedule 7 to the Licensing Act 2003, which received Royal Assent on 10 July 2003, will repeal the Licensing Act 1964 in its entirety, when it comes into force. Therefore, this provision of the 1964 Act will be repealed when the 2003 Act is fully in force.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 In November 2003, VisitBritain published its domestic marketing strategy. This is a three-year initiative designed to grow the value of the domestic market by encouraging the British to spend more on tourism throughout the English regions throughout the year. On 1 January 2004, VisitBritain launched its Enjoy England Spring Campaign which consists of a high profile television and press campaign and offers a holiday planner so that people can plan their domestic trips for the year. This will be followed up by a number of themed campaigns throughout the year and another major campaign in September. Information on the Enjoy England Spring Campaign can be found on the website: www.visitengland.com.

 Legally and financially, cathedrals are independent bodies governed by the Cathedrals Measure passed by Parliament in 1999. The Commissioners have a very limited statutory role in relation to cathedrals and have no authority to compel Bradford Cathedral to reach a settlement, nor do they have power to provide funds to enable such a settlement.
<P>

The proposal is intended to restrict the labelling of food with the term 'bio' to food which complies with the organic standards. The Explanatory Memoranda submitted on this proposal explain our view that the proposal to amend Article 2 is unnecessarily restrictive but note that it commands widespread support among other member states.

 There is little published information on this in the scientific literature, but what there is, suggests that avoidance of fishing gear by cod is largely a visual response. The escape characteristic of cod will vary between day and night, with avoidance being in either a vertical or a horizontal direction. Generally, fishing gears are rigged to reduce such escapements. In the case of bottom gears, for example, the warps tend

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of whether the pesticide regimes which may be approved for the cultivation of Chardon LL maize will be more aggressive than the regime adopted in the farm scale evaluation trials.  [146619]<P>

<P>
<a name="40112w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2004]:</i> Under Directive 2001/18/EC, the management practices associated with the cultivation of GM crops must be assessed for their environmental impact. Consequently, my Department will seek advice from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) as to whether the evidence provided by applicants about the specific management practices associated with a GM crop present an increased likelihood of adversely affecting the environment as compared to conventional practices associated with the cultivation of its non-GM counterpart. It would also be within the scope of Directive 2001/18/EC to include conditions to the consent that circumscribed the herbicide regime permitted, if this was felt to be appropriate. The farm scale evaluations provide important data with respect to current management practices, which will be invaluable in making this assessment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under Directive 2001/18/EC each application to release GM crops for commercial importation or cultivation is judged on a case-by-case basis according to the scientific evidence of any risks it may pose to human health or the environment. A person or company wishing to market such a GM crop must supply a detailed dossier of information including an environmental risk assessment on that GM crop. This information is open to scrutiny by all 15 member states and the European Commission, and an EU-wide public consultation must be held. In considering any application, the Government will consider all relevant evidence including results of its own investigations, for example including the Farm Scale Evaluations. No GM crop may be imported or grown commercially unless and until EU member states have agreed collectively under qualified majority procedures that it is safe. Once a GMO has the suitable consent, it can be imported and, if the consent conditions permit, cultivated within the EU, subject to other applicable legislation on seeds, pesticides and novel food and (animal) feed. No GM crop currently has all the required approvals for UK cultivation.

 The Environment Agency works closely with local authorities, water companies and other groups to ensure that the effects of flooding are, as far as possible, minimised. Proper maintenance and siting of sewers and septic tanks, and monitoring of groundwater levels, can help reduce the risks, though during a flood event itself there is little that can practically be done apart from ensuring that any sewage pumping does not contribute to contamination, that the situation is properly monitored, and that those affected are informed of the situation and risks. The Department has been working with the Environment Agency and others to produce a groundwater protection code of practice

 The Department does not currently fund any research into assessment of the possible environmental impacts resulting from the release of specifically nanotechnology-based products into the environment. Most regulation to protect the environment is based on product or use categories and would therefore cover such a release, whether or not based on nanotechnology.
<P>

<a name="40112w03.html_para4">However, in order to find out whether the technology raises new ethical, health and safety, environmental or social issues that have not already been covered by current regulations, last year the Department of Trade and Industry commissioned the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering to conduct an independent study to look at current and future developments in nanotechnology. We will examine carefully the conclusions of this study, expected in spring this year, to see whether there are any gaps that will need to be filled.

[147236]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Precautionary action must be based on objective assessments of the costs and benefits of action. The precautionary principle does not mean that we only permit activities if we are sure that serious harm will not arise, or there is proof that the benefits outweigh all possible risks. Most regulation to protect the environment is based on product or use categories and would therefore cover such a release, whether or not based on nanotechnology processes. We therefore do not consider that there is currently a case for a blanket moratorium on such releases, but we are keeping this under review, in particular via the independent study being carried out for the Department of Trade and Industry by the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering.

 Ultimately it will be for the courts to define what constitutes a reasonable excuse for the purpose of the offence set out in clause 2 of the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of claimants etc) Bill. However, the offence explicitly rules out certain defences which are not to be considered as reasonable causes for no longer being in possession of a document. The defence does not include reference to other legislation.

 The dyslexia, dyspraxia and attention disorder treatment (DDAT) is one of a number of commercially available programmes designed to support children with specific learning difficulties. It is for parents, individual schools and local education authorities to decide whether a given technique has something to offer an individual child in the light of his or her particular needs. The Department has no plans to extend the programme to other schools but officials are meeting with representatives of the Dore achievement centres/DDAT to receive an update.

 No decisions have yet been made about the level of the fees. The Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) is required to provide a range of fees for indicative purposes only. The upper limit of that range, &#163;500, does not signify that the Government intends, as some newspapers suggested, to set fees at that level.
<P>

<a name="40112w04.html_para2">The enabling power is the first stage of a two-stage process. The second part of the process is to undertake a full Regulatory Impact Assessment and wider consultation with key stakeholders. Following this consultation, decisions regarding fee levels, scope and timing of introduction can then be made taking these views fully into account.
<P>

<a name="40112w04.html_para3">Any foreign language student, full or part-time, who currently pays a fee would be required to pay charges at whatever level they may be set.

 The Government is committed to helping provide parents with more opportunities than ever before to balance work and family life. In April 2003, we introduced new laws for working parents which cover fathers as well as mothers, including the right for parents of children aged under six or disabled children under 18 to request flexible working, adoption leave available to men and women, and the right to two weeks paid paternity leave for fathers. These new rights together with the existing rights to parental leave and time off for dependents recognise that men increasingly want to play a greater role in sharing caring responsibilities for their children, and gives them more choices for doing so.
<P>

<a name="40112w05.html_para2">To encourage take-up of the new rights, the Government is running an ongoing awareness raising campaign which includes national newspaper adverts

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions he has had since 17 September 2003 with representatives of the United States Administration on the impact of US subsidies to domestic cotton producers on cotton producers in West Africa.  [146587]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w08.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 EU and US cotton subsidies are among the clearest examples of trade distortion by OECD countries. Failure to address them satisfactorily was a key issue behind the collapse of WTO talks at Cancun. Four West African countries (with support from European donors including the UK) presented an initiative at the WTO calling for the end to developed country subsidies, and compensatory support to developing country cotton producers who are negatively affected by them in the meantime. US subsidies are the largest, but recent research supported by my Department and the EU Directorate General for Development shows EU subsidies also affect West Africa because of market structures.
<P>

<a name="40112w08.html_para0">Reform of the EU's own support to its cotton sector is currently being discussed in Brussels. While these discussions continue, DFID has not had direct contacts with the US administration on the issue. The UK is pressing for more significant reform of the EU cotton regime than is currently proposed, both as an end in itself and also to help push the US to address their subsidies.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent discussions the British Government have had with the South African Government regarding proposals for land reform in South Africa; and what advice his Government have given President Mbeki and his Government on this matter.  [146841]<P>

<P>
<a name="40112w08.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The Department for International Development and the High Commission in Pretoria are in regular touch with South Africa's Department for Land Affairs. Land reform is a vital element in the transformation of South Africa after the apartheid era, and potentially offers important economic opportunities for poor people. We welcome the Government of South Africa's commitment to a transparent, accountable and legal process of land reform&#151;through restitution to previous owners of land acquired under pre-1994 legislation, through supporting purchase of agricultural land by previously disadvantaged groups, and through reform of communal land tenure arrangements in the former homelands. To support the Government of South Africa in increasing the pace of land reform, DFID committed &#163;2 million in 2002 to provide technical support to the Department of Land Affairs, and to support a public consultation process on the Communal Land Rights Bill.

<P>
<a name="40112w08.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Poverty reduction and sustainable development are closely inter-linked since development will only be sustainable if it tackles problems of global poverty alongside pressures on the environment. DFID policies and programmes therefore support sustainable economic and social development at both global and country levels. Resources provided as a result of the forthcoming Spending Review will enable us to continue these efforts. We will be developing plans for the next Spending Review period over the coming months.

<P>
<a name="40112w09.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The WTO negotiations on non-agricultural market access have yet to reach agreement with several countries having submitted proposals. Although this makes assessment of the implications for developed and developing countries difficult, most studies concur that reductions in tariffs could bring significant benefits. A recent UNCTAD <sup>1</sup>  study estimated that a reduction in barriers to non-agricultural goods will lead to an increase in global welfare of between $20 billion and $40 billion. A substantial majority of these gains are expected to go to developing countries, with welfare in developed countries remaining virtually unchanged.

<a name="40112w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We believe that the OSCE could have a useful role to play in support of a political process in Chechnya. We regret that since the closure of the OSCE Assistance Group to Chechnya at the end of 2002, it has been impossible for the OSCE Chairmanship in Office to agree with the Russian Federation on specific OSCE projects for Chechnya, with or without an OSCE presence on the ground in the region. If President Kadyrov showed clearly that he was prepared to work for reconciliation, to promote a genuinely open political process and to uphold human rights, the OSCE would be ready to assist, though any activities would have to take full account of the security situation in the region.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he <i>(a)</i> has made and <i>(b)</i> intends to make to the Russian authorities to persuade them (i) to cease compelling displaced Chechens to return to the war zone, (ii) to allow humanitarian organisations access to camps containing displaced Chechens, (iii) to avoid closing such camps without providing alternative accommodation and (iv) to issue invitations to UN specialist agencies to visit Chechnya.  [146687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We have bilaterally and with the EU repeatedly reminded the Russian Government of their obligations under the 1951 UN Convention on Refugees, stressing that all movements of internally displaced persons (IDPs) must be strictly voluntary. We have also stated that the dismantling of shelters, or the suspension of food, water and energy supplies, in our view constitutes a forced return.
<P>

<a name="40112w09.html_para1">The EU most recently raised concerns over IDPs during the recent Chechen Presidential elections. The EU, with UK support, issued a statement raising concerns over the conduct of the elections. The statement asked the Russian Government to provide assurances that the return of IDPs in Ingushetia and throughout the North Caucasus would be strictly voluntary. After the elections had taken place the EU issued a further statement, which the UK also supported. That statement expressed concern over the condition of refugees in neighbouring Ingushetia, repeating the EU's rejection of any attempts of involuntary return of refugees to Chechnya. It also called on the Russian authorities to renew their efforts to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has made to the Russian authorities in respect of <i>(a)</i> the mass bombardment of civilians in Chechnya, <i>(b)</i> the desirability of negotiations to bring the conflict to an end and <i>(c)</i> the applicability of internationally accepted standards of conduct to this conflict.  [146709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 We regularly raise with the Russian Government UK concerns about the situation in Chechnya, in particular human rights. We have stressed that there is a need for an open political process, and that Russian security operations in Chechnya must uphold the rule of law and respect human rights. We most recently did so following the Chechen Presidential elections, when I issued a press statement on 16 October 2003 calling for newly elected President Kadyrov to

A copy of the press statement is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth website: www.fco.gov.uk/policy/news/press-releases.

<a name="40112w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Russian Federation is not a State Party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (ICC) and Chechnya is currently therefore outside its jurisdiction. The UK has not called for an international tribunal on Chechnya as we believe such a move would be counter-productive. We continue to press Russia on the situation in Chechnya both bilaterally and multilaterally through the EU. UN and Council of Europe.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 In 2003, average unemployment in the 10 accession countries was 10.2 per cent., caused largely by the restructuring required for EU accession. It is expected that this figure will fall as the adjustments become embedded. Unemployment in the EU15 in 2003 remained unchanged at 8.0 per cent. The average GDP per capita in the 10 accession countries in 2002 (latest figures) was US$7,105, compared to US$24,689 in the EU15. While this demonstrates the current disparity between existing and new member states, the real GDP growth in accession countries over the last five years has been 18.9 per cent. (4.1 per cent. in 2003), compared with 10.1 per cent. in the EU15 (0.8 per cent. in 2003).
<P>

<a name="40112w09.html_para3">Combined with the political and economic reforms enacted for EU membership, this sustained growth should facilitate a gradual reduction in the current disparity, as has been the case in previous waves of enlargement. (All figures are from the IMF).

 We have made it clear that it is for the Iraqi people to decide how to bring to justice those responsible for crimes committed by the former regime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Government scrutinises all export licence applications and closely monitors the sale of weapons overseas from the UK. All UK exports are assessed against the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria on a case by case basis. In line with our obligations under United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 661 (6 August 1990) and its amendments, the UK did not sell or supply any weapons to Iraq prior to the onset of the conflict in 2003. Since the conflict ended the UK has rigorously enforced UNSCR 1483 (22 May 2003) which maintains the prohibition on the sale of all arms and related material, other than those required by the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to serve the purposes of UNSCR 1483 and other related resolutions.
<P>

<a name="40112w10.html_para1">Since the introduction of UNSCR 1483 the Government have approved export licences for the sale and supply of weapons to the CPA and for the protection of CPA personnel and personnel contracted to assist with the reconstruction of Iraq. I made clear in a Written Statement to the House on 14 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 7WS, that we have licensed sub-machine guns and pistols for this purpose.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the implications for the UK's responsibilities as <i>(a)</i> a permanent member of the UN Security Council and <i>(b)</i> a high contracting party to the Fourth Geneva Convention of the International Court of Justice's decision to open hearings into the legal consequences of the construction of the wall in the occupied Palestinian Territory.

 The International Court of Justice has been requested by the UN General Assembly (Resolution A/RES/ES-10/14) to give an Advisory Opinion on the legal consequences arising from the construction of the wall being built by Israel in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.
<P>

<a name="40112w10.html_para4">The International Court of Justice's decision to hold hearings on this issue has no direct implications for the UK's responsibilities as a High Contracting Party to the Fourth Geneva Convention or as a permanent member of the UN Security Council.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the amount of Palestinian land planned for appropriation by Israel under the map released by the Israeli Government on 23 October 2003 to construct the Separation Wall and <i>(b)</i> the amount of land that will be made inaccessible to its owners by the wall.

<P>
<a name="40112w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 According to the UN Secretary General's report of 24 November 2003, the Israeli Defence Force's map of 23 October predicts that 975 square km of land will lie between the Green Line and the fence, and 73 square km will take the form of closed areas.

<a name="40112w10.html_para5">While recognising Israel's legitimate security concerns, the UK considers the route of the fence Israel is building in the Occupied Palestinian Territories to be unlawful.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 As a non-signatory of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), Israel would not be in breach of any obligation under international law in the possession or deployment of nuclear weapons. However, the UK firmly believes that possession or 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jan 2004 : Column 530W</I><P>
deployment would be extremely destabilising for the region. We have consistently urged Israel to clarify its nuclear status by acceding to the NPT as a non-nuclear weapons state, and signing a full-scope safeguards agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Under the agreement with IAEA, Israel's nuclear facilities would be subject to regular inspection to detect and eliminate any diversion of nuclear materials for weapons production. The UK has consistently supported UN Resolutions calling for the establishment of a Middle East zone free of weapons of mass destruction. That zone would include Israel.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will list occasions on which his Department has conducted an inquiry into alleged leaks from members of staff since 1997; and if he will list the occasions on which the names of those persons accused of leaking information from his Department have been made public <i>(a)</i> by the Government and <i>(b)</i> by way of another source.

 Since 1997 the Foreign and Commonwealth Office has investigated 20 suspected leaks. In line with exemptions l(a) and 7(b) of Part 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, it has been the practice of successive governments not to comment on the outcome of such inquiries in order to safeguard security and investigative arrangements.

 The Government believe that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) has been pursuing two separate programmes for the production of fissile material, through the enrichment of uranium and the processing of plutonium. DPRK also has long-range missiles in service, and we believe it has the capacity to develop missiles capable of reaching the UK. We will continue to urge the Government of DPRK, bilaterally and in co-operation with international partners, to remove the threat thus posed to the international community by dismantling its nuclear programmes verifiably and irreversibly, and by continuing the moratorium on the flight-testing of long range missiles.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has to introduce a system to enable equipment and stocks to be tracked throughout the armed forces supply train.  [141811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Since April 2002, the Defence Logistics Organisation, has taken a number of steps to improve both the ability to track assignments and to measure the performance of our resupply systems.
<P>

<a name="40112w12.html_para3">In December 2002, the purchase of elements of the "Total Asset Visibility" system currently in service in the United States Department of Defense was approved, in order to enable interoperability with US forces. The system is known as "Total Asset Visibility (Minus)" (TAV (Minus)), and is a radio frequency identity system that enables remote and automated scanning of electronically tagged containers, pallets, and other consignments. It is linked to existing United Kingdom information systems.
<P>

<a name="40112w12.html_para4">The contract for TAV (Minus) was let on 23 January 2003, and installation work began four days later. The first phase of this work was divided into two parts. The first elements of Phase 1 to support early sustainment activity were completed by 15 February. The remaining elements of Phase 1, to give more comprehensive detail of strategic Supply Chain activity into Theatre, were completed by 31 March. Phase 2 of the system, to support redeployment and recovery, was installed from the end of decisive operations on 1 May, and was completed by the end of July. TAV (Minus) technology has since been integrated with information systems used by the Royal Navy. TAV (Minus) has genuinely enhanced our consignment tracking capability and offers an opportunity for further exploitation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Outward secondments to industry are subject to a formal application and selection process within MOD. Where an applicant is successful, a formal secondment agreement setting out the terms and conditions of the secondment is drawn up between MOD and the organisation concerned, covering aspects such as the duties to be undertaken, conduct, discipline, performance and development issues. Monitoring of performance and progress during the secondment is then undertaken by the relevant MOD interchange unit on a case by case basis as best fits the particular circumstances.
<P>

<a name="40112w12.html_para5">Appointments to other governments and departments are treated as public sector employment and are therefore subject to normal career posting arrangements. They are arranged by the appropriate local HR managers, and are not included as part of the central interchange programme. Although such appointments are not centrally monitored or covered by a formal secondment contract the other arrangements are broadly similar.
<P>

<a name="40112w12.html_para6">All MOD interchange activity is conducted in accordance with Cabinet Office guidelines which can be found at www.interchange.gov.uk.

<P>

<a name="40112w12.html_para7">The Galileo Global Navigation Satellite System is a civil programme that falls under the European Union's Directorate-General for Energy and Transport. Negotiations on the project are continuing with European Union partners, the European Commission and the United States, including its interoperability with the US Global Positioning System. During these negotiations the Government have been in regular contact with organisations and individuals representing the companies involved in the development of satellite navigation systems and applications. The UK is committed to the commercial success of Galileo as a civil system that has the potential to offer many opportunities for new transport and other applications.

<a name="40112w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Redress for Iraqi civilians who have allegedly been killed or injured by United Kingdom forces is covered by Section 6 of the Coalition Provisional Authority Order Number 17. This requires cases to be dealt with by the parent state of the person whose activities are alleged to have caused the loss, in accordance with the national laws of that parent state.

 Many of Northern Ireland's hospitals have come under considerable pressure in recent days, with large numbers of patients having to wait on trolleys for admission. In preparation for the pressure of winter, a significant range of additional services were put in place, including extra medical beds and enhanced facilities in primary care and community care services, which help to minimise the number of potential hospital admissions. An additional &#163;7 million was allocated to support this extra service provision. Work is also well under way to increase overall hospital capacity and, over the past year, the number of available hospital beds has increased by over 70. A further 30 beds will be coming on stream later this year. To complement this expansion, an additional &#163;6 million is being spent in the current year on providing extra community care services.

<P>
<a name="40112w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Following the scheme's entry into the Government's Targeted Programme of Improvements in March 2001, a contract to design and build a new 5 km dual carriageway to bypass the communities between Parton and Lillyhall was awarded by the Highways Agency in December 2002. The Agency is currently developing the scheme in sufficient detail to enable the publication of draft orders under the 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jan 2004 : Column 545W</I><P>
Highways Act, later this year. The public and other interested parties will have an opportunity to comment on the draft proposals and, if necessary, a public inquiry will be held to hear representations. Subject to completion of the statutory processes and availability of funding, construction could start in 2006. The scheme is expected to cost around &#163;25 million and will bring much needed relief to the local communities.

<P>

<a name="40112w15.html_para0">International civil aviation is governed by the Chicago Convention. Under the Convention the International Civil Aviation Organisation is responsible for establishing minimum safety standards. Contracting States are required to recognise the certificates of other Contracting States unless they have reason to believe that they have not been issued in accordance with ICAO standards. ICAO also audits Contracting States' aviation authorities to help identify and address any deficiencies in the implementation of international standards.
<P>

<a name="40112w15.html_para1">Any airline from outside the EU or EEA which wishes to pick up or put down passengers or cargo in the UK requires a permit from the Secretary of State. It is a condition of the permit that the airline should be operated in accordance with international safety standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.
<P>

<a name="40112w15.html_para2">Permits may be refused, suspended or revoked if the Secretary of State considers it appropriate to do so, taking into account any relevant information available to him, including the outcome of inspections of aircraft carried out by the Civil Aviation Authority at the request of the Department. We have now placed on the Department's web site information about UK permit action as set out in my answer of 8 January, which includes the reasons for and duration of such action. This information will be updated as appropriate.

<P>

<a name="40112w15.html_para3">We are not able to publish similar information with respect to permit action by other countries. Our inspections of foreign airlines are carried out in accordance with a procedure established under the European Civil Aviation Conference's Safety Assessment of Foreign Aircraft Programme, soon to be enshrined in European Community law. The results of inspections are entered on a central database and may be accessed by all ECAC States on the strict understanding that their use will be restricted to State organisations. The database includes information on some permit action by Member States, but what constitutes permit action varies from State to State. Some States include short restrictions on the use of an individual aircraft which may have been lifted before the report of the inspection reaches the database. The database cannot therefore be used to determine whether an airline currently has restrictions on its operations to an ECAC state. We are urgently considering with our ECAC colleagues how we can extend and refine the information on the database and whether it is possible for further information to be made public.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport for what reason the Pizza, Pasta and Italian Food Association was consulted by the Driving Standards Agency regarding proposed changes to Approved Driving Instructor qualifications; and if he will make a statement.  [146455]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Driving Standards Agency issued its consultation paper in April 2003 to a wide range of organisations including national and local approved driving instructor associations, other driver and rider training groups, road safety officers, motoring organisations and other interested parties.
<P>

<a name="40112w15.html_para4">Among the proposals, the paper invited comments on increasing the theory test fee for all learner drivers and riders. This was considered of particular interest to, for example, organisations representing trainers and employers of motorcycle and moped riders. The paper was therefore sent to the Motorcycle Retail and Rider Training Associations and to the Despatch Association. A copy was also sent to the Pizza, Pasta and Italian Food Association whose members employ large numbers of moped riders for home delivery services, some of whom only hold provisional licences and could therefore be affected by the proposed fee increase.

<a name="40112w15.html_para5">Consulting representative organisations is a more effective way of reaching the individuals than trying to contact them individually and is in line with guidance in the Cabinet Office "Code of Practice on Written Consultation".

 The requirements in relation to application for a driving licence in the United Kingdom are the same for asylum seekers as for everyone else. In order to be able to drive here all individuals must have the relevant driving entitlement.

<P>

<a name="40112w15.html_para6">Drivers who are resident in the United Kingdom and who hold a valid european Community/European Economic Area (EC/EEA) licence are entitled to drive until the expiry of the licence or until the driver becomes subject to British renewal at the age of 70.
<P>

<a name="40112w15.html_para7">Those who hold a non-EC/EEA driving licence or an international driving permit issued in another country may drive in the United Kingdom for the first 12 months from the date they become resident. To ensure continuous driving entitlement, a United Kingdom driving licence must be obtained before this period elapses. Drivers who hold a licence from a country which has been designated for licence exchange purposes must exchange their driving licence for a United Kingdom one. In the case of a country which has no exchange agreement, drivers must obtain a United Kingdom provisional licence and pass both the theory and practical parts of the driving test before being granted a full driving licence.

<P>
<a name="40112w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Any traffic effects of the closure of individual post offices will depend on the location of alternative offices, transport links, choices made by individual customers and the many other factors which may contribute to any local congestion. If there were any significant effects I would expect local authorities to take account of them in their Local Transport Plans.

 The monitoring results of the traffic management scheme in Stiffkey, Norfolk were published in 2001 in TRL Report 500 Countryside Traffic Measures Group: Traffic calming schemes in Norfolk and Suffolk, and the summary report TRL Report 502 Countryside Traffic Measures Group: Demonstration schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what progress has been made with the introduction of quieter road surfaces on <i>(a)</i> the M60 between junction 1 and junction 5 and <i>(b)</i> the M56 between junction 1 and junction 2; and what plans there are for introduction of further such surfaces.  [147020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The surfaces of the M56 and M60 Motorways at these locations are generally in good condition and low noise surfacing was used recently when the slip road leading from the M60 at Junction 4, to the M56, was widened. Under normal maintenance procedures, it will be necessary to resurface small sections of these motorways over the next two-three years, and low noise surfacing will be used. Full resurfacing using low noise materials will not be undertaken until a comprehensive renewal of the existing surface is needed.
<P>

<a name="40112w16.html_para9">The Highways Agency has plans to fully resurface the M60 between Junctions 1 and 2. In order to keep to a minimum any disruption to road users, the Highways Agency would wish to avoid work on this section of the M60 whilst widening is taking place between Junctions 5 and 8. That widening will include low noise surfacing and is due for completion in spring 2006.
<P>

<a name="40112w16.html_para10">The Government recognises that excessive noise from traffic is an important issue. Lower noise surfaces is used on the trunk road network for all new roads and for most resurfacing work.

 Last year the Strategic Rail Authority consulted the rail industry, local authorities, passenger representatives and other stakeholders on the future pattern of service on the West Coast Main Line, including through Northampton. In June their 'West Coast Main Line Strategy' was published, indicating the likely level of service from September 2004 and beyond. The timetable for September 2004 has not yet been finalised, but it should be agreed at least 12 weeks prior to implementation, and made available to the public at least four weeks prior to the timetable change date. A further consultation on the emerging timetable will take place with key stakeholders, including rail user groups and Rail Passengers Committees, before it is finalised.

<a name="40112w18.html_para0">Bereavement Benefits were introduced on 9 April 2001, and for the first time extended support to both widows and widowers following the death of a spouse. These new benefits concentrate the help available where it is most needed; on immediate needs and on families with children.
<P>

<a name="40112w18.html_para1">In April 2003 we extended the time limit for claiming Bereavement Payment to 12 months aligning it with the period over which a person can receive Bereavement Allowance.

 Information is available from local Jobcentre Plus and Social Security offices, and the Department for Work and Pensions website gives information about Bereavement Benefits together with leaflets and claim forms for downloading. A fully revised version of leaflet NP45 "A guide to Bereavement Benefit" for professional advisers and members of the public was published in May this year. Leaflets D49 "What to do after a death in England and Wales" and D49S "What to do after a death in Scotland" are reviewed and revised as necessary annually.
<P>

<a name="40112w18.html_para2">In addition, we have been working with funeral directors, Registrars and voluntary groups such as Cruse, National Association of Widows and Citizens Advice Bureaux who may be contacted by bereaved people.
<P>

<a name="40112w18.html_para3">We have worked with Registrars to amend the social security form for notifying the Department of a death (BD8) to draw greater attention to the fact that it can be used to initiate a claim for bereavement benefits, this went to print in April 2003 and has been in use by Registrars since then. Within the last year we have also arranged for Funeral Directors to be able to obtain Bereavement Benefit claim packs so that they can be given directly to bereaved people.
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 7 January 2004]:</i> The department's pay offer to its staff for 2003 for negotiation with its trade unions included proposals on performance bonus payments to be paid in addition to consolidated, pensionable pay. Under these proposals, the bonus payable would be performance related and take account of the total contribution made. It was envisaged it would be reduced proportionately for periods of absence beyond annual, public and privilege leave and other absences of five days or fewer. This provision was included as part of the effort to improve levels of attendance within the department. It could have had a limited effect on the bonus earnable by those, including justices of the peace, who were granted special leave by the department.

 We have always recognised there will be some people, such as those who cannot open or manage any sort of account, and some immediate payments, such as Crisis Loans, that we cannot pay by Direct Payment. We are therefore designing an exceptions method of payment to meet the needs of people in these circumstances. We are in the process of discussing the design of the exceptions method of payment with the representative bodies most directly affected to design a secure and efficient method of payment which meets people's needs.

 The Independent Housing Ombudsman, who managed the pilot voluntary tenancy deposit scheme, has no information on the proportion of completed tenancies requiring independent adjudication under those schemes. That is because the terms of reference of the pilot scheme did not require that the number of completed tenancies should be recorded.

<a name="40112w21.html_para8">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no reliable estimate of the number of disputes that would require adjudication under a statutory tenancy deposit scheme. The Survey of English Housing 2001&#150;02 noted that some 20 per cent. of households with a tenancy ending in the previous three years claimed to have had their deposit unreasonably withheld in full or in part. The number of disputes, for which independent adjudication might be required under any statutory arrangements for tenancy deposit protection, might well be lower than this figure.

This includes the approach of accessibility planning in those areas that produce a Local Transport Plan, where local transport planners and others work together to examine accessibility needs and how to overcome barriers.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) how much has been allocated to the 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jan 2004 : Column 572W</I><P>
Yorkshire and Humber Regional Housing Board for 2003&#150;04; and how much of this is allocated by them to <i>(a)</i> repairs and renovation of council housing and <i>(b)</i> privatisation of council housing;  [146422]
<P>
<UL>(2) how much has been allocated in the current financial year by the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Housing Board to gap funding for privatisation of council housing to <i>(a)</i> north-east Lincolnshire and <i>(b)</i> other local authorities; and what the allocation of gap funding per council property is in each area which has received it.  [146423]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w22.html_spnew3"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 2003/04 was the last year for which housing capital allocations were made to local authorities on the old basis of recommendations made to Ministers by Government Offices (the Yorkshire and the Humber Regional Housing Board was not therefore involved). As was standard, 80 per cent. of the resources available were allocated using a needs-based formula and 20 per cent. according to performance. Local authorities in Yorkshire and the Humber had an allocation of &#163;65.9 million. This was for authorities to use according to their own priorities, without having to identify specific purposes such as repair and renovation of council housing or supporting stock transfers.
<P>

<a name="40112w22.html_para3">Under the new arrangements (introduced last year in the Communities Plan) the Yorkshire and Humber Regional Housing Board recommended capital allocations to local authorities totalling &#163;76 million for 2004&#150;05 and &#163;81 million for 2005&#150;06. The recommendations, which we accepted, included a fixed sum based on a needs-based formula (95 per cent. in 2004&#150;05 and 70 per cent. in 2005&#150;06 of what they would have received under the old arrangements).
<P>

<a name="40112w22.html_para4">The balance is being used to commission proposals to deliver regional housing strategy priorities, and, in 2005&#150;06, &#163;10 million for 'transformational proposals' of regional significance, which deliver one or more of the regional housing strategy priorities. The Board has said that it will consider applications for gap funding from this &#163;10 million in specific circumstances. Gap funding proposals have been submitted by north-east Lincolnshire and one other local authority. I understand that the Regional Housing Board will be considering at its meeting on 22 January all proposals submitted.
<P>

<a name="40112w22.html_para5">Separate from the above, local authorities in Yorkshire and the Humber also benefited from support for capital investment through the major repairs allowance (current figures are &#163;172 million in each of 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05). This allowance, calculated formulaically, covers the bulk of support for the repair and renovation of council housing.

 A range of materials to enable teachers to fully embed ICT in their subject teaching have been developed. Materials covering Key Stage 1 and 2 literacy and numeracy, including Foundation Stage, and Key Stage 3 science were launched in 32 LEA areas last year. These subjects, together with Key Stage 3 English, maths, art, geography, design and technology, ICT and modern foreign languages were formally launched nationally at the BETT2004 Exhibition at Olympia this week. Further subjects will follow later. In addition to the materials, extensive one-to-one mentoring and online peer group support are an integral part of these courses.

<a name="40112w23.html_para4">The Department has contracted a number of commercial providers to develop these materials and schools are able to buy into them using Standards Fund money.

who go on to teach priority subjects, including information and communication technology, in a maintained school. Since September 2002, these incentives have been reinforced by the Repayment of Teachers' Loans scheme piloted for three years for new teachers of priority subjects. These incentives have helped to more than double recruitment to courses of initial teacher training in information and communication technology between 1999/2000 and 2003/04.

 <i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]:</i> KPMG and the National College for School Leadership (NCSL), in consultation with key stakeholders including local authority, teacher and governor associations, have jointly developed a range of budget management support for schools, including online materials, workshops and consultancy services. The programme of workshops, which will be rolled out from January to March 2004 will be available to 1,000 schools and follow-up surgeries will be available, on a regional basis, for up to 125 schools with pressing and complex problems. The website containing online support materials was launched on 15 December and is available to all schools, as will be the central helpdesk, run by NCSL and available from this month.

<a name="40112w25.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much the Government have spent centrally on administering the National School Fruit Scheme in <i>(a)</i> 2001&#150;02 and <i>(b)</i> 2002&#150;03; and if he will make a statement.  [141789]<P>

<P>
<a name="40112w25.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40112w25.html_para0">The Department of Health spent &#163;0.75 million in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;0.3 million in 2002&#150;03 on administering and evaluating National School Fruit Scheme pilots, including the cost of the fruit. In 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04 the lottery-funded New Opportunities Fund has been supporting a scaling-up of the original pilots region by region with &#163;42 million. From 2004&#150;05 the scheme will be rolled out to all local education authority infant schools in England with full funding by the Department of Health.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) if he will make a statement on provision of school meals by Essex county council;  [146625]
<P>
<UL>(2) what statutory requirements there are on local education authorities to provide school meals; and if he will make a statement.  [146627]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w25.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Local education authorities have a duty to provide free and paid for school meals that meet nutritional standards. Where a school has a delegated budget for meals, the governing body takes on these responsibilities. From April 2000, funding for school meals was delegated to all secondary schools. Primary and special schools can opt for delegation.
<P>

<a name="40112w25.html_para1">From April 2004, Essex county council will delegate the budget for primary school meals. Primary school governing bodies will have the freedom to choose what form school meals should take, including the type of dishes served and the ingredients which are used. They can also choose the suppliers or providers for the school meal service.

<a name="40112w25.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to his answer of 15 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 669W, if he will make a statement on the relationship between ability grouping and <i>(a)</i> personalised learning and <i>(b)</i> teaching tailored to the needs of pupils; and what the role of central government is in implementing these teaching practices.  [145527]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Ability grouping is one measure by which schools can personalise the learning and tailor teaching to the needs of pupils. However, it is possible to identify a list of benefits and limitations for the main kinds of ability grouping at the level of the institution, teacher and pupil. It is for schools within the context of their particular circumstances to develop and determine for themselves which forms of ability grouping have the most positive impact for different groups of pupils within different learning contexts (such as different subject areas).
<P>

<a name="40112w25.html_para4">Through the primary and Key Stage 3 national strategies we will be making available to teachers later this year support in assessment for learning techniques and approaches to promote personalised learning.

<a name="40112w25.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Drew: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps he is taking to address difficulties in assessing value added improvements in secondary schools where part of their intake have not previously been evaluated in terms of SATS and teacher assessment.  [146560]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Value added measures for schools can only be calculated using existing data. Given that all pupils of compulsory school age attending maintained mainstream schools follow the National Curriculum, there are only a very small number who were not assessed at the end of the earlier key stage&#151;for example, only 3 per cent. of 15-year-olds had no prior attainment data at Key Stage 3 in the 2003 performance tables.
<P>

<a name="40112w25.html_para5">Though most schools will be unaffected, we accept that a small number might have a significant proportion of pupils with no prior attainment data&#151;for example, pupils from overseas. This is why we publish a coverage indicator in the performance tables which shows the percentage of pupils on which the value added calculation is based.

<i>[holding answer 16 December 2003]:</i> The Department of Health has given the ADHD UK Alliance a one-year grant of &#163;25,000 as a contribution towards the central administrative costs of their activities in England. This grant supports our priorities in child and adolescent mental health by resourcing an organisation, which in turn, will help the development of the many small support groups in the attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) field. We have also previously supported the ADHD UK Alliance when they were part of the organisation, Contact a Family.

 The arrangements currently in place for importing blood plasma from the United States are based on the objective to secure long term supplies of non-United Kingdom blood plasma to ensure that the global plasma shortage would not reduce to national health service patients the availability of life saving plasma products, such as immunoglobulins and clotting factors.
<P>

<a name="40112w27.html_para2">The NHS has been using US sourced plasma since 1998 because of the unknown and unquantifiable risk of transmission of vCJD through blood. The US was the only country able to supply the quality and quantity of plasma required. The US also has a well established pool of donors, a well regulated environment and a developed collection industry. We are aware of the one case of BSE reported in the US, which is considered to be a negligible risk to the safety of the blood supply.

 The safety of blood and blood products used in the National Health Service is of paramount importance. The current high levels of safety are achieved by screening out potential high-risk donors and then further testing of every unit of donated blood for Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C and HIV before it is released to hospitals. Diagnostic tests became available for Hepatitis B in 1972, for Hepatitis C in 1991 and for HIV in 1984. It is a matter for health professionals to ensure

 The National Blood Authority (NBA) and the Health Protection Agency have an infectious surveillance scheme that monitors the effectiveness of the blood screening programme and the methodology employed.

 The Government is fully committed to ensuring the provision of an adequately trained workforce to provide care for all vulnerable adults in social care settings, including care homes with nursing on the premises. The Department's No Secrets guidance has required all local councils and partner agencies to establish effective multi-agency codes of practice to protect vulnerable adults from abuse. A key element of this guidance concerns the training of staff. The guidance states that agencies should provide training for staff and volunteers on the policy, procedures and professional practices that are in the place locally, commensurate with their responsibilities in the adult protection process.
<P>

<a name="40112w28.html_para14">In addition, the Department's National Minimum Standards for care homes and domiciliary care, used by the National Care Standards Commission to regulate social care for older people and other vulnerable adults has a number of requirements concerning abuse. These include, protecting service users from abuse, ensuring adequate staff training, and the employment of staff in accordance with the code of practice set by the General Social Care Council, which includes advice to challenge and report and behaviour or practice that could lead to abuse.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what progress has been made towards achieving the national priorities guidance performance target to reduce the per capita rate of growth in emergency readmissions of people aged 75 years or over; and for what reasons the data collection for emergency admissions was changed to an all age base from 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<a name="40112w29.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The performance target for the rate of emergency readmissions within 28 days of discharge for patients of all ages as set out in the priorities and planning framework for 2003&#150;06, "Improvement, Expansion and Reform", is that there will be no growth. The rate at Quarter 4, 2002&#150;03 was 5.5 per cent. The latest information available is the Quarter 2, 2003&#150;04 figure, which shows no growth.
<P>

<a name="40112w29.html_para0">The target, and subsequently the collection of monitoring information on emergency readmissions, was changed from that relating only to patients aged 75 because it was perceived as being ageist in that older people could be denied access to hospital services in order to meet a performance target. Emergency readmissions targets and data collections have, therefore, covered all ages since 2002.

We plan to make these regulations, which are subject to affirmative resolution, during 2004. Subject to their approval, we will issue guidance to strategic health authorities on their implementation including standards for consultations which ensure that the views of both proponents and opponents of fluoridation are expressed and taken into account.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what advice has been given to trusts seeking foundation status on <i>(a)</i> building up an active membership and <i>(b)</i> demonstrating their understanding of mutual organisations.  [146546]<P>

<P>
<a name="40112w29.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Department of Health officials are working with the first wave of applicants for national health service foundation trust status on membership issues, which includes holding regular meetings with the trusts. The advice given at the meetings includes significant input from the mutual sector both on building an active membership and developing a better understanding of the mutual sector. This is supported by a comprehensive source book, "NHS Foundation Trusts&#151;A guide to the governance arrangements", which was developed with advice from a group of external experts on governance.

<a name="40112w29.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Guidance on the disposal of surplus national health service property assets is contained in the Department's "Estatecode", a copy of which is available in the Library. Guidance on the accounting treatment for disposals of assets is contained in the NHS "Capital Accounting Manual", which is publicly available on the Department's web-site at www. doh.gov.uk.

<a name="40112w29.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Murrison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health which primary care trusts have indicated that they will not be able to assure out-of-hours cover for general practitioners in <i>(a)</i> April 2004 and <i>(b)</i> August 2004.  [143188]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w29.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 11 December 2003]:</i> None. From April 2004, general practices will be able to opt out of out-of-hours services with the agreement of their primary care trust (PCT). PCTs will not agree to opt-outs unless they have put in place proper alternative arrangements. Opting out will become a right in all but exceptional circumstances from January 2005.

<a name="40112w29.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Murrison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what proportion of general practitioners have indicated that they intend to opt out of 24-hour cover, broken down by <i>(a)</i> rural practices, <i>(b)</i> urban practices and <i>(c)</i> strategic health authority.  [143189]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w29.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 11 December 2003]:</i> Primary care trusts are working with their local practices to establish the position, but full information is not available. We expect, however, that the majority of general practitioners will choose to opt-out of responsibility for providing services overnight and at weekends.

<a name="40112w29.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many <i>(a)</i> general practitioners' surgeries and <i>(b)</i> single-handed general practitioners' surgeries there were in each of the last five years for which figures are available in (i) England, (ii) each region and (iii) each strategic health authority.  [144318]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w29.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Data on the number of general practitioner partnerships, including single-handed practitioners is published annually and is available at http://www. doh.gov.uk/public/stats1.htm. The information requested is shown in the table. The total number of partnerships fell during the period 1998 to 2003 however there has been a steady trend towards larger partnerships and more general practitioners working in the national health service than ever before.

<P>
<a name="40112w30.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Ladyman  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 17 December 2003]:</i> Professional guidance on head louse control recognises that detection combing is of paramount importance, as is the use of appropriate treatment options. This can involve either lotions or combing regimes. Our view is that parents should be able to make an informed choice with advice on both options being available from primary health care teams.

 The Department is not responsible for setting curricula for health professional training; that is rightly the responsibility of the statutory and professional bodies. However, we do share a commitment with those bodies that all health professionals are trained so that they have the skills and knowledge to deliver a high quality health service to all groups of the population with whom they deal.

 Entitlement to free national health service treatment is based on residence in the United Kingdom.

<P>
<a name="40112w30.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 2 December 2003]:</i> All strategic health authorities have developed stringent winter plans to cope with increased seasonal demand for health services, such as that caused by the flu season. These set out escalation procedures, which are activated in the event of increased pressure on the national health service.
<P>

<a name="40112w30.html_para1">In addition, a daily winter reporting system has been instigated so that the Department of Health is aware of any Trusts experiencing winter pressures. If pressures are identified, the Department of Health works with the responsible strategic health authority in developing a solution, such as the introduction of improved working practices or the opening of additional beds.

 The primary goal of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is the protection of public health through the regulation of medicines and medical devices.
<P>

<a name="40112w31.html_para0">Its aims and objectives are set out in its business plan, which is available in the Library. There are no specific objectives relating to the development of the pharmaceutical industry. The business plan does, however, contain measures of the efficiency of its performance of services for the pharmaceutical industry.

 Information is available from independent longitudinal research about the relationship between risk factors and the likelihood of an individual within the population developing a mental illness.
<P>

<a name="40112w31.html_para3">The Department of Health does not assess this directly. However, the Office for National Statistics (www.statistics.gov.uk) collects information on a systematic basis about current correlates of mental illness, including age, gender, socio-economic status, physical health and other factors, and estimates mental illness prevalence rates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w31.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The national survey of ethnic minority psychiatric illness rates in the community (EMPIRIC study) was a major survey of psychiatric illness rates in the community amongst ethnic minority adults aged 16&#150;74 living in England. The survey was used to make comparisons with the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity in the general population. The findings were released in May 2002.
<P>

<a name="40112w31.html_para4">The results of this survey allow, for the first time, detailed analysis of the mental health of ethnic minority groups and comparisons with a general white population. It contains data on common mental disorders, psychosis, social functioning, physical health, use of services and social support. The report identifies different rates of common mental disorders and psychotic illness between minority ethnic groups.
<P>

<a name="40112w31.html_para5">In order to combat the inequality experience by black and minority ethnic mental health service users, "Delivering Race Equality: Guidance for Services" was launched on 17 October for consultation. This marks the start of a major programme by the National Institute for Mental Health in England on black and minority ethnic mental health.

 There are nine regional microbiologist posts in the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Four of these have been filled by former Public Health Laboratory Service group laboratory directors, following internal advertisement, applying procedures in accordance with the change management protocol which was agreed when the HPA was created. The remaining five positions were subsequently advertised externally and the process for assessing and interviewing candidates is underway.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what investigations the <i>(a)</i> Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and <i>(b)</i> the Committee on the Safety of Medicines have conducted into the two suspected fatal reactions associated with the use of Mifegyne; and with what results.  [146479]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w31.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 As with all marketed medicines, the safety of Mifegyne (mifepristone, an antiprogestogenic steroid that is used for the medical termination of intra-uterine pregnancy) is continuously monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA).
<P>

<a name="40112w31.html_para6">The MHRA has carefully evaluated the two reports received via the Yellow Card Scheme of fatal suspected 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jan 2004 : Column 612W</I><P>
adverse reactions associated with the use of Mifegyne. This assessment has included details from the post-mortems received in the initial report or via follow-up information obtained from the marketing authorisation holder. The MHRA has concluded that the two cases did not require alteration of the advice to health professionals in the summary of product characteristics and did not affect the balance of risks and benefits of mifepristone. The Committee on Safety of Medicines was not asked to consider these cases.
<P>

<a name="40112w31.html_para7">The reporting of a suspected adverse drug reaction does not necessarily mean that the drug was responsible. Many factors, such as the medical condition that is being treated, other pre-existing illnesses or other medications might have contributed. In one of the cases, the fatal suspected reaction that was reported is recognised to occur with greater frequency during pregnancy or surgery, irrespective of the use of mifepristone.

 It is ultimately only the employer which can take action with regard to its employees. The code of conduct for national health service managers states that where there has been an alleged breach of the code, it is for a local employer to decide whether to investigate the matter informally or under the terms of local disciplinary action. In the majority of cases the authority with which the contract lies will carry out investigations of alleged breaches of the code.

If a case of this kind did occur, strategic health authorities and other bodies can offer advice.

<P>
<a name="40112w32.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Burns: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many patients in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> Mid-Essex are waiting for orthodontic treatment; and how many have been waiting for treatment for (i) up to six months, (ii) up to 12 months, (iii) up to 24 months, (iv) up to 36 months and (v) over 36 months.  [144860]<P>

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 5 January 2003]</i>: Information on waiting times for orthodontic treatment in the general dental services (GDS) is not available.
<P>

<a name="40112w32.html_para5">In terms of hospital treatment, in England at 30 September 2003 there were 228 patients waiting for elective inpatient admission for treatment by a consultant in the speciality of orthodontics. Of these 205 were waiting up to six months, and a further 23 were waiting over six months. No patients were waiting over 12 months. Mid-Essex Hospital Services National Health Service Trust had no patients waiting for the orthodontics speciality on the same date.
<P>

<a name="40112w32.html_para6">The NHS Plan (July 2000) sets out how waiting times will fall year on year. Maximum waiting times have already been reduced to 21 weeks for a first outpatient appointment and 12 months for inpatient treatment. However, the Government recognises that there is still some way to go.
<P>

<a name="40112w32.html_para7">Waiting times for hospital care will continue to fall, so that by the end of 2005, the maximum waiting time for a first outpatient appointment will be cut to 13 weeks and the maximum wait for inpatient treatment will be cut to six months.
<P>

<a name="40112w32.html_para8">In the twelve month period ending September 2003 GDS dentists in the Mid-Essex area claimed payment for 2,631 courses of treatment involving orthodontic appliances for children aged less than 18 years. This is equivalent to 27.5 claims per 1,000 population aged under 18, almost twice the England average of 14.5. The mid-Essex figure is for the area covered by the PCTs; Chelmsford; Maldon and South Chelmsford; Uttlesford; Witham, Braintree and Halstead.

<P>
<a name="40112w32.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 Osteoporosis is a key component of an integrated falls service, which all health and social care systems are to have established by 2005. The 2005 milestone is set as a target in Improvement Expansion and Reform, the Priority and Planning Framework for 2003&#150;06, and progress towards this target is being monitored centrally.

<a name="40112w32.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Department of Health does not collect data on the precise medical conditions of patients delayed in hospital, but it does have information on overall numbers of delays. Good progress has been made in reducing the number of delayed transfers of care from hospital year on year, with the number of acute patients delayed on any one day going down from around 6,000 in 2001, to 5,000 in 2002, to 4,000 in 2003. This reflects increased investment in services to tackle delays following the introduction of the Building Care Capacity Grant, and the introduction in October 2003 of new duties of communication between the National Health Service and councils required by the Community Care (Delayed Discharges, etc. Act). In January 2004 the Act requires local authorities to begin to reimburse the NHS for those delays for which they are solely responsible. This requirement will act as a further incentive to partners to identify and tackle the causes of delay in their local system.

<a name="40112w32.html_para10">The NSF for older people sets clear milestones for the planning and development of integrated falls services and provides the basis for a service model that will deliver the improvements in prevention, care, treatment and rehabilitation that we all want to see.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2003]</i>: The testing of shellfish for toxins is a public health matter, which falls within the policy responsibility of the Food Standards Agency (FSA).
<P>

<a name="40112w34.html_para0">Unusual results have been observed over the last two years in tests for diarrhetic shellfish poisoning toxins under the statutory monitoring programmes, which point to the possible presence of a new neurotoxin. These have therefore resulted in the temporary closure, from time to time, of some shellfish harvesting waters, as a precautionary measure to ensure that public health continues to be protected. The FSA is pursuing an extensive programme of work to resolve the issues associated with these findings.

<a name="40112w34.html_para3">In addition, we have asked NICE to update the referral guidelines for suspected cancer published by the Department in April 2000, to assist general practitioners in determining those patients who are most likely to have cancer and therefore need to be referred urgently to see a specialist. Both the existing guidance and the revised guidance will address skin cancers.

<P>
<a name="40112w35.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2003]:</i> National health service foundation trusts, like all NHS trusts, would in principle have the power to pay both the tuition and top-up fees of recruits. It would be up to each NHS foundation trust as to whether and in what

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures his Department has put in place to counter the shortages of <i>(a)</i> transplant consultants and <i>(b)</i> critical care nurses in the NHS outlined in the Transplant Framework for England, Saving Lives, Valuing Donors.  [144891]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w35.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The NHS Plan set challenging workforce objectives to increase staff numbers significantly and redesign jobs with more staff working differently. The Department has arranged for 11 additional surgical training places to be funded specifically to train transplant surgeons.
<P>

<a name="40112w35.html_para0">Between September 1999 and March 2002, a net increase of 28,740 nurses working in the national health service has meant the NHS Plan target for nurses, 20,000 by 2004, has been achieved early. The NHS has a plan to recruit an additional 35,000 nurses by 2008&#151;a proportion of whom will be working in critical care.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what system will be put in place to monitor and evaluate the measurements of progress outlined in the Transplant Framework for England, Saving Lives, Valuing Donors; and what action he will take in the event of primary care trusts failing to make progress;. [144892]
<P>
<UL>(2) what role he envisages charities and voluntary organisations will play in the implementation of the Transplant Framework for England, Saving Lives, Valuing Donors;  [144893]

 UK Transplant already closely monitors most aspects of organ donation and transplantation. The information UK Transplant collects and analyses on organ donation and transplant activity is available on its web-site at www.uktransplant.org.uk. In developing their transplant services, it will be for primary care trusts and specialist commissioning teams to take account of local needs and priorities to allocate resources and benchmark their performance against published activity data. As organ transplantation is of proven clinical

and cost effectiveness, maximising donation and transplantation rates will be important for both patients and the National Health Service.
<P>

<a name="40112w35.html_para1">We envisage that voluntary organisations will continue to play an important part in research, raising awareness about organ donation, particularly by encouraging people to join the organ donor register and supporting the families of donors and transplant recipients.
<P>

<a name="40112w35.html_para2">The Department has provided around &#163;7 million via UK Transplant since 2001 to boost organ donation through the employment of 35 donor liaison nurses working with staff in critical units to help identify potential donors and how to approach and support relatives; 23 living donor co-ordinators working with families considering live donation and funding 10 non-heartbeating programmes to increase the number of organs from non-heartbeating donors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40112w35.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Government policy on organ donation is one of informed consent, not presumed consent (opt out). The Government reviewed the law on the removal, retention and use of human tissues and organs and tissues during 2003 and the resulting Human Tissue Bill, which was laid before Parliament on 2 December 2003, does not propose to change this policy.

 The Transfusion Medicine Epidemiology Review is a collaborative project between the United Kingdom National CJD Surveillance Unit (NCJDSU) and United Kingdom Blood Services (UKBS). The main purpose is to investigate whether there is any evidence that Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease or variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease may have been transmitted via the blood supply.
<P>

<a name="40112w35.html_para3">Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease cases are notified to the UKBS by NCJDSU; a search establishes whether any have acted as donors. Donation records are checked and all components traced through hospital records. Details of all identified recipients are forwarded to NCJDSU for subsequent checking.
<P>

<a name="40112w35.html_para4">In the reverse procedure, patients with variant CJD reported to have received blood transfusions are identified by NCJDSU and notified to UKBS. Details of transfusions are traced through hospital records and relevant blood donors identified. The identity of donors is notified to NCJDSU for subsequent checking.
<P>

<a name="40112w35.html_para5">The safety of blood used in the National Health Service is of paramount importance. Every reasonable step has been taken to minimise any risks during blood transfusion. The current high levels of safety are achieved by screening out potential high risk donors and then further testing of every unit of donated blood for HIV, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C, Human T Cell Leukaemia Virus, and Syphilis before it is released to NHS hospitals.
