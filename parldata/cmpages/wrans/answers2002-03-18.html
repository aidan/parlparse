To ask the Solicitor-General what her policy is on the payment of relocation expenses to staff in her Department.  [41026]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w01.html_spmin5"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 March 2002]:</i> My own Department, the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers, is a small Department situated in central London and its staff are seconded to it from a number of parent Departments. The issue of relocating LSLO staff does not, therefore, arise.

<P>

<a name="20318w01.html_para3">In the Departments for which the Attorney-General is responsible, details are as follows:
<P>

<a name="20318w01.html_para4"><i>Crown Prosecution Service</i>
<P>

<a name="20318w01.html_para5">The Crown Prosecution Service provides financial assistance to staff who are permanently transferred to a new location in the interests of the Department and, as a consequence, need to move home. The general principle employed in this situation is that staff will be reimbursed for all reasonable expenses actually and necessarily incurred as a result of the relocation. Details of the financial assistance available to CPS staff are contained in the Department's Travel and Subsistence Code.
<P>

<a name="20318w01.html_para6"><i>Treasury Solicitor's Department</i>
<P>

<a name="20318w01.html_para7">All the Treasury Solicitor's Department staff are located in London apart from a small group of eight staff who are co-located with their clients, the Ministry of Defence in Bristol. This small section was relocated from London to Bristol in 1998 and they were given the same relocation terms as applied to MOD staff.
<P>

<a name="20318w01.html_para8">The Treasury Solicitor's Department policy is that, where moves are voluntary, relocation expenses are not paid. As nearly all Treasury Solicitor's Department staff are based in London, the Department does not have a specific relocation policy. The circumstances where the Department might pay relocation expenses would be where staff who were co-located with their clients were being compulsorily moved. In such cases the Treasury Solicitor's Department would ensure that its staff received the same benefits as the clients.
<P>

<a name="20318w01.html_para9"><i>Serious Fraud Office</i>
<P>

<a name="20318w01.html_para10">Almost all of the Serious Fraud Office's permanent staff are based in central London. The very few that are not based in London are regionally based investigators working either from home or in local police stations.
<P>

<a name="20318w01.html_para11">Therefore, the Serious Fraud Office does not offer relocation expenses to its existing staff.
<P>

<a name="20318w01.html_para12">Nor does the Serious Fraud Office offer relocation expenses to persons transferring to the Serious Fraud Office from other Government Departments, or to newly recruited staff who need to relocate in order to take up a post with the Serious Fraud Office.

 DFID made contributions totalling &#163;2 million to relief agencies active in addressing the needs of people affected by the eruption of Mount Nyaragongo shortly after the eruption.

 We understand that relatively few of those affected by the eruption of Mount Nyaragongo are in north-west Rwanda. Although many sought sanctuary there immediately after the eruption, most returned to DRC soon afterwards. The Red Cross reported on 7 March that just over 5,000 people have remained in Rwanda. There is no evidence that the presence of these refugees is causing instability in the region.

 UK responsibility for EU Common Fisheries Policy is taken by DEFRA. My Department has not assessed corruption in relation to Common Fisheries Policy agreements with the countries mentioned. However, the Government is seeking, along with our European partners, greater coherence in the implementation of EC's development and other external policies. We welcomed the endorsement of the EC's "Poverty and Fisheries" strategy at the Development Council in November 2001. The strategy calls for future fisheries agreements to be subject to "observance of the principles of good governance, with financial compensation having to be paid and used in accordance with sound budgetary management practice".

SHG committed itself to a significant change programme, designed to make St. Helena more self sufficient, by promoting the private sector and raising the efficiency of the public sector. In return, we agreed to provide &#163;29 million in development assistance over the period 2000&#150;01 to 2002&#150;03. This represented an increase of &#163;3 million over the previous three year agreement, and a modest increase in real terms.

 Despite three years of drought and 23 years of conflict, and the recent insecurity and population displacement, widespread famine in Afghanistan has been averted by the early and effective actions of the humanitarian community. Over 6.6 million people have been provided with food aid over the past six months, as well as other essential relief supplies such as tents, clothing and cooking equipment.
<P>

<a name="20318w04.html_para3">However, with the prospect of a fourth year of drought this year, and continued limited access to some areas of Afghanistan, the humanitarian situation remains fragile and significant needs will remain for a least the coming year in challenging and volatile operating conditions. The Immediate and Transition Assistance Programme for the Afghan People, prepared by the UN and agreed with the Afghan Interim Administration (AIA), sets out the current humanitarian situation and the challenges ahead, up to the end of December 2002. The programme estimates that approximately 9 million Afghans, including over 1 million internally displaced persons (IDPs), are in need of assistance in Afghanistan in 2002.
<P>

<a name="20318w04.html_para4">My Department has committed over &#163;60 million since September 2001 to support both the AIA and the United Nations-led humanitarian and recovery effort. This assistance is being channelled through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross movement and non-governmental organisations for projects covering a wide range of sectors. In addition, at the Tokyo Conference on the Reconstruction of Afghanistan, we pledged &#163;200 million over the next five years for both reconstruction and humanitarian assistance. The World bank is in the process of establishing the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) as a way of streamlining donor assistance to Afghanistan from July 2002 onwards. We intend to contribute to the ARTF on its establishment, as well as continuing to channel funds directly through humanitarian and development agencies working in Afghanistan.

 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2002]:</i> Inspections of workplaces in respect of general fire precautions are carried out by local fire authorities. Inspections are made of individual premises and other workplaces and recorded as such. Consequently it is not possible to give a date for inspection of the harbour as a whole.

 Personal details of rough sleepers in 1998 were in many cases not recorded, making it hard to track their progress away from the street and into housing, training and employment. As part of delivering its strategy the unit has now put in place client monitoring systems to track the progress of individuals in their move from sleeping rough to independent living. These systems are subject to review and further development.
<P>

<a name="20318w08.html_para1">The Rough Sleepers Unit has worked with Government Departments, other statutory bodies and voluntary agencies to help people with a history of sleeping rough to access statutory benefits, education, training and employment. The unit has funded the Homeless Routeway to Employment, "Learning Zones", a website to help rough sleepers into employment and a "jobs-led hostel" which specifically helps former rough sleepers into work.
<P>

<a name="20318w08.html_para2">The unit has also invested &#163;2 million of its Special Innovation Fund in schemes to build self esteem and help former rough sleepers into employment, including Business in the Community which has helped businesses provide work placements, training and support to local homeless agencies and their clients.

This breakdown will show possession action in relation to rent arrears and anti-social behaviour and will enable us to monitor trends on such actions and improve our understanding of the causes of homelessness.

 None. Registered social landlords (RSLs) are independent organisations regulated by the Housing Corporation. They must demonstrate compliance with the Housing Corporation's regulatory code and guidance, which requires them to seek possession of a property only as a last resort.
<P>

<a name="20318w08.html_para4">The Corporation's new inspection regime focuses on the quality and efficiency of registered social landlords' housing management services.

 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2002]:</i> Individual cases of mesothelioma or of lung cancer caused by asbestos are not pathologically or clinically distinguishable from those due to other causes. The link between asbestos exposure and the occurrence of these diseases is established scientifically by the observation that the "rates" of these diseases are consistently higher in population groups with asbestos exposure than in comparable non-exposed groups. Now this link is established, a judgment can be made for individual cases as to whether their conditions are likely to have been due to asbestos exposure if the extent of the individual case's exposure to asbestos is known or can be estimated. However, such judgments are always a question of a balance of probabilities, and can never be totally certain. Since every member of the population has been exposed to asbestos from multiple sources, the definitive linkage of individual cases to a particular source is not possible.

 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2002]:</i> The attribution of mesothelioma and lung cancer cases to asbestos exposure by doctors participating in the Surveillance of Work-related and Occupational Disease, known as SWORD, scheme reflects the reporting doctor's best judgment based on their knowledge of the case's exposure history. The attribution is not based on clinical pathology.
<P>

<a name="20318w09.html_para8">The statement that almost all mesothelioma cases recorded on the mesothelioma register are due to asbestos is an estimate based on the strongly established links between asbestos and mesothelioma, and the fact that the growth in the numbers of mesothelioma deaths over the last 30 years (and the more recent decline in deaths at ages below 50) corresponds to the earlier growth and decline in national asbestos imports.

 We continue to work with the Commonwealth Games Federation (who have formal responsibility for the development of the drug testing regime for the Commonwealth Games) as well as Games' organisers, Manchester 2002 Ltd., and UK Sport to ensure that a robust and reliable regime is in place for the Games; and which is consistent with internationally accepted standards of anti-doping

A decision on testing for EPO (Erythropoietin) using blood sampling is awaited from the CGF and will need to take account of any improvements identified by the International Olympic Committee from the protocols for the Salt Lake City Winter Olympic Games. The final decision on the number and type of drug tests rests with the CGF.

 <i>[holding answer 11 March 2002]:</i> There are certain days of the year known as 'named days' when the Union flag must be flown from Government buildings. The days include St. David's day (in Wales), St. George's day (in England), St. Andrew's day (in Scotland) but not St. Patrick's day. In the Department for Culture, Media and Sport there are no celebrations other than raising the Union flag.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Inter-Ministerial Group on Sport, which I chair, continues to meet monthly. It provides an opportunity for my Department, along with the Department for Education and Skills, the Department of Health, the Home Office, the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, Sport England and the New Opportunities Fund to get a cross-departmental perspective of the sport-related issues of the day, and to discuss options for addressing those that take into account the wishes and concerns of all involved. In addition, the group also receives feedback from the School Sport Alliance, which meets quarterly at official level to discuss the practicalities of putting the Government's Plan for Sport into practice.

 The medal is being issued to members of the armed forces and Royal Fleet Auxiliary, and to the emergency services. Yeoman Warders of the Tower of London do not fall within these categories and are therefore ineligible to receive the medal.

<P>
<a name="20318w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Decisions about the time limits on funding are for the Community Fund. Its directions require it to set specific time limits on the periods for which grants are payable, although the precise periods are a matter for the fund alone and are not subject to regulation by the Government.

final date is by which she expects all funds to have been distributed; and what measures are in place to ensure that all funds are distributed by this date.  [44036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Fair Share will begin distributing funds from April this year. It will operate for three years until March 2005 and by then we estimate that &#163;169 million of Lottery funding will have been distributed under Fair Share to benefit the areas selected. The Community Fund and NOF are developing a monitoring and evaluation strategy for ensuring that these funds go where they are most needed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to her answer of 25 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 708W, if she will list the 50 areas which are likely to benefit from Lottery grants following the review; and if she will make a statement.  [43788]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2002]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State on 28 February 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1539&#150;40W to my hon. Friend the Member for West Bromwich, East (Tom Watson).
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w12.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Sheerman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many projects have <i>(a)</i> been supported by the National Lottery and <i>(b)</i> subsequently failed; what the average value is of grants made by the National Lottery; and what steps are being taken to ensure that projects are revenue-funded to ensure their long-term success.  [43555]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w12.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 To date 103,586 projects have been supported by the National Lottery and the average value of the awards amounts to &#163;98,017. Comprehensive information on the number of failed Lottery projects is not centrally held at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Revised policy Directions issued by my Department in June 1998 freed Lottery distributors from past restrictions on revenue funding. It is for the distributors to decide the maximum period of time for which they will provide funding. It remains an important principle of Lottery funding that individual projects are for a defined period, to avoid commitments which would reduce the availability of resources for new projects.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w12.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport when her Department stopped recording information regarding <i>(a)</i> the number of applications made and <i>(b)</i> the amount of money asked for, by organisations per constituency; and if she will make a statement.  [43789]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w12.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2002]:</i> This Department has never held comprehensive information on applications for Lottery grants by constituency, either in terms of the number of applications made or the amount of money requested.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what the bidding process for the Privy Council silverware will be when it is offered for sale to institutions willing to display the items to the UK public; whether preferred institutions will be selected; by whom; on what criteria; whether <i>(a)</i> public and <i>(b)</i> charitable funds will be used for a national museum to

<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make it his policy that the purchaser of the Privy Council silverware shall not impose admission charges for public access;  [44251]

<P>
(5) what will be the process for offering the Privy Council silverware for sale;  [44246]

<a name="20318w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20318w13.html_para0">Current plans are for the Government to identify institutions willing to display the items to the UK public. These institutions would then be invited to submit bids against specified criteria. These criteria would cover both the arrangements for display and the proposed price. Admission charges will not be a criterion; nor will the bidding institution's source of funding. The items would be sold as a single group.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations the British Government have made to the Government of Lebanon to ascertain the fate of three Israeli soldiers taken prisoner by Hezbollah on 7 October 2000, and to encourage the Lebanese Government to work for their release.  [41400]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Her Majesty's Government has made a number of representations to Governments in the Middle East, including the Lebanese, about the fate of the soldiers and will continue to do so. We support all efforts to make progress, whether it be obtaining news of their situation, gaining access to them by ICRC and&#151;most welcome&#151;their release. Most recently, I met families of the soldiers during his visit to Israel in February.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 22 January 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 776W, on stolen equipment, what criminal proceedings have been undertaken for cases of theft against his Department, stating in each case <i>(a)</i> whether the proceedings (i) led to a criminal conviction and (ii) were unsuccessful, <i>(b)</i> the cost incurred by his Department in pursuing a conviction and <i>(c)</i> the value of items recovered; and if he will make a statement.  [41504]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In every case where equipment was reported stolen, an internal investigation was carried out. Unfortunately in every case, the investigation proved inconclusive with no culprit identified. As a result there were no criminal proceedings, no convictions, no actual costs incurred and no items recovered.

<a name="20318w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Both my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I regularly discuss Iraq with our counterparts in the European Union. We share the concerns of the US Government, and all responsible Governments, about Iraq's support for terrorism and its development of weapons of mass destruction.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what progress has been made with regard to verification procedures relating to the 1972 Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention.  [40923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Negotiations on a compliance Protocol to strengthen the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC) concluded unsuccessfully at the 24th Session of the Ad Hoc Group of States Parties in August 2001. And as no agreement could be reached at the subsequent Review Conference in December last year a decision was made to suspend the proceedings. The Conference will reconvene in Geneva on 11 November when we hope that it will be possible to make progress in reinforcing the norm against biological weapons. In preparation for the Conference the Government will shortly present a Government paper setting out its views on ways to counter the threat from biological weapons. This will be laid in the House in April.

 In the last five years, the largest shortfall in personnel against the in-year requirement for UK Trained Army Personnel was 8,063 in August 2001. The smallest shortfall during the period, against the lower assessed requirement at that time, was 4,855 in September 1997. As at 1 February 2002, there was a shortfall of 7,477 personnel against the currently assessed in-year

 The Ministry of Defence has every confidence in the independent studies carried out by the National Radiological Protection Board and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund that showed veterans' participation in the nuclear test programme has not had a detectable effect on their expectation of life, or on their risk of developing cancer or other fatal diseases. Consequently grounds do not exist for compensation to be paid to British nuclear test veterans or their surviving spouses and families. There are no plans to review this position.

 Since the announcement of the Veterans Initiative, and my appointment as Minister for Veterans Affairs one year ago, we have built up a partnership with veterans' organisations and other Government Departments to develop an integrated policy for veterans. This is well advanced, and will address veterans' concerns across Government and identify means of improving the delivery of services to veterans, particularly the most vulnerable.

<a name="20318w15.html_para1">Working through a Veterans Forum and a Ministerial Task Force, we have agreed an action plan.

I have decided that the War Pensions Agency should provide a special focus for our support to veterans and that, accordingly, with effect from 2 April, it should be renamed the Veterans Agency. As a first step towards giving substance to this change of name, the Veterans Agency will, from the end of this month, provide an integrated website and freephone helpline that will be the first point of contact for veterans seeking advice and information. For the longer term, we will also be looking at the future development of the War pensioners Welfare Service, and in particular the possibility of expanding partnerships with the charitable sector to improve the support delivered in this area by offering a better co-ordinated service.

These are now addressing the particular concerns identified within the initiative's core themes of partnership, identity, recognition and care. This work includes developing new resettlement training for the most vulnerable of our Service leavers who are at greatest risk of social exclusion, the development of material for the new Key Stage 3 and 4 scheme for citizenship to be part of the National Curriculum from September 2002; improving communication between Government and veterans, recognition of veterans' achievements in more recent years, and problems faced by the veterans charities' care homes. The Working Groups will be reporting their progress to me in time for the next meeting of the Veterans Forum and the Ministerial Task Force in April and May respectively.

From this April, the provisions for war widowers will be equalised to bring them fully into line with those currently available to war widows. Further, we plan to introduce measures from August that will guarantee that a war pensioner can return to Unemployability Supplement within the first 12 months of starting work.

<a name="20318w17.html_para0">The ordinary courts do not have jurisdiction to try service disciplinary offences or, in most cases, offences committed outside the United Kingdom. Service courts are able to deal with all but the most serious criminal cases in the UK and are able to bring to bear a full appreciation of the impact of an offence committed in a service environment. The benefit of transferring the most serious criminal cases to the ordinary courts allows a balance to be maintained between the military and civilian judicial systems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what research has been commissioned to look at alternative arrangements, compliant with the Human Rights Act 1998, for military discipline; and what estimate he has made of the limitations there are on the use of criminal courts.  [41099]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The arrangements for administering discipline in the armed forces are kept under review, including with a view to their remaining compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Changes are made where necessary, to reflect the requirements of the Convention and also to keep in step with appropriate developments in the civilian justice system.
<P>

<a name="20318w17.html_para1">This flexible approach to service discipline procedures is considered to be preferable to greater use of the civilian criminal courts. Generally, civilian courts are less likely that service courts to process a full appreciation of the importance of discipline to the operational effectiveness of the armed forces and of the possibility that an offence committed in a service environment may have even more serious implications that a similar offence in civilian life. Moreover, civilian courts do not have jurisdiction to try service disciplinary offences. Nor in most cases do civilian courts in the United Kingdom have jurisdiction in respect of offences alleged to have been committed overseas by service personnel or civilians accompanying them. The worldwide application of service law is particularly important for mobile forces that need to be able to maintain discipline, as a key to operational effectiveness, wherever they are deployed. The ability of service courts to try alleged offences committed outside the United Kingdom can also be a useful means of ensuring that the accused are dealt with in British courts and in accordance with a system of British law, rather than in foreign courts where the language, law and procedures may be unfamiliar to them.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will set out the changes that have been made to the provisions for courts martial contained within the Army Act 1955 to bring the framework for military discipline into line with Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights; and what the principal findings of the European Court on 26 February were.  [41097]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w17.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Armed Forces Act 1996 made extensive changes to the court martial system in all three services, intended to reinforce the independence of the courts and those making decisions concerning court proceedings, and to make the procedures as a whole compatible with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which concerns the right to a fair hearing.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The main changes were:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The replacement of the convening officer, who previously had the key role in deciding whether charges should be preferred against an individual, in appointing court martial members, and in confirming court martial findings and sentences. The convening officer's functions were divided between higher authorities, who take a preliminary view on whether court martial proceedings are appropriate for cases that are referred to them by commanding officers; prosecuting authorities independent of the service chain of command, who decide whether to prosecute and what charges should be brought; and court administration officers, whose responsibilities include the selection of court martial members, drawn from a different command to that of the accused.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The introduction of a requirement that the membership of every court martial should include a judge advocate appointed by the Judge Advocate General or the Chief Naval Judge Advocate. The judge advocate acquired an enhanced role, so that his advice on points of law is binding on the court and he has a vote on sentence.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The introduction of a simpler process of review of court martial findings and sentences (in the Army and RAF, replacing post-trial confirmation). Any changes resulting from review are intended not to worsen the position of the accused.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The extension of the right of appeal to include appeal against sentence as well as against finding.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The extension of the right for an accused to choose to be tried by court martial, rather than being dealt with summarily.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="20318w17.html_para2">The judgment of the European Court of Human Rights on the case of Morris <i>v.</i> the United Kingdom, published on 26 February, included the observation that these changes had gone a long way to meeting its concerns about the structure of the court martial system. The court also found that there was no violation of Article 6 of the Convention arising from the relationship between the chain of command and those involved in court martial proceedings.
<P>

<a name="20318w17.html_para3">However, it found that there had been a violation of Article 6 as regards aspects of Mr. Morris's trial by court martial in 1997, namely the potential for undue external influence over certain members of the court martial panel; and the procedures involving non-judicial authorities in the review of court martial findings and sentences. We are assessing the implications of these aspects of the judgment.

By generating technological capabilities within MOD's defence equipment supplier base, Towers of Excellence should enable industry to compete more effectively.

 The Ministry of Defence and the services create a significant amount of material during the course of business. As a consequence records are initially reviewed locally by those responsible for their creation. Where records are perceived to have no more value they may be destroyed locally. Records thought to have continuing administrative or possible historical value are transferred to the MOD's main archives. They are in due course reviewed by the MOD's staff in a process reflecting the requirements of the Public Records Act, 1958 and 1967.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w19.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The United Kingdom, the United States of America, Russia and France undertook dumping of confiscated German chemical munitions into the Baltic and Skagerrak between 1945 and 1947. However, after World War Two, it was the administrative practice to destroy records of sea disposals of munitions, including chemical weapons, when such records were perceived to be of no further administrative use. As a result of this practice, a detailed inventory of all conventional and chemical munitions does not exist. Where relevant British records on this subject do survive, they have been declassified and transferred to the Public Record Office in accordance with the terms of the Public Records Act, 1958 and 1967. We do not have details of the quantity or content of munitions dumped by other nations.
<P>

<a name="20318w19.html_para3">The consensus of international scientific opinion is that munitions on the seabed present no risk to human health or the marine environment provided they are left undisturbed. While the United Kingdom has no plans to monitor or remove conventional or chemical munitions dumped on the seabed, I am aware that NATO was approached by the Russian Government in 1997 regarding possible cooperation in the monitoring and prevention of leakage of chemicals from the German chemical weapons stocks sunk in the Baltic and Skagerrak after World War Two. Liaison on this issue with the Russian Government is continuing through NATO's Committee on the Challenges of Modern Society (CCMS), but no decision has yet been reached as to whether NATO will participate in any monitoring or preventative action.

 Reported cases of theft are held centrally on a summary basis and relate to reported suspicions only. It cannot be assumed therefore that criminal proceedings for theft have or will apply in every case. Every year the Ministry of Defence investigates a significant number of suspected thefts, many of a minor nature. Inevitably, in many instances a suspected perpetrator is not identified or there is insufficient evidence to sustain a prosecution. Where a suspected perpetrator is identified prosecution or internal disciplinary action follows as appropriate. The provision of comprehensive details, including costs incurred and recoveries made, relating to the outcome of such proceedings could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="20318w21.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I have today announced proposals to strengthen consumer protection against short-measure draught beer and cider. Under the proposals bar staff would have to serve a minimum of 95 per cent. liquid per pint. If consumers are dissatisfied with 95 per cent. they can request a top-up. The Government will work closely with the beer trade to ensure that consumers are fully aware of their rights, including pubs displaying signs that consumers can ask for a top-up at no extra cost if they are dissatisfied with their pint.
<P>

<a name="20318w21.html_para0">The Department estimates that the total wholesale cost of draft beer and cider not served to consumers owing to short measures amounts to some &#163;130 million a year at 2001 wholesale prices. This is based on sales of 6.6 billion pints a year, taken together with the results of surveys by local authority trading standards departments which show that 20 per cent. of pints were 100 per cent. liquid or more, 60 per cent. were between 95 per cent. and 99 per cent. liquid and 20 per cent. of pints were below 95 per cent. liquid.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when she will publish the conclusion of the Measures of Draught Beer and Cider: Consultation Paper on proposed legislative changes under the Weights and Measures Act 1985.  [41336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w21.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Currently, one pint of draught beer in five contains less than 95 per cent. liquid. The licensed trade's own voluntary guidelines recommend that a pint should not be less than 95 per cent. liquid, and that top-ups should be given if requested. But under existing laws trading standards officers can only act if beer drinkers are short-measured by at least 10 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20318w21.html_para5">Under proposals published today by my Department, bar staff will have to serve beer drinkers a minimum of 95 per cent. liquid in a pint, which is equivalent to an extra 60 million pints a year. Landlords who ignore the new regulations would be liable to prosecution for short-measure and would face &#163;1,000 fines. Persistent offenders would run the risk of losing their licence.
<P>

<a name="20318w21.html_para6">The Department has consulted widely with all the relevant bodies. It will now work closely with the beer trade to ensure that consumers are fully informed of their new rights. This will include pubs clearly displaying signs that consumers can ask for a top-up at no extra cost if they are not satisfied with their pint.
<P>

<a name="20318w21.html_para7">These proposals strike the right balance between delivering a better deal for consumers without damaging the brewing industry and hitting beer and cider drinkers with higher prices. The cost to the industry of serving 100 per cent. liquid would be &#163;95 million, which would have severe cost implications for smaller pubs with low profit margins.
<P>

<a name="20318w21.html_para8">The Department will now consult on draft regulations prior to bringing forward legislation and hopes to lay the legislation before the summer recess.

<P>

 As an equal opportunities employer, my Department aims to be fair to everyone and ensure that no eligible job applicant or employee receives less favourable treatment on the grounds of age. For example internal job applicants are not required to give details of their age nor does age appear on staff appraisal reports. The Department regularly monitors its personnel procedures, including by age, to identify any potential discrimination.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w22.html_spnew4"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 The area within 200 imperial miles of the Icelandic coast was selected as a convenient and identifiable area that accorded with the policy aim of the scheme to compensate former Icelandic water trawlermen following consultation with their leaders.

<P>
<a name="20318w22.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Department is undertaking a wide range of work looking at gender issues in particular sectors of the Department's business. We have commissioned research, consulted widely and published the outcomes on issues such as work and parents, flexible working, the national minimum wage, employment tribunals, women's employment and pay, work-life balance, fixed-term work, women entrepreneurs and issues surrounding women in science and IT.
<P>

<a name="20318w22.html_para2">My Department regularly consults with the Office for National Statistics and other government departments ensuring that data series provided by regular surveys such as the Labour Force Survey (LFS) provide us with opportunities for analyses by gender, race, disability and age. For example, we have recently published an analysis of women's scientific employment, also broken down by age (available on www2.set4women.gov.uk/set4women/ return/feedback.htm). In addition, services such as Business Link routinely capture detailed client characteristics, including gender and ethnicity.
<P>

<a name="20318w22.html_para3">My Department's policy is to consult widely and appropriately on its proposed legislation, using a variety of methods targeted to reach different stakeholders and audiences, including women's organisations. For example, we involved the Equal Opportunities Commission and Parents at Work in the Work and Parents Taskforce (which reported last year) as well as business and the trades unions.

However AMEC&#151;the UK contractor for the project&#151;has recently announced that for purely commercial reasons they have decided to withdraw from the project. ECGD therefore has no longer any reason to continue its consideration.

 I shall shortly be meeting representatives of the three UK transmission asset owners (The National Grid Company, Scottish Power and Scottish and Southern) as well as the Scottish Executive and Ofgem in order to discuss these issues.

 The recently published PB POWER report endorsed the option of an offshore hvdc link either as means of the bulk transfer of renewable energy to a suitable point on the existing transmission system, or as a means of addressing existing transmission constraints.

<a name="20318w23.html_para1">The report also recommended that a more detailed investigation of the feasibility of such a link should be part of a more general review of transmission system needs.

Management and unions from the site are members, and the Government are represented through the Government Office for the West Midlands. Advantage West Midlands is a key member and other members include both Local Authorities covering the area, the Employment Service, the SBS and the local Learning and Skills Council. A key function of the task group, set out in their terms of reference, is to identify all the potential sources of funding available and to develop a coordinated response to the needs of the company, the town and the surrounding areas.

 The Government want the UK to be the best place in the world to do business. To help achieve this we will eliminate unnecessary regulation and minimise the burdens imposed by regulation that is necessary. We have significantly strengthened the systems that control the regulatory burden. The Government have established the Better Regulation Task Force and the Ministerial Panel for Regulatory Accountability, appointed Ministers for Regulatory Reform in the main regulating Departments, and set up the Small Business Service to ensure that regulations do not impose unnecessary burdens.
<P>

<a name="20318w23.html_para7">In February we published the Regulatory Reform Action Plan&#151;setting out proposals for better regulation and reform across Whitehall, local government and health authorities.

These will benefit businesses, charities and the voluntary sector. It represents a good beginning, but Government will continue working to identify and bring forward proposals to reduce the overall regulatory burden.
<P>

<a name="20318w23.html_para8">The Government are working to ensure that similar disciplines and procedures are in place at European Union level.

<a name="20318w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 We have provided the police with strong new powers to deal with disorderly or excessively noisy licensed premises. Section 17 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which came into force on 1 December 2001, allows the police to close premises, instantly, for up to 24 hours where such problems are occurring. We expect the powers to have a deterrent effect and lead to a reduction in the incidence of violence and disorder on licensed premises, as well as providing the police with effective powers to deal with problems when they arise.
<P>

<a name="20318w25.html_para6">The White Paper "Time for Reform" (Cm 4696), published in April 2000, set out the Government's wider proposals for reforming and modernising licensing law.

The Government intend to bring forward legislation to implement the White Paper proposals as soon as parliamentary time permits.

 We made it clear in the White Paper 'Policing A new Century: A Blueprint for Reform' that we are concerned about the costs incurred in policing entertainment venues, pubs and clubs, and sporting venues where policing demands impact on policing in the area. We are keen to explore how we might encourage and develop arrangements under which entertainment venues make a contribution to the policing and public order costs generated by their activities.

<a name="20318w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 A package of measures to tackle alcohol-related crime and disorder were included in the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001. This includes new police powers to close disorderly or excessively noisy licensed premises, instantly, for up to 24 hours, and a toughening up of the law relating to drunkenness and disorder on licensed premises, and to under-age drinking. Working with the police and others, we shall keep the impact of these new measures, which came into force on 1 December 2001, under review as the basis for determining whether new or additional powers are required to assist the police and others in tackling crime and disorder on licensed premises.

<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2002 : Column 95W</I><P>
there are a number of categories for which prior entry clearance is mandatory for all nationals (apart from those exempt from immigration controls). A standard fee applicable world-wide is levied, according to entry category, by visa sections for each application for entry clearance. This is payable in local currency at the time the application is lodged. Administratively this is the most effective way of collecting and reconciling fee income. The entry clearance operation is self-financing and the fee therefore directly relates to the administration costs involved. None of the fee is received by the Polish Government.

 The Government continue to apply the principle that the law should be applied to criminal material on-line as it is to material off-line. The Government condemn those who produce race hate material including those who seek to distribute this material via the internet. The Public Order Act 1986 already deals with a range of material, which is threatening, abusive or insulting and intended or likely to stir up racial hatred and can be applied to material on the internet that falls within our jurisdiction. The Government have strengthened the provisions of the 1986 Act in amendments made by the Anti-terrorism, Crime & Security Act 2001. This means the maximum penalty for those inciting racial hatred has risen from two to seven years' imprisonment. It is also now an offence to incite racial hatred against a racial group abroad. We have asked the police and the Crown Prosecution Service to work together to pool knowledge and experience in the investigation and prosecution of race hate material.

<a name="20318w26.html_para3">The nature of the internet means that individual countries cannot counter this problem in isolation.

The Department will be using information on past pupils for statistical and research purposes only, and any disclosures will be for those purposes only. On this basis section 33 of the Data Protection Act allows personal data to be retained indefinitely.

 The following table shows estimated average prices paid by consumers for selected foods and the nearest equivalent average UK farmgate prices. The consumer prices reflect the price of imported foods as well as home-grown produce. They also reflect costs, value added and profit margins upstream from the farmgate.
<P>

<a name="20318w30.html_para1">All foods as purchased by consumers will differ to some extent from the ex-farm commodity. Milling wheat will be milled, mixed with other ingredients and further processed to produce bread; meat as retailed will have been de-boned, cut, trimmed of most fat and packaged; raw milk will be treated and fruit and vegetables will be graded and cleaned. These additional processes affect the validity of a direct comparison between the consumer and farmgate prices.

<P>
<a name="20318w31.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Due to decisions taken by the last Government prior to 1997 and to the low historic spend in this sector, the UK's share of the rural development budget (3.5 per cent.) is disproportionately low when compared with its share of agricultural land in the EU (12 per cent.) and with the range of environmental and other problems currently faced by the UK. I am sure that the hon. Member will appreciate that decisions by the last 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2002 : Column 117W</I><P>
Government placed us in a weak position but that this Government's stronger position within Europe puts us in a position to raise these issues again.
<P>

<a name="20318w31.html_para0">CAP reform and increasing the financial resources going towards rural development are key aims for this Government. The mid-term review of the CAP provides us with the opportunity to press hard, not only for increased funds to be made available for rural development, but also to ensure the UK receives a fairer share of these funds.

<P>

<a name="20318w31.html_para1">DEFRA conducts annual surveys of indigenous cereal foliar diseases. These data are made available by DEFRA and help industry identify where control measures, particularly fungicides are justified. Research on major cereal diseases is funded by DEFRA to underpin improved crop management with reduced dependence on fungicides.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the future payment of European Union subsidies to farmers in euros.  [42250]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w31.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government are committed to providing farmers with the option of receiving grant and subsidy payments in euro at the earliest practical opportunity, where they request this. We have considered the timing and practical requirements involved very carefully.
<P>

<a name="20318w31.html_para2">IT systems must be in place to deliver euro payments to farmers. A manual system, even to cope with a modest demand, would be extremely expensive and inefficient. In order to be able to make payments to farmers in euro as early as possible, the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has included euro capability in the design for all of its system development. The devolved Administrations have programmed in similar work, as all CAP paying agencies must be able to deliver at the same time.
<P>

<a name="20318w31.html_para3">The euro payment service for farmers is expected to be in place by the end of 2004 when RPA and the devolved Administrations have developed the necessary systems.
<P>

<a name="20318w31.html_para4">Once a system for direct payments in euro is available, it is likely that farmers would be asked to commit three months in advance and to sign up for a minimum of a year. That would be in line with the system the RPA is currently running for paying traders in euro where they request it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w31.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We are keen to see supermarkets stock more local produce. The issue of local sourcing has been discussed in meetings with individual supermarkets. Food from Britain, which we grant-aid, has also been encouraging the major supermarkets to introduce regional sourcing policies and most have done so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w31.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government assist the UK beekeeping sector to deal with bee health issues, in particular varroa, through programmes costing around &#163;1.6 million in 2001&#150;02. Under these measures, the National Bee Unit (NBU), part of the Central Science Laboratory, provides a free diagnostic and inspection service to beekeepers in England as well as training and advice (including various publications, lectures, workshops and demonstrations) to help them become more self-reliant through improved bee husbandry. Training and guidance is regularly updated to reflect the latest research findings. The NBU also carries out routine screening for varroa resistant to authorised treatments.
<P>

<a name="20318w31.html_para5">Varroa is widely distributed in England. At least 5,000 infested apiaries have been confirmed since 1992, when the mite was first confirmed in the UK.

<P>

<a name="20318w31.html_para8">New EU-wide measures (implemented domestically under the Processed Animal Protein Regulations from 1 August 2001) already control intra-Community trade and imports from third countries of a wide range of processed animal proteins, effectively preventing their inclusion in feed for farmed animals in order to stop the propagation of BSE.
<P>

<a name="20318w31.html_para9">In Great Britain, a national feed sampling programme has been in place since 1996 to monitor compliance with BSE-related feed controls. This programme, operated by the State Veterinary Service, typically takes around 20,000 samples per year from feed mills, on-farm mixers and other premises handling livestock feed. The results of the programme are very encouraging and indicate wide compliance with the feed controls, confirming that prohibited ingredients (from domestic or imported sources) are being effectively removed from the market, distribution channels and farms.
<P>

<a name="20318w31.html_para10">Of the 78,202 samples recorded to 6 March 2002 inclusive, 78,001 (99.74 per cent.) tested negative for prohibited proteins. The remaining 201 samples tested either positive or inconclusive. The SVS carry out a full on-site investigation to identify the cause of each positive or inconclusive result. A positive result does not necessarily indicate a breach of the feed ban as the testing mechanism detects the presence of some proteins in feed even where the presence of the protein product is lawful.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what investigation she has made of the cost of corrosion damage to water providers in <i>(a)</i> fluoridated and <i>(b)</i> unfluoridated areas.  [42973]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w33.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The maximum permitted concentration of all fluoride in public water supplies is 1.5 mg per litre of water. The effects of public water supplies on water companies' pipes are normally measured by the water's pH although there are other factors. In general, the lower the pH value, the higher the level of corrosion. Legislation specifies two compounds of fluorine which water companies may add to public supplies at the request of area health authorities. The compound that companies would normally add is hexafluorosilic acid. This is a corrosive substance and care must be exercised when it is delivered, in bulk, to water treatment works. There is, however, no measurable change in the pH of fluoridated or unfluoridated water, on leaving the treatment works, and therefore no reason to suspect that fluoridated water is more or less corrosive in the distribution system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Our approach and commitment to sustainable woodland management is set out in the 1998 UK Forestry Standard. The England Forestry Strategy describes our priorities and programmes for forestry in England. Our aim is to ensure that all of England's woodlands are sustainably managed. We give advice to private woodland owners to encourage them to manage their woodlands sustainably and support for this is given through the Woodland Grant Scheme. All applications for assistance under this scheme must meet the criteria set out in the UK Forestry Standard.
<P>

<a name="20318w33.html_para0">The Forestry Commission has been awarded the World Wide Fund for Nature's Gift to the Earth Award in recognition of the key role they played in progressing independent certification of sustainable forest management in the UK through development and delivery of the UK Woodland Assurance Standard. The UK is the only country where the entire state forest area has achieved credible certification to an independent standard recognised by the Forestry Stewardship Council.
<P>

<a name="20318w33.html_para1">We recognise the need to monitor UK woodland and to take corrective action when necessary. The UK Forestry Standard explains how we will achieve this through a combination of scientific study and national surveys. We are committed to publishing results and to continue developing the Standard in the light of experience.

 The Government assist the UK beekeeping sector by funding a range of measures to protect bee health, costing around &#163;1.6 million in 2001&#150;02. In England, the bee health programme costs some &#163;1.3 million annually, and is administered by the National Bee Unit (NBU), part of the Central Science Laboratory.
<P>

<a name="20318w35.html_para0">European foul brood (EFB) is a notifiable disease under the Bee Diseases Control Order 1982. All new suspected cases have to be reported. In 2001, 816 colonies in 350 apiaries in England were found to be infected with EFB. Colonies too heavily infected to respond to treatment are destroyed. Lightly infected colonies are treated with antibiotic by field inspectors of the NBU.
<P>

<a name="20318w35.html_para1">In addition, NBU has been conducting trials for the long-term control of the disease without the need for destruction of bees. The results to date are encouraging.

 The promotion of locally produced British honey is a matter for the industry itself. However, honey producers are able to benefit form the trade development and marketing services provided by the regional food groups which the Department supports through Food from Britain. Honey producers may also be eligible for grants under the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP). Two measures are of particular relevance to them. These are the Rural Enterprise Scheme measure on the marketing of quality agricultural products, which provides largely non-capital grants for marketing initiatives, and the Processing and Marketing Grant which provides capital grants for processing and marketing facilities. These grants are run competitively on a regional basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what steps her Department has taken in the last five years to destroy honey that has been found to have a significant risk of being contaminated by antibiotics and other dangerous substances;  [42380]

<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w35.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 All consignments of products of animal origin, including honey, currently imported from third countries into the UK are subjected to a documentary check of the veterinary certification and an identity check to match the goods to the certification. A percentage of consignments are also subjected to a physical check, which may include organoleptic checks, temperature checks and laboratory tests for pathogens or contaminants. In the case of honey 50 per cent. of consignments are so checked.
<P>

<a name="20318w35.html_para3">Where import checks reveal that any product of animal origin does not comply with Community import conditions it is rejected or destroyed. Figures relating to products destroyed are not kept centrally.
<P>

<a name="20318w35.html_para4">The Veterinary Medicines Directorate has been sampling honey on sale since 1995. No samples contained residues of antibiotics or other substances which posed a significant risk to consumers. Therefore, no honey was required to be destroyed. All results have been reported in the VMD Annual Report on Residue Surveillance and its quarterly newsletter, MAVIS.
<P>

<a name="20318w35.html_para5">Following a recent European Commission inspection visit to China, which revealed concerns about antibiotic residues, the EU has banned the importation of all animal products from China with effect from 13 March 2002. As a result the FSA carried out tests on a number of samples of Chinese and blended honey on sale in the UK. They found that most contained antibiotic residues, but at a level which scientific experts do not consider poses a risk to public health.

 The Department's Greening Government website provides advice to both civil servants and suppliers on a whole range of environmental issues including the use of refrigerants. The Green Guide for Buyers for example calls for the specification of systems free of refrigerants that deplete the ozone layer and, where it is safe, cost effective and technically feasible to do so, also free of substances that have a high global warming potential. The website has been widely promoted at conferences and in journals. It's URL is "http://defraweb/ environment/greening/gghome.htm".

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 18 March 2002]:</i> The UK Government's interpretation of Article 1 of EC Regulation 2037&#150;2000 is that it sets out the scope of the legislation and lists the substances that it controls, as well as making clear that it applies to the production, importation, exportation, placing on the market, use, recovery, recycling and reclamation and destruction of these substances. This includes those used for the blowing of insulating foam for refrigeration equipment and to certain activities relating to products and equipment containing those substances.

 Operational responsibility for flood management measures rests with the local operating authorities, normally the Environment Agency (EA) and local councils, who decide which projects to promote and their timing.

 The Government are maintaining close links with the insurance industry to help achieve the mutual aim of ensuring the continued availability of affordable flood cover as widely as possible after the end of the year.

<P>

<a name="20318w36.html_para0">Together with the flood defence operating authorities, we are reducing the risk of flooding and are communicating this to the insurance industry. We are reducing the risk through substantial increases in investment in flood and coastal defences (which now totals over &#163;400 million a year).

<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w37.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Steen: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will remove the interim measures on the movement and sale of cattle and sheep in Devon.  [43509]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w37.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 March 2002]:</i> The Interim rules for livestock movements, which my noble Friend, the Lord Whitty announced on 5 February 2002, allow greater flexibility for farmers to move their animals. However, there is a low but very real risk that there are still hidden pockets of live virus on a few premises or circulating at a low level in a handful of sheep flocks. This could be reactivated if animals are under stress, for example during lambing, so precautionary controls need to be kept in place.
<P>

<a name="20318w37.html_para0">A copy of the Veterinary Basis for the Interim measures has been placed in the Libraries of the House and is available on the DEFRA website. The measures are expected to remain in operation until November 2002. However, we expect to be able to relax some aspects of the regime during the course of the year if there is no further outbreak.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the maximum time period sheep can be held on board a ship during a live transport is.  [42128]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w37.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 March 2002]:</i> Ships used to transport live sheep must comply with Directive 91/628/EEC, as amended, on the protection of animals during transport. The vessel must be fitted to carry livestock, with access to feed and water and meet required space allowances. If these conditions are met the statutory maximum journey times do not apply. There is therefore no maximum time period that sheep may be held on board a ship during transport, provided they are not caused injury or unnecessary suffering. Time spent by a livestock vehicle on a roll-on roll-off ferry counts towards the statutory maximum journey time.

 At the time of the announcement, it was estimated that some 4 million households in England would be eligible for the new home energy efficiency scheme (HEES)&#151;households with children in receipt of an income-related benefit and people receiving a disability benefit. Around 3.7 million households were estimated to be eligible for New HEES Plus&#151;for people aged 60 or over who receive an income-related benefit.

 We are taking determined steps to combat internal fraud. We have published an internal fraud policy that sets out staff responsibilities, and appointed a senior accountable officer and a supporting central probity team. There are also security specialists and staff to investigate suspected internal fraud vigorously when it arises. We know that the overwhelming majority of staff are completely honest and trustworthy, and instances of internal fraud are not common, but we remain vigilant. We employ our 100,000 staff so these cases represent a small fraction of our work force.

 367 of the 409 local authorities administering housing benefit use the official "Do Not Redirect" scheme representing 90 per cent. of the total.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20318w38.html_spnew8"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Invalid care allowance and retirement pension are both benefits intended to maintain income. Rules exist to prevent the duplicate payment of more than one benefit intended for the same basic purpose. Where a person already entitled to invalid care allowance reaches pension age and becomes entitled to retirement pension, the payment of retirement pension, a contributory benefit, 



<P>
<P><I>18 Mar 2002 : Column 148W</I><P>
takes precedence and either extinguishes or reduces the payment of invalid care allowance. Underlying entitlement to ICA is retained, which provides low income carers with access to the carer premium paid with the minimum income guarantee.
<P>

<a name="20318w38.html_para6">Invalid care allowance has always been subject to these rules. We have no plans at present to change this. However, in light of the National Carers Strategy, the Government have introduced a draft order proposing to remove the ICA age restriction, thus allowing carers aged 65 and over access to ICA and therefore the carer premium. The proposal will provide the opportunity for low income carers in this group to boost their income on top of the minimum income guarantee.

 We have been considering carefully the terms of the judgment, which confirmed that term-time workers are not eligible for Jobseeker's Allowance. A change in the law to extend eligibility to term-time workers would not necessarily be appropriate, given that Jobseeker's Allowance is intended to support those who are out of work and looking for a job rather than those in employment. We shall nevertheless continue to consider this matter, in the light of the judgment and other possible means of support.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2002]:</i> Information is available only on the number of people who received winter fuel payments. Details of the number of recipients in winters 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01, broken down by sex and constituency, have been placed in the Library.

<a name="20318w39.html_para3">The figures for 1999&#150;2000 exclude men aged 60&#150;64 (and a small number of others) who became eligible for winter fuel payments from 2000&#150;01 onwards. These people are entitled to claim retrospectively for previous years and the majority have already done so. Unfortunately it is not possible to relate these claims to specific years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, pursuant to his answer of 23 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 851&#150;52W, on stolen equipment, what criminal proceedings have been undertaken for cases of theft against his Department, stating in each case <i>(a)</i> whether the proceedings (i) led to a criminal conviction and (ii) were unsuccessful, <i>(b)</i> the cost incurred by his Department in pursuing a conviction and <i>(c)</i> the value of items recovered; and if he will make a statement.

 The Department does not hold centrally information regarding criminal proceedings, or any follow-up actions, which have been undertaken in cases of theft against the Department. Any incident of break-in is always referred to the police for investigation.

 Occupational pension schemes are provided voluntarily by employers, and they are therefore free to decide whether to continue to provide such pensions in the future. The legislation that is in place is to ensure that the pension rights that individuals have already built up in schemes are protected.
<P>

<a name="20318w40.html_para8"> Accounting rules are the responsibility of the Accounting Standards Board which is independent of Government. The Government have already announced proposals to replace the minimum funding requirement (MFR) with a long-term scheme specific funding standard in the context of a regime of transparency and disclosure, with additional measures to strengthen security. This will be taken forward as soon as parliamentary time is available. Meanwhile the Government announced a package of changes on 26 February to improve the way the MFR operates in the period leading up to its replacement, and increase protection for pension scheme members where an employer decides to wind a scheme up voluntarily.
<P>

<a name="20318w40.html_para9"> We have asked Alan Pickering and Ron Sandler, in two separate studies to review the regulation and operation of the pensions, and the wider market of savings products, including final salary schemes. Alan Pickering will report, with recommendations for reform, in June and Ron Sandler will also report around that time.
<P>

<a name="20318w40.html_para10"> The Government will then set out its proposals, which will build on the reforms put in place since 1998, and on which it will consult, to simplify the regulatory system, to look at how the Government and employers encourage and support pension savings, and to make sure that the most appropriate incentives for savings in retirement are in place.
<P>

<a name="20318w40.html_para11"> We have already announced last month an interim package of measures to improve the way the minimum funding requirement works, which will reduce compliance costs for employers with defined benefit pension schemes.

<a name="20318w41.html_para6">The decision of the Court of Appeal in the recent case of A <i>v.</i> London borough of Lambeth, which considered the provision of accommodation under section 17 of the Children Act 1989, casts doubt upon the ability of councils with social services responsibilities to provide accommodation to children in need and their families. This judgment does not affect local authorities' powers to provide other services under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 that they deem appropriate in order to meet a child's needs, for example day care, nor does it have any impact on children being looked after by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20318w41.html_para7">It is, and has long been, our policy that councils with social services responsibilities should have the power to provide accommodation under section 17 of the Children Act 1989 where they feel that this is the appropriate way to meet the child's needs and where no other support is available. We therefore wish to restore the position so that this important safety net is available for all families. I announced on 17 January 2002 during the special standing committee on the Adoption and Children Bill that we intend to introduce amendments to the Children Act 1989 by way of the Adoption and Children Bill to make clear that accommodation may be provided by councils with social services responsibilities under section 17.

 The Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA) report on folic acid and the prevention of disease (2000) noted that fortification of flour with folic acid might result in a reduction in the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD, especially strokes and heart attacks).
<P>

<a name="20318w42.html_para11">In otherwise healthy people, an increased blood level of homocysteine is associated with increased risk of CVD. Studies have shown that low intakes of folate are an important cause of increased homocysteine level in the general population and increasing folate intake can reduce homocysteine level. However, whether there is a causal relationship between folic acid intake and cardiovascular disease still requires confirmation. There are on-going randomised controlled trials assessing the impact of lowering homocysteine levels (by increasing folic acid intake) on incidence of heart disease.
<P>

<a name="20318w42.html_para12">In 1998, the COMA report on the nutritional aspects of cancer concluded that there was insufficient evidence for any specific links between folate intake and the development of cancer.
