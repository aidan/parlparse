 The economic analysis and projections set out in the Treasury paper on Trend Growth, published alongside the Budget in April 2002, imply a contribution from net migration of about 0.4 percentage points towards the 2&#190; per cent. annual trend rate of output growth. Subsequent updates have not changed this.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w01.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government are already making extensive use of the tax system to encourage energy-efficient housing. We have introduced a reduced rate of 5 per cent. VAT for certain contractor-installed energy-saving materials, and grant-funded installation of central heating systems, heating appliances, factory-insulated hot water tanks, micro-CHP and renewable energy heating systems. The HM Treasury/DEFRA consultation on the use of economic instruments to promote household energy efficiency closed on 24 October 2003. The Government received 126 responses, and published a summary of responses on the Treasury web site on 11 December. Responses are being carefully considered as part of the Government's development of policy in this area. In the pre-Budget Report (Cm 6042), the Government announced that we believe that there is a case for further use of economic instruments as part of a package of measures to promote energy efficiency.

: The current scale of the UK trade deficit needs to be viewed in perspective. In recent years, the UK economy has been growing faster than many of our key trade partners, particularly those in the Euro area, so boosting our trade deficit. Nevertheless, the UK's trade and current account deficits have remained well below previous peaks.

<P>
24. <a name="40129w01.html_wqn4"><B> Keith Vaz: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the supervision of banks by the Financial Services Authority.  [151566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 As the right hon. Gentleman is aware, responsibility for the supervision of banks moved from the Bank of England to the Financial Services Authority on 1 June 1998. The legislative framework for the regulation of banks was subsequently reformed under the Financial Services and Markets Act, which came into effect on 1 December 2001. The regime for prudential supervision of banks is kept under constant review, both at home and internationally, in forums such as the European Union and the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision.

<P>
<a name="40129w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Letwin: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the level of gross administrative expenditure in central government as a proportion of total managed expenditure was for <i>(a)</i> 1996&#150;97 and <i>(b)</i> 2003&#150;04. [R]  [145608]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 The most appropriate measure of comparison between this year and 1996&#150;97 is for planned expenditure on central administration as a percentage of total government spending, using the measures available at the time. This yields a figure which is 4.4 per cent. for 2003&#150;4 and falling in future years, against a planned 4.9 per cent. in 1996&#150;97. We cannot yet compare final out-turns because figures are not yet available for this year but, based on previous years' experience, we would expect this year's out-turn to be lower than the 4.6 per cent. of total government spending out-turn figure for 1996&#150;97.

 The Treasury monitors regional housing market developments, and from time to time reports on them.

 The White Paper, The Future of Air Transport, reflects the overarching perspective of the Northern Ireland administration on the key issues surrounding the development of air transport within the United Kingdom, as they affect Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland administration's input to the production of the White Paper reflected the cross-cutting and inter-departmental character of the issues previously consulted on during 2002. A senior official from the Northern Ireland Civil Service was a member, together with representatives from other regions and the Department for Transport, of the steering group that produced the White Paper. The implications of the White Paper for Northern Ireland's three commercial airports are currently being considered locally and in consultation with the Department for Transport within the 'balanced approach' of economic development, people's desire to travel, environmental impact, safety and security and the continuation of air services to the major London airports.

 The phased introduction of Digital Hearing Aids (DHAs) commenced in October 2003. Information on the provision of hearing aids is not collected routinely by the Department. Health and Social Services Trusts with Audiology departments will shortly be asked to provide information on the provision of DHAs for the period October 2003 to the end of January. Information will thereafter be collected on a quarterly basis.

 There has only ever been one application to grow GM crops in Northern Ireland. This was made in 1996 by the Department of Agriculture to carry out a small field-trial on potatoes. This application was dealt with through the regulatory process established under the Genetically Modified Organisms (Northern Ireland) Order 1991 and the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1994.

This typically occurs if the vacancy has arisen in what was previously a single-handed GP Practice. Otherwise the remaining GPs within the practice, as independent contractors, advertise and fill the position independently.

 Belfast City Airport operates under a planning agreement, which governs operations, including flight hours, at the airport. The main elements controlling flight hours are: "permitted hours" between 6.30 am and 9.30 pm for normal scheduled operations; "extended hours" between 9.30 pm and 11.59 pm for delayed scheduled operations; and, "prohibited hours" between 9.30 pm and 6.30 am, which prohibits scheduled operations. During the calendar year 2003, six scheduled flights, four arrivals and two departures, used the airport between 12 midnight and 12.30 am during the "prohibited hours".

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on what basis SEELB provides a greater number of funded pre-school places to the statutory nursery school sector than to the private/voluntary sector in Newtownards; and for what reason the playschool at Londonderry Primary School has not attracted any funded places.  [149612]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w05.html_spnew0"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 In Newtownards there are currently 234 pre-school places in statutory nurseries and 136 in settings in the voluntary and private sector. Of these, 52 statutory places and all of the voluntary and private places were created by the Pre-school Education Expansion Programme. The planning of pre-school provision and the allocation of voluntary/private sector places is a matter for each Board's Pre-School Education Advisory Group (PEAG), which identifies shortfalls in funded pre-school provision at local area level. The intention was that new places created under the programme for Northern Ireland as a whole would be broadly on a 50:50 basis between the statutory and voluntary/private sectors, though at local level the ratio varies considerably, depending mainly on the level of provision prior to the programme. In Newtownards, most of the statutory provision pre-dated the expansion programme.
<P>

<a name="40129w05.html_para0">The number of pre-school places which the South Eastern Education and Library Board's PEAG is funding in Newtownards is already sufficient to satisfy the demand from the parents of children in their

 In June 2003 the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety set up a Northern Ireland SARS Taskforce charged, inter alia, with preparing a contingency Plan for SARS in Northern Ireland. This in turn led to the establishment of eight sub-groups drawn from the HPSS to take forward various aspects of SARS preparation and these groups reported to a Conference in Belfast on 8 December at which the Contingency Plan was also launched. A tabletop exercise, to test the Plan, was held the following day and the lessons learned from that will be incorporated into the Plan at the next reprint.

Since its inception the scheme has enabled 17,500 participants to gain a foothold on the property ladder through its equity-sharing scheme, over 13,000 of whom eventually moved to full home ownership.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w06.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Department's annual influenza immunisation campaign is the main element of its programme to minimise any winter influenza outbreak. There are two main groups involved in the campaign: everyone over 65 and those under 65 who are considered to be at risk because of an underlying medical condition such as asthma, diabetes, a heart condition etc. The Department has proactively promoted immunisation this year with a particular focus on those 'at risk', including children. Figures on vaccination uptake to the end of November show that the campaign is ahead of the targets set for this year.
<P>

<a name="40129w06.html_para3">This year also the Department has regularly reminded the public of measures to protect themselves from influenza and of the steps to take to look after themselves should they develop it.
<P>

<a name="40129w06.html_para4">The Communicable Disease Surveillance Centre (CDSC) at Belfast City Hospital monitors the incidence of influenza through a network of spotter practices and provides information directly to the Department. The assessment provided by CDSC in the middle of January 2004 is that influenza is circulating at very low levels in Northern Ireland. Boards and Trusts all have plans in place to deal with upsurges in the numbers of cases of flu, should this occur.

<a name="40129w06.html_para5">In 2003 the Department secured a small supply of a new anti-viral drug called Oseltamivir which can be administered, in the event of a serious outbreak, to patients and staff in nursing homes, residential homes and hospitals to prevent them catching the flu.

 All applications for driving licences are subject to the same requirements in relation to age, health competency and identity. A wide range of identity documentation can be produced as evidence of identity in support of an application for a photocard driving licence and most would not indicate the residency status of the applicant. It is therefore not possible to determine what proportion of applicants were asylum seekers.

 We have no plans to introduce a statutory requirement for pensioners to be able to travel free on public transport during off-peak hours. The current statutory minimum requirement for concessionary travel in England introduced in 2001 ensures half fares for pensioners on local buses, with a free pass. From April 2003, we have extended concessionary travel schemes to men aged 60&#150;64, bringing them into line with women of the same age. Local authorities may make more generous provision, including free travel, at their discretion.

 <i>[holding answer 26 January 2004]:</i> The number of cancers in England, excluding non-melanoma skin cancer, increased by 6.9 per cent. between 1995 and 2000. This is mostly accounted for by increases in breast cancer, prostate cancer, testicular cancer, bowel cancer, melanoma, mesothelioma and lymphomas. However, this should be balanced against significant decreases in the numbers of lung, stomach and cervical cancers.
<P>

<a name="40129w07.html_para4">There are many reasons for the changes in incidence of these cancers.
<P>

<a name="40129w07.html_para5">The increased incidence of breast cancer can be attributed not only to the success of the national breast screening programme in identifying new cases, but also 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2004 : Column 471W</I><P>
changes in factors that affect a woman's hormonal environment, such as obesity, use of hormone replacement therapy and differing patterns of child birth. The increase in reporting of prostate cancer is primarily due to the greater use of prostate specific antigen testing. Increased incidence of melanoma is due to greater over-exposure to sunlight. The increased number of bowel cancer cases is partly due to diet and lack of physical activity. For mesothelioma, the increase is due to the increased numbers of people exposed to asbestos in the 1960s and 1970s who, because of the long latency period of the disease, are only now developing this condition. The reasons for increased cases of testicular cancer and lymphomas are unclear.
<P>

<a name="40129w07.html_para6">The decrease in lung cancer incidence is due to reduced rates of smoking in men over the last two decades. The reduction in stomach cancer is primarily thought to be due to changes in diet. The reduction in the number of cases of cervical cancer is almost certainly due to the national screening programme identifying abnormalities which, left untreated, would later become cancerous.

<a name="40129w07.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 We recognise that a causative link between early cannabis use and later development of schizophrenia is not conclusively proven. However, the recent epidemiological research on the issue of earlier use of cannabis and risk of later development of schizophrenia, 'schizophrenic symptoms' and 'schizophreniform disorder' has shown a stronger association than was previously evident from published studies. The British Medical Journal editorial accompanying the publication of the key research papers concluded that:

 The Government have no plans to introduce a new definition of dual diagnosis into statute. Under the draft Mental Health Bill it is

proposed that there will be a single definition of mental disorder with no exceptions or exclusions, so that people can be treated according to their individual needs.
<P>

<a name="40129w08.html_para1">Under the current Mental Health Act 1983 a person cannot be treated as being mentally disordered (for the purposes of the Act) solely on the ground that he is dependent on alcohol or drugs, there must be dual diagnosis of a mental illness. We believe that, in practice, these exemptions have been misunderstood and misapplied. This has meant that some people have not received the compulsory treatment which they need to prevent them from harming themselves or others.
<P>

<a name="40129w08.html_para2">The intention of proposals in the draft Mental Health Bill is that strict conditions will ensure the powers are only used where the nature or degree of mental disorder requires treatment under the care of a mental health consultant; appropriate treatment is available for the individual patient and there is a risk to self or others that warrants such treatment. This will mean that there is no artificial barrier to people being treated under compulsory powers when this is necessary because the conditions in the Bill are satisfied.

<a name="40129w08.html_para3">In May 2002 the Department of Health published Dual Diagnosis Good Practice Guide.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to the answer of 20 November 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1200W, how far in terms of linear distance badger culling extended from the buildings in reactive areas which housed cattle which were reported as TB reactors.  [150489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Reactive culling attempted to remove badger social groups whose territories impinged on those parts of cattle premises where infected reactor cattle were housed or grazed, or from which their forage had been harvested. The extent of such removal operations varied depending on the outcome of badger activity surveys and local badger density. On average culling areas extended about 1 km around implicated land/buildings and was in the order of 5 km <sup>2</sup> .
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w10.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what factors determine the placing of badger traps in order to maximise the success of badger culling operations within the context of the Krebs trials; where traps have had to be repositioned to more discrete locations as a result of interference; whether that has required their positioning in sub-optimal locations; and what effect that has had on the conduct and the success of the culling operations.  [150493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Standard operating procedures for the Krebs Trial as ratified by the Independent Scientific Group advise on number and location for trap sites; saturation trapping on setts being the preferred procedure. Traps are located at other sites where consistent anti-Trial interference or denial of consent renders trapping at sites impossible. The impact of varying trap locations is unknown.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 8 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 210W, on badgers, what measures can be taken to reduce the risk to badger cubs inhabiting the same sett as an infectious female suckling badger from infection from <i>M. bovis</i> bacilli.  [150548]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Practical measures that could be used to prevent the possibility of an infectious lactating female from infecting her cubs have not yet been identified.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 8 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 210W, what her estimate is of the typical proportion of badger faeces and urine deposited in latrines from a given social group; what proportion is distributed more generally over grassland; and what risk of <i>M. bovis</i> infection these deposits present to grazing cattle.  [150550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Work carried out by Bristol University suggests that the proportion of faeces and urine deposited at latrines vary with badger density. The proportion of latrines located in different habitats is the subject of current research at the Central Science Laboratory, the results of which will be published in due course.
<P>

<a name="40129w10.html_para2">The majority of cattle actively avoid eating grass contaminated with badger faeces but tend not to select against grass contaminated with badger urine. Since most faeces tend to be deposited in latrines, which are often large and obvious, while urinations tend to trail onto pasture, infected badger urine at pasture might pose a greater transmission risk than infected faeces. However, there is likely to be some risk of onward transmission wherever either infectious faeces or urine are present on land grazed by cattle.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w10.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 10 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 522W, on badgers, what evidence there is that viable <i>M. bovis</i> bacilli remaining in badger setts following the culling of infected denizens can transmit the disease to healthy badgers which subsequently colonise those setts.  [150567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 <i>M. bovis</i> survival is promoted by low levels of sunlight, low to moderate temperatures and high relative humidity. A typical badger sett experiences 100 per cent. relative humidity at all times of year, a fairly constant temperature, which is always higher than ambient temperature and almost total darkness. Hence, although no quantitative studies have been carried out, it seems possible that <i>M. bovis</i> bacilli could remain viable in badger setts long enough to infect badgers during recolonisation.

<a name="40129w10.html_para3">For comparison, <i>M. bovis</i> has survived in manure for up to two years when buried at 5 cm deep, and for one year when buried 1 cm deep. On pasture, <i>M. bovis</i> has survived for five to 11 months.

<a name="40129w10.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the proportion of cubs born to infectious sow badgers which themselves go on to develop TB with the potential to spread to other animals; and what assessment she has made of whether this poses a significant threat to <i>(a)</i> other badgers and <i>(b)</i> cattle.  [150578]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Transmission of infection between infectious females and their offspring is thought to be an important process in the dynamics of TB in badger populations. The Central Science Laboratory's Woodchester Park study has shown that there is a significant statistical relationship between the number of infected cubs in a social group and the presence of an infectious female. However, no assessment has been made of the proportion of cubs born to infectious females which themselves go on to become infectious.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 8 December 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 217W, what warnings were given by her officials to farmers who were asked to volunteer for participation in the Krebs trials about <i>(a)</i> the risks involved in participation and <i>(b)</i> the consequences of failure of all or any part of the trials.  [150582]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The signing up of landowners agreeing to voluntary participation in the trial was carried out according to a Standard Operation Procedure ratified by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB. Information on the Government's TB strategy and on the Culling Trial in particular was available in the form of fact sheets, website pages and reports from the Krebs and Bourne Groups. The basis for the Randomised Badger Culling Trial was well documented and communicated to participants by trained staff at the time of their voluntary agreement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There have been no confirmed outbreaks of bovine tuberculosis in East Yorkshire since before January 1996. There are currently no farms under TB restrictions.
<P>

<a name="40129w11.html_para1">Defra is shortly to launch a public consultation on a new TB Strategy for England, which will include proposals for a range of potential measures for introduction in the short-term. These are designed to halt the geographical spread of the disease, and include pre and post-movement testing of cattle and a review of local testing frequencies. One of the major concerns of the consultation is to reduce the risk of spreading TB from areas of high incidence to areas with little or no disease.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w11.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Paterson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to standardise the collation of data on bovine TB in a format which allows for a comparison with the Office International des Epizootics figures for incidence of TB; what she estimates the costs of so doing would be; and what assessment she has made of the merits of so doing.  [150510]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Bovine TB is a regional problem with a higher incidence of disease in the South West of Great Britain and in Northern Ireland. Defra publishes the incidence of TB in Great Britain on a regional basis, to demonstrate the regional distribution of incidents. The OIE requires a composite annual report for the whole of the United Kingdom. The composite report indicates the average incidence of TB in the UK; but does not demonstrate the localised incidence within the regions. The composite report which is provided each year, as required for the OIE, is derived by amalgamating the regional reports for GB and Northern Ireland, therefore there would be no cost benefit in providing only a UK report and the true regional incidence of the disease would remain unclear.
<P>

<a name="40129w11.html_para2">In Great Britain there is an obligation under Council Directive 64/432/EEC and other Directives to provide the European Commission with herd and animal incidence figures for bovine TB every year in the prescribed format.

range of <i>M. bovis</i> is in respect of cattle; and whether some badgers suffering from bovine TB are capable of excreting sufficient numbers of <i>M. bovis</i> bacilli to constitute such an infective dose.  [150526]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Determination of the minimum infectious dose of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> in cattle is part of the TB pathogenesis research programme. Early indications are that the minimum infectious dose for cattle via the respiratory tract is relatively small; the lowest infectious dose recorded so far is 70 colony forming units (CPU) when introduced by the intracheal route or 9,600 CPU by the intranasal route.
<P>

<a name="40129w11.html_para3">Relatively high levels of <i>M. bovis</i> in the urine of badgers with renal TB have been identified. Bacterial loads of up to 300,000 CPU per millilitre of urine have been measured. This suggests that inhalation of as little as 0.03 ml of the urine could result in infection.

Statistics on the disability profile of the civil service as a whole from April 2003 show that 3.6 per cent. of the civil service overall had a declared disability (1.7 per cent. in the SCS). Corporate data on disability by disability type is not published. Further data can be found on www.civil-service.gov.uk/statistics. The civil service anonymous Diversity Survey (2001) showed that 15 per cent. of respondents were declaring a disability or long-standing illness against a declared level of 4 per cent. staff with a disability. This could show that disabled staff are more likely to take part in the survey, or that many people who consider themselves to be disabled or have a long standing illness have not declared this to their employer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what cuts in trade distorting support and export subsidies will result from the reforms of the common agricultural policy agreed at the Agriculture Council of the EU in June 2003.  [149108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w11.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The CAP reform agreement will substantially reduce trade distorting support as a result of the decoupling of direct payments. There is a degree of national discretion over the extent of decoupling but we anticipate that EU Blue Box support (defined as subsidies deemed less trade-distorting because they are linked to production-limiting programmes such as set-aside, e.g. arable area and livestock headage payments) will fall by at least two-thirds. Amber box support (defined as subsidies which significantly distort trade, e.g. support prices) is estimated to fall by a modest amount due to reductions in support prices and declines in production as a result of decoupling. However, amber box subsidies have already been falling substantially due to the previous Agenda 2000 reforms.
<P>

<a name="40129w11.html_para8">Both decoupling and reductions in support prices will reduce export subsidies, but the precise impact will depend on future conditions on world markets and on the exchange rate.

: The Government are committed to help develop a farming industry which is environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. The Government's Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food (SFFS), published in December 2002 sets out how the Government will work with the whole of the food chain to secure a sustainable future for English farming and food industries, as viable industries contributing to a better environment and healthy and prosperous communities.
<P>

<a name="40129w12.html_para1">One of the strategy's key aims is to protect the environment and reward farmers for providing environmental goods. Last year's agreement on CAP reform will help further this objective by removing an incentive to overproduce. In addition, the cross compliance measures to be introduced as part of the agreement will help farmers to reduce damaging environmental impacts by making farm subsidies dependent on meeting good agricultural and environmental conditions. The CAP reform deal also provided for the switching of support from production subsidies to environmental and rural development schemes. In England, we have been running a pilot Entry Level Scheme designed to link key elements of good environmental management across a wider area than the current schemes. Provided that the pilot is successful, the scheme will be made available across England during 2005.
<P>

<a name="40129w12.html_para2">Defra is also carrying out a strategic review of options to reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture, and will be consulting further on this in the near future.
<P>

<a name="40129w12.html_para3">The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000) provides protection for wildlife and their habitats and sets out comprehensive statutory protection for all species and habitats. All wild birds are afforded statutory protection under the 1981 Act, which fulfils our obligations under the EC Wild Birds Directive. Certain animals and plants are also protected under the 1981 Act. In addition to the protection given to certain animals by the 1981 Act, further protection is also granted to certain species via the Habitats Regulations 1994.
<P>

<a name="40129w12.html_para4">Furthermore, England's Biodiversity Strategy builds on the foundations already laid in conserving habitats and species and aims to go further by ensuring that the implications for wildlife as a whole are considered an integral part of agriculture policy. The strategy encourages the management of farming and agricultural land so as to conserve and enhance biodiversity as part of SFFS.
<P>

<a name="40129w12.html_para5">Also as part of the SFFS, an outline Animal Health and Welfare Strategy for Great Britain was published for consultation in July 2003. The strategy sets out the direction for animal health and welfare related policy over the next 10 years. It aims to improve the health and welfare of kept animal, and protect public health from animal disease. The strategy is underpinned by the principle of partnership between government and all those involved in and affected by animal health and welfare. It sets out the factors that will help inform Government decisions and the rationale for

 In 2003 fishing vessels using single trawl gears caught a much wider range of species than those using pair trawl gears.

We support the negotiating position taken by the European Commission on behalf of the EU, and we call upon the Russian Government to respond positively to the points raised by the Commission on our behalf. We also call upon the Russian Government to address the issues that have been identified by their WTO Accession Working Party as material to the readiness and ability of Russia to implement WTO rules upon accession. Since December 2000, the UK has provided &#163;1.2 million worth of technical assistance to Russia to support their efforts to accede to the WTO.

It is too early to consider what specific celebrations will mark the Diamond Jubilee but London 2012 will consider what links could be made should we stage the Games.

<a name="40129w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 There is no official policy regarding the laying of wreaths on behalf of the Royal Irish Regiment on the graves of fallen soldiers from antecedent regiments. However, this does not prevent Royal Irish Regiment battalions from carrying out individual acts of remembrance at the discretion of the Commanding Officer and where resources and appropriate personnel are available. Where it is not possible to carry on such acts and where Regimental Associations consider that a requirement still exists, the Royal Irish Regiment would encourage the respective associations to take on and carry on the tradition.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what restrictions apply to the renewed call-up of a reservist who has completed a six-month operational deployment; and what time must elapse before he or she can be called up again.  [150863]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Reserve Forces Act 1996 (RFA 96) sets specific limits for mobilised Service under different call-out orders. Under a section 52 call-out order (national danger, great emergency or attack on the UK), reservists may serve for a total of three years in five; under section 54 (warlike operations), reservists may serve for a total of one year in three; and under section 56 (essentially peacekeeping and disaster relief), reservists may serve for a total of nine months in 27.

mobilised Service beyond the limits set by RFA 96; usually for six months at a time. However, there are normally theatre specific limits to the period a reservist can serve. This is to ensure that no one serves too long in an operational environment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what conclusions have been reached by his Department's review of the investigation into the collision of two UK Sea King helicopters, from RNAS Culdrose in Cornwall, off Iraq on 22 March 2003; what the implications were of the non-availability of night vision goggles for the pilots; and if he will make a statement.

<i>[holding answer 26 January 2004]:</i> A Board of Inquiry into the circumstances leading to the collision of the two Sea Kings from 849 Naval Air Squadron on 22 March 2003, was completed last November. The purpose of the Board of Inquiry was:

<P>

<a name="40129w16.html_para5">The BOI concluded that:

<P>

<a name="40129w16.html_para7">A full technical investigation by the Royal Navy Flight Safety and Accident Investigation Centre is still under way, and the report of its findings is not expected for some time.
<P>

<a name="40129w16.html_para8">Helicopter flight safety is achieved through a number of measures including air traffic control, radar detection of hazards, communications, lighting and lookout. Night Vision Goggles (NVG) can, in certain circumstances, enhance these capabilities. However, NVG can be operated only in aircraft that have been specifically modified for this role and from compatible ships. Naval helicopters are fitted to allow operation with NVG according to their tactical role in operations. The operational role for the helicopters of 849 Naval Air Squadron involved in Operation Telic did not require the modifications to the helicopters that are necessary for the provision of NVG. We are currently considering whether to adopt as policy a fleet-wide NVG capability.

 This is primarily a matter for Brent Housing Partnership (BHP), the Arms Length Management Organisation that manages 13,500 tenanted and leasehold homes owned by the London Borough of Brent. BHP reports that 34 per cent. of these homes now have smoke alarms, 23 per cent. have double glazing, and that planned works will increase these figures to 80 per cent. by April 2006 and 32 per cent. by September 2004 respectively. The hon. Member may wish to contact BHP to discuss the information she requires on fire doors.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what percentage increase in council tax he considers to be profligate; and how he defines low single figure percentage increases.  [150135]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 With the significant extra investment we have put into local government and the scope for efficiency improvements, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's view is that local authorities can and should deliver council tax increases in low single figures in 2004&#150;05. It would not be appropriate for the 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2004 : Column 507W</I><P>

<a name="40129w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government accept the conclusions of the Mott MacDonald report, on the "Future of Fire and Rescue Service Control Rooms in England and Wales", published in December 2003. It believes that control rooms at regional level are appropriate for reasons of governance, resilience and intra-service working. It is seeking the views of the Practitioners' Forum, authorities and the service on the conclusions of the report and the Government's response. Copies of the report are available in the Library of the House.

 This is a matter for local assessment. National planning advice in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 "Housing" (PPG3) makes it clear that each local authority should assess the local need for affordable housing within its area.
<P>

<a name="40129w17.html_para2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has published for consultation proposed changes to the current policies for affordable housing set out in PPG3 and in Circular 6/98, 'Planning for Affordable Housing'.

<P>
<a name="40129w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 There are no plans to review the Barnett formula as a result of elected regional assemblies.

 The hon. Gentlemen will be interested in the European Commission's "Delivering Lisbon'" report, published on 21 January&#151;copies have been placed in the Library of the House. The report notes that although the EU has made some progress in job creation, market liberalisation and creation of a knowledge-based economy, there remains considerable work to be done if the EU is to meet its 2010 goal of becoming the most dynamic economy in the world. The Commission notes that the 2005 mid-term employment targets are likely lo be missed and it therefore urges member states to reinvigorate their commitment to the Lisbon reform agenda. The UK Government support this aim and will be looking to the March 25&#150;26 European Council to provide this impetus.

As numbers increase the force is extending its reach throughout the country. UNMIL is responsible for the disarmament and demobilisation process. It has collected about 9,000 weapons; is constructing three cantonment camps; and is sensitising ex-combatants towards the peace process.

<a name="40129w19.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 It is difficult to make an overall assessment of the rise in prices of basic services in South Africa. The latest consumer price index figures published by Statistics South Africa suggest that overall inflation was 4.8 per cent. for the year to November 2003, while the price of fuel and power in urban areas rose over the same period by 6.8 per cent.
<P>

<a name="40129w19.html_para0">The Government of South Africa is committed to providing free basic services to the poor. The Free Basic Water policy entitles poor households to 6,000 litres of water each month, and the Free Basic Electricity policy to 50 kilowatt hours of electricity each month, free of charge.

 There are no specific requirements for the retention of personal notes following either a criminal or civil trial.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w20.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The key criterion the SFO uses when deciding whether to accept a case is that the suspected fraud appears to be so serious or complex that its investigation should be carried out by those responsible for its prosecution. The following factors are taken into account:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. The sum at risk is estimated to be at least &#163;1 million (this is simply an objective and recognisable signpost of seriousness and likely public concern rather than the main indicator of suitability).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. The investigation requires a highly specialised knowledge of, for example, financial markets and their practices.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2004 : Column 518W</I><P>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. There is a need for legal, accountancy and investigative skills to be brought together in a combined operation.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6. The suspected fraud appears to be complex and one in which the use of Section 2 powers (Criminal Justice Act 1987) might be appropriate.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para0">The SFO does not have separate criteria that apply to allegations of bribery of a foreign public official. Allegations of this nature would have to meet the above criteria for the SFO to commence an investigation.

<P>
<a name="40129w20.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Simon Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how many referrals there have been since 1997 to the Serious Fraud Office where bribery of a foreign public official has been an ancillary offence to another offence; and in how many instances since 1997 the SFO has investigated or prosecuted a company or individual for an offence to which bribery of a foreign public official was ancillary, or in which bribery of a foreign public official may have played a part.  [151402]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w20.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The SFO have identified five referrals since 1997 where bribery of a foreign public official may have been an ancillary allegation of the wider matter referred. One case is currently under investigation for other offences. The other cases have not resulted in prosecution for any offences.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w20.html_spmin2"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act crates new offences. The SFO investigates and prosecutes offences of serious and complex fraud. In selecting cases, it gives priority to those that meet its published criteria agreed by Ministers. The SFO does not prioritise by reference to specific offences.

<a name="40129w20.html_para4">The Specialist Schools Programme is contributing to the creation of a specialist system in which every secondary school has its own special ethos and works with others to spread best practice and raise standards. The programme helps schools, in partnership with private sector sponsors and supported by additional Government funding, to achieve their targets to raise standards. It promotes school improvement by providing opportunities for schools to work to their strengths, enabling them to deliver effective teaching and learning in their area of expertise, as well as across the curriculum, and to drive innovation.

<a name="40129w20.html_para9">The Government have set a target to increase the number of specialist schools to 2,000 by 2006. The aim is that all secondary schools will become specialist schools.
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para10"><i>Beacon schools:</i>
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para11">The Department is currently phasing out the existing beacon schools programme.
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para12">The leading edge partnership programme is specific to secondary schools and builds on the success of the beacon schools initiative to encourage an accelerated pace of change and improvement. We need our very best schools and departments to play a leading role in this; to encourage excellence, to develop curriculum expertise and to work with other schools to raise standards through improved teaching and learning. Leading secondary schools will work with other secondary school partners to find solutions to the most critical learning challenges and those most likely to have the greatest impact on closing the attainment gap. We are committed to establishing a network of 300 partnerships by 2006.
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para13">In primary, the leading practice programme, described in the recent primary strategy document "Excellence and Enjoyment", a strategy for primary schools, will build on successful practice developed through the beacon programme. We intend to develop a leading practice programme with common national criteria and branding. It will focus on identifying outstanding work in particular areas, within schools that are performing well across the board. The LEA will have a role in working with leading practice schools to ensure they contribute to local networking arrangements so that excellent practice is spread widely.
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para14"><i>Excellence Clusters:</i>
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para15">Excellence Clusters are designed to bring the benefits of Excellence in Cities (EiC) to smaller pockets of deprivation. Some 197 secondary schools and over 440 primary schools are involved in Excellence Clusters. Like EiC, the clusters focus on some of the most deprived areas of the country, using a structured programme designed to raise standards.
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para16">Clusters benefit from extra resources to provide the three core strands of the EiC programme:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Extended opportunities for Gifted and Talented pupils</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Access to full time Learning Mentors for pupils who need them</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Learning Support Units to tackle disruption.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para17">A fourth strand of funding is available to target particular local issues, as identified by the schools in each cluster.




<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2004 : Column 521W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para18">Under our transformation strategy for Education Action Zones (EAZs) established under the Standards and Framework Act 1998 41 of the 73 EAZs will transform to Excellence Clusters. This process will be completed by the end of April 2005.
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para19"><i>Leadership Incentive Grant:</i>
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para20">The Leadership Incentive Grant is intended to accelerate the improvement in standards and to strengthen leadership at all levels in schools. The grant also enables schools to work together to share expertise, resources and effective practice to strengthen teaching and learning.
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para21"><i>Primary Leadership Strategy:</i>
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para22">In 2003, primary schools in every LEA were invited to take part in the Leadership Programme, funded by the Primary National Strategy and developed in partnership with the National College for School Leadership (NCSL). (The National Primary Strategy is a holistic whole-school improvement strategy, building on and incorporating the Literacy and Numeracy Strategies.)
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para23">The programme seeks to support schools in improving the leadership of the teaching and learning of English and mathematics, helping to ensure that the rate of progress of children within the school community continues to improve as more reach the standards expected.
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para24"><i>Sure Start:</i>
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para25">Sure Start programmes work with parents-to-be, parents and children to promote the physical, intellectual and social development of young children&#151;particularly those who are disadvantaged&#151;so that they can flourish at home, when they get to school and during later life. The programme aims to help strengthen families and reduce child poverty by enabling parents to maximise their opportunities to work, learn and study, confident their children are being cared for in a safe and stimulating environment; and contribute to building and sustaining strong local communities through high quality and innovatively delivered family services, which respond to the needs of the communities they serve.
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para26"><i>Connexions:</i>
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para27">Connexions is the Government's front line support service for all young people in England aged 13&#150;19. Connexions will play an integral role in the delivery of the agenda for reform on services for children and young people proposed in the Green Paper "Every child matters".
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para28">Through multi-agency working, Connexions provides integrated advice guidance and access to personal development opportunities to help remove barriers to learning and progression and ensure young people make a smooth transition to adulthood and working life. Personal advisers play a lead professional role. They provide advice on careers and lifestyle issues as well as barriers such as homelessness and drugs. They refer young people to specialist support where needed.
<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para29">The new vision statement for Connexions launched in November 2002, signed by eight Government Ministers, re-affirmed the universal nature of the service.




<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2004 : Column 522W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40129w20.html_para30">Connexions' overarching objective is to reduce the number of 16 to 18-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training (MEET). Connexions Partnerships have a target of reducing local MEET numbers by 10 per cent. by November 2004.

<P>
<a name="40129w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The direction notice sent to Cambridgeshire county council asks the authority to increase its Schools Budget to a level consistent with full passporting. Full passporting means increasing the 2003&#150;04 Schools Budget by the increase in the Schools Formula Spending Share from 2003&#150;04 to 2004&#150;05. Therefore the direction notice is based on the Schools Formula Spending Share figure for Cambridgeshire.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much funding for environmental educational initiatives will be lost by schools following the end of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme; and if he will replace such lost funding from his departmental budget.  [150644]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (LTCS) has not ended, although two of the objects of the scheme were withdrawn in April 2003, those which concerned research and development, and education on sustainable waste management. Since April 2003 a number of projects in categories c and cc have continued to be financed by legacy funding through the Department for Environment, 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2004 : Column 526W</I><P>
Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), the Welsh and Scottish Assemblies and the Northern Ireland Authorities but the current arrangements will cease at the end of March. The value of environmental education projects funded in calendar year 2003 under these categories is &#163;71,300, although that amount may increase since claims can be made until April 2004. However, some types of education projects are currently, and will still be, eligible for funding under some of the remaining objects of the scheme, for example biodiversity.
<P>

<a name="40129w21.html_para5">As part of the sustainable waste delivery public expenditure programme established as a result of the reform of the LTCS, and managed by Defra, work will be taken forward on waste awareness. Therefore, my Department has no plans to increase the level of funding for environmental educational in schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if he will list the <i>(a)</i> average funding of each schoolchild in England and <i>(b)</i> the level of funding for a schoolchild in Shrewsbury and Atcham.  [151407]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40129w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The average national funding for 2004&#150;05 provided through the Education Formula Spending Share for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;3,515. The formula for the main primary and secondary sub-blocks comprises a basic entitlement for each pupil, which is the same across the country, plus a top-up for each pupil with additional educational needs, which is again the same across the country, plus top-ups for areas where it costs more to recruit and retain teachers. Local education authorities with a greater proportion of pupils with additional educational needs or higher average earnings will receive a higher level of funding per pupil. The Government do not directly fund school children in Shrewsbury and Atcham. The Government provide funding to Shropshire county council which is then responsible for funding its schools.
