<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_wqn0"><B> Sir Nicholas Lyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent percentage increases there have been in the daily rates charged for planning inspectors conducting inquiries into local plans and other planning inquiries; and if he will make a statement.  [61188]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have asked the Planning Inspectorate's Chief Executive, Mr. Chris Shepley, to write to the right hon. and learned Member.
<P>

<a name="81201w01.html_para0"><i>Letter from David Hanchet to Sir Nicholas Lyell, dated 1 December 1998:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State has asked Chris Shepley to reply to your Question about the daily rates charged for Planning Inspectors. I am replying in his absence today on official business.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Planning Inspectorate makes charges for two categories of inquiry held by our Inspectors. The fee for conducting local plan inquiries was set at &#163;340 per day in February 1996, and the fee for conducting other planning inquiries under various items of legislation was set at &#163;350 per day in October 1994.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A review of the fees has shown that under our previous methodology the full costs of the service were not being recovered. As a result, new fees of &#163;430 per day for local plan inquiries and &#163;492 for the other recoverable inquiries are now planned (increases of 26.5% and 40.6% respectively).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Although these are significant it is important to remember that</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>a. the service was effectively being subsided in the past;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>b. there have been no increases for nearly 3 years in one case and over 4 in the other;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>c. although the daily rate has increased, the service provided has become steadily more efficient through a variety of management measures taken by the Planning Inspectorate. As a result, the actual duration of inquiries, and therefore the number of chargeable days, has reduced.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Randall: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the policies applied by English Partnerships when deciding whether to fund development proposals affecting sites of special scientific interest are to be reviewed following the release of the consultation paper on better protection and management of SSSIs.  [61006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 English Partnerships is currently reviewing all aspects of its environmental policy, including that on development proposals affecting SSSIs. This review is taking account of the commitments set out in my department's consultation document "Better Protection and Management of SSSIs", that Government Departments and agencies publish statements of commitment, or sign appropriate memoranda of understanding with DETR, in 



<P>
<P><I>1 Dec 1998 : Column: 112</I><P>
relation to the obligation to secure the protection and positive management of special sites for which they are responsible.
<P>

<a name="81201w01.html_para1">The review will result in the production of new internal guidance, which will include more specific advice on how the Agency operates on land close to, or within, SSSIs and other environmentally sensitive areas. A copy of this will be placed in the Library of the House when available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 I established the Housing Sounding Board in December last year to discuss a number of housing issues. Members of the Board have a wide range of experience in housing and related issues and serve in a personal capacity. The current members are:

<a name="81201w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Council Tax</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. O'Hara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what would have been the additional increase in the council tax at Band D of each local authority in 1998-99 if the proposed council tax limitation scheme had been introduced this year, assuming the limit had been set at five per cent. over 1997-98.  [61666]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 We have abolished crude and universal capping and have not proposed a council tax limitation scheme for 1999-2000 or subsequent years. We will be taking reserve powers to limit council taxes in the Local Government Bill published on 1 December 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will confer upon charter trustees and town councils the powers contained in section 249 of the Local Government Act 1972 in respect to the conferring of honorary freedoms.  [61833]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 No. I am advised that for my right hon. Friend to extend the powers in section 249 of the Local Government Act 1972 to include charter trustees and town councils would be unusual, unexpected and inappropriate. We have no plans for further legislation in this field.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the outcome of his meeting with train operating companies.  [61938]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Transport in London and I met representatives from the rail franchisees and Railtrack on November 26. The meeting was frank and constructive. It represented a significant first step aimed at delivering improvements to passengers.
<P>

<a name="81201w01.html_para3">The Government believe, and the industry accepts, that the target must be progressive, year-on-year improvement in performance. Measures identified to improve service in the short term included the recruitment and training of 800 drivers and the introduction over the next year of 500 new vehicles, of which about half will be additional to the current fleet. There will be a wider-ranging National Railways Summit next February to build on measures and actions identified at this first meeting.

<a name="81201w01.html_sbhd6"><H4><center>Aircraft Noise</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the research on the effect of aircraft noise on sleep disturbance which his Department has commissioned, indicating sites chosen for noise trials.  [61974]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We have commissioned a research trial on the effect of aircraft noise on sleep disturbance. This trial is to assess analytical techniques and methodology, and their limitations, to help us decide whether to proceed with a full-scale study either of sleep prevention or of total sleep loss, and to determine what should be included in any such study. The trial will involve taking measurements of people sleeping in their own homes and will be based at Manchester Airport, which provides a suitable combination of densely populated communities close to the airport with a spread of aircraft noise throughout the night. It may be extended to Heathrow if actual noise levels in the early morning at Manchester prove insufficient for the purposes of the trial. No specific sites have been selected yet. The steering group for the study includes representatives of the consultative committees from Manchester, Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, along with the airport management, airlines and environmentalists.

<a name="81201w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Tourism</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to include provision for spending on tourism in the Standard Spending Assessment.  [61086]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The element of the Standard Spending Assessments for Environmental, Protective and Cultural Services (formerly known as "Other Services"), makes allowance for spending on a group of services which includes tourism.

<a name="81201w01.html_sbhd8"><H4><center>Small and Medium Businesses</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Singh: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps 



<P>
<P><I>1 Dec 1998 : Column: 114</I><P>
the Government are taking to help small and medium businesses improve their environmental performance.  [62215]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 By setting up a single environment and energy helpline (0800 58 57 94), the Government are making it very much easier for SMEs to find out how they can improve their environmental performance. The Helpline, which will be run under the auspices of the Government's Energy Efficiency and Environmental Technology Best Practice Programmes, will come into operation today. It will provide callers with free access to:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>impartial best practice information</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>up to two hours telephone assistance from an energy or environment expert; and, where it would be beneficial</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on-site technical advice, where this would be beneficial and worthwhile.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="81201w01.html_para4">Small and medium businesses are an important part of the UK economy. There are about 3M firms, 80,000 of which employ 20 to 250 people. They employ around 4 million people and have a turnover of &#163;4 billion. They are also responsible for one-third of the carbon dioxide emissions from business and a significant proportion of other waste. Smaller companies therefore have a significant role to play to help meet our climate change targets.
<P>

<a name="81201w01.html_para5">There can be significant benefits in improving environmental performance for companies of all sizes. On average, a fifth of energy and a quarter of a company's waste can be avoided cost-effectively. Saving resources saves money and improves competitiveness--gain, not pain. The Government's two Best Practice Programmes provide authoritative advice on how to improve environmental and energy efficiency performance. For business, there are competitiveness advantage. And, for everyone, there are environmental advantages. The Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme, for example, has helped to save energy worth around &#163;650 million a year and consequently 3.25 million tonnes of carbon--across the nation.
<P>

<a name="81201w01.html_para6">To ensure this new initiative is a success, the helpline will be closely co-ordinated with Government Office Regional Energy and Environmental Management Contacts (REEMCs), Business Links, green business clubs, the Energy Saving Trust's Energy Efficiency Advice Centres, the Environment Agency's regional offices, Training and Enterprise Councils and local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has held with <i>(a)</i> Greenwich Council, <i>(b)</i> London Underground and <i>(c)</i> the Port of London Authority over contingency plans for transport to the Millennium Dome.  [61980]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Minister for Transport in London, through her Millennium Access Co-ordination Group, asked London Underground Limited to lead the production of contingency plans for transport to the Millennium Dome, and keep the group informed of progress. Progress was presented to the group in October, at which time there was discussions on how the work was progressing and next steps.




<P>
<P><I>1 Dec 1998 : Column: 115</I><P>

<P>

<a name="81201w02.html_para0">My hon. Friend has had no discussions with the Borough of Greenwich or the Port of London Authority on contingency planning. The Borough of Greenwich has, however, recently become a member of the Millennium Access group and will therefore participate in future discussions on this work.

<a name="81201w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps the Franchise Director has taken to involve the train rolling stock companies in supplying Connex's rolling stock replacement needs.  [61877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The two train operating companies franchised to Connex will have to replace or modify certain trains to meet their commitments to the Franchising Director and any requirements of the Health and Safety Executive. How they achieve this is a matter for the companies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Savidge: </B> 
To ask the Attorney-General what approach prosecutors take to reliance on inferences which may be drawn from silence during police questioning at a time when the suspect is denied access to legal advice, having regard to the judgment of the European Court of Human Rights in John Murray <i>v</i> United Kingdom.  [62217]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w02.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 The Government intend to introduce the necessary legislation in the forthcoming Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill and this legislation will be extended to Northern Ireland, by way of negative resolution Order in Council, to ensure that the domestic law which was at issue in Murray <i>v</i> United Kingdom is fully compatible with our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights. As an interim measure, I have today promulgated to prosecuting authorities guidance about the handling of cases where the evidence available to the prosecution would include such inferences as might be drawn from the accused's silence in the circumstances covered by Sections 34, 36 and 37 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 (and corresponding provisions in Northern Ireland) when the suspect has been denied access to legal advice at the time of questioning.
<P>

<a name="81201w02.html_para1">A copy of the guidance has been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. Its effect is that the prosecution should not seek to rely on inferences drawn from silence before access to legal advice had been granted. In the event that a court, of its own volition, indicates an intention to draw any such inferences, its attention would be drawn to the judgment in the John Murray case.

associated directly with security activities in <i>(a)</i> Northern Ireland, <i>(b)</i> the Falklands and <i>(c)</i> the remaining United Kingdom dependent territories.  [61696]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Expenditure directly associated with security activities cannot be distinguished from that on other activities. The following costs of the military presence provide a broad guide to the overall level of commitment in 1996-97:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> Northern Ireland &#163;505 million.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="81201w02.html_para2">This figure relates to the costs incurred by the General Officer Commanding, Northern Ireland. It thus excludes related elements of expenditure, incurred elsewhere within Class I Votes, which are not separately identified.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> Falklands &#163;81 million.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="81201w02.html_para3">This figure relates to the costs incurred by the Commander, British Forces Falkland Islands (CBFFI) only. It does not thus include the costs of the RAF airbridge to the Falkland Islands, nor the cost of naval deployments to the South Atlantic. These costs fall to other budgets and are not separately identified.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> UK dependent territories (excluding Falkland Islands) Gibraltar &#163;63 million.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="81201w02.html_para4">Costs incurred in the support of the remaining dependent territories are not separately identified and are relatively small. Expenditure is principally on the operation of the West Indies Guardship which supports UK dependent territories throughout the Caribbean, among other tasks. Otherwise, support generally relates to the provision of a small number of Loan Service Personnel to assist with training. The cost of the military presence in South Georgia and the Sandwich Islands is included in CBFFI's budget.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 On 17 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 345-46, I announced that Fisheries Departments planned to introduce from 1 January 1999 phased arrangements for recording maximum continuous engine power on fishing vessel licences.
<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para4">Following that announcement, the arrangements for the recording of maximum continuous engine power have been the subject of detailed consideration by Fisheries Departments, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA). Since the fishing vessel licensing regime operated by Fisheries Departments is dependent on vessel characteristics as registered by the Registrar of Shipping and Seamen, part of MCA, parallel changes will be introduced in the arrangements for registering fishing vessel engine power. These changes have also been discussed with representatives of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, the Northern Ireland Fishermen's Federation and the Scottish Fishermen's Federation as part of a wider review of UK fishing vessel licensing.
<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para5">We are now writing to advise all fishing vessel owners and licence holders of the new arrangements.




<P>
<P><I>1 Dec 1998 : Column: 120</I><P>

<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para6">From 1 July 1999, new registrations, re-registrations, and changes in existing registrations affecting ownership or vessel characteristics (engine power, length or breadth), and the licensing of such vessels, are to be based on the declaration and recording of maximum continuous engine power. The permanent derating of engines will be permitted but vessel owners will have to provide a signed statement or certificate from the engine manufacturer or a suitably qualified marine engineer setting out the steps that have been taken to achieve such a modification. De-rated engine power will be registered and licensed only where the MCA and Fisheries Departments are satisfied that the modifications are permanent.
<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para7">The Merchant Shipping (Registration of Ships) Regulations 1993 will be amended to provide specifically for the registration of maximum continuous or permanently modified engine power.
<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para8">From 1 January 2000, the maximum continuous or permanently derated engine power of vessels registered before 1 July 1999 will be taken to be that declared on the Certificate of Registry and shown on the fishing vessel licence. When vessels are registered between 1 January and 30 June 1999, owners will wish to take appropriate action to ensure that they declare the full power of their vessels (maximum continuous or permanently derated engine power) because this is the basis on which subsequent enforcement will take place.
<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para9">Checks will be undertaken from 1 January 2000 to ensure that the apparent installed engine power of fishing vessels is consistent with the registered and licensed engine power. Where the apparent installed power is greater than the registered and licensed power, a fishing vessel's licence will become invalid and a new licence will not be issued until the owner acquires additional vessel capacity units (VCUs) to cover the deficit in engine power or undertakes permanent de-rating of the vessel's engine. However, the owners of vessels registered before 1 January 1999 will have until 31 December 2004 to rectify any anomalies in their registered engine power if they provide a written undertaking specifying the steps they are taking.
<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para10">To assist the implementation of the new arrangements, a capacity penalty will be payable only on the additional VCUs needed to cover the discrepancy between apparent installed and registered engine power provided no other changes are made to the characteristics of the vessel. A 20 per cent. capacity penalty will operate unless the adjustment to engine power is made before 31 December 2001 in which circumstances the penalty will be 10 per cent. For this purpose, it will be permissible for vessel owners to split VCUs and licences between two or more vessels.
<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para11">The arrangements will apply to the licensing of fishing vessels wherever they operate. However, from 1 January 1999, vessels applying for licences for the first time in respect of fishing opportunities in external and other waters will be expected to satisfy Fisheries Departments that the maximum continuous or permanently derated engine power has been declared and appropriately licensed.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what changes he proposes to make in the arrangements for the licensing of pelagic freezer trawlers and pair trawling; and if he will make a statement.  [62218]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In July 1998, Fisheries Departments issued a consultation document seeking comments on proposals to assist pelagic freezer trawling including the aggregation of whitefish with pelagic licences and pair trawling with vessels from other Member States. The proposals attracted wide-ranging comments from the fishing industry.
<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para13">After careful consideration, it has been decided to introduce a time-limited scheme for the introduction or replacement of pelagic freezer trawlers. Any person may introduce a pelagic freezer trawler into the UK fleet by aggregating Category A whitefish licences and/or category A pelagic trawler licences with existing Category A pelagic freezer trawler or purse seine licences or licence entitlements, provided:
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) proposals to introduce or replace a pelagic freezer trawler are notified in writing to Fisheries Departments by 28 February 1999;</FONT></UL>
<P>

<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para14">A capacity penalty will be payable only on that part of the capacity of the incoming vessel which is not covered by Category A pelagic freezer or purse seine licences: that penalty will be 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para15">In submitting proposals to introduce or replace a pelagic freezer trawler, the prospective owner will have to demonstrate, to the satisfaction of Fisheries Departments, a genuine intention to pursue pelagic freezer trawling and access to sufficient fishing opportunities to support the operation of the incoming vessel. Any effort expended by the new vessel would count towards existing effort targets. Consequently, any pelagic effort allocated to producer organisations or other groups to cover an incoming vessel's activities could amount only to the allocation for the existing freezer vessel it replaced and/or the fishing opportunities linked to any other pelagic licences used in the licence transaction. No additional effort would be available as a result of the aggregation of whitefish licences.
<P>

<a name="81201w03.html_para16">For the time being, the prohibition on pair trawling with vessels from other Member States will remain in place. The prohibition will, however, be reviewed in the light of the new rules to regulate transhipment and joint fishing operations which the Commission are expected to draw up following changes in the EU's control regulation for fisheries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans he has to ensure that the European Code of Conduct on the arms trade is adopted into UK law; and what plans he has to make arms brokering to arms embargoed countries a crime.  [61492]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The EU Code of Conduct on Arms Exports, which was an Anglo-French initiative, was adopted by the EU General Affairs Council on 8 June. However, as our own national arms export criteria are not legally binding, the UK Government felt that it would not have been appropriate or realistic to press our partners to sign up to a legally binding instrument to give effect to similar criteria at the EU level.
<P>

<a name="81201w04.html_para0">The Government already impose controls on trafficking and brokering under the United Nations Act 1946 where this is necessary to implement a binding United Nations decision. In addition, the White Paper on Strategic Export Controls, which was published on 1 July, contains proposals to extend controls on trafficking and brokering in several areas, including to countries subject to other types of embargo, whether as a result of non-binding decisions of the UN or decisions of the EU, Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe or the UK Government. This would mean that, as is already the case for binding UN arms embargoes, it would be an offence for persons in the UK or UK persons abroad to be involved in trafficking or brokering in controlled goods to countries subject to these other types of embargo, without a valid licence. The use of a licensing system, rather than imposing an outright ban, would enable the Government to sanction such transfers on the rare occasions that they are desirable (e.g. the transfer of equipment to peacekeeping forces in an embargoed destination).

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Creative and innovative proposals are key features in the award of licences on 78 of the 82 blocks applied for in the 18th Round of Seaward Petroleum Licensing. The awards are made to a total of 44 companies, of which 22 are operators of one or more of the blocks.
<P>

<a name="81201w04.html_para11">The applications received showed that companies are still thinking creatively and generating innovative proposals to identify significant new prospects in the North Sea. Despite more than 30 years of exploration activity in the area, there was strong competition for attractive blocks and clear evidence that companies are prepared to look beyond traditional areas and the tested strata to find new resources.
<P>

<a name="81201w04.html_para12">The willingness of companies to test innovative thinking with both further technical analysis and early drilling where appropriate confirms that the industry still sees the North Sea as an exploration area with significant potential in undiscovered reserves. I believe that the open basis of this round--the first to allow companies to bid for almost any unlicensed blocks in mature areas of the United Kingdom Continental Shelf--encouraged companies to develop innovative ideas and bring them forward as licence applications.
<P>

<a name="81201w04.html_para13">When the 18th Round was launched in June this year, our expectation was that most applications would focus on acreage close to existing developments or infrastructure, where any discoveries were likely to be brought on stream as rapidly as possible in order to prolong the life of current assets.
<P>

<a name="81201w04.html_para14">In the event, a majority of the applications received reflected this pattern, and there was strong competition for several blocks, but an unexpected--and very pleasing--number of other applications were received which identified strata and structures with previously unrecognised hydrocarbon potential.
<P>

<a name="81201w04.html_para15">Some of these concepts were developed in blocks which have been licensed and explored for conventional targets before. Twelve of the blocks awarded have not previously been licensed. Eight of these are granted to the Shell/Esso partnership whose application stood out for its creative approach.
<P>

<a name="81201w04.html_para16">Two of the blocks applied for--48/19d and 210/20c--have been divided between competing applicants. This will allow presumed extensions of adjacent fields--Anglia and Otter respectively--into the new acreage to be appraised and brought into production as soon as possible, while at the same time maximising exploration of the remaining area.
<P>

<a name="81201w04.html_para17">I look forward to seeing the successful applicants moving forward to explore their new holdings, and to develop any new reserves they may discover.

 The Government of Zimbabwe's land reform programme began after Independence in 1980. So far, the programme has benefited some 70,000 families. An evaluation by the then ODA in 1988 showed that the resettlement had shown a good rate of return, but had little impact on the poverty in the communal areas. Poverty also exists in the new resettlement areas. The Government of Zimbabwe established a Commission of Inquiry into Appropriate Agricultural Land Tenure Systems (the 'Rukuni Commission') which in 1994 made recommendations on tenure, subdivision, administrative decentralisation, and land taxation, among other issues. These recommendations are for consideration as part of the second phase of the Government's Land Reform and Resettlement Programme. In November 1997, the Government of Zimbabwe notified 1,471 landowners of their intention compulsorily to acquire further land.
<P>

<a name="81201w05.html_para5">Her Majesty's Government have made it clear since May 1997 that there is a strong case for land redistribution in Zimbabwe but that we will provide support only if the programme is part of a wider poverty reduction strategy, is transparent and pro-poor and complies with Zimbabwean law on land acquisition and compensation.

 A Department for International Development mission visited Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Albania between 16-26 November to assess conditions on the ground and the state of aid co-ordination. A humanitarian disaster has been averted, but the situation remains serious and must be monitored carefully. The internally displaced persons who were living out of doors are now back under shelter. The international response is generally adequate to meet current emergency needs of displaced people and refugees for food, blankets, stoves, mattresses and fuels. It is vital that the current level of humanitarian operations is maintained over the winter.

<P>
<a name="81201w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In the case of John Murray <i>v</i>. the United Kingdom, the European Court of Human Rights held that it was a breach of Article 6 of the Convention to deny the applicant access to legal advice in circumstances where inferences could be drawn from his silence during questioning. The Government have concluded that the only sure way to prevent a repetition of the circumstances which prevailed in the Murray case is to amend the relevant legislation and the Codes of Practice made under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, the Police 



<P>
<P><I>1 Dec 1998 : Column: 131</I><P>
and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 and the Northern Ireland (Emergency Provisions) Act 1996, so as to prohibit the drawing of inferences from silence when a suspect is questioned at a police station while denied access to legal advice. The Government therefore intend to introduce the necessary legislation in the forthcoming Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Bill, and this legislation will be extended to Northern Ireland by way of Negative Resolution Order in Council.
<P>

<a name="81201w06.html_para1">In the interim, the Government will take such steps that are possible, without legislation, to ensure that no one is put in the same position which arose in the Murray case. My right hon. and learned Friend the Attorney-General will shortly be issuing guidance to prosecutors and, in parallel, my Department and the Northern Ireland Office will shortly be issuing a circular to the police. This guidance will seek to ensure that the usual practice will be for suspects to have access to legal advice before being interviewed at a police station. Where access to legal advice is denied, the police will be encouraged to put inference-bearing questions again after the suspect has been given the opportunity to obtain such advice. Additionally, prosecutors will be advised not to seek reliance on inferences drawn from silence before access to legal advice was granted. I am arranging for a copy of the guidance to the police to be placed in the Library.

<a name="81201w06.html_para4">As regards applications for British citizenship, these are currently taking longer to consider than I would wish. Unfortunately, the spending plans we inherited from the previous Government, together with the increased pressures on the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, arising from increased passenger numbers arriving at our sea and airports and the numbers claiming asylum, mean that we do not have the financial resources to devote greater effort to citizenship work. This will change next year when we start to put into effect our plans for immigration and nationality work, which should result in twice as many decisions being taken and waiting times coming down significantly.

<a name="81201w06.html_para5">In relation to immigration appeals, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate published a consultation paper on the appeals system on 13 July.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 The Welsh Office is well aware of oral health benefits conferred by topping up the existing fluoride levels in public water supplies to 1 part per million. The dental decay rate of children aged five years in Anglesey was reduced by 50 per cent. after fluoridation was introduced there in the mid fifties. However, since withdrawal of the last of the Anglesey fluoridation schemes in 1991, there has been a 168 per cent. increase in tooth decay.
<P>

<a name="81201w07.html_para1">Dental decay is increasingly recognised as a disease of childhood and deprivation, and water fluoridation is an ideal and simple way in which to improve oral health.
<P>

<a name="81201w07.html_para2">The recent consultation on the Green Paper 'Better Health, Better Wales' drew considerable support for fluoridation and the Welsh Office is considering the responses in conjunction with other UK Health Departments.

 The New Deal offers a flexible package of support which can last from a few days to over a year, according to individual need. The latest revised information provided by the Employment Service shows that 10,800 young people joined the New Deal in Wales between January and September, of whom nearly 2,700 had left by the end of September.
<P>

<a name="81201w07.html_para3">Almost 1,600 young people left the New Deal to take up unsubsidised jobs (59 per cent. of all leavers).

 We have not given any guidance to local education authorities on the relative merits of three tier and two tier systems.

The Government's Programme of Action for meeting special educational needs, published last month, made it clear that we are committed to achieving a substantial improvement in LEAs' performance and will continue to challenge under-performing LEAs; and that we intend to require LEAs to publish information about the time taken to complete statutory assessments and statements. In addition, we will shortly be providing LEAs with guidance on good practice in this area.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland for what reasons his Department is proposing a voluntary code of practice for the management of complexes of retirement flats owned by their occupants.  [61083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Following representations to Ministers about the management of some owner occupied sheltered housing developments, the Scottish Office convened a meeting of interested parties in July 1996. At the meeting, representatives of developers, management companies, owners and other organisations such as Age Concern Scotland and the Scottish Consumer Council, agreed that a working group should be established to consider a voluntary code that would set out a framework for good practice in the management of owner occupied sheltered housing developments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if the voluntary code of practice for the management of complexes of retirement flats owned by their occupants will include provisions relating to <i>(a)</i> major repair funds, <i>(b)</i> complaint procedures, <i>(c)</i> terms in deeds of conditions, <i>(d)</i> adherence to these conditions and <i>(e)</i> the implementation of an arbiter's award by managing agents.  [61084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The detailed provisions of the proposed voluntary code of management practice are still under consideration by the working group established by the Scottish Office. However, it is currently envisaged that there would be clauses relating to major repair funds and complaints procedures. The terms of deeds of conditions, adherence to these conditions and the implementation of awards by arbiters are essentially legal matters to be resolved between the parties concerned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what assessment he has made of the impact upon crofters and other small producers of the costs of disposing of spent sheep dip as proposed under the Groundwater Regulations; and if he will make a statement.  [61849]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 A copy of the Regulatory Impact Assessment in respect of the Groundwater Regulations 1998 was placed in the Library of the Houses of Parliament on 11 November. The Assessment notes that, in England and Wales, compliance costs for a typical farmer are likely to be &#163;100 recurring costs per annum with non-recurring costs of &#163;85. Broadly similar costs are expected for Scotland.
<P>

<a name="81201w09.html_para0">On 26 November, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency issued for public consultation their proposals for charges under the Regulations. Under the terms of section 42 of the Environment Act 1995, the approval of the Secretary of State must be obtained before a charging scheme is made. In determining whether or not to approve the scheme the Secretary of State must consider any representations or objections duly made to him and not withdrawn. He must also have regard to the desirability of ensuring that the amounts recovered by the Agency by way of the prescribed charges are the amounts which taking one year with another, need to be recovered by the Agency to meet such of the costs and expenses which it incurs in carrying out its functions as he may consider appropriate.

 The Scottish Office has had continuing constructive discussions with both Dornoch Academy and Highland Council, particularly in relation to the school's annual grant. The Government remain committed to repealing the self-governing schools legislation. This, however, will now be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what representations he has received regarding the transfer to Moray House College of Education of the East Suffolk Road student hostels; what investigation he has made of the events surrounding this transfer and the accounting procedures involved; and if he will make a statement.  [61703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I have received representations concerning the transfer to Moray House College of Education of the East Suffolk Road student hostels. A comprehensive reply has already been provided. In October, the Scottish Office Education and Industry Department received further representations, on the issue that the transfer of the student hostels to Moray House in 1979 was not correctly undertaken. Since then, officials have received numerous further representations from the same person, as have the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland for what reasons the new Housing Partnerships Initiative precludes local authorities in Scotland from investing the funding available in local authority owned stock without transferring ownership of this stock outside the local authority.  [61678]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 The new Housing Partnerships Initiative aims to promote community ownership and secure private sector finance for affordable housing. Local authorities receive separate capital allocations for works to their own stock.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how his figure for the cost of abolishing tuition fees in Scotland was arrived at; over what period it applies; what the annual figures are; and what assumptions underlie the calculation.  [61710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I am not entirely clear which figure is the subject of the question. The Scottish Office Education and Industry Department has commissioned independent research on the long term savings arising from the recent changes in policy on student support, including the introduction of a means-tested private contribution towards the cost of tuition and the replacement of grants by loans. I have arranged for a copy of an abstract of the results to be placed in the House of Commons Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what plans he has to implement the Nitrates Directive in respect of water bodies, rivers and their catchments which exceed the limit of 50mg/l of dissolved nitrates; and if he will make a statement.  [61699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 This Directive is being implemented and we already monitor at all surface water and groundwater locations used for drinking water abstraction. 



<P>
<P><I>1 Dec 1998 : Column: 145</I><P>
The Scottish Environment Protection Agency is extending this monitoring network to be representative of all Scottish inland surface waters. This will be used to identify where there are exceedances of the 50 mg/l concentration limit value for nitrate. From this information SEPA will undertake a further review to determine if revised or new Nitrate Vulnerable Zones should be designated.
<P>

<a name="81201w09.html_para2">Before an extended network can be identified for groundwater monitoring it will be necessary to carry out a preliminary study of existing abstraction. I am asking SEPA to set up a groundwater monitoring network by the end of 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what advice he has received from Scottish Natural Heritage in respect of applications for licences for the killing of barnacle geese on the Island of Islay; and if licences will be issued for land within areas designated as special protection areas under EU Directive 79/409/EEC.  [61700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 Advice has been given by Scottish Natural Heritage on the likely effect of limited licences to shoot barnacle geese in specified areas on Islay. Two licences to prevent serious agricultural damage have been issued for a limited period where no other satisfactory solution was available. These licences allow a maximum of 50 barnacle geese to be shot in areas designated as Special Protection Areas under EU Directive 74/409/EEC. The effect of the licensed shooting on the farms and the goose populations will be carefully monitored, and the results will be taken into account before any further licences are issued to farmers on Islay.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 None. The National Goose Forum is not due to report on a national policy framework for managing potential conflicts between geese and agriculture until Summer 1999.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Questions to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I cannot provide precisely all the information that you have requested, but have provided as much as possible from the most recent information available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency has six front-line Business Units; each of these consists of a Child Support Agency Centre and associated Field Offices. Information has been provided for each Business Unit.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency measures the accuracy of maintenance assessments against targets set by the Secretary of State. For 1997/98, the target was for the cash value of all maintenance assessments checked in the year to be correct to the last penny in at least 85% of cases. The Agency met this target scoring an accuracy rate of 86%.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1998/99, the Agency is measuring the accuracy more stringently by examining the last full assessment rather than just the last work carried out, which could have been a simplified review not requiring a full assessment. The revised methodology is closer to that used by the National Audit Office. The checks will be more reliable, measuring accuracy of assessments to the last penny in earlier years as well as more recent changes to assessments. 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>1 Dec 1998 : Column: 148</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, this may result in a larger number of inaccurate assessments being identified in the short term because it will reflect earlier periods in which the accuracy of assessments was lower than it now is. As a result the accuracy target is lower for 1998/99, and requires the cash value of all assessments checked in the year to be correct in at least 75% of cases. The Agency will be looking to improve on the accuracy target in 1999/2000 and following years.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At 31 October 1998 the accuracy level (against this revised criteria) achieved by the Agency was 75%. The levels achieved by each Business Unit are shown in the attached table.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General to the House of Commons which was published as part of the Agency's Annual Report for 1997/98 noted that when examining non-resident parents' maintenance balances, National Audit Office staff had identified that some error had occurred at some point in the history of the account in 79% (85% in 1996/97) of the cases examined. In the large majority of cases these inaccuracies had a relatively small monetary effect, and need to be put in the context that on average cases require to be worked at about 3 times a year. This assessment was based on a sample of cases going back to the start of the Agency, but it is a matter of public record that during its first two years the Agency frequently made errors when assessing maintenance. We recognise the legacy of this problem and aim to tackle this by getting cases right first time and will review older cases as the opportunity arises. We estimate that by the end of 1998/99 we will have had the chance in our normal course of work and through periodic reviews to look at many of those individual accounts which stem from the start of the Agency.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency has been concerned that the full maintenance debt reported previously was not a true reflection of the amount ever likely to be collected. Following a Debt Analysis Exercise we have therefore identified that part of the debt which is probably uncollectable and removed it to show a more realistic debt position. This change was introduced in the Agency's Annual Report and Accounts for 1997/98. This revised format is in response to the Committee of Public Accounts recommendation that the Agency " examine the scope for eliminating a significant amount of this debt, since it is unlikely ever to be collected ".</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At 31 October 1998 the amount of child support full maintenance assessment debt was &#163;480,340,622. This can be broken down further to &#163;280,038,583 (58.3%) collectable debt, &#163;186,852,502 (38.9%) possibly uncollectable debt and &#163;13,449,537 (2.8%) deferred debt. Deferred debt is where the Agency has deferred the debt indefinitely, provided non-resident parents meet certain conditions on payment of regular maintenance and any remaining debt. Where appropriate the parent with care will be compensated for the loss of this money. Details for each Business Unit are shown in the attached table.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To further increase the flow of maintenance and to help non-resident parents pay the arrears that they owe, wherever possible the Agency makes every effort to re-schedule debts; re-scheduled debts are those where the Agency has negotiated a closely monitored agreement with the non-resident parent to pay arrears by instalments. The amount of debt re-scheduled included in the &#163;480,340,622 at 31 October 1998 was &#163;374,392,076.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency does not collect information on average processing times for the clearance of maintenance assessments. The Agency measures the clearance of maintenance assessments against targets set by the Secretary of State. The age at clearance is measured from the date of the initial application. In Income Support cases where the Benefits Agency have conducted a pre-adjudication visit as part of the Closer Working arrangement, the date of initial application is the date of the visit.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Agency does not currently measure the time between application and payment due to the several factors that have an influence on when a payment is due (the payment preferences of the parent with care and the non-resident parent, and the non-resident parent's pay frequency) and in turn actually made. The speed with which assessments can be cleared is constrained by the complexities

</UL></FONT><P><I>1 Dec 1998 : Column: 149</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>of the current legislation which can require up to 104 separate pieces of information to be collected and verified before an assessment can be made, however the Agency is steadily reducing the time taken and is clearing the backlog of applications from the early years.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For 1997/98, the Secretary of State target required 525,000 maintenance applications to be cleared; 60 per cent. of new applications to be cleared within 26 weeks and on 31 March 1998 no more than 5 per cent. of all maintenance applications to be over 52 weeks old. The Agency met this target with 595,000 clearances (13 per cent. above target), 72 per cent. of new applications cleared within 26 weeks and reduced the maintenance assessment backlog (i.e. cases which are over 52 weeks old and have not yet been assessed) to less than 5 per cent of applications received.</FONT></UL>

To achieve the target to have no applications outstanding over 52 weeks old at 31 March 1999 all these 306,900 cases need to be cleared during 1998/99. At 31 October 1998 108,695 of these cases are outstanding; it is not possible to state how many of these cases are currently outstanding over 52 weeks, however we are ahead of profile to achieve the target by March. Details for each Business Unit are shown in the attached table. From 1 April we expect to have no applications outstanding over 52 weeks old.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As the older cases are cleared some non resident parents will inevitably be assessed as owing arrears for periods dating back a number of years.

Through the hard work and dedication of the Agency's staff, for the first time in our five year history we met or bettered all of our Secretary of State targets. Letters of complaint to the Agency and to MPs continued to fall as a percentage of our caseload. But we accepted the need to improve our all-round performance in line with concerns expressed by Parliamentary Committees and Stakeholder Groups, rather than just our performance against formal targets.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the short term, we are looking at the ways that we can change the way we deliver our service to address customers immediate concerns; to this end we have reviewed the way that we handle complaints and we have increased resources for our Client Helplines and the National Enquiry Line, extended our hours of opening to cover 8.00am to 8.00pm Monday to Friday and 9.00am to 5.00pm on Saturdays and begun pilots to greatly improve and increase clients' opportunities to secure a face to face service.

 The provision of Medical Services was contracted out to Sema Group on 1 September 1998. One of the objectives of contracting out medical services was to improve service provision. With this in mind the targets that have been set in the contract reflect the improvements the Department is seeking. Sema, however, are not yet achieving the targets that have been set for Incapacity Benefit, Disability Living Allowance, and Industrial Injuries. The contract recognises that service improvements cannot be achieved overnight and allows a six month period before remedies are applied for failure to deliver to contract levels.

 On 24 November, the Budget Council gave its second reading of the draft 1999 EC budget setting commitments at some 97 billion euros (&#163;67 billion) and payments at 85 billion euros (&#163;59 billion). This represents an increase of some 6.6 per cent. in commitments and 2.5 per cent. in payments compared to the 1998 budget, almost all of which is accounted for by unavoidable increases in structural funds appropriations required under the terms of the Edinburgh agreement of 1992. The Council's second reading leaves a margin of some 6.4 billion euros below the ceiling on the financial perspectives. A detailed description of the Council's second reading of the budget is given in an explanatory memorandum which the Government are submitting to the European Scrutiny Committee.

 The National Debt rose by &#163;270.3 billion between 31 March 1978 and 31 March 1995, and stood at &#163;419.2 billion at 31 March 1998. Hence the proportion built up over this period is 64.5 per cent. Net public sector debt rose by &#163;206 billion between 31 March 1978 and 31 March 1995 and stood at &#163;352 billion at 31 March 1998. The proportion built up over the period is 58.5 per cent. The proportion of total debt interest payments incurred over the period can be estimated precisely but should be roughly similar to the proportion of debt.

<P>
<a name="81201w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We regularly discuss North Korean nuclear issues with the US and South Korea, at both Ministerial and official level, bilaterally and collectively at meetings of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation. The UK does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea and no Ministerial talks have been held. Nuclear issues were discussed at official level in November 1997. The UK also intends to raise them in EU Troika and bilateral talks with North Korea on 2 and 3 December respectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is responsible for monitoring North Korea's adherence to its obligations under the Non- Proliferation Treaty. The UK fully supports the work of the IAEA through its contribution to that organisation.
<P>

<a name="81201w14.html_para0">In addition, the UK, through the EU, is strongly committed to the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO), as the best means of resolving the issue of nuclear proliferation on the Korean Peninsula. The EU is a member of the KEDO Executive Board, making a substantial contribution of 15 million ecu a year for five years, of which the UK share is some &#163;1.7 million a year.

 We and our EU partners regularly raise the status of Christians in Pakistan with the Government of Pakistan, most recently at a meeting of the EU Troika and Pakistan on 25 November. I raised our concerns for all religious minorities in Pakistan with the Interior Minister when I visited Pakistan last year, as did my noble Friend the Under Secretary in January of this year. As EU Presidency, we led a demarche on Pakistan's blasphemy laws on 14 May, and participated in a further demarche on 19 October.

<P>
<P>
<a name="81201w14.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Embassy itself does not purchase alcoholic drinks: they are bought by Embassy staff on an individual basis. Annual expenditure by individual members of staff on official entertainment does not distinguish between alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks and food. It is therefore not possible to say how much was spent on alcoholic drinks in any one year.

 The membership of the Royal Commission on Long-Term Care of the Elderly includes people with knowledge of the public and independent sectors, health and social care, housing, finance and consumer affairs. They were chosen for their skills and experience, rather than to represent particular interests. Age Concern, Help the Aged and the National Pensioners Convention are members of the commission's reference group, which includes charities and other organisations representing people who may find themselves in long-term care; the financial services sector; the NHS; local government and other service provider bodies; and representatives of the major faiths in the United Kingdom. By this means, the commission is drawing on the most up-to-date experience of users and carers.
