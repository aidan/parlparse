<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60327w01.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The World Bank&#039;s Africa Action Plan, which forms part of the World Bank&#039;s response to the commitments made at Gleneagles last June and was endorsed by bank governors at their annual meeting in Washington in September, proposed the establishment of a Catalytic Growth Fund&quot;. Its purpose is to help Africa make faster progress on meeting the MDGs, particularly the hardest-to-reach&quot; ones like health and access to water, and increasing the rate of economic growth. Its aim is to complement other sources of development financing, including those from the International Development Association (IDA), while, at the same time, being innovative and creative in supporting countries that have shown an ability to make good use of increased amounts of aid, as well as countries with reforming and post-conflict Governments that show a commitment to reducing poverty. Money will also be given to regional projects to deal with needs that cross borders.

We welcome the Bank&#039;s agreement that use of the Fund will be guided by the priorities of the Africa Partnership Forum and that the World Bank will ensure regular consultations with Fund donors, African Governments and regional institutions.

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60327w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The Department for International Development (DFID) is strongly committed to the targets set out in the Framework for Sustainable Development on the Government Estate. During the refurbishments of our UK offices we incorporated many energy saving mechanisms; for instance, a new building management system allow us to monitor and manage energy usage to a much greater extent than in the past. DFID has also installed energy efficient heating systems and lighting systems which are movement sensitive and take account of natural lighting levels. An environment management system has been implemented at both UK offices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_2">DFID is also currently installing timers to regulate energy usage and additional sub-meters to monitor our energy usage even more closely in the future. We have ensured that 100 per cent. electricity used in our main UK offices is from renewable sources and we are also currently investigating additional options such as combined heat and power plants, solar panels and a wind turbine at our East Kilbride office. The design for the refurbishment of our East Kilbride office has received an excellent&quot; and the London office a very good&quot; rating under the Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment Methodology (BREEAM). We are also actively encouraging staff to use energy 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Mar 2006 : Column 624W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
efficiently, for instance by switching off equipment when not in use rather than simply leaving on stand-by&quot;. DFID is also in the process of arranging under the Carbon Trust Framework Agreement, a carbon management programme including an energy audit of both UK offices.

 This year, DFID will spend around &#163;250 million in India&#151;the Department&#039;s largest country programme in the world.

<a name="stpa_3">DFID&#039;s India programme supports the achievement of the Government of India&#039;s (GoI) 10th Plan and Millennium Development Goal (MDG) poverty reduction targets, as outlined in our India Country Assistance Plan (CAP) for 2004&#150;08 (available on DFID&#039;s website www.dfid.gov.uk).

<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_4">The programme is provided in close partnership with the Union Government and the State Governments of Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Orissa and West Bengal.

economic growth. Our funds are directed at increasing access to basic education and health and to improving the lives of poor people in rural and urban areas. We also promote better management of the environment and support activities to empower the poor, especially women and those who are less able to represent themselves.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_5">For example, in West Bengal, our Kolkata Urban Services for the Poor Programme aims to help slum dwellers directly, through funding improvements to slum infrastructure (for example; better drainage, road systems, latrines, solid waste management), and indirectly and in the longer term through supporting overall city management, building in a poverty focus to urban planning, strengthening urban management systems, and working to help municipal authorities become more accountable to citizens. A parallel programme operates in Andhra Pradesh and one is also planned for Madhya Pradesh.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_6">In Andhra Pradesh, our Rural Livelihoods Project supports the State Government in helping poor rural households to develop new livelihood options and landless farmers to earn income from the use of common lands through better use of water in drought-prone areas. The project aims to extend the reach of these schemes to target the poorest and most excluded groups including women, Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_7">Alongside assistance to its four focus states, DFID is strengthening its National Programme to provide significant resources for central programmes in key areas, including health and education where progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) needs to accelerate. For example, DFID is currently supporting the Government of India&#039;s Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (Education for All) programme with a &#163;210 million commitment in close collaboration with other donors. This programme is aimed at ensuring that by 2010, all children in India receive eight years of basic education of acceptable quality regardless of sex, caste, creed, family income or location and has already resulted in a reduction in the number of out of school children from 25 million in 2003 to 13.5 million in March 2005. DFID is also financing over 20 per cent. (&#163;128 million) of the Government of India&#039;s National Polio Eradication Programme, which has succeeded in confining this disease to only a few isolated pockets in the country.

<p>
<a name="60327w01.html_para9">

 Spending on transport infrastructure within Norfolk over the last five years has taken place via the funding Norfolk receive as part of their Local Transport Plan settlement and the Highways Agency investment to support the strategic highway network within Norfolk. The following figures are the yearly allocations for local transport funding, comprising capital funding for integrated transport and the funding allocations for local transport major schemes within Norfolk.

<p><a name="st_23"><a name="60327w04.html_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22 March 2006]:</i> A range of appraisal information including assessments using the New Approach to Transport Appraisal system, is required alongside all schemes submitted to the department for funding. Traffic forecasts are used by scheme promoters as part of these appraisals. There is departmental guidance available to promoters, setting out the appropriate use of forecasting techniques, to ensure that traffic is realistically forecasted. The forecasts are checked by the promoters, such as the Highways Agency or other appropriate body, and by the department&#039;s modellers. The full appraisal is finally inspected by the department as part of the value for money assessment, to provide Ministers with advice on the case for a particular scheme.

<i>[holding answer 22 March 2006]:</i> The Department, as a matter of routine, expects to assess the impacts arising from major transport schemes which it has supported against the forecasts originally made, in order to learn lessons for future schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w04.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_29">With regard to rail, the Department has been monitoring the usage of section one of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link against the original forecasts, as reported by the National Audit Office in their report Progress on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link&quot;, published in July 2005.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport which major <i>(a)</i> road, <i>(b)</i> rail and <i>(c)</i> other schemes approved since 1997 have assessed future patronage or traffic levels based on (i) a fixed trip matrix and (ii) other forecast models.  [60595]</p>








<p><a name="st_25"><a name="60327w04.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22 March 2006]:</i> The Department does not ordinarily compile information on the modelling technique used by external promoters in assessing future patronage; to compile a list of schemes on this basis would be prohibitively expensive. However, scheme promoters are expected to use appropriate techniques in the appraisals of a project, using the guidance published by the Department.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w04.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_31">Since 1997, of some sixty Highways Agency road schemes that have been approved, around 90 per cent. were appraised using a fixed trip matrix method to assess future traffic levels; a similar proportion would be expected for local authority major road schemes. The &#039;elasticity&#039; approach has been the alternative used in larger schemes. This technique models the growth in traffic induced by the completion of a transport improvement&#151;something a fixed trip matrix would notdo. The Department for Transport has recently published guidance for road scheme promoters to encourage greater use of improved &#039;variable demand&#039; appraisal techniques. All rail schemes are assessed using an &#039;elasticity&#039; approach. In the largest schemes, affecting a number of modes, full multi-modal studies are conducted which would better articulate modal change as well as induced traffic.

We have encouraged end users, particularly gas-fired power stations and other energy intensive industrial consumers, to respond to price signals by reducing demand and switching to alternative fuels where possible. We have sought to improve the operation of the market by making more information available on a timely basis through the voluntary agreement with the offshore industry, and by encouraging the Futures and Options Association to develop an action plan for improving the liquidity of the gas and electricity markets.

 The UK energy market is one of the most liberalised in the world. The UK is giving the European Commission our full support to ensure that EU energy markets are also open and competitive. As 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Mar 2006 : Column 640W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
the Chancellor noted in his budget speech, incomplete liberalisation of EU energy markets is a factor in high gas prices and at the Spring European Council the UK will propose that the energy and other sectors which fail to liberalise and open up to Competition should be subject to independent investigation and enforcement. This work has been ongoing in the energy sector for some time; the Commission launched a sector inquiry into EU gas and electricity markets in June 2005 and the UK gave this prominence during our Presidency of the EU in the second half of last year. The Commission recently reported the preliminary findings of this inquiry and identified a number of areas of concern. We expect the Commission to remedy the defects it has found.

 As indicated in the BBC Charter Review White Paper published on 14 March, responses to last year&#039;s Green Paper consultation identified a range of groups with a case for concessionary TV licences, pensioners below the age of 75; people on low incomes; partially sighted people; students; people in hostels for homeless people; members of the armed services; and catering staff in communal accommodation. However, there was no clear consensus on how such concessions should be allocated or funded and the White Paper therefore proposes no changes to the existing concessions. The draft Charter and Agreement was published along with the White Paper and as my right hon.

<p><a name="st_98"><a name="60327w11.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 17 March 2006]:</i> The Pollution Prevention and Control (PPC) system was set up by the Pollution Prevention and Control (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 and encompasses (i)regulation by the Environment Agency of industrial installations subject to the requirements of the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive, and (ii) regulation by local authorities of some 23,000 generally smaller industrial installations in respect of their emissions to air. Local authorities are also responsible for the regulation of about 10 per cent. of the some 4,500 installations subject to IPPC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w11.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_85">These regulators recover their costs through charges made to each operator who holds a permit issued under the PPC system. The income from these charges is set out in the tables which cover the annual periods from 2000, in which year the PPC Regulations came into force. The increasing income to the Environment Agency arises because installations subject to IPPC requirements are being phased into the new system according to a timetable laid down in the PPC Regulations extending from late 2000 to early 2007. Many of those installations were already subject to integrated pollution control under the system introduced by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and which IPPC is superseding. The local authority income from charges does not vary so much from year to year because it includes income from the predecessor controls under Part I of the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w11.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_86">While these charges account for a large part of the administrative costs of the PPC system, operators may also incur costs directly in preparing applications for permits and, on a recurring basis, responding to routine monitoring and other information requirements of their permits. No estimates of these on an annual basis are available.

 Only rifles classified as Beyond Repair are cannibalised for spare parts. Since January 2004 a total of 300 Cadet rifles have been so categorised. The process of cannibalisation is managed at unit level and information on the numbers of rifles involved is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 There is currently no administrative backlog of appeals at the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal (AIT).

Those cases experienced a delay in initial processing (acknowledgment and issue of papers to the respondent requesting the appeal bundle) of up to 16 weeks.

As a result of work load volumes, and the clearance of backlogged cases, the AIT is currently listing entry clearance and family visit appeals at 16 weeks from receipt of the appeal bundle. This represents a departure of between eight and 12 weeks from steady-state time scales.

 The Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment has a dedicated enforcement team which investigates incidents of illegal dumping and prepares cases, where appropriate, for the Public Prosecution Service (PPS).

 Migrant workers in Northern Ireland are entitled to the same employment rights and working conditions as other workers, including benefiting from the laws relating to the conduct of employment agencies.

They establish a framework of minimum standards that the work-seekers and employers who use employment agencies can expect, including establishing the suitability of work-seekers for vacancies, agreeing terms and conditions, placing controls on client accounts and record-keeping, and clarifying arrangements for charges and fees. Under the 1981 Order, the Department for Employment and Learning has responsibility for enforcing the legislation, including powers to prosecute offenders and in more serious cases, seeking a prohibition notice from an industrial tribunal to prevent an individual from operating an agency for up to ten years.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what enforcement measures are in place to ensure that existing regulations on the use of asbestos are adhered to.  [59004]</p>








<p><a name="st_230"><a name="60327w25.html_spnew10"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 The Asbestos (Prohibitions) Regulations 1992 prohibit the importation, supply and use (namely the manufacture) of asbestos and asbestos-containing products into the United Kingdom. The Health & Safety Executive (HSE) are the enforcing authority for these regulations and to their knowledge there is no manufacture of asbestos-containing products within the UK. HSE have the authority to grant exceptions to the prohibition of supply and importation. Such an exemption is granted only in exceptional circumstances with strict conditions applied by HSE.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w25.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_183">However, asbestos-containing materials were widely used up to the implementation of these regulations. Although it is difficult to give a precise figure, it was estimated in 2000, that 500,000 commercial premises contain asbestos products. Asbestos products present no risk to a person unless its condition deteriorates and asbestos fibres are released. Therefore the principal duty on the person in control of these premises is Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 regulation 4, commonly known as the Duty to Manage. HSE Inspectors and Local Authority Environmental Health Officers enforce this legislation. The Duty to Manage is one of the strands of HSE&#039;s Disease Reduction Programme, which sets out a schedule of work to seek compliance with this legislation. There is a range of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Mar 2006 : Column 712W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
enforcement powers available to secure compliance, including the issue of enforcement notices and taking legal proceedings.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w25.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_184">When work has to be carried out on the asbestos material, including its removal, then it is subject to the Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations. This requires that prior to the commencement of work that a suitable risk assessment is carried out to determine the appropriate control measures required to prevent, or reduce to the lowest level practicable, exposure to asbestos fibres. HSE Inspectors and Local Authority Environmental Health Officers have the same enforcement powers as for the Duty to Manage Asbestos.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w25.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_185">For high-risk activities, work is also subject to Asbestos (Licensing) Regulations 1983. These prohibit an employer or self-employed person from carrying out any significant work with asbestos insulation, asbestos coatings and asbestos insulating board unless HSE&#039;s Asbestos Licensing Unit has granted them a licence. The applicant is subject to a rigorous assessment prior to any licence being granted. HSE have the authority to apply any conditions on a licence, refuse, amend, or revoke a licence. A licence is granted for a fixed period and the applicant is subject to a further assessment on re-application. A condition on all licences is that work with asbestos is notified to the relevant enforcing authority. HSE carry out site visits for a sample of this notified work, and if acceptable standards are not met take suitable enforcement action, which includes letters, enforcement notices and prosecutions. In addition relevant information is fed-back to the Asbestos Licensing Unit, to enable the terms and conditions of an individual licence to be continually reviewed.

<i>[holding answer 16 March 2006]:</i> There have been no changes in the decision-making process for the referral of cases of potential fraud for criminal investigation since April 2003. The current process is based on a computerised scoring system, the Fraud Referral Intelligent Scorecard (FRISc). Using this system, each referral is given a score based on pre-determined criteria. Cases that attain a score above a set level are referred for investigation by the Fraud Investigation Service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w26.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_187">From 1 April 2006, we are introducing a revised referral decision system that will also identify cases that require action at a level below the criminal law standard. Cases identified under the new system will be referred for action by Customer Compliance Officers. Customer Compliance Officers will deal with cases of lower level fraud, enabling the Fraud Investigation Service to concentrate its resource on cases requiring criminal investigation.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_111">There are a number of changes raised in the Green Paper which we don&#039;t intend to pursue at this time. These include further reform of disregards, tapers and non-dependent deductions.

<a name="stpa_190">Although we have not taken forward the options in the Green Paper, there have been reforms to the non-dependent deduction scheme. From October 2003, if the householder or their partner is aged 65 or more, and a non-dependant moves into their home or an existing non-dependant&#039;s circumstances change to increase the deduction, then the start of the deduction or increase in deduction is delayed for 26 weeks. Also, from April 2005, if the non-dependant is on pension credit, no deduction is made in respect of that non-dependant.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether consent orders by courts may be <i>(a)</i> taken into account and <i>(b)</i> over-ridden by the Child Support Agency in assessing non-resident parents for maintenance in a case where a non-resident parent has agreed to pay sums in lieu of maintenance.  [59352]</p>








<p><a name="st_253"><a name="60327w28.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 There are only limited circumstances in which sums paid to an ex-partner in lieu of ongoing maintenance can be taken into account.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w28.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_206">Under the new child support scheme non-resident parents and parents with care may apply for a variation&quot; to the maintenance calculation. A non-resident parent can apply to have their maintenance reduced to reflect a transfer of property or capital to the parent with care.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w28.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_207">This applies where the transfer was valued at &#163;5,000 or more and was made as a result of a court order or written maintenance agreement made prior to 5 April 1993, and the transfer was made in lieu of ongoing child maintenance. These were often referred to as clean break&quot; settlements. In all other cases transfers of property or capital cannot be reflected in maintenance liabilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w28.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_208">A variation is allowed only where it is just and equitable&quot;. Broadly this means that the result of the variation must be fair, taking account of all the circumstances of the case, and, in particular, the welfare of any child likely to be affected. This includes the child for whom maintenance is paid as well as any other children living with either parent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w28.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_209">An order for periodical payments of maintenance made, by consent or otherwise, before 3 March 2003 will usually prevent an application for child support maintenance unless the parent with care has claimed a prescribed benefit. Such an order made after that date will prevent an application for a year, again unless the parent with care claims benefit. When a maintenance calculation is made in a case where an order exists, that part of the order which provides for periodical payment of maintenance ceases to have effect.

 In cases assessed under the new scheme, child support liability is based on the non-resident parent&#039;s net weekly income and the number of children in their previous and current families.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w28.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_210">When a child maintenance application is made there is often a gap between the date the responsibility for maintenance begins and the date the maintenance calculation is completed. Voluntary payments made during this period may be offset against any arrears which exist once maintenance has been calculated. If the total amount of the voluntary payments exceeds any arrears, the amount payable under a current maintenance calculation can be reduced to take account of those voluntary payments but the amount payable cannot be reduced to less than &#163;5 per week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w28.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_211">These voluntary payments can include those made by non-resident parents for child maintenance, to provide for some of the basic needs of their children, or for household bills (such as mortgage repayments or for gas or electricity costs).

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_132">The new child support scheme was introduced on 3 March 2003. It has been well publicised that there has been a number of technical problems with the performance of the new computer system (CS2) from this date. A great deal of work has been carried out to improve the stability of the new computer system (CS2) and operational performance has improved to the point where contracted service levels are now consistently being met.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_133">There are still a number of defects in the CS2 computer system which can prevent some cases from progressing.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_134">Where a payment has not been issued by the system a manual payment can be requested. The Agency has a process for manual payments which has reduced delays in issuing such payments to clients. In such circumstances, a hold is placed on the computer system to prevent it from releasing the funds pending recovery and adjustment of the accounts. Further investigation is taking place to ensure that this system is effective.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_135">We have around 3,400 customers who are regularly paid their maintenance manually.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what criteria he uses to decide whether potential contractors are a bad financial risk.  [60583]</p>








<p><a name="st_259"><a name="60327w29.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Prior to the formal tendering stage of the procurement process, the Department requires potential contractors to complete and submit a detailed &#039;Pre-Qualification Questionnaire&#039; (PQQ), developed by the Office of Government Commerce, which provides the basis for selecting potential contractors to be invited to tender. The financial information required via the PQQ comprises the last two years&#039; audited accounts, or, where audited accounts are not available, turnover, profit and loss, cash flow details and end-period balance sheet. The PQQ also seeks separate information regarding the turnover which enables us to assess the capacity of the organisation to fulfil the contract.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60327w29.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_216">The PQQ is analysed by procurement and financial experts to determine whether or not the potential contractor is capable of undertaking the required work, and is also financially able to take the work on. This helps to prevent the Department entering into a contract with a financially exposed supplier.

 On this issue, HSE supports the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA), who have overall responsibility for burial law, to ensure that the safety of headstones is taken into account as part of the overall management of cemeteries. In 2004, the Chairman of the Health and Safety Commission wrote to all Local Authority Chief Executives, setting out the need for a sensitive and proportionate approach to headstone safety. HSE is now assisting the DCA in preparing advice, which, following consultation, they plan to publish later this year.

 Our Welfare Reform Green Paper sets out proposals that will build on the success of Pathways to Work. To ensure our reforms are successful and that we deliver the best services possible, we are working with customers and their representatives, employers and medical professionals to increase awareness of the needs of all groups, including those with mental health conditions. We know that nearly four out of 10 people who claim incapacity benefit have a mental health condition and the longer people remain on the benefit; the more likely they are to develop mental health conditions.

<a name="stpa_232">One of the key principles of Pathways to Work is inclusion and support for all, and it is important that claimants attend and participate in their scheduled work-focused interviews to maintain contact and take advantage of the support that is on offer. Everyone who wants to work, whatever their health condition or disability, should get the appropriate help and support to enable them to work as soon as they are able to do so. With that support the prospects for the majority of people are good. To provide this advice and support we have invested heavily in training for personal advisers and in condition management programmes in Pathways to Work areas.

 The intention is to create a more compact Registered Body network, working in greater partnership with the CRB and composed of high-volume users. This will allow the CRB to focus its resources more effectively to improve compliance and support the evolving role of Registered Bodies. It will also give the CRB the ability to deregister those Registered Bodies that repeatedly fail to adhere to regulations. Overall, the reduction will enhance efficiency and improve standards within the Registered Body network, through the introduction of an annual threshold of applications per Registered Body. This is a key part of the CRB&#039;s strategy. The CRB is committed to ensuring that organisations wishing to access the CRB&#039;s service can continue to do so.

 The Identity Cards Bill amends the Football Spectators Act 1989 to make it clear that an identity card issued to a British citizen falls within the definition of travel authorisation&quot;. This ensures that travel restrictions can be imposed. However, to ensure that anyone subject to restrictions for an extended period of time can demonstrate their identity for domestic purposes, they will be able to obtain an identity card which will be issued to the same standards as other cards but which will not be valid for travel. This will be achieved by not specifying the nationality of the card holder on the face of the card.

 The National Identity Register will be classified as part of the nation&#039;s Critical National Infrastructure and security procedures to protect the Register will reflect this status. Security risk assessments have been conducted on issues such as the physical, logical, procedural, personnel and systems aspects of the identity card scheme to ensure such necessary procedures are implemented correctly and are sufficiently comprehensive. In addition, all security aspects of the scheme will be subject to a security accreditation process which must be passed before the scheme can be launched. However, it would not be appropriate to give more detailed information about security contingency planning for the scheme as to do so would jeopardise future integrity of such arrangements.

 In May 2006 the 101 service will be launched in two of the First Wave 101 Partnership areas (Hampshire/Isle of Wight and Cardiff).

Successful use of both 999 and 101 will depend upon a significant marketing and public education campaign. The 101 programme will not only reduce calls to 999 but also provide better access to advice, information and improve action concerning community safety issues.

<sup>(43)</sup>Total strength is based on full-time equivalent figures that have been rounded to the nearest whole number, because of rounding there may be an apparent discrepancy between these totals and the totals in other tables. Between 1986&#150;1995 the full-time equivalent figures were based on estimations. Figures exclude those staff on career breaks or maternity/paternity unless otherwise stated.<br>

<sup>(44)</sup>Civilian staff have been referred to as police staff since March 2003. Figures exclude traffic wardens, police community support officers and designated officers (s.38).<br>

<sup>(45)</sup>Strength figures for civilian staff were collected by HMIC from 1986 until 1995. The research development and statistics section within the Home Office, have been collecting and publishing this data since March 1996.<br>

The responsibility for the provision of health services, including mental health services, to prisoners in publicly run prisons transferred from the Home Office to the Department of Health in 2003. The Department of Health has in turn devolved funding and responsibility for prison health to national health service primary care trusts, which work in partnerships with prisons to commission and deliver services.

The three stages are: informal investigation by the local office, formal investigation by the chief officer or a senior officer nominated by the CO, and finally the appeal stage when a panel of three board members hears the appeal. The ombudsman may accept complaints that are referred to him within one month of the complainant receiving the result of the appeal.

Key elements of the strategy focus on the development of effective and proportionate protective security arrangements and ensuring that we are prepared to respond effectively to, and recover from, a terrorist attack. We do not comment on the specifics of the operational activity across the UK as this could assist those who may wish to perpetrate acts of terrorism. As I announced on 25 January, the Government have provided for 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08 a total of &#163;446 million specifically for countering the international terrorist threat and domestic extremism.

<i>[holding answer 21 March 2006]:</i> No representations have been made to other Governments regarding the partial suspension of the Schengen Agreement during the 2006 world cup. Such a decision by the host or transit country would have no significant impact upon the English and Welsh strategy for preventing English football disorder during the tournament. This is because the strategy is based on preventing known risk fans from leaving England and Wales during the tournament rather than on the reintroduction of border controls in host or transit countries.

 The Government have stated their commitment to a national bowel cancer screening programme, for which funding has been agreed.

<a name="stpa_277">Five programme hubs across England will invite men and women to participate in the screening programme, send out the faecal occult blood (FOB) testing kits, interpret kits and send results out. 90 to 100 local screening centres will provide endoscopy services for the two per cent. of men and women who have a positive FOB test result.

<p>
<a name="60327w40.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_278">NHS Cancer Screening Programmes are currently assessing where the five programme hubs will be located. The English bowel cancer screening pilot site at the Hospital of St. Cross, Rugby, Warwickshire, is expected to become the first programme hub when national roll-out begins. It is hoped to establish the other four programme hubs by March 2007, with announcements to be made in due course.

When account is taken of the lower expenses ratio for dentists with a higher NHS commitment, the estimated average net GDS income for 2004&#150;05 in the table would be about &#163;74,000.

These savings form part of the efficiency opportunities in public funding and regulation costs, a key workstream identified by the Gershon review, Releasing Resources to the Front Line&quot; and therefore will count towards the Department&#039;s total efficiency target of &#163;6.5 billion.

The Department change programme to deliver these reductions was announced in February 2003. The Gershon commitment to 720 net reductions was predicated on this programme and therefore agreement was made with HM Treasury for this specific target for an appropriate earlier baseline date.

These data were to be submitted to competent authorities for subsequent evaluation to assess safety both to humans and the environment.

<sup>(61)</sup>Dentists with a reasonable commitment to the GDS are defined as dentists with GDS earnings equivalent to at least &#163;40,000 in 1993&#150;94 in fees for treatments and patient capitation. This equivalent is calculated each year by adjusting figures to take into account the effect of fee increases. The equivalent figure for 2004&#150;05 is &#163;59,100.<br>

<sup>(62)</sup>Commitment payments started in 2001.<br>

<sup>(63)</sup>Figures since 2000&#150;01 use a different methodology to calculate the contribution from other non-fee/capitation payments.<br>





Note:<br>

Figures converted into real terms using Gross Domestic Product deflator at market prices.<br>

<a name="qnpa_28">When account is taken of the lower expenses ratio for dentists with a higher NHS commitment, the estimated average net GDS income for 2004&#150;05 in the table would be about &#163;74,000. In 2005&#150;06, after allowing for the 3.4 per cent. fee increase, the average would be about &#163;76,500 for a dentist with a reasonable NHS commitment.
