To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many Royal Navy ships have been ordered since May 1997; and on what dates.  [134927]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 On 19 June 2000, the Minister for Defence Procurement announced the placing of an order with Vosper Thornycroft (UK) Ltd. for two new Multi-Role Hydrographic and Oceanographic Survey Vessels together with 25 years contractor support. The ships, to be named HMS Echo and HMS Enterprise, will be built under sub-contract at Appledore Shipbuilders in Devon, and are due to enter service in 2002 and 2003.
<P>

<a name="01102w01.html_para0">During the debate on Defence Procurement on 26 October, I announced that we intended to order four alternative landing ship logistic (ALSLs), subject to negotiation of satisfactory terms and conditions.
<P>

<a name="01102w01.html_para1">I also announced that, subject to final negotiations, we intend to sign a 25-year private finance initiative contract with AWSR Shipping Ltd. to provide for the strategic sealift capability. This will involve the construction of six new roll on roll off (RORO) vessels; two at Harland and Wolff in Northern Ireland and four in a German shipyard.
<P>

<a name="01102w01.html_para2">It is also intended that, subject to satisfactory arrangements being agreed, the order for the first new type 45 Destroyers will be placed later this year. It is planned that the first and third ships will be assembled by BAE Systems Marine and the second by Vosper Thornycroft (UK) Ltd.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement about the future of the TRACER programme as a bilateral programme with the United States of America.  [135834]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2000]:</i> Bilateral collaboration is continuing on the UK's Tactical Reconnaissance Armoured Combat Equipment Requirement (TRACER) and the US Future Scout and Cavalry System (FSCS).
<P>

<a name="01102w01.html_para3">The current phase of the programme is of 42 months duration and finishes in July 2002. The programme is proceeding to schedule and both Governments are pleased with progress to date.
<P>

<a name="01102w01.html_para4">In parallel, the UK is conducting studies to examine the use of unmanned air vehicles to complement ground-based reconnaissance. The outcome of these studies will be used to inform the UK decision on the optimum mix of platforms, technology and sensors and the role that TRACER will play in the Army's future battlefield information gathering.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the non-war graves where maintenance to an appropriate standard is impossible for <i>(a)</i> climatic and <i>(b)</i> political reasons.  [134307]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The standard of maintenance of those service graves designated non-world war graves varies according to the prevailing weather and local climatic conditions in the countries in which the graves are located. I am able to confirm however, that in general there are no non-world war graves that are impossible to maintain to the appropriate standard for climatic reasons, though they may not appear the same as those located in a typical war grave cemetery in, for example, north-west Europe. Local conditions are taken into account when selecting the material used for headstones or markers and the design of the cemetery.
<P>

<a name="01102w01.html_para6">The changing worldwide political situation does mean that at times cemeteries containing war graves and non- world war graves are difficult or impossible to maintain. Currently, activity is restricted or impossible in Algeria, Ambon (Indonesia), Iraq and Mogadishu (Somalia). It can be difficult to maintain cemeteries in Northern Cyprus, parts of the Middle East, particularly Libya and China, and even Northern Ireland for political and security reasons. Restoration work on non-world war graves maintained on our behalf by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Trincomalee (Sri Lanka) is resuming.

<a name="01102w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence from 1 October what will be the annual budget of the Army Casualty Cell at Upavon in respect of non-war graves in <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> overseas.  [134304]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Army Casualty Cell assumed responsibility for overseas non-war graves from 1 October 2000, but will not take over the financial responsibility until April 2001. &#163;180,000 has been allocated for this task. The maintenance of non-war graves in the UK is the responsibility of Land Command and is funded as part of their overall budget for property management. It follows that the Army Casualty Cell has no annual budget for this purpose.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what are the current annual budgets for <i>(a)</i> the Royal Navy and <i>(b)</i> the Royal Air Force in respect of their non-war graves in the UK.  [134306]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force meet the costs of funerals, burial plots, headstones, marker stones and related costs for personnel who die while in service. In financial year 2000-01 the Royal Air Force allocation is &#163;70,000. The Royal Navy allocation is not separately identified. The costs of subsequently maintaining non-war graves are met from local works service budgets and are not separately identified by either service.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence in each of the past five years what has been the annual contribution from British Government sources to the South African Heritage Committee in respect of Boer War graves.  [134297]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Ordinarily, the British Government make an annual donation of &#163;10,000 to the South African Heritage Resource Agency (SAHRA) towards the maintenance of Boer War graves. In 1999, however, it was decided that an additional donation of &#163;5,000 should be paid for three years, ending in 2001. This temporary increase in the contribution was established in order to support the SAHRA's initiative to employ a single contractor to maintain all British graves throughout South Africa.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_wqn7"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the specification is of fuel tankers used by <i>(a)</i> the Army and <i>(b)</i> the other armed services; how this differs from the specification of commercial fuel tankers in use in the UK; and if he will make a statement.  [136061]




<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 2000 : Column: 544W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The armed forces currently use three sizes of bulk fuel tanker (12,000 litre, 22,500 litre and 32,000 litre). The 32,000 litre fuel tanker is commercially based and has a similar specification to modern commercial fuel tankers. It employs commercial standard safety systems, is fully compliant with "Accord European relatif au transport des Marchandises Dangerous par Route (ADR) Directive" requirements and approved for use under the petroleum industry's Safe Loading Pass Scheme (SLPS). The 22,500 litre and 12,000 litre fuel tankers are older; they are not fully compliant with ADR regulations as they were constructed to specifications reflecting Carriage of Dangerous Goods (CDG) regulations in force at the time of manufacture.
<P>

<a name="01102w01.html_para7">In general terms, the specification of military tankers is enhanced to optimise them for military use. Military tankers differ from commercial tankers in the numbers of filling and discharge points; they are fitted with an integral pump to permit cross-loading and kerbside refuellng of convoys and tend to be tougher in construction.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_wqn8"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many service personnel are qualified to drive commercial fuel tankers of the type in use in the UK; how many were qualified to do so on 1 January; how many are undergoing training which would enable them to drive such commercial fuel tankers; and if he will make a statement.  [136060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Some 300 service personnel are qualified to drive commercial fuel tankers--the figure is the same for 1 January--of which 180 could be made available for this purpose. Around 900 additional drivers are currently being trained to drive commercial tankers.

<P>
<a name="01102w02.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Julian Lewis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what changes will be made in courts martial as a result of the incorporation into UK law of the European Convention on Human Rights.  [135060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Changes have already been made so that courts martial procedures are compatible with Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which concerns the right to a fair trial. These were included in the Armed Forces Act 1996, which introduced reforms to reinforce the independence of the courts martial system. The changes came into effect on 1 April 1997.
<P>

<a name="01102w02.html_para0">No further changes to the legislation on the conduct of courts martial are planned as a result of the incorporation into UK law of the European Convention on Human Rights.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There is no Eurolift project for the establishment of an EU air transport command.

 There are currently two similarly named reviews being carried out within the Ministry of Defence.
<P>

<a name="01102w02.html_para1">First, Land Command is conducting an Army Training Estate Site Utility Review. This aims to identify Land Command training areas, camps and ranges which are no longer required in order that they can be closed or sold, thereby saving maintenance costs and where possible generating revenue. The review team will make their recommendations by the end of this calendar year. Secondly, the Army Training and Recruiting Agency is conducting a review into the strategic development of the Agency over the next few years and this may have an impact on its estate. Work is still at a very early stage and no decisions have been taken.

<P>

<a name="01102w02.html_para2">The Registry of Shipping and Seamen (RSS), part of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency issues all campaign stars in respect of Merchant Seamen. The qualifications for the Atlantic Star require that the 1939-45 Star must first have been earned by six months' service at sea and then must be followed by a further six months' service at sea before 8 May 1945, with at least one voyage in the qualifying area ie across the Atlantic, South Atlantic or service in convoys to North Russia. This award is available to all British seafarers who fulfil the criteria.
<P>

<a name="01102w02.html_para3">Merchant Shipping Notice M.279, which sets out the criteria for campaign stars for Merchant Seamen, was published in 1946 and is still in use to assess awards.

 This and other matters relating to the evacuation of trains in an emergency are under review by the Health and Safety Commission. The Railways (Safety Case) Regulations 2000, which were laid before the House on 2 October following proposals from the Commission, will require train operators to revise their safety cases to include, among other things, details of the train evacuation equipment and arrangements which they have in place or propose. These revised safety cases will have to be submitted to the Health and Safety Executive for formal acceptance.

Since privatisation, no public money has been paid direct to Railtrack, but the company's profitability is contingent on public money. Some 90 per cent. of Railtrack's income is paid to the company by TOCs and FOCs in access charges, a substantial proportion of which are supported by public money.<P>

<a name="01102w03.html_para11">The precise size of annual payments in future years will depend on negotiations which the Franchising Director has not yet completed with TOCs and others. Under existing franchises, total subsidy to TOCs is set to fall from some &#163;1.2 billion this year to less than &#163;900 million by 2002-03. Also, the Franchising Director has approved a number of projects under the Rail Passenger Partnership (RPP) scheme, involving commitments to pay some &#163;12 million to TOCs. He is currently considering 23 other possible RPP projects, with potential to generate payments of an additional &#163;53 million. The Ten-Year Plan for Transport provides for substantial extra Government funding to halt the decline in revenue subsidy and for direct payments of renewals capital grant to Railtrack for both passengers and freight. In addition, the Plan provides for a Rail Modernisation Fund of &#163;7 billion to support enhancements of the rail network.

We have no plans to alter this arrangement, which was introduced to ensure that taxpayers do not fully subsidise the costs of people living in the highest value properties. This is consistent with our policy of not supporting such properties on Income Support where help for mortgage interest in new cases is also restricted. However, we are aware of the concerns that remain with this measure and are continuing to monitor the effects of the restriction.

<P>
<a name="01102w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 I will publish a draft Water Bill for public consultation on Monday 6 November. The draft Bill will have three main elements: first, it will contain provisions to improve the management of water through reforms to the abstraction licensing system and by promoting greater water conservation by water companies; second, it will re-introduce the regulatory reform provisions for water that were removed from the Utilities Bill in March 2000. These clauses have been updated since then, mainly to reflect any relevant amendments made to the equivalent energy provisions now in the Utilities Act 2000. The overall aim is to put the consumer at the heart of the regulatory process and to make regulation more open and accountable; and third, the draft Bill will contain a number of other useful but minor improvements to the regulatory systems for water and reservoir safety.
<P>

<a name="01102w04.html_para3">The draft Bill includes provisions to increase the maximum penalty for abstraction and impounding offences and for supplying water unfit for human consumption from &#163;5,000 to &#163;20,000. This reflects the importance the Government attaches to ensuring appropriate fines for water offences. Unlimited fines are available in the crown courts.
<P>

<a name="01102w04.html_para4">The draft Bill will also give new powers to the regulators to fine water companies up to 10 per cent. of their turnover for breaches of their conditions of appointment, or for failure to achieve prescribed standards of performance.
<P>

<a name="01102w04.html_para5">We are also consulting on measures to ensure that customers have easy access to reliable comparative information on water company performance. We are working with the water industry with the aim of developing a pilot scheme. We are also consulting when we publish the draft water bill on introducing any necessary legislation to require companies to provide comparative performance information to customers.
<P>

<a name="01102w04.html_para6">Copies of the draft Bill and covering consultation paper, and an accompanying publication setting out the Government's Regulatory Impact Assessment, Environmental Impact Assessment and a Policy Appraisal for Equal Treatment will be laid before the House at 11am on Monday 6 November.

As a separate exercise, Departments and Agencies that are responsible for managing significant risks faced by the public are drawing up and publishing the framework and procedures they use for reaching decisions on the risks for which they are responsible. Copies of these will be placed in the Library. As of 31 October, risk frameworks had been published by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, the Ministry of Defence, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Environment Agency, the Department for Education and Employment, the Food Standards Agency, the Department of Health, the Health and Safety Executive, the Inland Revenue and the Office for National Statistics.

Among other things, it looked at whether there were any barriers in the planning system to the productivity of this sector.

 In June 1999, the Conclusions of the Cologne European Council called for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be drawn up to make those rights more visible.

<a name="01102w05.html_para4">The Charter is not legally binding. It is addressed to the EU Institutions, and to member states only when they are implementing Union law (Article 51(1)).

It does not create any new powers for the European Court of Justice.

 We have no evidence that equipment licensed for export by this Government has been used by Israeli forces against civilians in the Occupied Territories during the recent violence. We would be concerned if such evidence came to light and continue to monitor the situation closely.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations Her Majesty's Government have made to the Israeli Government about the re-establishment at Mitzpe Hagit in the West Bank of an illegal settlement.  [135471]<P>

<P>
<a name="01102w06.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Government's position remains that all settlements are illegal under international law and undermine the peace process. This applies to Mitzpe Hagit, as to other settlements. The Israeli Government is well aware of our position.

 <i>[holding answer 26 October 2000]:</i> The delegation is currently being finalised. It will include myself and Education Ministers from four overseas territories. The devolved Administrations will make their own decisions on possible representation. The Department for International Development also hopes to be represented at ministerial level.

A number of other UK bodies and Commonwealth bodies based in the UK will also be attending, either as observers to the ministerial conference or as delegates to the parallel symposium and trade fair.

 The Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education (QAA) carries out reviews of the effectiveness of institutional arrangements for the management of the quality and standards of academic provision in all higher education institutions that receive public funding from the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and therefore subscribe to the Agency. The University of Buckingham is an independent university which does not receive any public funding from the HEFCE. There are, therefore, no requirements for any assessments of the work of the University of Buckingham to be undertaken by the QAA. However, the University of Buckingham is a voluntary subscriber to the QAA for academic quality audit.

 All teachers have access to the good quality range of benefits provided by the teachers pension scheme. Employers will not, therefore, need to offer teachers a stakeholder pension. All employers should, however, be considering whether they need to offer access to a stakeholder scheme to any of their staff to ensure that no employee is denied the opportunity to make adequate pension provision.

 The House of Commons Commission settled its dispute with Harmon CFEM Facades (UK) Limited on 16 August 2000 at the figure of &#163;5.26 million, which included a contribution to Harmon's costs. This sum was very substantially less than that claimed by Harmon.
<P>

<a name="01102w10.html_para3">In making the decision to settle, the Commission took into consideration the judgments of His Honour Judge Humphrey Lloyd QC at the liability trial and at the later interim payment hearing. The subsequent decision in the House's favour of Lord Justice Kennedy to grant permission to appeal the interim payment judgment was a significant factor in reducing the amount of the settlement.
<P>

<a name="01102w10.html_para4">In deciding to settle the action the Commission took into account that were the House to be awarded its costs of defending the damages action (due to be heard in April 2001) the prospect of recovering them was nil due to Harmon's insolvency.

In the first half of the current financial year, commencing 27 March, there has been a net loss of 333 post offices. The number of rural closures at the half year stage has declined but there has been an increase in the number of town closures (practically all of which have been force majeure).

 We are taking a regional approach in our response to the drought which is affecting a belt of countries across the whole of Asia. So far we have committed over &#163;5 million for humanitarian assistance in the drought affected countries. Further funds have been set aside to respond to needs in Central Asia specifically. We are currently considering proposals from a number of international agencies, including UN organisations, the Red Cross and international NGOs.

<a name="01102w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 Over the last 10 years, this Department (and its predecessor) has provided emergency aid in a large number of major disasters and it would take a long time to retrieve the details requested. However, since 1997 this Department has provided humanitarian assistance on more than 80 occasions in over 60 countries. During 2000, DFID has provided speedy and appropriate relief to a number of disasters, including floods in West Bengal, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Cambodia, a hurricane in Belize, typhoon and tidal wave in North Korea and droughts in Asia and East Africa. We have also continued to provide humanitarian assistance to people affected by conflict in many countries, such as Afghanistan, Sierra Leone and Sudan.
<P>

<a name="01102w14.html_para0">Where disasters occur frequently or result in prolonged crises, we are increasingly promoting preparedness and mitigation measures as part of longer-term development programmes. This includes analysing common hazards and their impact on poor people, and assessing the effect of recurrent crises on achieving the targets of sustainable international development.
<P>

<a name="01102w14.html_para1">We are working to strengthen the international humanitarian system. For example, we are working with the Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to improve their preparedness and response to disasters, specifically in poor countries. We are supplying the United Nations organisations such as the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Food Programme, the United Nations Children Fund, and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, to improve the speed and effectiveness of their responses. We are encouraging the international non-governmental organisations to strengthen standards of assistance for those affected by disasters.

 Together with the civil service code itself, the procedure to be followed in such circumstances is set out in this Department's staff handbook. Three senior officers are designated as being available to advise staff and to investigate such complaints. Staff have the right to approach them at any time. The procedures also provide for the right to raise such matters with the permanent secretary and, if necessary, with the Civil Service Commissioners. Staff may also be protected by the provisions of the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998.

 My right hon. Friend and I liaise regularly with ministerial colleagues about sport in schools and physical education. The Government are particularly aware of the potential of sport as a tool for educating young people about health and fitness and for helping them to develop a healthy and safe life style, hence initiatives such as Positive Futures, a joint project involving Sport England, the Youth Justice Board and the UK Anti-Drugs Co-ordination Unit, which aims to help vulnerable children avoid drug misuse and crime through sporting activities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w14.html_spnew5"><B> Janet Anderson: </B> 
 Based on information provided by the BBC, the answers to the hon. Member's questions are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> the number of people aged 75 or over who do not own a television set is not known, but over 97 per cent. of all households have television;</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> 0.5 million households who currently qualify for a concessionary television licence include a person aged 75 or over;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> no information is available on the age of the person who has previously paid the television licence fee in households where there is a resident aged 75 or over; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(d)</i> an estimated 3.1 million households which currently pay the full licence fee will receive a free licence from 1 November.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="01102w14.html_para3">Television licences cover households rather than individuals, so presenting the above figures as a proportion of the total number of people aged 75 or over would be misleading. There are an estimated 4.35 million people aged 75 or over in the United Kingdom, all of whom are entitled to benefit from a free television licence, but the estimated number of free licences that will be issued is 3.6 million.

 We consider that doctors should not prescribe cannabis until the quality, safety and efficacy of a medical form have been scientifically established and a marketing authorisation issued by the Medical Control Agency. This is a procedure that all prospective new medicines must go through.

<P>
<a name="01102w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We made clear in Local Authority Circular (98)20, copies of which are available in the Library, that although a child's ethnic origin, culture, language and religion are significant factors to be taken into account when adoption agencies are considering the most appropriate placement for a child, it is unacceptable for a child to be denied loving adoptive parents solely on the grounds that the child and adopters do not share the same racial or cultural background.
<P>

<a name="01102w16.html_para6">Although age is one consideration among many that is taken into account in assessing the suitability of prospective adopters, the guidance also makes it clear that there should be no upper age restriction to people applying to become adoptive parents. It is clear that for far too long children drift in the care system when suitable adopters are available.
<P>

<a name="01102w16.html_para7">In February, my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced a review of adoption services. In July, the report by the Performance and Innovation Unit was published for consultation. We will be publishing a White Paper on adoption before the end of the year. In addition, as part of our commitment to modernising services, we will be publishing, for consultation, a draft set of evidence-based national standards for adoption.

 We are committed to improving the working conditions and moral of staff in the National Health Service by becoming a better employer. We recognise that a well motivated work force, able to manage a healthy work-life balance and fairly rewarded, will provide a better service to patients. For the last two years pay awards recommended by the independent review bodies have been implemented in full. Since 1997 nurses have had a 15 per cent. pay rise.
<P>

<a name="01102w17.html_para4">On 4 October, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State published the human resources performance framework which will measure for the first time the way in which NHS employers treat their staff, and which will link their performance to the resources they receive. An integral part of the framework is the new improving working lives standard. This introduces a kite-marking system for NHS employers to demonstrate how they are improving the working lives of all their staff. By April 2003, all NHS employers are expected to be accredited as putting the IWL standard into practice.

An additional &#163;6 million in 2001-02, rising to &#163;8 million in 2003-04, is being invested to extend occupational health services for staff in the NHS. An extra &#163;140 million is being invested by 2003-04 in personal development and training, to provide access to learning for all NHS staff.

In addition the Department will shortly introduce a "whistleblowing" policy covering disclosures by staff of malpractice, illegal acts or serious omissions of duty at work. The policy has been developed in line with the best practice advised by the Public Interest Disclosure Act 1998. It enables staff to raise--at an early stage and in the right way--any concerns they may have about activities within the Department.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Data are taken from the Published Departmental Report for GMS data.<P>

2. Personal Medical Services (PMS) and Personal Dental Services(PDS) schemes are Primary Care Act pilots designed to test locally managed approaches to the delivery of primary care. PDS and PMS expenditure figures, although not allocations, exclude any related capital investment by NHS trusts. PDS expenditure figures are also gross of patient charge income whereas allocations are net of charges.<P>

3. From 1993-94 onwards, gross HCHS revenue, gross NHS revenue and NHS total gross expenditure is inflated because of the interest dividends paid by NHS Trusts.<P>

4. Please note that Discretionary GMS data were not available in 1998-99 as they did not start until 1990-91.<P>

 An upgrade of the current mortuary facilities at Trafford General Hospital took place in 1998 so that it would meet the necessary minimum standards. Trafford Healthcare National Health Service Trust is now in the process of developing a business case for a new mortuary and this has the support of the north-west regional office of the NHS Executive.

<P>
<a name="01102w19.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps he plans to take to improve the recruitment and retention of occupational therapists in the NHS.  [122908]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The national recruitment, retention and vacancy survey published September 1999 gave us the latest authoritative data on staff vacancies from 98 per cent. of National Health Service trusts. They show that only 1.9 per cent. of occupational therapy posts have been vacant for three months or more (in England). The Government are ensuring that effective recruitment and retention policies are in place to make the best use of trained staff and that training levels are sufficient to get a better match between supply and demand.
<P>

<a name="01102w19.html_para0">We are taking a number of steps which will help to address the issue of recruitment and retention of occupational therapists. These include the publication of the framework for the management of human resources for the whole of the NHS, "Working Together: securing a quality workforce for the NHS", which sets targets for local employers to improve recruitment and retention year on year. We have issued guidance to the service on improving working lives and we will shortly be issuing guidance on lifelong learning and continuing professional development.




<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 2000 : Column: 606W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01102w19.html_para1">We are also modernising services and modernising employment practice in the NHS: developing more supportive, flexible and family friendly working practices; extending and improving investment in lifelong learning and professional development; tackling violence and racism in the workplace; involving staff in the way services are delivered and in the changes and developments that affect their working lives.
<P>

<a name="01102w19.html_para2">We have accepted in full the pay increases recommended by the Pay Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (including occupational therapist) for 2000-01. The review body has recommended an across-the-board increase of 3.4 per cent. for 2000-01. Experienced staff will receive total increases of up to 8.4 per cent.

 A major reform of company car tax, to be implemented from April 2002, was announced by the Chancellor in the 1999 Budget, following a review of the system in the light of criticism of its inherent perverse incentives for some company car users to drive extra, unnecessary business miles. The main details of how the system will work in practice were announced in a Budget 2000 press release (Rev6)--'Protecting the environment: Reform of company car taxation' as legislated for the Finance Act 2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent assessment he has made of the arrangements for the delivery of health care services in prisons in England.  [134384]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 A comprehensive assessment of the arrangements for delivering health care services in prisons was conducted prior to the publication of "The Future Organisation of Prison Health Care" in March 1999. The programme of reform set out in that report requires each prison and health authority jointly to review the health needs of the local prison population and to develop joint improvement plans by the end of March 2001.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w20.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to make available specific ring-fenced funds for health-related service improvements in prisons in England.  [134387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Prison Service funds are not generally ring-fenced for particular purposes. The reform and improvement of prison health care is a high priority for the Government and this will be reflected in business plans and financial allocations within the Prison Service for 2001-04. Provisional plans are for significant additional investment in health care over this period, including up to &#163;35 million to rebuild or refurbish those prison health care centres in England and Wales that most badly need it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The joint work programme of the prison health policy unit and the prison health task force was set out in the "Prison Health Handbook", which was published in September 2000. Copies have been placed in the Library. These will publish a joint annual report on their work.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government's policy on responsibilities for prison health care was set out in the report "The Future Organisation of Prison Health Care", published in March 1999. That document sets out the rationale for an approach based on a partnership between the Prison Service and the NHS as the best way of meeting the health care needs of prisoners.

<P>
<a name="01102w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Without more detail I am not sure to which haulier the hon. Member is referring. Any haulier who suspects that persons are concealed in their vehicle should report the matter immediately to the authorities, whether in the United Kingdom or abroad. To do otherwise may give rise to suspicion that they are deliberately involved in facilitating the illegal entry of such persons. If a haulier has taken proper measures to secure his vehicle in accordance with the Code of Practice for Vehicles, he will have grounds for establishing a defence against the Civil Penalty that may be imposed. Where a penalty is imposed there are thirty days in which to lodge a notice objecting to liability.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if, in his review of sentencing policy, extending the right of appeal against lenient sentences to include the offence of the sale of drugs to children will be considered.  [134532]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Rights of appeal, whether by the prosecution or the defence, are not within the terms of reference of the current Review of the Sentencing Framework.
<P>

<a name="01102w21.html_para0">However, on 24 July my hon. Friend the Minister of State announced an extension of the Attorney-General's powers to refer unduly lenient sentences to the Court of Appeal for review. From 21 August 2000, the Attorney- General has been able to refer sentences imposed for drug trafficking offences, including the offence of supplying a controlled drug. There is no separate offence of supplying drugs to children.

 The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Appeals Panel will naturally take account of the judgment in making determinations under the tariff-based criminal injuries compensation scheme. The Government will

consider whether greater clarification of the terms "full recovery" and "continuing disability" would be helpful in any future amendment of the scheme and its accompanying tariff of injuries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w21.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures are presently under discussion at EU level for combating money laundering through <i>(a)</i> the Internet and <i>(b)</i> electronic currency transfers.  [134810]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 A number of measures have been taken or are currently under consideration in this area.
<P>

<a name="01102w21.html_para1">The revision of the 1991 Money Laundering Directive in the European Union, which has recently received political agreement within the Council, is designed to ensure that all member states have sufficiently robust national laws and regulations to combat the increasingly sophisticated methods used in money laundering. As such it includes specific provisions to ensure that there is adequate identification of customers where no face-to- face contact between bank staff and customer occurs, such as through Internet banking accounts. Implementation will require the development of specific regulations and guidelines in the United Kingdom, applied to all those involved in financial transactions. This is currently being considered. It has been agreed that three years after the adoption of the Directive an examination will be undertaken to consider identification measures for clients involved in non-face-to-face transactions and the possible implications for electronic commerce.
<P>

<a name="01102w21.html_para2">In a separate measure, the European Union has prepared a comprehensive strategy for dealing with organised crime in a paper entitled "The Prevention and Control of Organised Crime: A European Union Strategy for the beginning of the new Millennium". The measures proposed in that document, and to be taken forward in European Union Working Groups, include a specific recommendation to address the issue of money laundering on the Internet and via electronic money products.
<P>

<a name="01102w21.html_para3">At the joint Council of European Union Justice and Finance Ministers on 17 October, it was agreed that a range of measures be undertaken against financial crime, with particular attention to be given to measures to facilitate the fight against the abuse of new information and communications, especially the Internet and electronic transfer of money.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will assess the benefits of introducing a fast-track procedure at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate for processing applications from non-EU foreign nationals for leave to remain in the UK when they are medically qualified people filling a vacancy for a doctor or nurse within the NHS.  [135531]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 From 2 May, the Immigration and Nationality Directorate and the Department for Education and Employment have revised procedures for handling all

<P><I>2 Nov 2000 : Column: 614W</I><P>
applications for leave to remain for the purpose of employment including those from medically qualified persons seeking employment within the NHS. This has enabled such applications to be completed within 2-3 weeks instead of three months or longer.

 The information requested can be found in the table. We have interpreted "returned" to mean unsuccessful asylum seekers removed under port and enforcement processes, and "accepted" to mean those asylum seekers granted refugee status or refused asylum but given exceptional leave to remain.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the reason for the delay by the Transfer Desk in his Department in transferring a letter regarding an immigration matter sent to him by the hon. Member for Hull, North on 5 September; what is the <i>(a)</i> average, <i>(b)</i> shortest and <i>(c)</i> greatest length of time taken for a letter to be transferred from his Department to another department; and if he will make a statement.  [136026]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I apologise for the delay in dealing with the letter sent by the hon. Member. This was referred to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate immediately upon its receipt in the Home Office on 5 September. That Directorate subsequently advised that the correspondence would more appropriately be dealt with by the Joint Entry Clearance Unit. Unfortunately, the transfer to that Unit was not completed until 25 October. This was due to a recent and regrettable failure of our normal procedures, which we have since rectified.
<P>

<a name="01102w22.html_para0">Prior to that failure, in the current year, of all the letters requiring transfer to other Government Departments, 54 per cent. were transferred within five working days; 



<P>
<P><I>2 Nov 2000 : Column: 616W</I><P>
15 per cent. in 5 to 10 days; 13 per cent. in 10 to 20 days and 18 per cent. in over 20 days. The average was 13 days. I do not regard these periods as acceptable.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what action the Government are taking to prepare in the event that BSE is present in the United Kingdom sheep flock.  [136933]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 The Government are adopting a precautionary approach and have for some time been operating a risk reduction strategy in this area in line with advice from SEAC and, more recently, the Food Standards Agency. This includes an ongoing research programme, including development of rapid screening methods, a national scrapie plan to eliminate scrapie from the national sheep flock (on which the Government initiated consultation in August) and the removal of the specified risk material from the food chain.
<P>

<a name="01102w22.html_para2">Genotypically susceptible sheep dosed orally with infected brain material from cattle have developed BSE in scientific experiments. To date, however, BSE is not known to have occurred naturally in sheep, although this possibility is being checked by an ongoing research programme. The Government have in hand preparation of a contingency plan setting out actions that might be taken in different scenarios if in the future BSE is found to be present in sheep.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w22.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Arrangements are already in place to provide tissues and body fluids from cattle with BSE and cattle incubating the disease. The Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) holds an archive of material from BSE-infected cattle. Scientists may apply directly to the TSE Office at the VLA to request samples of these tissues for use in research. Applications are approved by the TSE Research and Surveillance Unit in MAFF on the basis of the supplies available and the merit of the research. Scientists also need to show that they have the containment facilities available to perform the research and any necessary Home Office or import licences. Where sufficient supplies exist, reasonable requests will be granted and the tissues will be released once funding for the research is secured.

 All of the projects funded as a result of the 1996 open competition have finished. None has resulted in the development of a test that can be used in the live animal. One project has resulted in a diagnostic test (called DELFIA) which has been submitted for validation by the EU Commission. Tests which pass the EU assessment may be used in national surveillance schemes. This test uses brain samples and so can be used only on dead animals. MAFF is now funding the assessment at Ames in the United States. The test is performed on blood samples and early results suggest that it can diagnose sheep with scrapie. MAFF is funding its further development as a diagnostic test in the live animal.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many of the unfunded proposals submitted in 1996 to the open competition for a diagnostic test for bovine spongiform encephalopathy were developed further; and if he will make a statement.  [135078]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01102w22.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 To our knowledge, none of the unfunded proposals submitted under the 1996 open competition has resulted in a diagnostic test that can be used in the live animal. Swiss researchers who submitted a proposal under the competition have since developed a test called the Prionics test. However, this is not the same test as that submitted under the open competition. The Prionics test has been assessed by the EU Commission and has met their criteria. The test is currently being used in abattoir surveys of cattle in Switzerland and France. It is also used in the UK for the confirmation of clinical cases. This test uses brain tissue and cannot be used in the live animal.

 In view of the very difficult trading conditions faced by UK arable farmers, the Government have decided to ask the EU Commission to draw down &#163;34 million of the optional agrimonetary compensation available this year. This is in addition to the &#163;57 million agrimonetary compensation already announced for this autumn. The extra money will provide valuable assistance to the arable sector at an exceptionally difficult time and follows a series of discussions with NFU leaders about the present problems of the arable sector.

 The review of the organic farming scheme was launched in December 1999 and is now completed. I am grateful to all those individuals and organisations who contributed to it. A note summarising the outcome of the review has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01102w23.html_para0">We have carefully considered the extent to which changes needed to be made to the scheme, which was heavily oversubscribed after it opened in April 1999 as a much improved replacement for the previous conversion aid arrangements. We believe that the priority is to reopen the organic farming scheme as quickly as possible, and accordingly we will begin accepting applications from 2 January 2001, with the first new payments being made in April 2001.
<P>

<a name="01102w23.html_para1">The organic farming scheme is now part of the England rural development programme, and its future operation will be reviewed as part of the programme's mid-term evaluation. Many of the issues raised during this year's review will be relevant to that evaluation, and we will ensure that they are taken into account at that time.
<P>

<a name="01102w23.html_para2">Against this background, one change is being made to the scheme when it reopens, subject to parliamentary approval. To facilitate applications, we propose to extend the deadline for applying for aid under the scheme after registration with an organic inspection body from three months to six months.

<P>
<a name="01102w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The England Rural Development Programme, launched on 3 October, contains a range of measures to encourage diversification within the agricultural industry in England. The Rural Enterprise Scheme will fund farm diversification projects. The Processing and Marketing Grant, Energy Crops Scheme, woodland grants and Vocational Training Scheme will also support diversification. The Ministry of Agriculture will also be producing a guide on farm diversification which will list these and other sources of funding and advice.

 Under the relevant accession treaties, all Finnish, Spanish and Portuguese fishing vessels are excluded from fishing in the North Sea until 31 December 2002. As things currently stand, they will be able to fish for non-quota stocks only thereafter. UK vessel access to the North Sea will not be affected.

However, since 1 April 1999 four knackers yards have closed.
