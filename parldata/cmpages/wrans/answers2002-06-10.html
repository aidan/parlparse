 The UK is committed to measures aimed at helping poor countries to develop their economies and take a more active part in international trade. To this end, we are considering the special and differential treatment and development box proposals made by certain, so called "like-minded" developing countries in the WTO's Agriculture Committee. These proposals contain some interesting elements, including developing countries reducing tariffs more slowly, extension of the safeguard mechanism and maintaining the flexibilities for developing countries agreed in the Uruguay Round. We will actively consider these ideas in the context of the agriculture negotiations.

We also have a programme on HIV/AIDS in Burundi.

<a name="20610w01.html_para1">We will devote more attention to the needs of Burundi in coming months, with the appointment of an official in the region to cover Burundi for DFID, based either in Bujumbura or, in the first instance, in Kigali.

 My Department currently maintains a normal retiring age of 60 and it has not hitherto been the practice to recruit staff above the age at which existing staff are required to retire unless there were exceptional management reasons. However, this policy is currently under review in respect of those staff for whom DFID has delegated authority to determine the normal retiring age (that is, staff below the senior civil service).

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what measures have been taken to ensure that international aid is given to known MDC supporters as well as Zanu-PF supporters.  [60408]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w01.html_spnew13"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are doing all we can to try to prevent humanitarian relief being misused for political purposes in Zimbabwe. Programmes are operating in a number of areas badly affected by food shortages that could be described as both MDC and Zanu-PF dominated. Beneficiaries are selected on the basis of their vulnerability not their political views. All programmes are delivered by non-government organisations. Selection is undertaken at the grass roots level either by NGOs alone, or in local disaster committees including ward councillors and traditional headmen together with the NGOs. All claims that vulnerable people have been excluded from receiving assistance are investigated, whether they are from Zanu-PF or MDC supporters.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what estimates she has made of the number of children who have been moved from primary schools in Zimbabwe.  [60171]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w01.html_spnew14"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Zimbabwe has a good record in primary school access. Between 1979 and 1996 there was a more than 100 per cent. increase in the numbers of primary schools, and a 102 per cent. expansion in enrolment figures, with 2.49 million children in school. We are concerned that food shortages and economic pressures may be eroding these gains.
<P>

<a name="20610w01.html_para2">DFID has targeted school children in its supplementary feeding programmes. Since September 2001 we have provided one meal a day to over 200,000 primary school children. Monitoring shows that in the areas where our programmes are active, this has helped to increase enrolment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w01.html_spnew15"><B> Clare Short: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what estimates she has made of the extent to which the reported famine in Zimbabwe results <i>(a)</i> from natural causes and <i>(b)</i> from disruption of agriculture.  [60172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w01.html_spnew17"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 It is clear that drought has played a large part in the failure of the maize harvest this year. However, the Government of Zimbabwe's policy failures in mishandling food markets; agricultural prices; the exchange rate; and the chaotic land reform programme have also been much to blame, and continue to make matters worse. While it is not possible to attribute between causes with any accuracy, the UNDP estimate that maize production may have been 30 to 60 per cent. affected by land reform alone. The expected drop of at least 60 per cent. in wheat planting this season is almost entirely attributable to disruption of commercial farming activities and state control of prices and markets.

<P>
<a name="20610w02.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2002]:</i> The Attorney-General and I have considered closely the current system and agree with the assessment of Sir Robin Auld in his "Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales" that on the whole the procedure appears to be working well. However, we will keep the system under review at all times.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w02.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General what steps her Department has taken to ensure that victims of crime and other interested parties are routinely informed of the procedures and timescale for requesting that a sentence be referred to the Court of Appeal on the grounds of undue lenience.  [53395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w02.html_spmin1"><B>The Solicitor-General</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 May 2002]:</i> Sections 35 and 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 provide that the Law Officers may refer sentences passed in the Crown Court for a limited range of serious offences to the Court of Appeal for review if it appears to the Law Officer that the sentence passed is unduly lenient. The Law Officers must give notice to the Registrar of Criminal Appeals of an application for leave to refer within 28 days from the day on which the sentence was passed. This time limit is fixed by statute and cannot be extended.
<P>

<a name="20610w02.html_para4">It is most often the relevant prosecuting authority, such as the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), the Serious Fraud Office, etc., that gives consideration as to whether the sentence passed in a particular case is so lenient that the matter should be brought to the attention of the Law Officers, for consideration of a referral to the Court of Appeal as an unduly lenient sentence.




<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2002 : Column 729W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20610w02.html_para5">In addition, both the Law Officers and the CPS receive complaints from victims of crime, Members of Parliament, members of the public, through the media or otherwise that particular sentences passed were lenient. If, in response to such a complaint, the CPS decides that the sentence does not merit submitting the matter to the Law Officers for consideration it will write to the complainant to complain direct to the Law Officers.
<P>

<a name="20610w02.html_para6">Complaints received by the Law Officers are considered in person by a Law Officer, often with advice from counsel experienced in sentencing law. A reply explaining the Law Officer's decision whether or not to refer the case to the Court of Appeal will be sent to the correspondent.
<P>

<a name="20610w02.html_para7">Since 1988 the CPS, being the principal prosecuting authority in England and Wales and responsible for the vast majority of prosecutions brought before the courts, has identified a substantial number of suitable cases to submit to the Law Officers for consideration of a reference. Advocates acting for the CPS in the Crown Court are instructed to consider whether sentences passed should be submitted to the Law Officers for consideration of a reference.
<P>

<a name="20610w02.html_para8">Experience suggests that victims who are at court at the time of sentencing and who are concerned about the sentence passed will express that concern to the police or prosecution representatives who would be expected to explain the options that may be available in taking those concerns forward.
<P>

<a name="20610w02.html_para9">Under the victim's charter the police have a responsibility for advising victims of the outcome of cases. CPS prosecutors will often advise victims of the case outcome in cases where there is a pre-existing line of communication between the CPS and the victim.
<P>

<a name="20610w02.html_para10">In addition, since 1988 there have been many references to the Court of Appeal, a large proportion of which result in sentences being increased and often receiving national and local media coverage.

<P>

<a name="20610w03.html_para0">We work closely with the Radiocommunications Agency to assess continuously where spare capacity can be made available for new commercial services from within the radio spectrum that is managed by the Ministry of Defence to meet current and planned operational and training commitments.
<P>

<a name="20610w03.html_para1">The Ministry is currently engaged in releasing the majority of the 410 to 430 MHz band for use by digital public mobile radio services.

The remainder should be released in 2003 and has a current value of &#163;4.3 million

per annum. About 36 MHz of currently MOD managed spectrum is also to be made available for the extension of the 800/900 MHz bands for digital mobile phones and other digital personal mobile radio services. This would be valued at &#163;4.3 million per annum. Spectrum for fixed wireless services in the 3.4 GHz band has very recently been released, with a value of &#163;80,000 per annum. These valuations are based on current spectrum charges that apply equally to civil and military users.

 <i>[holding answer 24 April 2002]:</i> The details of the personnel from the Defence Medical Services (DMS) deployed in Afghanistan are contained in the table. The majority of these personnel are members of 34 Field Hospital, which serves all United Kingdom personnel in Afghanistan, although 59 are dedicated to Operation Fingal. DMS personnel account for between 6 and 7 per cent. of the total UK forces in Afghanistan.

 The Ministry of Defence has no plans to preserve any of the current serving aircraft carriers as a museum when they are taken out of service. Similarly there are no such plans for the Landing Platform Dock (Assault) ships HMS Intrepid and HMS Fearless which were withdrawn from service in July 2001 and March 2002 respectively. As normal practice, ex-service assets are disposed of to maximise the receipt to the taxpayer. While the Ministry of Defence is supportive of work carried out by military museums, the preservation of ships is mainly carried out by charitable trusts.

<a name="20610w04.html_para12">As I said in my answer on 9 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 828W, to the hon. Member for North Essex (Mr. Jenkin), the current strength of the TA, including those mobilised on operations and on full-time reserve service, almost exactly matches the overall target size of the TA set as a result of the Strategic Defence Review. It is, therefore, in good shape, although there are some specific areas where numbers fall short of target, most notably the Army Medical Service (TA). The "Time to get fitTA" awareness campaign launched in December last year received a good response, although the overall effectiveness of the campaign will not be known until the new figures come out later this year. The annual National Recruiting Campaign which concluded on 18 May with TA Day, and a further Regional Recruiting Campaign to be launched in the autumn, are excellent opportunities for the general public to find out more about the TA. The aim of these campaigns is to keep the TA in its currently healthy state and under current plans they will continue to be a significant feature of the TA recruiting operation.

However, Her Majesty's Government remain in close contact with the Angolan Government, the United Nations Secretary-General's Special Representative for Africa, and international partners, and have offered to the Government of Angola an opportunity to visit Sierra Leone to see at first hand the challenges of integrating ex-combatants. MOD will, of course, be involved as appropriate with this initiative, should it go ahead.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the pilot Skill Force scheme.  [59196]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w05.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Skill Force scheme forms part of the Ministry of Defence's contribution to our wider Government social exclusion policies. The initiative aims to prevent young people from feeling long-term disaffection with school and society. It is currently being piloted in 11 areas and in 47 schools in England and Scotland. Discussions are currently being held with a view to extending the pilot to Wales.
<P>

<a name="20610w05.html_para10">A feature of the scheme is the use of recently retired service personnel as instructors for selected children in years 10 and 11 in a number of state secondary schools; and this has proved very effective. Skill Force emphasises instruction in vocational subjects with the aim of acquiring the Award Scheme Development and Accreditation

Network modular vocational award at bronze/silver level. Participants also take part in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award; St. John's Ambulance Young Life Saver's award and the OCR First Certificate in Preparation for Employment. The Skill Force scheme is funded by MOD, Department for Education and Skills (DfES), HM Treasury's Invest to Save Budget and local partners.
<P>

<a name="20610w05.html_para11">An integral part of the Skill Force pilot scheme has been rigorous and independent evaluation by the British Market Research Bureau. The most recent evaluation report, based on the two original schemes that started in September 2000 in Newcastle and Norfolk, has been completed. The report has shown that Skill Force has helped to maintain attendance rates of over 90 per cent. among children who would otherwise have been expected to display sharply declining attendance, sometimes leading to exclusion, through years 10 and 11. Exclusions from these schools have been reduced by 72 per cent. compared with those predicted by the head teachers at the start of the scheme.
<P>

<a name="20610w05.html_para12">The Skill Force initiative has been supported by DfES from the outset, with the Invest to Save Budget bid being made jointly by the MOD, Home Office and DfES. In response to the Government's Street Crime Initiative, Skill Force is one of the schemes 11 local education authorities have been invited to consider to help them to deliver part of DfES's Behaviour Improvement Programme. A decision from the London education authorities on whether they wish to use Skill Force is expected shortly.

[59726]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w05.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has few research programmes that specifically address non-lethal weapons. There are, however, a wider variety of research programmes that might be considered to contribute to non-lethal capabilities, details of which I am withholding under Exemption 1 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The MOD's main non-lethal weapon is the baton round which is employed in forces world wide.

<P>

<a name="20610w05.html_para15">On the development of techniques and equipment for use in urban warfare, it is not yet clear to what extent the UK will be involved in fighting in these areas in the future. We are, however, undertaking a number of studies into how existing and planned equipment and doctrine could be developed for use in an urban environment.

 If any degrading or demeaning initiation ceremonies were found to exist they would be dealt with swiftly. It is made routinely clear to all armed forces personnel that forcing compliance with initiation rites is classed as bullying and is quite unacceptable. The new armed forces diversity policy goal will aim to achieve an environment free from harassment, intimidation and unlawful discrimination, in which all have equal opportunity and encouragement to realise their full potential. This position is reinforced through single service values and standards and equal opportunities policies, and was reflected in the Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct issued to all personnel in January 2000, where clear guidance was given on what is considered inappropriate personal behaviour within the armed forces. All of these measures are, of course, regularly reviewed and reinforced as necessary.

It was thought that many absentees would be more prepared to return to their unit if they were better informed of the likely disciplinary consequences. This scheme is to be relaunched with greater publicity this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many Royal Navy vessels are at sea without their Lynx helicopters; and what the shortfall is in helicopters for the Royal Navy.  [60018]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As at 23 May there are three vessels at sea not engaged on front line duties which do not have Lynx embarked (HMS Newcastle, HMS Norfolk and HMS Montrose). The Royal Navy has its full required operating fleet of 116 helicopters of various types, and the required level of spare aircraft. There is no overall shortfall.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what measures the Government are taking to <i>(a)</i> increase the lives of rotor heads for helicopters, <i>(b)</i> decrease the manufacturing period and <i>(c)</i> ensure that enough spare parts are available for the front line and reserve.  [60020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A number of factors influence rotor head life including the helicopter's operational role and weight, any changes to capability during its service, the vibration environment of the helicopter and the cost and ease of maintenance. We continue to work closely with industry to improve the techniques and materials used in the manufacture of rotor heads, and gain a better understanding of the stress under which the rotor head operates. These initiatives are designed both to increase the life of the rotor heads and reduce manufacture lead times. Helicopters now entering service, for example Merlin, benefit from this work.
<P>

<a name="20610w07.html_para0">We are also embarking on a number of innovative partnering arrangements with industry that focus both on greater reliability and improved component performance. More broadly based work to improve the responsiveness of the Defence Supply Chain will also enhance helicopter logistics, and ensure that we are better able to support front line forces.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Problems with Lynx main rotor heads have obliged the Joint Helicopter Command to review helicopter deployments, and Lynx helicopters in the rapid reaction forces not currently deployed on operations are subject to restrictions on the number of hours that can be flown. In addition, to protect front line operations and the flying training programme, some ships not on front line service are currently at sea without an embarked Lynx helicopter.

 None. The term "grounded" is normally used only when a whole fleet or mark of aircraft is identified as unsafe to fly because of specific serious engineering or airworthiness problems that call into question the safety of the aircraft type. More generally, the number of aircraft available to operational commanders can vary on a daily basis as aircraft move in and out of maintenance.

<a name="20610w07.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Since 1998, when the Ministry of Defence first recognised the current problem with the mistaken taxation of attributable service invaliding pensions, it has sought legal advice on a number of aspects of the application of the Income and Corporation Tax Act (ICTA) 1988, or preceding laws. These have centred on establishing clearly the nature and extent of our responsibilities for remedying the effects of the error, in particular in the following areas:

The board concluded that it was most likely that while approaching the Mull of Kintyre the aircraft was established in a steady climb, with a ground speed of between 160 and 275 kts, until approximately four seconds before impact. The aircraft then flared to an attitude of 30 degrees nose up, and finally impacted with a ground speed of 147 kts.

 The estimated all-up weight of Chinook ZD576 at take off was 38,720 lbs, which included fuel weighing 6,776 lbs. At impact the estimated all-up weight of the aircraft was 37,620 lbs. The weight of the aircraft at any given point during the flight reflects the amount of fuel used by that point. Boeing conducted their simulation of the last five seconds of flight against a gross aircraft weight figure of 37,700 lbs at this point.

 The flight plan indicated a route to the Mull of Kintyre lighthouse and then a course change to port on a track following the western shore of the Mull. The first waypoint or landmark the pilots entered on the on-board navigation computer was the Mull of Kintyre lighthouse. At 0.95 nautical miles, or about 20 seconds from impact the crew released the computer from the fix on the lighthouse and set it to indicate the bearing and distance to the next waypoint at Corran 87 miles to the north. The preserved data held by the navigation system indicated that the aircraft was very close to the direct track from RAF Aldergrove to the lighthouse when the waypoint change was made. There is no evidence of any significant change of course before the impact.

<P>
<a name="20610w08.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2002]:</i> Acclimatisation for operations in mountain terrain depends, in the first instance, on personal physical fitness. As the British armed forces mountain and cold climate specialists, the Royal Marines pay particular attention to this at all times. More specifically, they undertake annual mountain training in climbing, navigation and 'living' techniques, and every year a detachment spends three months training in Norway.
<P>

<a name="20610w08.html_para1">It is standard requirement for units to undertake pre- operational acclimatisation training. Prior to commencing operations, personnel of 45 Commando were deployed to Afghanistan for up to 10 days. This period ended with Operation Ptarmigan, which gave our forces vital experience of operating in Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="20610w08.html_para2">As a result of this careful planning, the number of cases of ill-effects from altitude and cold reported by 45 Commando have been well within the predicted parameters.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the length is of the training period required for Harrier GR7 pilots to qualify for flying operations from aircraft carriers.  [59786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The additional training required to qualify Harrier GR7 pilots for aircraft carriers combat ready (Day) and (Night) status has historically taken a minimum of 16 aircraft carrier based flying days during which 15 day time sorties and five night time sorties must be accrued. The night sorties must be undertaken within 72 hours of the last day time sortie. The length of time to complete this training can vary, as it is aircraft carrier availability and weather dependent. It would be rare for the training to be completed within 16 days, however, on occasions when optimum operating conditions have been experienced, some pilots have qualified in a slightly shorter time.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w09.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the maximum number of Harrier GR7 pilots is that can be trained for aircraft carrier flying operations at any one time.  [59787]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The maximum full front line strength of the three operational Harrier GR7 squadrons is 48 pilots and it is unlikely that there would be a requirement to train more than that number. 36 pilots are currently qualified to fly operations from aircraft carriers. Training to enable Harrier GR7 pilots to conduct aircraft carrier based operations is usually conducted as part of a Squadron's routine training programme. The maximum number of pilots that could be trained for aircraft carrier operations at any one time is dependent on a wide range of factors. These include aircraft carrier availability, operational tempo, pilot requirement for such training, weather conditions and completing training priorities, themselves dictated by anticipated operational requirement.

 It is planned that all RAF Harrier GR7 pilots will be trained for aircraft carrier operations at some stage during their first front line tour.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 We do not currently plan to upgrade the Pegasus engines of the full Harrier GR fleet, as the current partial fleet fit with the upgraded engines fulfils all our operational requirements. While there could be some operational and logistical benefits in a full Harrier fleet engine upgrade, the benefits over the partial fit would be marginal and are not sufficient to outweigh the substantial costs involved, particularly in view of the aircraft's out-of-service date.

 P&OSL Canterbury joined the UK shipping register in the summer of 1998.

As BV are a classification society authorised by the UK, and the Bahamas is a reputable flag, the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) followed established procedures and accepted the stability information on the basis of the previous approvals, and without any further detail checks, by marking the document "provisionally approved".

 The trends for the number of lives lost in UK waters remain static when compared to incident numbers. However, even one death is too many. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency are, therefore, currently undertaking incident prevention pilot studies in each of their three regions in order to assist in the formulation of a long-term incident prevention strategy.

 The Government recognise that, under the right circumstances, park and ride can make a valuable contribution to alleviating congestion, improving the environment and promoting accessibility and travel choice. A number of high quality schemes have been introduced in recent years. Such schemes are carefully sited and accessible, offer safe and secure parking, provide clean and comfortable buses and offer a high frequency of service and fast journey times. Local authorities are being encouraged to consider the role that park and ride can play in their local transport plans. The English Historic Towns Forum, in conjunction with my Department, published the current edition of "Good Practice Guide on bus-based Park and Ride" in May 2000.

MEL will also bear additional costs to cover scheme preparation, land acquisition and financing.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Estimates of changes to road usage because of the M6 Toll were presented in evidence at the Public Inquiry for the scheme. Briefly, it is expected that much of the long distance traffic presently travelling through the West Midlands on the very congested M6 motorway will transfer to M6 Toll. That transfer will allow released capacity on the M6 to be used by traffic currently using congested trunk and local roads within the M6 corridor, thus relieving their overall traffic burden. Traffic flows are expected to increase on some routes which provide access to the new motorway; for example, some sections of the A453 and A5127.</FONT></UL>

<a name="20610w14.html_para0">In the five years up to July 2001 67 personal injury accidents have been reported at this junction. Of these five have been serious and the rest slight. There have been no fatalities. Some 72 per cent. of the accidents over this period have been nose to tail shunts.

<a name="20610w14.html_para2">Last summer the Highways Agency took action to improve driver awareness of the layout by enhancing the signing at this junction. It is too early to conclude how effective this has been in reducing the number of accidents. Traffic signals are due to be installed at the junction as part of the widening of the M25 between Junctions 12 to 15. The road markings are to be renewed shortly and further improvements to the signing are currently being considered. In the meantime the Highways Agency will continue to monitor the situation.

<a name="20610w16.html_para15">Level crossing accidents in Great Britain are among the lowest in Europe. However, as about 33 per cent. of railway collisions occur on level crossings they still present a significant area of risk.

 The Office of the Rail Regulator (ORR) are consulting on a licence modification which would enable the proposed railway industry safety body (RISB) to be established without primary legislation. If there is agreement to proceed by way of a licence change modification, ORR expects RISB to be in place by the end of the year. A copy of the consultation document was placed in the Library by the ORR in December 2001, it is also available on the ORR website www.rail-reg.gov.uk.

 The Rail Regulator has published a consultation document on the establishment of the rail industry safety body (RISB). Copies of the consultation document and the majority of responses are available on the Rail Regulator's website, together with other working papers discussed at the development group. The development group is intended to be a series of working 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2002 : Column 785W</I><P>
meetings to develop the detailed proposals for establishing RISB. It is not therefore open to the public. The Rail Regulator has however held two conferences open to a wide audience including passenger representatives, freight users, and trade unions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w16.html_spnew16"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Health and safety law places a duty on all employers to consult employees and their representatives in good time about specified aspects of their health and safety at work.
<P>

<a name="20610w16.html_para19">In addition, the Railway Safety Case Regulations 2000 places an explicit duty on railway employers to establish adequate arrangements for the passing and receiving of information relevant to health and safety to and from employees and others affected by their operations.
<P>

<a name="20610w16.html_para20">The railway industry also has a Confidential Incident Reporting and Analysis System (CIRAS). CIRAS offers an independent and confidential way for staff to report safety concerns without fear of disciplinary procedures. CIRAS is not intended to replace the normal reporting channels already operated by railway companies. Rather it is intended to work alongside them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w16.html_spnew17"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Lord Cullen's part 2 Ladbroke Grove report made a number of recommendations about an independent rail accident investigation branch (RAIB). We expect to consult this summer on proposals for the establishment of RAIB which are drawn from these recommendations. The consultation exercise will run for 12 weeks from the date of publication, as set out in the Cabinet Office Code of Practice on Written Consultation. Responses to the consultation will be carefully analysed following this period, and in advance of primary legislation. The costs of consultations exercises are included in the Department's running costs.

 Research shows that there is a strong link between drugs and acquisitive crime, and that treatment can play a significant part in reducing both drugs misuse and associated crime. The National Drugs Treatment Monitoring System provides data on trends in the use of drug treatment services to assist planning on how best to provide services to meet the needs of drugs misusers. It is though, a matter for local decision between the Probation Service and other stakeholders within Joint Commissioning Groups whether the clinical treatment element of the Drug Treatment and Testing Order is delivered through the National Health Service or by another provider.

 The street crime initiative represents a step-change in cross-Government action to tackle street crime with a focused programme of action in the 10 police force areas where the problem is most acute. In the Yorkshire region two forces are involved, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire.
<P>

<a name="20610w20.html_para5">Both South and West Yorkshire have commenced targeted police operations in crime hotspots.

 Tackling street crime is now a top priority for the Government. However, it is recognised that it cannot successfully be tackled by the police and criminal justice agencies alone. That is why the Government set up the Street Crime Action Group in March of this year. This group, chaired by the Prime Minister, has brought together all relevant Government Departments, criminal justice and other agencies to work together to identify and address weaknesses in the current systems.

 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> The National Asylum Support Service (NASS) has not provided any funding to London boroughs to cover additional costs of asylum seekers returning to London from dispersal areas. NASS is responsible for meeting the direct costs of providing support to asylum seekers who are destitute. NASS is not responsible for providing funding for other services such as education and health. Asylum seekers returning to London can apply to NASS to change their support package from subsistence and accommodation to subsistence only. But asylum seekers could not, as a matter of routine, request that accommodation be provided in London. London is not a dispersal area. Accommodation will be provided in London only in exceptional circumstances.

 The new provisions in the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (PACE) Codes of Practice, which came into force on 1 April 2002, will enable police forces to make more use of video technology to speed up the identification process. Video identification provides a fast and effective alternative to live identity parades. Problems in arranging "live" identification parades within a reasonable period of time have contributed significantly to delays in processing cases and such delays impact upon the quality of evidence and compromise the whole process of justice. Making better use of video identification technology will free up officer time to tackle crime and standardise police practices. It will also result in more

 The military authorities have long denied access to many parts of Burma. There is no indication of their policy changing at this point. We would welcome international access to all areas of Burma. The ethnic minorities who live in those areas kept closed to the international community suffer disproportionately from human rights abuses.

 Our effort on Burma is focused on bringing about national reconciliation, respect for human rights and the return of democracy.

 There is an exemption in the EU Common Position whereby with the agreement of all member states the ban on the Burmese Foreign Minister may be waived where it is in the interests of the European Union.

 The EU has external agreements with a large number of third countries. These agreements include an article establishing an official level committee to oversee implementation of the agreement. This committee is known as a joint or association committee depending on the nature of the agreement (ie whether it is a Trade and Co-operation Agreement or an Association Agreement). The mandate of the committee is to ensure the effective implementation of the agreement. Specific provisions for the powers or provisions of the committees are set out in the individual agreements.
<P>

<a name="20610w28.html_para0">The range of work covered by such committees includes economic and trade issues, technical co-operation and, in the case of Association Agreements, political dialogue. The committees are required to meet at regular intervals, usually annually. The UK is represented at the committee at official level, normally by officials from the UK Permanent Representation in Brussels (when the meeting is in Brussels) or by British embassy or high commission officials (when meetings take place in the third country concerned). It is not possible to disaggregate the cost of the committees to public funds as they are part of the EU's wider relations with third countries. Parliament has the opportunity to scrutinise each third

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20610w28.html_para1">It was intended that a Committee for Protection Against the Effects of the Extraterritorial Application of Legislation Adopted by a Third Country and Actions Based Thereon or Resulting Therefrom (anti-boycott) would be established in Brussels to assist EU companies affected by extraterritorial jurisdiction by third countries, and in particular those affected by the extraterritorial aspects of the US trade sanctions against Cuba, Iran and Libya.
<P>

<a name="20610w28.html_para2">Thus far, the Committee has not been convened. UK companies are obliged to inform Her Majesty's Government and the European Commission of any extraterritorial action taken against them, but while it is clear who would be responsible for representing the UK at any meeting of the Committee, in these times of improved electronic communication, it has not been necessary in practice for it to meet.
<P>

<a name="20610w28.html_para3">In addition, as part of the 1997 Understanding between the EU and the US, the US undertook to exempt European individuals and companies from the extraterritorial aspects of US legislation drastically reducing the number of cases occurring, thus further reducing the need for the Committee to meet.

 I am pleased to announce that the Valuation Office Agency have today published council tax lists on the internet. Council taxpayers will be able to access council tax bandings and make appeals online. This follows the Valuation Office Agency's successful online provision of the non-domestic rating lists in 2000 and is an other important step in the process of improving public access to information by electronic means.

 In order to bring details of all UK financial transactions with the EC into a single publication, information which has previously been included in the departmental report of the Chancellor of the Exchequer's Department will now be published in the Government's annual White Paper "European Community Finances". This change will take effect from the White Paper to be published in the summer. However, in advance of that, updated versions of tables 14a and 14b from the 2001 departmental report are set out in the tables.

<a name="20610w29.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Since 1996, Customs and Excise have increased their efforts to publicise their complaints system. The increase in the proportion of complaints upheld between 1997&#150;98 and 1999&#150;2000 followed accompanying measures taken internally to raise staff awareness of the value of complaints in improving customer service, and to improve training and guidance on handling them objectively.
<P>

<a name="20610w29.html_para1">The increase in the proportion of complaints upheld in 2000&#150;01 reflects technical problems during the transition from regional advice centres to National Advice Service contract centres, resulting in some businesses facing delays in getting through to an adviser. Following the resolution of these problems, there has been a significant reduction in the number of recorded complaints.

 Since 1997 the Government have introduced numerous measures to help both incorporated and unincorporated business, including: making 40 per cent. first year capital allowances permanent, implementation of the Carter Review of payroll services, cutting the small companies rate of corporation tax from 23 per cent. to just 19 per cent., introducing a 10p starting rate of income tax and introducing measures to ease the impact of VAT on small business.

 The Inland Revenue has arranged for application forms for children's tax credit to be placed in "Bounty packs" which are given to mothers at around the time of the birth of their baby.

 I refer the hon. Member to the "The Child and Working Tax Credits" in the series 'The Modernisation of Britain's Tax and Benefit System, Number 10, April 2002', which states that around 5&#190; million families are expected to benefit from the child tax credit. Some of these families will also receive the working tax credit as will other low-income working households. Families with children receiving income support or income-based jobseeker's allowance will not need to make a separate claim for the new tax credits. During the transition period, they will continue to receive IS/JSA but with enhanced child premia rates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w31.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Since the special taxation regime for UK oil and gas was introduced in the 1970s, oil and gas pipelines associated with particular fields have received the same tax treatment as the fields themselves. This reflects the fact that the pipelines are an integral part of the overall development of the fields concerned. Because the tax regime that applies to a field, and therefore its associated pipelines, depends on the date on which the filed was given development consent, pipelines associated with different fields can have different tax treatments.

 All new cars purchased on or after 1 March 2001 are subject to the graduated system of vehicle excise duty (VED).

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question asking what information businesses are required to supply to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and in what legislation this requirement lies. (59192)</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ONS requires businesses to supply information on their structure, level of employment and the earnings of its employees, and financial data such as their turnover, sales, prices, stocks and capital expenditure. This information is collected through a range of monthly, quarterly and annual business surveys, with the short term surveys asking for aggregate level data, while the annual surveys seek more detailed structural data. Each business survey is subject to regular review to reassess its continued need. The sample size for each survey is set at the minimum level consistent with the need to produce aggregate statistics for use by the Government in its economic monitoring and planning. Full details of all the business surveys carried out by the ONS are included in the ONS Compliance Plan for 2002 to 2004 which will be available on the ONS website www.statistics.gov.uk/other on the 29th of May.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information sought from businesses by the ONS is collected under the provisions of the Statistics of Trade Act 1947. The Schedule to the 1947 Act allows for the collection of the following:</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w34.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 In the last 40 years those developing countries which have managed to be more open and trade more in the world economy have seen faster growth rates than those which have remained closed. From the early 1970s to the early 1990s, developing countries that were able to pursue growth through trade grew at least twice as fast as those that kept their tariffs high and their doors closed to imports and competition.
<P>

<a name="20610w34.html_para0">Full trade liberalisation could lift at least 300 million people out of poverty by 2015. Even diminishing protection by 50 per cent. in agriculture and in industrial goods and services would increase the world's yearly income by nearly $400 billion: a boost to growth of 1.4 per cent. All countries and regions stand to benefit, with developing countries gaining an estimated $150 billion a year and higher than average increases in GDP growth.
<P>

<a name="20610w34.html_para1">The WTO's new trade round, referred to as the Doha Development Agenda, contains a package of commitments to progress in areas that will lead to major gains for developing countries and the poorest people in these countries.
<P>

<a name="20610w34.html_para2">We need an approach which ensures that Poverty and Social Impact Assessments are undertaken of key reforms, including trade, to ensure that policy options and trade-offs are discussed, and that reforms are properly designed. Where negative consequences exist, appropriate measures should be put in place to protect vulnerable countries and people from an overly rapid transition to a system of liberalised trade. The IMF and World bank have committed to undertake Poverty and Social Impact Assessments of reforms, and to promote the integration of trade into developing countries' poverty reduction strategies. We are working hard to support this process.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the performance targets that his Department, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies are required to meet, apart from those set out in the public service agreements for 1999 to 2002 and 2001 to 2004; and if he will specify for each target <i>(a)</i> who sets it and <i>(b)</i> who monitors achievement against it.  [60463]<P>

 Performance targets are set out in each Department's Public Service Agreement and supported by detailed Service Delivery Agreements. Other targets devised by Departments, their agencies and non- departmental public bodies (NDPBs) do not fall within the framework of "performance targets" as established by the Treasury. All the formal performance targets for HM Treasury and its agencies&#151;the Debt Management Office, the National Investment and Loans Office and the Office of Government Commerce&#151;are set out in HM Treasury's 2002 departmental report (Cm 5425), which is due to be published shortly. The NDPBs for which the Chancellor is responsible&#151;the Public Services Productivity Panel, the Statistics Commission and the Royal Mint Advisory Committee on the Design of Coins, Medals, Seals and Decorations&#151;publish information, following best practice, on their role and achievements in their annual reports, but do not have performance targets that are within the framework as defined above.

 In the years 2000&#150;01, 2001&#150;02, 2002&#150;03 funding was allocated to projects in England, with funds allocated to the other regions in accordance with the Barnett consequentials calculations. The exceptions to this were projects whose scope encompassed the UK. It should be noted that projects led by the police in Wales are eligible for funding under the allocation for England as the Police Service for England and Wales is still a unitary body.

<a name="20610w34.html_para3">Allocations for England in 2003&#150;04 are dependant on the successful bids from the fifth bidding round of ISB.

The choice as to whether to incorporate or not is influenced by multiple factors, many of which are firm-specific, for example the personal circumstances of the owner(s).

 The stamp duty relief for disadvantaged areas came into force on 30 November 2001.

We estimate the number of properties sold in 1999&#150;20000 for a consideration of less than &#163;150,000 in the subsequently qualifying wards to be in the region of 120,000 (of which about 40,000 are estimated to have a consideration of greater than &#163;60,000).

<P>
<a name="20610w36.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The extension of the stamp duty relief for disadvantaged areas for non-residential property above the &#163;150,000 limit is currently subject to a state aid investigation by the Commission. Such investigations are normal for an innovative scheme such as this which does not conform precisely with any existing Commission guidelines. The investigation is necessary to establish whether the measure will adversely affect trading conditions to an extent contrary to the common interest and it gives interested parties, including other member states, a chance to comment. We are working closely with the European Commission to progress matters as quickly as possible. Those purchasing property for amounts up to &#163;150,000 in the areas which qualify for the relief are already benefiting from the measure. In addition to the stamp duty relief, the Urban White Paper fiscal measures package provided a cut in VAT to 5 per cent. to encourage renovation and conversion of existing property; 100 per cent. capital allowances for creating flats over shops, 150 per cent. accelerated tax credits to help clean-up contaminated land; and the Government are now implementing the Community Development Venture Fund which will also support enterprise and regeneration in these areas.

 Fuel duty differentials have proved very successful in encouraging the introduction of cleaner fuels such as ultra-low sulphur petrol and diesel throughout the UK. In addition, favourable duty rates for liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) combined with purchase grants through the Government sponsored PowerShift programme have led to a substantial increase in the number of LPG vehicles from less than 6,000 in 1996 to around 65,000 now.

<P>

 Civil Service equal opportunities policy provides that all eligible people must have equality of opportunity for employment and advancement on the basis of their suitability for the work. There must be no unfair discrimination on the basis of age, disability, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origin, or (in Northern Ireland) community background.
<P>

Staff over age 60 are subject to the same terms and conditions as staff under age 60. No special reviews of performance are applied.
<P>

<a name="20610w38.html_para3">The Department's flexible approach to age retirement allows staff to continue to work in their current grade and, subject to business need, to seek promotion to a higher grade or voluntarily to downgrade. Subject to business need staff may also choose to work full or part time.

 The Department has undertaken some feasibility work into a research project on the incidence and demography of BSL use. This involved discussions with research organisations, academics, and a meeting with representatives of organisations of and for deaf people. The work identified concerns about the robustness of the data which such a project might produce, its

<a name="20610w39.html_spnew3"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 There is no central record of the number of people working as British Sign Language interpreters in the UK. The Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People, The Association of Sign Language Interpreters, and the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters all maintain directories of BSL interpreters registered with their respective organisations. These do not, however, provide a comprehensive record of interpreters both active and available for assignment. The Department will shortly publish a research report that includes an examination of BSL interpreter provision in England, Scotland and Wales. The field work was undertaken in 1999 and 2000. Preliminary estimates are that 257 qualified and trainee interpreters were available for work in England and Wales and 27 in Scotland.

 From 2003, customers will be able to receive payments into their bank/building society accounts on a weekly, fortnightly, four-weekly, 13-weekly or yearly basis. The precise frequency will depend on the payment rules which apply to the particular benefit they are receiving.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w39.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 When a homeless person in temporary accommodation provided by a local authority claims housing benefit, the local authority must pay the full amount of benefit in respect of the rent for which the homeless person is liable. However, the amount of subsidy paid to reimburse local authorities for benefit paid in these circumstances is subject to a threshold above which only a proportion of benefit is reimbursed, and a cap, above which nothing is reimbursed. These limits are intended to ensure that the tax-payer does not subsidise unreasonably expensive accommodation. However, there are no circumstances in which we will "claw back" subsidy.




<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2002 : Column 879W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20610w39.html_para0">From April 2002, we introduced changes to the subsidy limits to encourage local authorities to use better quality accommodation in housing homeless people, and to ensure that even more families have the chance of a more permanent home. From that date, the subsidy rate for privately-leased accommodation was increased, while the rate for board and lodging accommodation remained the same.
<P>

Our customers will continue to deal with their local social security office until the national service is in place.

 Section 41(2) of the Police (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 requires Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary to inspect and report on efficiency and effectiveness of the police in Northern Ireland at least once every year. To that end, HMIC has carried out an inspection in each of the past three years. Prior to each inspection, the Inspectorate have liaised with the police service, Police Authority and NIO to agree the terms of reference for the areas to be reviewed. The recommendations made after each inspection are contained in the published report, copies of which are laid in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

 The Chief Constable has advised that, as the officer in command of the Rosemary Nelson murder inquiry, Colin Port, the Deputy Chief Constable of Norfolk Constabulary, determines the overall strategy for the investigation. The numbers of officers involved in the investigation has varied to accommodate the needs of particular lines of inquiry; staff work as a team and are not assigned to specific duties except where there are particularly sensitive lines of inquiry or specialist functions. As some persons have been arrested more than once it could be misleading to attempt to put an overall figure on arrests made by officers attached to the investigation of this murder.

<P>
<a name="20610w42.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The UK recognises that Article VIII of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling provides for any contracting Government to grant any of its nationals a special permit authorising that national to kill, take or treat whales for purposes of scientific research.
<P>

<a name="20610w42.html_para0">We regret, however, Japan's continued use of this provision to carry out large scale, lethal "scientific" whaling. The UK believes that Japan's activities serve to undermine the International Whaling Commission's (IWC) moratorium and, at this year's IWC meeting which took place in Shimonoseki between 20&#150;24 May, we called upon them to discontinue their lethal research programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w42.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The UK delegation participates fully in the IWC's Scientific Committee including work to provide in-depth assessments of whale stocks.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w42.html_wqn2"><B> Malcolm Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what preparations her Department made for the International Whaling Commission annual meeting in Japan;  [58577]
<P>
<UL>(2) what action her Department took before the annual meeting of the International Whaling Commission to build support for the continuation of the ban on commercial whaling.  [58578]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w42.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The UK Government is opposed to all whaling except by some subsistence whaling by indigenous people. We strongly support the current moratorium on commercial whaling.
<P>

<a name="20610w42.html_para1">Before the start of the 54th annual IWC meeting we held a meeting of the Consultative Forum on Whaling with non-government organisations to discuss the UK line to take and strategy on key issues. In conjunction with the FCO we also undertook extensive lobbying of all IWC member states to build support for the continuation of the moratorium.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with the Treasury about funding for the recommendations of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food; and if she will make a statement.  [57515]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w42.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government intends to produce a Strategy for Sustainable Food and Farming in England in the autumn. Funding for the strategy forms part of this year's Spending Review discussions. The strategy will incorporate a definitive response to the Policy Commission's recommendations, although not all of these fall to, or involve expenditure by Government.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> Retrospective information for 1996&#150;97 can not be supplied as DEFRA did not exist prior to June 2001.
<P>

<a name="20610w42.html_para2">Our records show a total operational running cost for the DEFRA Press Office, for the financial year 2001&#150;02 of &#163;1.6 million.

 DEFRA was created in June 2001. For the period ending the 31 Dec 2001 the Press Office issued 319 press releases.
<P>

<a name="20610w42.html_para3">Retrospective identification and enumeration of the press releases issued prior to June 2001 by the Home Office and the former DETR and MAFF Press Offices on policy subjects now covered by DEFRA would be disproportionately costly to produce.

[39938]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w42.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 When DEFRA was created on 8 June 2001 it brought together the Environmental Protection Directorate and the Wildlife and Countryside Directorate of the former DETR, together with the full range of former MAFF policies and operational activities and certain hunting and animal welfare interests of the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="20610w42.html_para4">Of the retrospective statistics that have been requested, such of those as could be obtained would not provide a valid comparison of these staff resources. Moreover, such information could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost.
<P>

 We received a copy of the memorandum of 26 March from the European Commission. This advice will be fully taken into account should another cargo of Brazilian mahogany arrive for clearance into the Community via the UK. We have also asked the Timber Trade Federation to advise their members not to import Brazilian mahagony until the present situation is clarified.

 <i>[holding answer 16 April 2002]:</i> We are aware of advice sent by the CITES Secretariat to the German management Authority on 13 March. This formed the basis of a subsequent note from the European Commission to all member states on 26 March. We have passed this on to the Timber Trade Federation and to other Government Departments with an interest in this issue. I attach a copy.

<P>
<a name="20610w43.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 We understand from the German CITES Management Authority that, since the moratorium, three cargoes of Brazilian mahogany have been cleared by German customs and one has been detained at Hamburg.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if big leaf mahogany (swietenia macrophylla) is classified as an endangered species; and what measures she is taking to ensure that illegally logged mahogany is not used in the United Kingdom.  [50459]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w43.html_spnew6"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Big leaf mahogany (Swietenia Macrophylla) is listed on Appendix III by certain range states. This means that it is not classified by CITES as endangered but is subject to regulation.
<P>

<a name="20610w43.html_para2">Our main line of defence against the use of illegally logged big leaf mahogany is the CITES and European Union controls on the import of such mahogany. All imports into the Community for the first time must be accompanied by appropriate CITES documentation. Mahogany requires a valid export permit or certificate of origin and a completed import notification. Failure to present such documentation could render any cargo liable to seizure, and illegal trading in CITES listed timber is subject to strict penalties. We are also exploring with our EU partners whether there are changes in EU regulations which would secure better regulation of this trade; and we have made clear to the Brazilians our concern to support their efforts to prevent illegal logging.

 The Management Committees for Fisheries and Aquaculture and Fisheries Products have been established under the Common Fisheries Policy for the management of fishing activity and the common organisation of the market for fish and fish products respectively. Both committees meet on average once a month. The UK is normally represented by officials from DEFRA and the Scottish Executive. In keeping with standard practice for this type of meeting, the travel costs of those attending are reimbursed by the EU.
<P>

<a name="20610w44.html_para81">At the last meeting of the Management Committee for Fisheries and Aquaculture, on 30 April, the two agenda items were the extension of the fourth Multi-Annual Guidance Programme (MAGP IV) and the provision of information to the Commission under its new data collection arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20610w44.html_para82">At the last meeting of the Management Committee for Fisheries Products on 16 May, the three main agenda items were the provision of import price data by member states, the application of common market rules and the review of the operational programmes of producer organisations.
<P>

<a name="20610w44.html_para83">Together with member states, the Commission is currently conducting a review to bring existing legislation on the conduct of comitology committees like these into line with Council Decision 1999/468/EC, to "simplify the requirements for the exercise of implementing powers conferred on the Commission". As an obligation to this Decision, the Commission undertook to publish an annual report on the working of the committees. The first report was deposited in the Libraries of both Houses on 26 February 2002 (Com (2001) 783 Final). As part of the review process, the UK Government have encouraged the Commission to produce and maintain an electronic database of every comitology committee, its agendas and recent actions, to be accessible through its website.

<a name="20610w44.html_spnew35"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Committee of the regulation concerning the evaluation and control of the risks of existing substances has met twice over the last 12 months. UK attendance is usually one representative from the Health and Safety Executive or my Department depending on the nature of the issue. The cost to public funds is approximately &#163;1,000 per year for travel and subsistence, which is largely met by the European Commission. The Committee is not currently considering any issues.
<P>

<a name="20610w44.html_para84">The work of the Committee has been to agree the publication in the Official Journal of the results of risk assessments and risk reduction strategies carried out under Council Regulation 793/93/EEC and to agree the scope of additional testing requirements. Any such recommendations are the subject of new proposals from the European Commission for European Parliament and Council Directives as appropriate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the mandate of the Committee for the adaptation to scientific and technical progress of the directive on water intended for human consumption is; how many times it has met over the last 12 months; what the UK representation on it is; what the annual cost of its work is to public funds; if she will list the items currently under its consideration; if she will take steps to increase its accountability and transparency to Parliament; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="20610w44.html_spnew36"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Drinking Water Directive 1998, requires the Commission to review drinking water quality standards in Annex I to the directive "in the light of scientific and technical progress" and to make proposals for any necessary amendments. At least every five years, the Commission is to adapt Annexes II and III (monitoring and methods of analysis) to scientific and technical progress. A management committee was established under Article 12, to assist the Commission.
<P>

<a name="20610w44.html_para85">The Article 12 Committee has met three times: in June 1999, when the Committee adopted its rules of procedure, in November 2001 and in April 2002. It is too soon to carry out full reviews of the Annexes. However, the directive also stipulated that certain provisions, particularly on sampling methods for the lead, nickel and copper parameters, and some radioactivity provisions, remained to be added.
<P>

<a name="20610w44.html_para86">The additional work, carried out by the Committee, has included:
<P>

[58066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w45.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Figures for the tonnage of ash buried on-farm are not available since in most cases the pyre ash was buried on-site by further excavating the pyre trench and scraping the ash into the hole and no assessment of the tonnage was made. The Environment Agency risk assessments and Groundwater Authorisations issued to DEFRA are based on the number of animals burnt and not the tonnage of ash buried.
<P>

<a name="20610w45.html_para1">The following is a listing by county of the number of sites from which ash has been removed. The list is by county, since the Department is constrained by the provisions of the Data Protection Act from providing full addresses of all the sites.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what advice her Department has received on the desirability of re-incinerating ash from foot and mouth pyres before disposal.  [58067]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w45.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Advice was obtained from the Environment Agency (EA), other Government Departments and a risk assessment was commissioned from DNV Consulting Ltd. Advice was also sought from a specially convened Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) Working Group on 24 May 2001, attended by experts from the Department of Health, Food Standards Agency, Environment Agency, Health and Safety Executive and MAFF.
<P>

<a name="20610w45.html_para3">The working group recommended that the choice of disposal option should be made on a site-by-site basis. Leaving the ash unburied in-situ was likely to be associated with a higher risk than alternative routes such as incineration, on-site burial or burial in landfill. Disposing of ash from pyres by on-farm burial was regarded as a preferred low risk option. Where on-site burial was not possible, SEAC's preferred disposal option was re-incineration. The working group noted however that landfilling also represented a low-risk option and that the limited availability of high temperature incineration capacity in the UK meant that incineration of pyre ash might not be practical. Given that leaving the material unburied in-situ or in storage prior to incineration was not a risk-free option, the working group's advice indicated that landfill also represented an appropriate risk minimisation option.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w45.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 42,289 tonnes of meat and bonemeal was produced from animals killed and rendered under the FMD and associated Welfare Disposal Scheme culls. This material is currently stored at two sites (one in Lincolnshire the other in Devon) pending incineration capacity becoming available later this year. Storage costs are approximately &#163;17,500 per week (excluding VAT).

<P>
<a name="20610w45.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Records indicate that during the recent foot and mouth disease outbreak approximately 430 tonnes of sheepskins and hides were disposed of for disease control purposes. A range of disposal routes were utilised including burning at a mass burn site, rendering, incineration and burial at licensed landfill sites. The total cost of disposal (including VAT and landfill tax where appropriate) is estimated to be &#163;90,000. A number of other hides from animals entering the livestock welfare disposal scheme were recovered for leather production.

 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002] [pursuant to the answer, 2 May 2002, Official Report, c. 938]</i> the road haulage contractors involved in the foot and mouth contract were Banks; Yuill and Dodds; NDMR; Whitkirks; Beverley Ridley; and Blakeys Haulage. The Snowie contract was awarded through the use of the negotiated procurement procedure without the prior publication of an <i>Official Journal</i> (OJEU) notice and by competitive tendering.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what has been the cost of storing and disposing of meat and bonemeal since the over 30 months scheme began; and when the backlog will be disposed of.  [58069]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w45.html_spnew19"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 By mid-May some 428,000 tonnes of MBM from the Over Thirty Month Slaughter Scheme (OTMS) had been incinerated at a cost of &#163;41.2 million (&#163;49 million including transport). MBM storage costs since the commencement of the scheme are estimated at &#163;60 million.
<P>

<a name="20610w45.html_para9">RPA achieved its target to have incinerated 60 per cent. of OTMS MBM produced by 31 March 2002. RPA continues to operate a disposal programme which should ensure that stocks are reduced to low levels by 31 March 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w45.html_spnew20"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The 20 day standstill is at the centre of the interim livestock movement restrictions currently in force to guard against a future outbreak. Scientific and veterinary advice is that it aids detection of disease and slows disease spread. A number of exemptions from the standstill have been introduced, on veterinary advice, in order to help livestock farmers without causing an unacceptable increase in disease risk. These interim arrangements are currently under review, but whatever changes may be made to the interim rules this summer the Government intend to take full account of any relevant findings from the FMD inquiries before it reaches a final view on the role that a 20 day standstill might play in the long-term controls over livestock movements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w45.html_spnew21"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Latest cost estimates for the period ending 31 March 2002 indicate that the site has cost &#163;15.3 million to acquire and establish the mass burial facility. Budgeted future costs for leachate removal, site remediation, landscaping and other essential works such as capping and re-profiling are &#163;3.3 million. On-going management and monitoring of the site for a further 10 to 15 years are estimated to be a further &#163;4 million.

This is the first stage in a process which may lead to a further ECJ case against France and the imposition of penalties for failure to comply with the court's judgment in December 2001 that the French ban on imports of UK beef exported under the data based export scheme is illegal.

 DEFRA and SEERAD are mutually committed to work together on the application of agricultural policy within their respective responsibilities. This commitment is given expression in a significant two-way flow of information and related discussions between the Departments, which take place within the framework of the "Memorandum of Understanding and supplementary agreements between the United Kingdom Government, Scottish Ministers and the Cabinet of the National Assembly for Wales" (Cm 4444) and a bilateral concordat. In order to ensure effective co-ordination and help resolution of differences, Agriculture Ministers of the devolved Administrations meet regularly, normally in advance of EU Agriculture Councils, under the chairmanship of the DEFRA Secretary of State. In addition, there are regular (monthly or more frequent) meetings at senior official level on matters relating to agricultural policy.

<a name="20610w46.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The depreciation policy for Forest Enterprise's fixed assets is published each year in the Notes to the Forest Enterprise Accounts within the Forestry Commission's annual reports for Great Britain and England, Scotland, and Wales. Copies of the reports are held in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w46.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Forest Enterprise does not use vehicles which are exempt from vehicle excise duty to deliver capital equipment after it has been sold. These vehicles may, however, be used on service jobs, including instances where Forest Enterprise has agreed to service capital equipment it has sold.

 The table shows the value of capital equipment disposed of by Forest Enterprise in Great Britain in the last five years, all of which was sold following public auction or open tender. (In a very few instances the expected price was not reached at the auction or tender. In these cases, Forest Enterprise negotiated with bidders to obtain an increased offer.)

<a name="20610w46.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department offers various forms of assistance to farmers wishing to develop export markets, both in the EU candidate countries and more widely. These include mounting a UK agriculture presence at overseas trade fairs, leading trade missions overseas and organising inward missions of foreign buyers and opinion formers. Events have been organised in two EU candidate countries over the last year, and future events are planned at world fairs to which buyers from the candidate countries are known to go. We are currently considering further options of promoting the UK agriculture industry in these markets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w47.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The most up-to-date water quality classification for the River Ribble is based on chemical monitoring of the river between 1998 and 2000. From this chemical monitoring, the upper reaches of the River Ribble from High Bridge to Settle Wastewater Treatment Works (WwTW), a distance of 26.7 km, are classified as very good quality&#151;General Quality Assessment (GQA) class A. Downstream of Settle WwTW to the freshwater limit at Samlesbury, a distance of 70.7 km, the River Ribble is classified as good quality&#151;GQA class B.
<P>

<a name="20610w47.html_para0">Biological monitoring in 2000 indicated that the quality of the upper and middle reaches of the River Ribble between High Bridge and Clitheroe WwTW, a distance of 66 km, is very good (class A). Between Clitheroe WwTW and the River Calder, a distance of 4.0 km, the biological quality is good (class B). Below the confluence with the River Calder to the freshwater limit, a distance of 27.4 km, the biological quality is fairly good (class C).

<P>
<a name="20610w47.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Policy Commission estimated that implementing its recommendations would cost approximately &#163;500 million over three years. However, the cost of many of the recommendations will depend upon the precise way in which they are implemented. The Government intend to produce a strategy for sustainable food and farming in England in the autumn, following a wide-ranging process of stakeholder engagement. This strategy will incorporate a definitive response to each of the Policy Commission's recommendations.

 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2002]:</i> Discharge is recorded by use of a pump run meter. This meter has shown that the storm pumps have operated once in the past 12 months for approximately eight minutes.
<P>

<a name="20610w47.html_para3">The discharge consent for the Foreness outfall, issued in February 1985, has no conditions requiring monitoring or telemetry to record storm overflow events. The water utility is therefore under no legal obligation to record these events. This situation will be reviewed in the proposed combined scheme for collection of waste water from Margate and Broadstairs.

 All advisory and executive non- departmental public bodies are required to adopt a board members' code, based on guidance produced by the Cabinet Office, and they should have registers of interests. The definition of interests is ultimately for individual Departments since they are best placed to decide what might be thought to influence members of their non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs).

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w48.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A number of measures are in place to protect all forests in the UK, including ancient semi- natural woodlands, where the biodiversity and cultural heritage values are the highest. In particular, the felling of any type of woodland is controlled through felling regulations. Additionally, many woodlands are subject to further controls because they are within designated areas such as Sites of Special Scientific Interest or Special Areas of Conservation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what priority she accords to high standards of animal welfare in her Department's strategy for the future of farming.  [58823]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w48.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Encouraging high animal welfare standards on farm is already at the heart of Government policy and will certainly play a role in the Department's new strategy for sustainable food and farming.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on what basis she proposes increasing the importation of beef from Argentina under the European Community's import tariff quota; and what checks are carried out to ensure that the beef is <i>(a)</i> high quality and <i>(b)</i> disease-free.  [57516]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w48.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Argentina may send beef to the Community under a number of concessionary import schemes. A recent Commission proposal will, if agreed, provide Argentina with a further 10,000 tonne quota through the High Quality (commonly known as the 'Hilton') Beef import scheme under which they are currently allocated 28,000 tonnes. This additional 10,000 tonne quota will be for one year only.
<P>

<a name="20610w48.html_para0">The detailed rules for the Hilton import scheme are set out in Commission Regulation 936&#150;97. This regulation sets out the definition of High Quality beef and ensures the arrangements under which conditions are met.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Commission Communication, "A European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development", with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> social dialogue, <i>(b)</i> priority to market-based approaches to provide price incentives and <i>(c)</i> support for coal-fired power stations.  [57894]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w48.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The European Commission adopted its Communication, "A Sustainable Europe for a Better World: A European Union Strategy for Sustainable Development", on 15 May 2001. My Department submitted an explanatory memorandum on this document to Parliament on 20 June 2001. The European Council agreed a Strategy for Sustainable Development in Goteborg on 16 June, drawing to a large extent on the material in the Commission's proposal and highlighting the importance both of stakeholder consultation and of getting prices right so that they reflect external costs.
<P>

<a name="20610w48.html_para1">The Commission's Communication included a proposal to phase out subsidies to fossil fuel production and consumption by 2010, but this does not feature in the Goteborg Conclusions. The Government do not give any direct support to coal-fired power stations. However the DTI-supported Cleaner Coal Technology Programme encourages collaboration between UK industry and universities in the development of technology and expertise which delivers environmental benefits, in a manner entirely consistent with the spirit of the Commission's Communication.

<P>
<a name="20610w48.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Department for International Development has also commissioned a study for the benefit of developing countries on "the costs and benefits to the livelihoods of the rural and urban poor arising from the application of so-called 'terminator genes' and similar technologies in developing countries." The results of this study have been published in two books: Swanson, T(ed), 2002, "Biotechnology, Agriculture and the Developing World: The Distributional Implications of Technological Change", Edward Elgar, Cheltenham and Swanson, T(ed), 2002, "The Economics of Managing Biotechnologies", Kluwer Academic Press, Dordrecht.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w48.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Advice services are an important element of support to farmers and other land managers. As part of the development of the Government's strategy for sustainable food and farming, we are considering the relevant recommendations of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food. We published our document "Sustainable Food and Farming: Working Together" on 26 March which invites views on the content of the strategy.
<P>

<a name="20610w48.html_para2">We announced two measures, also on 26 March, that are directly relevant. First, a review of the effectiveness of education and training provision for land managers, about which we will make a detailed announcement as soon as possible. Second, as an important contribution to effective knowledge transfer and dissemination, a pilot demonstration farm scheme to be operational by the end of 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will list the European Union directives and regulations relating to her Department that have been implemented in each of the last four years, specifying <i>(a)</i> the title and purpose of each, <i>(b)</i> the cost to public funds of each and <i>(c)</i> the cost to businesses of each.  [39126]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w48.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In answer to part <i>(a)</i> two tables are available in the Library of the House. The first table shows all directives agreed in the UK in the years 1998&#150;2001, for which DEFRA and its predecessors took the lead, and which have since been implemented. The second table shows council regulations agreed in the years 1998&#150;2001 for which DEFRA and its predecessors took the lead. A number of regulations agreed during this time have since expired&#151;these are not included. The list has been trawled from a variety of sources and it is possible that a small number of regulations may have fallen through the net. Regulations have a direct effect in the laws of member states and do not usually require Governments to take action to implement them. The table does not show commission regulations. Details of all regulations and directives agreed can be found on the Eur-Lex database available on the European Union's website.
<P>

<a name="20610w48.html_para3">The Department does not hold information in the form requested in part (b). This information could be assembled only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proposals she has put forward to the EU Agricultural Council regarding reform of the CAP.  [57820]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w48.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The latest stage in the ongoing reform of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) will begin with publication of the European Commission's proposals on the mid-term review of Agenda 2000 this summer.
<P>

<a name="20610w48.html_para5">We are urging the Commission to publish radical proposals based around a shift from production linked support (pillar 1 of the CAP) to support for agri- environment and rural development measures (pillar 2 of the CAP). We will continue to argue this during negotiations which are expected to continue through 2002 with a final agreement in the first half of 2003.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w48.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what reforms have been made to the Common Agricultural Policy since 1997.  [57819]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w48.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Reform of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) was agreed at the Berlin Council in March 1999. This reform, known as the Agenda 2000 agreement, represented a significant shift from price support to direct payments; reduced the economic distortions of the CAP; helped agriculture meet the challenges of further trade liberalisation; and enabled the formulation of an integrated EU rural development policy, shifting the emphasis from production support to environmental and rural economy measures in the future. It also went some way towards helping our ambitions for EU enlargement and the WTO round.
<P>

<a name="20610w48.html_para6">A further reform of the sheepmeat regime was agreed by the Agriculture Council in December 2001, simplifying the regime and making it more flexible. The ewe premium will in future be paid on a flat rate basis, and the introduction of national envelopes provides a valuable mechanism for targeting extra support for the sheep sector and for encouraging environmentally beneficial farming practices.
<P>

<a name="20610w48.html_para7">At the Berlin Council in 1999, it was agreed that elements of the Agenda 2000 package would be subject to mid-term review. We await the Commission's mid-term review proposals, which are expected this summer. In the mid-term review we will be looking to build on the Agenda 2000 reform, which we do not believe went far enough, and arguing for a further shift away from production linked support (pillar 1 of the CAP) to agri- environment and rural development measures (pillar 2 of the CAP).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the rules are for carbon trading for companies participating in climate change agreements; and what the timetable is for their application.  [53794]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w49.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 In August 2001, the Government published the "Framework for the UK Emissions Trading Scheme" which sets out how companies participating in climate change agreements will be able to trade carbon dioxide emission allowances. In April 2002, the Government issued guidance on how companies and sector associations in climate change agreements might wish to manage their interface with the UK emissions trading scheme. The Government intend to consult on legal rules to supplement these guidance documents in June 2002.
<P>

<a name="20610w49.html_para0">Since 2 April 2002, companies in climate change agreements have been able to buy allowances in the UK emissions trading scheme. Once the rules are finalised, they will be able to use these allowances to meet the target in their climate change agreement. However, the Government will not allocate any allowances to companies that have overachieved their target until companies' emissions have been independently verified at the end of the current 'target period'. Depending on the industrial sector, the current 'target period' will end between 30 September and 31 December 2002.

I and my right hon. friend the Secretary of State have made clear to the Commission that we consider progress in reviewing the Common Fisheries Policy to be a vital step in securing a sustainable future for fishing, and that we wish to see the proposals as soon as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the status of negotiations to extend the lifespan of the 12 mile limit derogation; which countries have indicated an aversion to so doing; and if delegations have made linkage between extension and UK agreement in different fields.  [57875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w49.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This issue falls to be negotiated as part of the forthcoming review of the Common Fisheries Policy. The negotiations have yet to start: the Commission has not yet issued its proposals, but says that they are imminent. It is to be expected in a negotiation on a matter such as this that delegations will seek to link issues in pursuit of their objectives. But on the matter of 6 and 12 mile limits it is plain from views already declared that a clear majority of member states favours retention of the present arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w49.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Under the Jakarta Mandate of the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Government is working internationally to protect coral reefs, notably to tackle coral bleaching and activities that can result in their physical degradation and destruction. The UK was a founding member of the International Coral Reef Initiative (ICRI).
<P>

<a name="20610w49.html_para1">Our Darwin Initiative plays an important part in our contribution to implementing the Convention on Biological Diversity in developing countries, including marine biodiversity and coral reefs. The UK has committed substantial funding to support the development of improved understanding and better management of tropical coral reef ecosystems, recognising the importance of the resource to the livelihoods of many vulnerable coastal communities in developing countries.
<P>

<a name="20610w49.html_para2">Furthermore, the cold water corals off the north west coast of Scotland, the Darwin Mounds, are expected to be the first habitat to be afforded Special Area of Conservation status once regulations to extend the Habitats Directive out to the limit of jurisdiction of UK waters are in place.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the average <i>(a)</i> time and <i>(b)</i> cost has been for registering a regional food in the last 12 months; and what assistance including advertising, her Department provides to organisations wishing to register a regional food.  [56842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w49.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Regional foods can be registered as EU protected food names under a system set up under Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2081&#150;92. The application process for registering such products involves a number of steps including checks by both this Department, the agriculture Departments of the devolved Administrations and the Commission to ensure that the applications meet the 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2002 : Column 940W</I><P>
necessary criteria for registration. Participation in the scheme is voluntary. No fee is charged on producers wishing to register a product.
<P>

<a name="20610w49.html_para4">In the last 12 months no UK regional food has been registered as a protected food name although a number have been lodged with the European Commission who are currently considering whether they meet the criteria for registration. Officials from this Department work closely with colleagues from the agriculture Departments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland as well as the applicant themselves in handling applications. The work involves advising applicants, both in writing and face- to-face, on the application process, the consideration of application and liaising with the European Commission. It is estimated that the staff costs to the Department for this work in the last 12 months is &#163;15,106.10.

<a name="20610w49.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No regional foods have been registered as protected food names in Angus. Five regional foods have been registered in Scotland, (and including these) 31 in the UK.

 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> Controls in relation to BSE, on trade in beef and beef products from other member states and imports from non-EU countries, are in force on an EU wide basis.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w50.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Veterinary and scientific advice is that livestock shows pose a risk of the transmission of Foot and Mouth or other notifiable diseases because large numbers of animals, vehicles and people are brought together from a number of different farms. Hence strict biosecurity is needed. Animal faeces may contain Foot and Mouth virus and other animal pathogens, which may survive in faeces for a period of time. Show organisers are required to draw up a biosecurity operating plan and appoint a biosecurity officer to ensure that the show licence conditions are followed. These conditions include that if animals cross a public area, any faeces is removed as far as possible and the spot covered, for example with sawdust, as is normal hygienic practice.

<a name="20610w51.html_para2">In response to the increased number of breaches of the hydrogen chloride limit in 1999, the Agency wrote a strongly worded letter to the operator of the incinerator.

<a name="20610w51.html_para3">In response to the increased number of breaches of the carbon monoxide limit in 2001 the Agency issued an enforcement notice requiring the operator to analyse the causes of the breaches and report the results of the analysis to the Agency. The reports show that if there is a loss of waste feed to the incinerator the resulting excess air cools the flame resulting in increased carbon monoxide emissions. The most common causes of a loss of waste feed are failure of the waste feed ram, bulky items blocking the waste feed chute and blockages of the ash removal mechanism. The enforcement notice and the operator's responses are on the Public Register maintained by the Agency which can be viewed at the following address:

<a name="20610w51.html_para4">With regard to the impact of such breaches on local air quality, both the operator and the Agency have carried out dispersion modelling of emissions from the plant. The Agency has modelled emissions from the plant under worst case breach conditions in comparison with current standards. It was concluded that at the highest recorded level of emissions there would not be a breach of an air quality standard.

<P>
<a name="20610w51.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 'Energy from Waste' incinerators are already tightly regulated through authorisations issued under the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC) regime. This regulatory regime is being subsumed into the even more exacting Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC). Existing energy from waste incinerators will have to apply for IPPC permits by 31 August 2005.

 The Environment Agency has implemented the EU Municipal Waste Incineration Directives through the Integrated Pollution Control regime by imposing emission limits which are as strict as, or stricter than, those required by these directives. In addition, the agency has imposed limits for nitrogen oxides and dioxins although they were not required by the directives, and, in general, tighter limits for heavy metals.

<a name="20610w52.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 May 2002]:</i> Catering waste as defined in the Animal By-Products Order 1999 includes domestic kitchen waste. Following the outbreak of foot and mouth disease, the order was amended in May 2001 to make it an offence to allow livestock and poultry to have access to any catering waste which contains meat or most other products of animal origin, or which originates from premises which handle such products. The aim was to prevent livestock and poultry from having access to material which might introduce or spread animal diseases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what advice and funds her Department is making available to local authorities to <i>(a)</i> devise and <i>(b)</i> implement zero waste strategies.  [54159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w52.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 "Zero waste" is a term that is used in different ways in different countries. Some use it to mean no waste to landfill; others use it to mean that no waste is sent to any form of final disposal. Some claim that in nature there is no such thing as waste; that what is waste for one species is a resource for another. They believe humans should emulate nature and build a society in which all "wastes" can be reused as resources.
<P>

<a name="20610w52.html_para0">This Government have not adopted a goal of zero waste, but many of the policies and actions necessary to achieve zero waste are outlined in 'Waste Strategy 20'. The challenge is to develop policies that reduce the waste we generate, while at the same time ensuring the safe disposal of wastes for which efficient re-use, recycling or recovery solutions have not yet been found.

<a name="20610w52.html_para1">Under the Best Value regime local authorities should set targets for waste reduction and produce Municipal Waste Management Strategies, in line with the national waste strategy, which prioritise waste minimisation wherever practicable. Each Municipal Waste Management Strategy should clearly set out the local authority's proposals for collection, treatment and disposal of waste, its plans for achieving the statutory recycling and composting targets and its proposals to meet waste reduction targets.
<P>

<a name="20610w52.html_para2">In March last year DETR issued guidance to local authorities on the development of Municipal Waste Management Strategies. This guidance contained a section on implementing the Waste Minimisation Act 1998 and included a case study on a waste reduction project.
<P>

<a name="20610w52.html_para3">The principal means for funding local authority waste management functions, including waste reduction, is through general grant. This is distributed through Standard Spending Assessments (SSAs). Waste management is within the Environmental Protection and Cultural Services (EPCS) SSA. The EPCS SSA increases over the three years of the Spending Review from 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 by &#163;1.1 billion. Consistent with the general local authority financial framework, it is for individual local authorities to decide the proportion of their budget that should be directed to waste management work.
<P>

<a name="20610w52.html_para4">Local councils in England also have access to a &#163;140 million household waste minimisation and recycling fund to help them meet their recycling and composting statutory targets. The Government hope the money will help move local authorities away from traditional landfill dumping in favour of recycling/recovery and as a result minimise the amount of waste generated.
<P>

<a name="20610w52.html_para5">Future funding for local authority waste management will be determined by the outcomes of the 2002 spending review.

 In April the Government launched the bioenergy capital grant scheme which includes funding for the development of the heat market utilising purpose grown energy crops or forestry wood fuel. Further funding will be available from a community and household capital grant scheme which will be launched later this year. In England, the energy crops scheme, part of the rural development programme, has allocated &#163;29 million to solid biomass and this can support feedstocks for heat generation. Officials are also working closely with the local support teams set up by the Countryside Agency, through the community renewables initiative, to develop markets for renewables.

 The Government-Industry Forum on the Non-Food Uses of Crops is studying the potential for bioethanol production. This includes an assessment of the new production technologies which utilise lignocellulosic feedstocks, including purpose grown crops and forest material, and which are likely to give a better environmental return. The Government have also launched a second round of the green fuel challenge inviting bids for pilot projects for biofuels, including bioethanol, which would qualify for duty reductions. In England, the energy crops scheme, part of the rural development programme, has allocated &#163;29 million to solid biomass and this can support feedstocks for bioethanol production. Finally, the Government are considering carefully the recommendation of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food that duty on biofuels should be reduced to the rates applied to other clean fuels.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w53.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government do not assess the number of people, across the whole country, exposed to noise every year and so there are no data relating specifically to the last 12 months. Such an exercise is, however, carried out periodically and levels outside dwellings were last measured, in 2000 for England and Wales and 2001 for Scotland and Northern Ireland, at over 1,000 sites in total, for a 24 hour period. The results of this National Noise Incidence Survey, which I announced on 20 May 2002, established that 24 per cent. of the population was exposed to noise levels between 55&#150;65 dBLAeq over 24 hours and 2 per cent. of the population was exposed to noise levels greater than 65 dBLAeq over 24 hours. It should be noted that these dBLAeq levels represent the "free field" values outside dwellings. Such levels outside dwellings (i.e. ignoring sound reflected back from the fa&#231;ade of the dwelling) are, of course, greater than the actual levels experienced from external sources inside the home. I have arranged for copies of the report to be placed in the Libraries of both houses.

<P>

<a name="20610w53.html_para1">A substantial quantity of WEEE is currently recovered in the UK, particularly the larger items&#151;white goods&#151;such as fridges, cookers and dishwashers. There are adequate facilities for processing the existing disposals of WEEE through a wide range of re-use facilities, treatment sites and shredder operations licensed or registered exempt through the Environment Agency. These include community based refurbishment initiatives for household electrical items, scrap metal processors who take in white goods and shredders which take a range of WEEE in addition to white goods. Smaller items of WEEE, which generally have a high ratio of plastics to metal, are likely to prove the most challenging fraction of WEEE to collect and recycle.

There may, however, need to be an expansion in the market for recycled material from ELVs; we therefore welcome the fact that the Directive encourages the use of such material in vehicle manufacture.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement about Government policy on the acquisition of additional Public Record Office storage space to facilitate the transfer of the <i>(a)</i> 1921, <i>(b)</i> 1951, <i>(c)</i> 1961 and <i>(d)</i> 1971 census records from the Registrar-General's Department to the Public Record Office.

<a name="20610w54.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 10 June 2002 [59066]. There is no Government policy to acquire additional storage space for the PRO to facilitate the transfer of these records from the Office for National Statistics. The PRO's storage capacity will be reviewed before the transfer of such records as the year of their availability to the public approaches.

 Records of the decennial population census are closed for 100 years under Lord Chancellor's Instrument number 12. The records of the population census of <i>(a)</i> 1921, <i>(b)</i> 1951, <i>(c)</i> 1961 and <i>(d)</i> 1971 are currently retained by the Office of National Statistics with the approval of the Lord Chancellor under section 3(4) of the Public Records Act 1958 (as amended).

The performance monitoring framework, which came into effect alongside the Single Programme on 1 April 2002, requires the RDAs to report to Government on the achievement of Tier 3 milestones on a quarterly basis and on contribution towards the achievement of Tier 2 targets annually.

 The RDAs are required to carry out sustainability appraisals of their regional economic strategies. All of the agency's schemes and projects from 2002 onwards will be subject to a formal sustainable development assessment. This assessment covers environmental, social and economic impacts. The RDAs carry out a broad spectrum of activities in pursuit of their regional economic development role and many of their activities have an environmental component, for example in relation to land and property development, in supporting the environmental technologies sector, or in regeneration activities. The Government do not require the RDAs to provide a disaggregated figure for expenditure on environmental projects or initiatives or on the environmental aspects of sustainable development assessments.

 The current value to Consignia of business from the Department of Work and Pensions is some &#163;400 million a year. The migration of benefit payments to ACT is scheduled to begin in 2003.

Universal banking services, together with Post Office Limited's plans for an expansion of network banking&#151;the provision of counter services for ordinary current accounts&#151;should lead to a substantial increase in the range and volume of banking at post offices, tapping into a very much larger customer base than benefit recipients alone. This should benefit subpostmasters both directly and through increased footfall, providing a major income stream offsetting the loss over time of the benefit book related revenue.

 The European Investment Bank (EIB) does not have direct responsibility for venture capital. Since June 2000 the European Investment Fund (EIF) has carried out all of EIB venture capital activity as the EIB's specialist risk capital arm.

<a name="20610w60.html_para0">During 2001 the EIF has invested EUR 800 million in 57 funds across Europe, primarily in the SME and start-up segments. As at the end of April 2002, EIF had a total of EUR 2115 million in venture capital operations signed.
<P>

<a name="20610w60.html_para1">EIF has invested EUR 504 million in UK funds including those that primarily invest in the UK and those based in the UK that have a multi-country investment strategy. This includes the single largest operation the EIF has approved with its commitment to invest EUR 86 million (&#163;53.5 million) in the Regional Venture Capital Fund programme. Overall more than 400 companies based in Britain are benefiting from support through EIF venture capital activities.

 The Transparency Review was initiated in 1999 following the Comprehensive Spending Review. Its goal was to improve the accountability within the higher education sector for its use of public funds. The approach taken was to ensure that UK universities adopted a robust costing system to enable them to calculate the full economic costs of their main activities of teaching and research. An activity based costing methodology for this purpose was subsequently developed, and had been adopted by all UK HEIs by the end of 2001.

During this period, Foresight established a regional network of coordinators. On-going regional initiatives, led by RDAs and others, working with trade associations and businesses to look ahead and identify opportunities and threats, have now gained a great deal of momentum.

The Government's chief scientific adviser (CSA) will be hosting a meeting of leading innovators from industry and academia in July 2002 to generate about a dozen ideas. This will be followed by a wide consultation with stakeholders from business, academia and Government before a formal programme of projects is agreed upon.

<P>
<a name="20610w61.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department continues to work with the claimants' solicitors and other parties, through the Welsh Ministerial Monitoring Sub-Group, chaired by my hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Wales, to ensure that any backlogs and delays are dealt with as expeditiously as possible. Our claims handlers, IRISC, set up an office in Cardiff last year to speed up the handling of Welsh claims. Staff there work closely with the local solicitors.
<P>

<a name="20610w61.html_para10">The system is being constantly refined and improved. I have set clear targets which are on course to be met, and which will see 15,000 full and final respiratory disease offers made by the end of year. In Wales alone we have already seen over &#163;152 million paid out under the coal health schemes.

 My hon. Friend the Minister for Energy and Construction, represented the UK at the G8 meeting of energy ministers, Detroit, 3 May 2002. He was supported by the Director General for Energy and four other officials.
<P>

<a name="20610w62.html_para0">Ministers highlighted the role of market forces, diversification of supplies, and energy efficiency in enhancing security of supply. Closer dialogue, and sharing of data and expertise were also needed, along with the physical protection of energy facilities and more flexible energy transport networks.
<P>

<a name="20610w62.html_para1">Ministers also highlighted the importance of improved energy security to economic growth, environmental protection and therefore sustainable development. In the associated open event for industry and non-government organisations, Brian Wilson emphasised the role of clean, reliable energy sources in addressing world poverty, and supported the recommendations of the G8 Renewable Energy Task Force. G8 Ministers reaffirmed the importance of renewable sources, as recognised by the Genoa G8 Economic Summit. They committed to encourage the development and introduction of clean energy technologies, including renewables, as well as energy efficiency, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development and elsewhere. They agreed also to strengthen co-operation on energy science and technology, particularly in the areas of emerging renewable sources, energy efficiency, and cleaner energy technologies.
<P>

<a name="20610w62.html_para2">There were no formal conclusions but the co-Chairs, Spencer Abraham, US Energy Secretary and Herb Dhaliwal, Canadian minister for Natural Resources issued a statement, the text of which has today been placed in the Libraries of the House.

<a name="20610w63.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Determining the available capacity in gas pipelines is technically very complex and dependent on a number of factors including gas specification, entry location, existing gas flows and relative demand. Pipeline owners therefore undertake calculations on a case by case basis for each new prospective entrant and the results are commercially sensitive. On a broad level, certain pipelines currently have a reasonably constant level of spare capacity while others may have some spare capacity on a seasonal basis only. Additional annual spare capacity in the pipelines to St. Fergus is expected to begin to develop from about 2003&#150;04.

Friend the Chancellor of Exchequer in Budget 2002 will depend, among other things such as the level of oil and gas prices, on the level of industry investment.

 A study is currently being carried out by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) to assess the overall contribution that ECGD makes to the UK economy. This work will look at both the potential resource cost to the Government of the use of its balance sheet in providing export credit support and the economic benefits to the UK that accrue through the public provision of export credits to UK industry. The results of the NERA report will be used to develop the policies needed to maximize the benefits to the UK economy of ECGD's activities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what incentives she has given to encourage <i>(a)</i> recycling and <i>(b)</i> cascade use of scrapped tyres.  [60641]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w65.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Over the years the Government have provided financial support to a number of tyre recycling projects, across a broad spectrum of activity, at various stages of development. R & D has received support through schemes such as SMART, Partners in Innovation and those run by the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council. Companies have also received grants where they have chosen to establish themselves in particular areas of the country eligible for support under schemes such as regional selective assistance.
<P>

<a name="20610w65.html_para0">The Government have been working with the tyre industry since 1995 through the Used Tyre Working Group, which includes the four major tyre associations and representatives from the DTI and the Environment Agency. This group produces an annual report which identifies the main destinations for scrapped tyres, and presents statistics which quantify tyre recovery rates. This information is made widely available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures she has put in place to ensure that whole tyres will be properly disposed of once they are banned from landfill sites.  [60639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w65.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 We are working closely with the industry and regulatory authorities such as the Environment Agency on tyre disposal and recovery issues. The proper disposal of tyres forms an important element of this work. The agency is committed to a long term programme, leading up to the landfill tyre ban, aimed at improving industry's awareness of its disposal responsibilities, backed up by effective enforcement action. We wholeheartedly endorse this programme and have provided additional funding to strengthen the agency's enforcement capabilities in this area.
<P>

<a name="20610w65.html_para1">It will be necessary to ensure that the framework underpinning the tyre landfill ban promotes responsible tyre disposal and recovery. In April, DTI issued a discussion document on used tyre issues which included a possible statutory producer responsibility model. Comments on that discussion paper have been requested by 12 July 2002. We will consider next steps in light of the responses received.

 The Advisory Committee on concentrations between undertakings is the body through which the European Commission carries out its duty to consult the competent authorities of the member states before making certain decisions on cases being considered under the EC Merger Regulation (Regulation (EEC) 4064/89 as amended). These decisions concern declaring whether a concentration is compatible with the common market following a detailed 'Phase 2' investigation, and decisions on the imposition of fines and penalty payments.

 The provision of broadcasting services potentially falls within the ambit of the Competition Act 1998 and Fair Trading Acts. Responsibility for considering complaints, and for enforcing the law if necessary, rests with the Office of Fair Trading. In addition, the BBC's commercial activities are subject to its own fair trading commitment, which reflects and in some respects goes beyond the statutory requirements. This is set out in the BBC's published commercial policy guidelines and is monitored by the Board of Governors. An independent review by Professor Richard Whish, published in May 2001, concluded that the fair trading commitment and the guidelines are appropriate to ensure that the BBC does not distort competition in commercial markets and recommended no changes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made of the contribution made by the Commission for Architecture in the Built Environment to <i>(a)</i> reducing school truancy, <i>(b)</i> reducing traffic congestion and <i>(c)</i> improving patient dignity.  [58788]<P>

<P>
<a name="20610w67.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) helps promote better design for the cultural, social and economic benefits this brings to society. CABE is working closely with the Department for Education and Skills on the design of new education buildings; achieving a high-quality learning environment is key to reducing truancy rates. CABE is working with central and local government and with developers to promote the provision of public transport in all new developments, and thereby reduce traffic congestion. CABE is also working with NHS Estates and individual NHS trusts to ensure that health care services are delivered in well-designed environments.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proportion of projects <i>(a)</i> approved and <i>(b)</i> rejected by the Commission for Architecture in the Built Environment involved the external use of vernacular materials.  [58787]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w67.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Of the projects that CABE sees, most are likely to contain a degree of vernacular or locally available materials. Using local materials supports CABE's aim to promote a sustainable use of resources and is a contributory factor in CABE's assessment of any building project.

 We held one meeting on problem gambling issues which was attended by 11 people who either represented bodies working with or researching problem gamblers or were themselves expert practitioners. We held a further meeting with GamCare.

 We received and considered submissions on the report of the Gambling Review Body from 12 bodies working with or expressing concerns on behalf of problem gamblers, including GamCare, the Centre for Research into the social impact of gambling, the Methodist church and the Royal College of Psychiatrists.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w68.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the measures set out in paragraphs 10.22 and 10.23&#150;10.27 of "A Safe Bet for Success" (Cm 5397), which deal respectively with crime and problem gambling. The proposed Gambling Commission will have greater powers than are currently available to the Gaming Board to vet the suitability of applicants for personal and operating licences; and it will also regulate bookmaking and other sectors of gambling which are currently outside the board's remit. We have emphasised to the gambling industry the importance of supporting the new charitable trust which will fund work to prevent and treat problem gambling; and the trust is this week inviting tenders for work to develop effective strategies for the delivery of research, education and support services.

 My Department will consider the general publication of commissioned reports and documents where there is a recognised interest in the subject and where there are no bars to a wider publication on grounds of confidentiality or sensitivity.
<P>

<a name="20610w69.html_para0">In general my Department aims to publish material we commission and all such publications are available through the Department's website, www.culture.gov.uk and, where appropriate, HMSO.
<P>

<a name="20610w69.html_para1">The time between receipt of a document and its wider publication will depend upon the nature of the document but the intention would be to avoid any unnecessary delays.

 The Department undertakes directly only a small number of low value non-PFI capital projects each year to improve the working environment for staff, to enable it to meet its electronic service delivery commitments, and to improve communications with its NDPBs.
<P>

<a name="20610w69.html_para4">The Royal Parks Agency has one non-PFI capital project planned in the current year involving the replacement of catering facilities at St. James' park. The capital value is &#163;3.2 million.

<a name="20610w69.html_para5">The Department provides support to its NDPBs through grant-in-aid finance capital expenditure. In addition to this source of funding NDPBs supplement their funding with donations and sponsorship from individuals and corporate bodies, funding from the National Lottery and other sources. The Department does not hold centrally information on all the non-PFI capital projects undertaken by its NDPBs. However, the Departmental Investment Strategy (DIS), published and printed separately as an outcome of the 2000 spending review, describes the Department's strategic plans for both new investment and for the use of existing assets. The DIS can be viewed on the website: www.culture.gov.uk.

<P>
<a name="20610w69.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2002]:</i> The BBC would have been informed of the Government's intentions for religious broadcasting at the same time as everyone else, with the publication of the White Paper "A New Future for Communications" in December 1999. I should clarify that our proposals published recently with the draft Communications Bill propose the lifting of the restrictions on religious bodies owning local digital broadcast licences, and not national digital broadcast licences.

[59878]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w69.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Part of UK Sport's responsibilities is to encourage and maintain UK influence within international sports federations. To support this objective they operate an International Representatives Grant Aid Programme. This programme offers financial support to elected British postholders and in addition supports governing body delegates attending formal meetings to international sports bodies. I am arranging for copies of the list of UK nationals supported by UK Sport who hold senior positions in international sports organisations to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The definition used for 'senior position' is Chair or President, Vice-Chair or Vice-President, Secretary or Treasurer.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on progress made towards the method used to determine the Government's target number of United Kingdom nationals holding senior positions on international sports federations and organisations.  [60001]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w69.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 It is one of UK Sport's responsibilities to maintain and encourage UK influence within international sports administration. My Department has agreed with UK Sport that it is not appropriate to set a numerical target for the number of UK nationals holding senior positions. Instead, performance is measured based on a qualitative assessment of the work of selected UK nationals holding senior positions in international sports federations and organisations from the annual reports these postholders are required to submit to UK Sport. The definition used for 'senior position' is Chair or President, Vice-Chair or Vice-President, Secretary or Treasurer.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20610w71.html_para2">It is not possible to make accurate estimates of the impact on employment of any future local government reorganisation in the east of England region, as this will depend on the unitary structure recommended by the Boundary Committee for England. More generally, we expect that an elected regional assembly would help to increase employment in the region by enhancing regional economic competitiveness and performance.

<P>
<a name="20610w71.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Cost estimates have been based on a number of factors, including the number of staff working on relevant policy functions in the regions at present, the expected number of assembly members and support staff, and comparable costs for other tiers of Government, adjusted to take account of the specific features of regional assemblies.

with the Code of Data Matching, agreed between the Audit Commission and the Information Commissioner. Because data for matching is drawn from a wide range of data sources, with individuals' details potentially appearing on a number of data submissions, it is not possible to identify the number of individuals for whom data has been collected. However, in its report on the 2000 NFI, the Commission reported that over 14 million records were matched. The Commission's role is to identify matches and report these back to the relevant authorities for further investigation. It is for individual authorities to identify potentially fraudulent matches and to investigate these further, and, if appropriate, prosecute. The Commission does not have details of how many cases fall into these categories. The cost of the Audit Commission's role in NFI 2000 was some &#163;600,000, including staff costs and computer costs. The Commission does not have information on the costs incurred by individual authorities in investigating potentially fraudulent matches. The Commission does not seek to estimate the potential savings arising from NFI. However, in its report on the 2000 NFI, the Commission reported that the value of detected fraud and overpayment, up to the date of publication, was &#163;50 million, an increase of 19 per cent. over the previous NFI undertaken in 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w73.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The best estimate my Department has of the number of people affected by poor sound insulation comes from the regulatory impact assessment prepared for the revision of Part E of the Building Regulations&#151;which deals with sound insulation between new dwellings. This examined data collected by the 1996 English house condition survey and concluded that 670,000 households were bothered by noise from neighbours which could be attributed to poor design of the building or a combination of poor design and behaviour of the neighbours.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w73.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Housing Corporation through the approved development programme (ADP) and supported housing management grant (SHMG) provide specially adapted housing and support for the elderly and disabled. The Housing Corporation through its national investment strategy sets out the priorities against which registered social landlords should bid for resources for both ADP and SHMG. Included in these priorities are housing for older people and supported housing for people with 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2002 : Column 1033W</I><P>
physical disabilities and frail older people. The ADP is set to rise to &#163;1.2 billion in 2003&#150;04, almost double the planned expenditure for 2000&#150;01. The Housing Corporation is currently reviewing its strategy for housing older people to reflect national policy developments such as supporting people and to encourage more joined up solutions to housing support and care needs to this group.
<P>

<a name="20610w73.html_para6">Local housing authorities have a statutory duty to offer disabled facilities grants (DFGs) to eligible applicants who require adaptations to help them live independently in their own homes. The grant is available to homeowners and tenants in both the private and social rented sector. It is subject to a means test. The Government meet 60 per cent. of the total local authority expenditure incurred on DFGs through the payment of specified capital grant. The budget for this grant for English authorities in 2002&#150;03 is &#163;88 million compared with &#163;56 million in 1997&#150;98, an increase of nearly 60 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w74.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Pound: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the future of the Millennium Dome.  [60811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w74.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 On 29 May 2002, English Partnerships entered into legally binding contracts with Meridian Delta Ltd. (MDL), a consortium consisting of Lendlease plc and Quintain Estates and Development, and with the Anschutz Entertainment Group, for the redevelopment of the dome and approximately 170 acres of land on the Greenwich peninsula. Under the deal, Anschutz will construct a world-class standard 20,000 seat arena inside the dome, capable of hosting a wide range of entertainment and sporting events. No specific price is being paid for the land under the arena, but its value is reflected in the deal as a whole with MDL. Anschutz is committed to investing &#163;135 million, and English Partnerships will be entitled to a share of profits made by the arena, after a priority return to Anschutz.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para0">In the outer rim of the dome, and spilling out into the northern tip of the peninsula, MDL and Anschutz plan to construct a mix of eating, entertainment and leisure facilities&#151;this part of the development is known as the dome waterfront. Again, the land value is reflected in the deal as a whole with MDL. MDL and Anschutz are committed to investing at least &#163;65 million. Again English Partnerships will share in profits.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para1">All risk in respect of the dome will transfer to Anschutz and MDL, who are required to maintain the dome until 2018. Should they decide at that time to remove the dome structure and redevelop the land, English Partnerships will be entitled to a 50 per cent. share of redevelopment proceeds. This protects English Partnerships' position on the redevelopment value of the land.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para2">In respect of the rest of the peninsula land in the deal (around 146 acres), English Partnerships and MDL have agreed that they will develop the site jointly. Development is to take place over the next 20 to 25 years, with an end date of 2025. The detailed terms provide for English Partnerships to retain ownership of its land until individual plots are required for development. The payout will work as follows: first, an agreed minimum land value, on the sale of any parcel of land&#151;this protects against any downturn&#151;secondly, the uplift in the value of land, 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2002 : Column 1034W</I><P>
after planning permission and at the point of sale to a developer, to reflect development value. Calculation of the split varies across the phases of development, but broadly evens out to 50:50&#151;after costs&#151;assuming development of about 14 million square feet. Where MDL develops land itself, English Partnerships will receive the agreed minimum land value plus a share of sale proceeds, or the value of the development&#151;both after costs&#151;once the development is complete.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para3">Under the terms of the original acquisition of the land, British Gas is entitled to 7.5 per cent. of sale proceeds or open market value across the site. This would apply in relation to any onward sale of land on the Greenwich peninsula by English Partnerships.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para4">No negotiations between English Partnerships and British Gas have yet taken place on how exactly British Gas's entitlement is to be interpreted in the context of the deal with MDL and Anschutz. English Partnerships will ensure that the outcome of those negotiations represents good value for money for the public purse.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para5">The deal's three parts&#151;dome, dome waterfront, and the rest of the land&#151;are subject to the grant of planning permission. Participants envisage making an application in the autumn. Until planning permission is granted the site will remain the responsibility of English Partnerships.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para6">In agreeing to accept the terms of this deal, the Government have focused on four main aspects: value for money; regeneration benefits for the area; deliverability and a proper use for the dome.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para7">As regards value for money, we have made it clear that we would only proceed with any deal if it provided proper value for money for the Government. That included comparison with the value for money which could be delivered by demolishing the dome, or by alternative development scenarios retaining the dome. The net present value of the agreements that I have just outlined to English Partnerships, assuming the full scheme is developed, is around &#163;240 million as estimated by independent advisers. The expected cash to be received over a period of around 20 years will be up to &#163;550 million.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para8">The division of these proceeds between the Millennium Commission and English Partnerships has not been finally agreed. At the time of the Legacy deal a formula was agreed. Because that deal was of an entirely different sort to this one, the precise application of the formula to this deal needs to be considered further. But a fair split will be worked out. The process of working out that split does not affect the deal English Partnerships has done with MDL and Anschutz. On the basis of independent advice, we are satisfied that the deal is good value for money.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para9">If the site had been sold outright now with no joint development agreement, the estimated value of the site&#151;the amount we would have obtained in the market&#151;was considerably less than the net present value of the deal of around &#163;240 million. This is so whether the dome was there or not.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para10">The other main comparator that we have considered is whether this current deal would have produced a higher return had the dome been demolished and the land under it dealt with in the same way as the wider peninsula lands. Independent advice from Jones Lang Lasalle satisfies us 



<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2002 : Column 1035W</I><P>
that the value to the Government of demolishing the dome would produce a lower return for the Government than preserving the dome, and developing the site in the agreed way. To make available more land by the demolition would not increase the amount of land which could be developed because the constraints on development over the period of the development are not the amount of land but planning and transport.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para11">Moreover, we have received professional advice that the establishment of a successful and iconic venue enhances the value of the rest of the development.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para12">These agreements allow the Government to participate in the increasing value of the land across the peninsula. This is sensible, and in the public interest. As the development proceeds, land values will increase. This will be reflected in the land value element in the payment to English Partnerships when the land is sold for development.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para13">The deal also ensures a return to English Partnerships if the dome site is redeveloped at some point in the future. In addition, English Partnerships will share in profits from the arena and from the dome waterfront development.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para14">The deal contains no promise by the Government to a particular crossing across the Thames. There is no commitment of any sort in the deal or associated with it. MDL has confirmed this.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para15">The issue of enhancing the transport infrastructure is of huge importance to many communities in and around London. The increased activity on the Greenwich peninsula which comes from this development will inevitably be a factor which will bear on those decisions. But there is no promise on this issue in connection with the deal. The question of river crossings is a very complex regional issue, extending well beyond the Greenwich peninsula and relating to traffic flows across the region, not just in respect of individual developments.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para16">As regards regeneration benefits, the Greenwich peninsula has for decades been contaminated and badly connected to the rest of London. It has been de-contaminated and the Jubilee line extension brings with it good transport links. This development will bring tens of thousands of jobs and up to 7,000 new homes, many of them affordable. We believe that it will have a significant regeneration effect. It will create a new mini city. The MDL scheme outperforms any other scheme in regeneration benefits.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para17">As regards deliverability, the participants in the development include players with established records in delivering developments of the size and quality this project requires. This is their core business.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para18">Anschutz Entertainment Group is part of the Anschutz Corporation, one of the largest private corporations in the United States of America. It has world-wide sporting and entertainment interests including the Staples Centre arena in Los Angeles. It has the resources to develop and the track record which shows that it can do it. It has the energy and commitment to deliver.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para19">Lendlease is a major development company. It is quoted on the Australian stock exchange, operates in 40 countries and has a market capitalisation of around &#163;2 billion. Quintain is quoted on the London stock exchange and has gross assets of &#163;637 million.




<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2002 : Column 1036W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para20">Lendlease owns Bovis in the UK and has successfully developed the Sydney Olympic village and Bluewater shopping centre. It is currently project manager for the ground zero project in New York.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para21">These players have the resources, the experience and the ability to deliver.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para22">As regards a suitable use for the dome, by creating an arena and associated entertainment and leisure facilities we have found an appropriate use for what is widely acknowledged to be a high quality landmark building. Public access is assured. Keeping the dome as the lynchpin of the development has been welcomed by the London borough of Greenwich and the Mayor's office.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para23">The agreements represent excellent value for money. The deal brings substantial regeneration benefits for the immediate area and beyond. It brings into the development players of proven ability and resource. It ensures that the public sector can participate in the increase in value of the whole estate as the development proceeds. It represents a fitting use for the dome which will enhance the value of the whole project and attract people and economic activity.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para24">A huge amount of work has gone into this deal. It represents a very secure foundation on which the Government and their private-sector partners can proceed to deliver the benefits that are available to be harvested from the dome, and for the peninsula. We considered all other options but none offered comparable benefits.
<P>

<a name="20610w74.html_para25">The deal will deliver excellent value for money, thousands of jobs and homes, an exciting use of one of London's landmark buildings and the continued regeneration of a key site in the evolution of Greenwich, London and the Thames Gateway.

 No such estimates have been made. Schools have been required to collect data on the ethnicity of pupils since 1989, and should already have an equal opportunities policy. This Department has encouraged schools to make more flexible use of administrative and support staff to collect, monitor and analyse data relating to pupils, and we have increased the number of support staff by 78,900 to 213,000 in order to reduce the time teachers spend on non-teaching tasks.

 The Department for Education and Skills has not conducted research into the level of awareness of HIV/AIDS among young people. However, the Department of Health funds a four monthly tracking survey of young people aged 13 to 21 as part of the evaluation of the Teenage Pregnancy Strategy. This has consistently shown that 96 per cent. of those surveyed are aware of HIV/AIDS.

Local Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships are responsible locally, in association with local education authorities, for early years education and child care provision and are making special educational needs support a priority between 2002&#150;03 and 2004&#150;05.

 I am confident that by September 2002 there will be sufficient places within pupil referral units and other alternative education provision for all those who have been permanently excluded. A breakdown of the number of places within pupil referral units is not held, and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 Teachers in maintained schools are subject to national schoolteachers' pay and conditions. Further education sector colleges are run by independent corporations established under the Further Education and Higher Education Act 1992 and there is no national pay structure in place. Colleges are free to establish pay scales that meet their needs and can be agreed with their staff. This Government have acknowledged the historic funding gap between schools and FE and we have pledged to bring up levels of funding and ensure upward convergence over time. Annual funding for FE has increased by over &#163;1.1 billion between 1997 and 2002&#150;03, up to around &#163;4.3 billion. With a further increase of &#163;300 million planned next year, the real terms increase in total funding between 1997 and 2003&#150;04 will be 26 per cent. The Teaching Pay Initiative (TPI) budget is &#163;311 million over the period 2001&#150;04. This is to reward excellent teaching and is over and above any general pay rise. The additional investment we are making in the FE sector should help meet the pay aspirations of their staff.

<P>
<a name="20610w79.html_spnew5"><B> Margaret Hodge: </B> 
 We are supporting colleges' recruitment strategies by making available over &#163;310 million from 2001 to 2004 through the Teaching Pay Initiative, so that colleges can reward high quality teaching. From September this year, new teachers in shortage subject areas may qualify for payments of &#163;4,000 under the "Golden Hellos" initiative and later this year, subject to the passing of legislation by Parliament, we will introduce a pilot scheme to help to pay off, over time, the student loans of newly appointed teachers in shortage subjects in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="20610w79.html_para0">We are supporting the professional development of FE teachers and staff through targeted assistance to colleges of &#163;175 million in 2002&#150;03 from the LSC's Learning and Skills Standards Fund. We have also introduced training bursaries for FE teachers in pilot institutions.
<P>

<a name="20610w79.html_para1">Recruiting and training new staff is just one element of the Government's plans to improve the quality and responsiveness of further education. We have therefore started a debate with the sector and will announce later this year our proposals for implementing a strategy, supported by the outcomes of the Spending Review, to raise standards and performance and meet employer and skill needs.

 The Department for Education and Skills does not maintain records that enable ill health retirements to be separately identified as work related. For the Department for Education and Skills the number of staff retired with a medical retirement certificate issued by the civil service pension scheme medical adviser for the year 2001 was eight.

<a name="20610w80.html_para0">Benefits provided on medical retirement are as set out in the rules of the principal civil service pension scheme and laid before Parliament, and provide for an immediate payment of enhanced pension and lump sum. Ill health retirement is met centrally from the civil superannuation vote. For the year ending March 2002, provisional expenditure met from the vote was &#163;310 million in respect of all civil service cases for which an ill health pension has been awarded. These cases number approximately 67,000 and include those who have formerly been ill health retired but who have now reached and exceeded the normal retirement age.

 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2002]:</i> The Government aims, over time, to ensure affordable, accessible, good quality child care in every neighbourhood, and to ensure a good quality free early education place for every three and four year old. Londoners are benefiting from the range of measures within the national child care strategy. For example: between 1997 and 2001, 122,000 new child care places have been created in London; in financial year 2002&#150;03 we will pay some &#163;16.7 million in child care grant to London local education authorities to support further development of new child care places; and we are targeting disadvantaged areas in London for 9,060 new neighbourhood nurseries places over the three years to March 2004, with total revenue support of some &#163;39.9 million and capital support of some &#163;16.9 million.

 The Department for Education and Skills works at the regional level through the Government offices for the regions. There are nine Government offices in England: south-east, south-west, London, east of England, East Midlands, West Midlands, Yorkshire and the Humber, north-west, and north-east. The Government offices are funded by nine sponsor Departments: the Department for Education and Skills; the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions; the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs; the Department of Trade and Industry; the Department for Work and Pensions; the Home Office; the Department for Culture, Media and Sport; the Department of Health; and Cabinet Office.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to the answer from the Deputy Prime Minister of 20 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 461&#150;62W on the Social Exclusion Unit, in which schools targets have been set for the reduction of truancy and which schools have met those targets; in what proportion of schools truancy was more than three per cent. above average in 2001 and what the current proportion is; and how many schools fall into each decile measured by the proportion of pupils days lost through <i>(a)</i> unauthorised absence and <i>(b)</i> all absence in the most recent year for which information is available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w82.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 In 1999 225 schools were asked to set targets to reduce unauthorised absence. These schools had unauthorised absence three percentage points or more above the average for their sector (primary, secondary or special) for the previous two academic years. Locally determined school level targets were agreed by the school's governing body in close discussion with the education welfare service. 117 schools met the targets that they set for themselves and in total 181 (80 per cent.) decreased their unauthorised absence rate.
<P>

<a name="20610w82.html_para0">In the academic year 2000&#150;01 326 schools recorded absence three percentage points or more above the national average for their sector (0.5 per cent. for primary schools; 1.1 per cent. for secondary schools and 2.2 per cent. for special schools). These are the most recent published results.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to the answer of 16 April 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 895W, and with reference to Sir Gareth Robert's Review 'Set for Success&#151;The supply of people with science, technology, engineering and mathematics skills', if vocational qualifications are treated as non-academic.

 The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) accredit qualifications in relation to three broad categories, general, vocationally-related and occupational. GCSEs in vocational subjects are available and suitable for young people of all abilities, and are categorised as vocationally-related. Other vocational qualifications are categorised according to the published QCA criteria as either occupational or vocationally- related. National curriculum GCSEs and GCE A-levels are categorised as general qualifications.

<P>
<a name="20610w83.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Laing: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what types of specific <i>(a)</i> handicap and <i>(b)</i> special needs are defined as constituting special needs; and how many children there are with each specific type of handicap.  [58930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w83.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The guidance contained in the new SEN Code of Practice, which came into force in January 2002, does not assume that there are hard and fast categories of special educational need. It recognises that each child is unique and the questions asked by LEAs should recognise that there is a wide spectrum of special educational needs that are frequently inter-related, although there are also specific needs that usually relate directly to particular types of impairment. Children will have needs and requirements which may fall into at least one of four areas, and many children will have inter- related needs. The impact of these combinations on the child's ability to function, learn and succeed should be taken into account. The areas of need are: communication and interaction; cognition and learning; behaviour, emotional and social development and sensory and/or physical.

 The 1998 European Union expert report concluded that currently available data indicate that mercury from dental amalgam restorations will not cause an unacceptable health risk to the general population. There is little evidence that an unacceptable health risk is associated with occupational exposure of dental personnel providing due care is used in the preparation and handling

of dental amalgam. The same report also concluded that there is no scientific evidence that the use of dental amalgam is related to adverse effects on pre and post-natal health or fertility. There are therefore no plans to commission further research into amalgam safety. However, it remains the Department's advice that dentists should continue to avoid or delay any dental intervention or medication during pregnancy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many NHS dentists there are per head of population in <i>(a)</i> the Chesham and Amersham constituency, <i>(b)</i> Buckinghamshire and <i>(c)</i> each other English county.  [57993]<P>

 The information requested is not collected in the form requested but by health authority (HA), many of which are coterminous with county boundaries. The total number of national health service dentists per 10,000 in England at 30 September 2001 is shown in the table for each HA.
<P>

<a name="20610w83.html_para13">The number of NHS dentists includes general dental service (GDS) dentists, dentists working in the salaried services of the GDS, hospital and community dentists and personal dental service (PDS) dentists. The figures are on a head count bases rather than whole time equivalent (wte) and take no account of part-time working.
<P>

<a name="20610w83.html_para14">Dentists working in more than one dental service are included in each service apart from dentists working in both PDS and GDS who are counted in the GDS only.

At national level these range from membership of the Department's policy development groups to contributing to specific consultation exercises. Locally voluntary organisations often provide specific services, for example volunteer hospital transport schemes to enable better patient access; and providing information and support networks for patients, their carers and families, about living with specific medical conditions.

 Prevenar was authorised by the European Commission in February 2001 for active immunisation of infants and children from two months of age to two years of age against invasive disease (including bacteraemia, sepsis, meningitis, bacteraemic pneumonia) caused by the streptococus pneumoniae serotypes contained in the vaccine. An assessment of the possible risks and benefits of the vaccine for this indication was considered by the Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products, the advisory body to the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) prior to licensing.

 The principal source of information in respect of establishing historic compliance with fire safety requirements is the estates return information collection (ERIC) system where data is returned annually by national health service trusts up to the end of the financial year being reported. Data in respect of non-NHS trust property that form part of the NHS estate (eg health authority offices, primary care groups etc.) are not available.
<P>

<a name="20610w86.html_para2">The most relevant indicator is 'Costs to Achieve Statutory Fire Safety Compliance Standard B (excluding fire safety)'. In this context, condition B is the minimum standard required and is defined in the NHS guidance, estatecode, as meaning buildings which do not have backlog maintenance costs in respect of fire safety deficiencies and which comply with NHS firecode guidance and statutory requirements.
<P>

<a name="20610w86.html_para3">NHS trust accommodation which is currently below condition B standard will include that for which there is work outstanding that is of a relatively low risk but required under statutory legislation.

<a name="20610w86.html_para4">Fire safety is a serious issue, which is why we have set targets for the NHS in this area and every effort is made to remedy any concerns expressed by local enforcement bodies as quickly as possible. This is reflected in the extremely small numbers of injuries and deaths arising as a result of fires in NHS hospitals in England despite the high volumes of people who access healthcare premises annually. I have also imposed targets set by HSC 1999/191 to reduce backlog maintenance costs associated with fire safety and to achieve compliance with firecode.

 In relation to the regulation of medicines, there are no existing regulatory categories defined as traditional or alternative medicines and it is not possible to estimate expenditure on the evaluation of such products.

<P>

<a name="20610w88.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The protocol for the United Kingdom's Biobank project was developed following extensive consultation with the scientific community. Independent international scientific peer review was used to inform the funding decisions made by the Department, the Wellcome Trust and the Medical Research Councils. In all, 12 experts were involved, 10 of whom were from overseas, including the United States of America, Australia and various European countries. None of these had prior involvement in the development of the protocol nor were they involved with organisations likely to participate in the study or benefit financially. A scientific management committee composed of senior scientific advisers will be responsible for overseeing data collection, setting targets, agreeing changes to the protocol, and monitoring scientific output. Scrutiny of the scientific protocol will be an on-going process and it is therefore considered unlikely that an additional body undertaking further independent scientific peer review will add significant value to the UK Biobank project.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w89.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Reports of links between chemicals in vegetables and cancer of the oesophagus relate to speculation concerning possible effects of nitrate. I am informed that the Food Standards Agency (FSA) is aware of the scientific developments in this area and is investigating the matter.
<P>

<a name="20610w89.html_para5">Vegetables, particularly green leafy vegetables, contain the highest concentrations of nitrate in the diet. Although some of this nitrate comes from the use of conventional and organic nitrogen fertilisers on crops most is naturally

occurring. Low light intensity during the growing period is the main influence on nitrate concentrations in plant tissue.
<P>

<a name="20610w89.html_para6">Many studies have investigated the possibility of a link between nitrate and cancer, but these have failed to provide convincing evidence that nitrate intake in the UK causes cancer. A new study by Professor McColl at the University of Glasgow has speculated on a possible association with oesophageal cancer in Scotland. The FSA agree with Professor McColl that the results are preliminary and require further investigation. Other areas of the United Kingdom with high nitrate intakes do not show similar high levels of the oesophageal cancer reported in Scotland. There is also new evidence available which suggests that dietary nitrate has beneficial effects. The FSA has commissioned a three-year project to characterise the potential benefits versus possible toxicity to humans from nitrate in the diet. The results of this work will be available later this year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w89.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We have no evidence that sex selective abortions are being performed. An abortion may only take place on grounds under the Abortion Act 1967, as amended. While abortion on grounds of foetal sex alone is not specifically prohibited, it is illegal. The sex of an unborn child might, however, be a legitimate factor if in a practitioner's judgment, an abortion in a particular case is justified on the medical grounds specified in the Abortion Act, for example in sex-linked inherited conditions.

 In recent years the Department has encouraged a number of initiatives taken by professional bodies and voluntary groups to raise awareness of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and to facilitate accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment. We currently support, including provision of grant aid, the work of the "contact a family ADHD alliance" project.
<P>

<a name="20610w89.html_para7">In guidance on the use of the drug methylphenidate in the treatment of ADHD in children, published in October 2000 by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE), it was made clear that a diagnosis of ADHD should be based on a timely, comprehensive assessment conducted by a child/adolescent psychiatrist or a paediatrician with expertise in this disorder. Referrals for specialist assessment can come from a number of sources including family members, general practitioners, social workers and teachers. NICE also recommended that drug treatment with methylphenidate, where appropriate, should be seen as part of a comprehensive treatment programme, which includes psychological, educational and social interventions, for children with a diagnosis of severe ADHD.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w90.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health in relation to the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002, what steps he will take to inform patients about <i>(a)</i> the disclosure of personal data to cancer registries and other bodies and <i>(b)</i> their right to object to such processing of personal data; and if he will make a statement.  [59220]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w91.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 All national health service bodies are already required by data protection legislation to provide patients with information about all likely processing and disclosures of personal data. The Information Commissioner has recently published guidance on the "Use and Disclosure of Health Data" which clarifies these requirements. The right to object to processing of personal data where the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002 are in effect is provided by the Data Protection Act 1998 and awareness of these rights is promoted by the Information Commissioner.




<P>
<P><I>10 Jun 2002 : Column 1101W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20610w91.html_para1">However, the Department will be issuing guidance to health service bodies that will both complement the Information Commissioner's and make it clear that where patients object to a disclosure under the permissive provisions of the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002, their objections should normally be respected. A sample leaflet for informing patients about the regulations and what they should do if they are unhappy about possible disclosures will be included within this guidance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w91.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I have no plans to introduce a requirement for health professionals to provide personal data to cancer registries. While the Health Service (Control of Patient Information) Regulations 2002, when they come into force, would permit me to introduce such a requirement in the public interest I will only do so if so advised by the independent patient information advisory group. In the absence of such a requirement, the regulations are permissive rather than prescriptive, allowing but not requiring information to be disclosed. However, if such a requirement were to be introduced the action to be taken in cases of non-compliance will need to be determined on a case by case basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his policy is on the certification and registration of still-born babies of between 18 and 24 weeks gestation.  [59162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w91.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Births and Deaths Registration Act 1953, as amended, provides for the registration of babies born dead after 24 weeks gestation. When a baby is born dead before 24 weeks gestation (the legal age of viability), the law does not require the birth to be certified or registered.
<P>

<a name="20610w91.html_para2">If a baby is born dead before 24 weeks gestation, parents can obtain a certificate from the doctor or midwife who attended the delivery, stating that their baby was born before the legal age of viability and showed no signs of life. This will enable the parents to have their baby buried or cremated. The Stillbirth and Neonatal Death Society's Guidelines "Pregnancy loss and the death of a baby. Guidelines for professionals (1995)" recognise that forms and certificates are often greatly valued by parents who otherwise may have little or no evidence or mementoes of their baby's existence. It states that it is good practice to offer all parents a copy to keep, whether or not they need it for practical reasons and that the documents should, where possible, be sensitively and sympathetically worded.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w91.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The sale of oral tobacco products with the exception of chewing tobacco and tobacco intended to be smoked is already banned in the UK. Because of this there has not been a need to ban imports of these products.
<P>

<a name="20610w91.html_para8">Since 1992 it has been illegal to place tobacco for oral use on the market in this country. A Community-wide ban was put in place in the 1992 Council Directive 92/41/EEC, and became part of UK law under the Tobacco for Oral Use (Safety) Regulations 1992 (SI 3134). The Europe-wide ban was renewed in 2001 in European Union Directive 2001/37/EC.

 <i>[holding answer 21 May 2002]:</i> The national quality assurance framework on exercise referral systems, published last year, aims to improve the quality of existing referral schemes and help the development of new ones. The guidelines were also promoted at two regional seminars for primary care and leisure services. The Department does not keep a national register of practices which offer these schemes, or the number of participants. These details are held locally by primary care trusts (PCTs) or local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20610w92.html_para3">The Department does not organise and centrally fund such schemes. It is up to PCTs, in conjunction with local authorities, to determine whether an exercise referral scheme fits with their broader plans for promoting physical activity.
<P>

<a name="20610w92.html_para4">The Department has funded two reviews by the former health education authority that documented progress and effectiveness of exercise referral schemes. The research showed that better designed referral schemes can lead to small levels of increased participation in activity, but that practice across the country was highly variable.

 Money for repair and maintenance is currently derived from block capital allocations provided annually to each national health service trust. The amount budgeted and spent on each element is then determined by each NHS trust. In addition, the major capital investment programme set out in the NHS Plan is making a significant contribution to improving the quality of the NHS estate. Figures are not collected centrally on the amount of block capital sums budgeted and expended against repair and maintenance by each NHS trust.

 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2002]:</i> Information is not collected centrally on the number of pupil drop-in surgeries run by school nurses, nor are numbers of nurses employed in the school health service collected separately from returns on the overall community nurse work force. Expansion of the school nursing service is a matter for primary care trusts, which are tasked with providing for the health care needs of their local population.

 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2002]:</i> Since the formation of the National Health Service Counter Fraud Service (NHS CFS) in 1998, every health body is required in Secretary of State Directions to have a dedicated and accredited local counter fraud specialist (LCFS) who can be contacted by NHS staff to report any suspicion of fraud in the NHS. One of the many functions of the LCFS is to contribute to a wider change in public and staff attitudes towards fraud in the national health service, using a variety of measures to develop an anti-fraud culture.
<P>

<a name="20610w95.html_para5">In addition, the NHS CFS has the Fraud and Corruption Reporting Line (FCRL), which is a secure channel for members of the public and NHS staff to report any suspicion of fraud in the NHS.

 The Department does not collect information about the qualifications of staff involved following 'Shifting the Balance of Power' in commissioning mental health services.

PCTs are accountable to their strategic health authority (StHA) for discharging these functions effectively. In all cases, it will be important to work in partnership with existing stakeholders, pool expertise and ensure sufficient dedicated capacity to develop effective health needs assessments, and plan and secure effective service delivery. We believe that mental health local implementation teams offer a strong and stable platform to continue joint commissioning approaches to mental health service development.

With regard to more specialised services that, by their very nature, are provided from relatively few providers, PCTs will increasingly have collaborative commissioning arrangements with other PCTs.

 Central records are not kept of commissioning by primary care trusts of the services listed. However, we are well aware that these approaches are of benefit in mental health promotion, and in the treatment of mental illness. Clinical decisions about their use for individual patients are taken locally in the context of national guidance, the evidence base, and the available resources. We have set out seven standards for the delivery of effective mental health services in the mental health national service framework. Standards one, two and three set out the action needed to ensure effective access to assessment and treatment in and through primary care. The Department published an evidence based clinical guideline 'Treatment Choice in Psychological Therapies and Counselling' to help guide referrers. 'Making it happen&#151;A guide to delivering mental health promotion' was published by the Department later in 2001; it contains a section entitled 'Physical activity as treatment', and in March 2001 we published a response to the Lords inquiry on complementary medicine, welcoming the report's recommendations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if the Government will introduce legislation for the protection of personal genetic information before members of the public are asked to donate blood samples to Biobank UK.  [55631]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20610w97.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears:  </B> 
The United Kingdom's Biobank will conform to all relevant ethical and legal guidelines regarding consent, confidentiality and use of human tissue, biological samples and genetic information. Also, as recommended in the report on research databases published recently by the human genetics commission ("Inside Information&#151;balancing interests in the use of personal genetic information"), governance of the UK Biobank will be overseen by an independent body that is separate from its owners and users. The Government do not currently intend to introduce further safeguards for the protection of personal genetic information before members of the public are asked to donate blood samples to the UK Biobank.
