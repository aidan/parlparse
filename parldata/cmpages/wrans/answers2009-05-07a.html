 In 2008, Department for Transport officials collaborated with colleagues in Communities and Local Government and regional Government Offices to set up an information management structure for the infrastructure requirements of new growth points and growth areas. That structure is now in place and provides the framework for the Department's continuing efforts to understand and offer assistance to overcome the transport challenges faced by growth point authorities. The Department has recognised the importance of streamlining mainstream funding with the needs of housing growth, and encouraging regions to do the same: up to 2014, most of the schemes in the national roads programme and over half of the regional funding allocation pot go some way towards supporting housing growth. In addition, the Department has sought to maximise the capacity of the community infrastructure fund, which is dedicated to supporting housing growth.</p>

 Following the publication of Delivering Simple Speedy Summary Justice in July 2006, the Criminal Justice Simple, Speedy, Summary programme was implemented in all magistrates court across England and Wales by March 2008. Since implementation the estimated average time from charge to disposal in the magistrates courts for adult charged cases (excluding committals) has dropped from 61 days in the year to March 2007 to 48 days in December 2008 and the average number of hearings has reduced by around 20 per cent. Following the success of this project, Her Majesty's Courts Service has now implemented a similar programme for youth cases where the estimated average time from charge to disposal for youth cases has dropped from 52 to 40 days (over the same time period).</p>

 It is not possible for an amendment to be made to the register of title through Land Registry's website. The Find a Property service, formerly known as Land Register Online, which is available through the website only allows users to view or obtain information, for example, a copy of the register for a particular property. This information is also available to any person who applies to Land Registry by post or in person. The Land Register has been open to the public since 1990.</p>

It also constantly keeps its anti-fraud strategy under review and changes its procedures as appropriate to meet developing threats.</p>

1. The data are for residents of the East of England, rather than patients treated in the east of England.<br>
2. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
3. To protect patient confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with &#145;*&#146;. Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br>
4. The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed:<br>
alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6);<br>
alcoholic gastritis (K29.2);<br>
alcoholic liver disease (K70);<br>
alcoholic myopathy (G72.1);<br>
alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1);<br>
alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4);<br>
chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0);<br>
degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2);<br>
mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10);<br>
accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45);<br>
ethanol poisoning (T51.0);<br>
methanol poisoning (T51.1); and<br>
toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9).<br>
5. These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in an HES record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
6. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES dataset and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
7. As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
8. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
9. Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br>
10. HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the national health service have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
The ICD-10 codes used to identify sexually transmitted infections are as follows:<br>
A50: Congenital syphilis<br>
A51: Early syphilis<br>
A52: Late syphilis<br>
A53: Other and unspecified syphilis<br>
A54: Gonococcal infection<br>
A55: Chlamydial lymphogranuloma (venereum)<br>
A56: Other sexually transmitted chlamydial diseases<br>
A57: Chancroid<br>
A58: Granuloma inguinale<br>
A59: Trichomoniasis<br>
A60: Anogenital herpesviral (herpes simplex) infection<br>
A63: Other predominantly sexually transmitted diseases, not elsewhere classified<br>
A64: Unspecified sexually transmitted disease<br>
It should be noted that there are other diagnoses that can be transmitted sexually but are not limited to sexually transmission&#151;they have been excluded from this response.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> PCT/SHA data quality</i><br>
PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of general practitioner (GP) practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

 We want the new inclusive Government in Zimbabwe to work and to lead to a better future for all Zimbabweans, and we work to keep Zimbabwe high on the agenda at all appropriate international gatherings. There are already effective mechanisms for international discussion and co-ordination on Zimbabwe without the need to establish a formal contact group. An example of this co-ordination is the 20 March 2009 meeting in Washington of all donors, which reconfirmed international willingness to support recovery in Zimbabwe when there is evidence of a genuine commitment by the new Government to political and economic reform.</p>

 A convincing business case is required before committing public expenditure to establishing national databases. The case for establishing a national database for personal licence holders, some of whom would be designated premises supervisors, was examined by independent consultants and they did not find that a compelling case existed. In the absence of any new evidence to strengthen the case we have no current plans to introduce a database but we will keep the matter under review. The current arrangements were designed to function effectively with or without an electronic database.</p>

 Whilst we have not estimated the level of savings that would be expected from introducing unitary authorities across England, the nine new unitary councils established on 1 April, which provide services to around 13 per cent. of the population of the two tier areas that existed in England prior to that date, are on track to make savings of over &#163;100 million per annum once they are fully up and running, as well as having new opportunities for redesigning service delivery and simplifying partnership working. Local government in Wales, which is a devolved matter, has been wholly unitary since 1996.</p>

<i> [holding answer 5 May 2009]:</i> DIUS does not collect information on the number of further education establishments who accept non-EU students. However, data returned to the Data Service shows that there were 392 FE establishments with non-EU domiciled learners undertaking some form of further education in the 2007-08 academic year. This is based on country of domicile information (the country where the learner has been ordinarily resident for the three years preceding the start of the programme).</p>

 The Government are addressing the problems faced by children in care with chronic or severe mental health needs through a range of measures including taking forward the recommendations of the CAMHS review in relation to vulnerable children and piloting the Multi-dimensional Treatment Foster Care programme for children in care with severe and complex needs. We will shortly be publishing for consultation proposals on promoting the health of looked after children through revised statutory guidance. This will require CAMHS services to provide targeted and specialist services to looked after children where there is an identified local need. Since April 2008 all local authorities have to screen children in care for emotional and behavioural difficulties through use of a Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire and in partnership with primary care trusts provide support where the screening shows this is necessary.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_364"><a name="90507w0021.htm_para5"><a name="090507120000345">The Government continue to take the difficulties many third sector organisations face during this recession very seriously, which is why the &#163;42.5 million package announced in &#147;Real help for Communities: Volunteers, Charities and Social Enterprises&#148; provides targeted help for the sector to face these challenges. This package of support was designed together with third sector leaders and took into account submissions from over 80 charities. This action plan builds on the wide range of measures the Government have put in place to support people through the economic downturn, and on the Government&#146;s long-term commitment to voluntary organisations and social enterprises.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="90507w0021.htm_para6"><a name="090507120000346">The OTS will continue to monitor this situation closely and work with its partners to share evidence on this issue and will host a sector-wide summit on the economic downturn in June. In addition, the Third Sector Research Centre will also be factoring the impact of the downturn into its analysis of the sector.</p>

 In 2008 the Department for International Development (DFID) has provided &#163;690,000 of humanitarian assistance to 10,000 vulnerable migrants and children living in Musina (Limpopo Province) close to the South African and Zimbabwean border; and approximately 40,500 vulnerable migrants who have been displaced due to xenophobic attacks in June 2008 in the Guateng, Kwazulu Natal and Western Cape provinces. While the majority of these vulnerable migrants are Zimbabwean, there are also nationals from other countries (i.e. Angola and Congo) who live in the same areas. Some of these vulnerable migrants may have refugee status, but our humanitarian programmes do not record this data. We are providing a further &#163;738,000 to these groups in the current year. We had no humanitarian spend in South Africa between 2004 and 2007.</p>
