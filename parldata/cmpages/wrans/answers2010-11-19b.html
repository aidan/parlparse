<p><i>Letter from Andrew McDonald</i>:</p>

<ul>As Interim Chief Executive of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority, I have been asked to reply to your Parliamentary Question asking what meetings members of the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) staff have held with representatives of press and media organisations since IPSA's inception; on what date each such meeting was held; where each such meeting was held; and what the names were of those who attended each such meeting. </ul>



<ul>In the course of their work, IPSA staff have meetings and conversations with a wide range of people, including from time to time with members of press and media organisations. Disclosure of details of such meetings would, in my view, inhibit free and frank discussions.</ul>

<i> [holding answer 28 October 2010]:</i> The Youth Sport Trust does not fund schools directly. The Department has paid grant to the network of school sport partnerships since 2003. All primary, secondary and special schools have been part of this network since 2006 and have benefited from this support. While the network helped schools to increase participation rates in the areas targeted by the previous Government, the fact remains that the proportion of pupils playing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low. Only around two in every five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against others schools. In removing the many PE and sport targets and requirements placed on schools by the previous Government, we are freeing them to take decisions about the competitive sport that they offer in the best interests of the pupils and parents they serve.</p>

 Compared to other G7 countries, the building blocks for enterprise in the UK appear strong. Fear of failure is lower, and perception of having the necessary skills to start a business is higher, than any country other than the United States. However, while 47% of people think they have the skills to start a business, just 4% expect to do so in the next three years and the positive headline statistics mask wide variation by region, by gender and by ethnicity.</p>

 Ministers have announced their intention to abolish the RDAs and transfer responsibility for delivery of inward investment to the national level. As set out in the Local Growth White Paper, UK Trade and Investment is currently developing a framework to deliver inward investment activity. The new framework will be organised around two operational principles. The first being the provision of national, sectoral support (effectively the front line, UK based sales force) and the second the provision of support around the local needs of investors. The people providing this support will be geographically dispersed around England and sited, ideally, near to key clusters of excellence. The full details are still being worked up.

 Universities in the UK are autonomous and develop their own strategies for competing in the global student market, and are extremely competent at doing so.

 The Government have set out plans to reform higher education student finance in England which will offer a more generous package of financial support for low income students living in England wishing to attend university in 2012/13. No full-time student will need to contribute to their tuition costs up-front and students from families with incomes of £25,000 or less will be entitled to a more generous full maintenance grant of £3,250 a year.

 Changes to the Access to Work programme made by the previous Government are designed to improve take-up among under-represented groups, including people working for small employers, people with mental health conditions and people with learning difficulties. In February 2010 Access to Work officials held a series of focus groups across the country with a number of key external stakeholders, including disability charities, business groups and ethnic minority groups with regard to plans to refocus the Access to Work programme. All parties in attendance valued the service that Access to Work provides but agreed that the programme should be more flexible, and more available to those who are in need of most help and that larger employers could contribute more. These changes were announced in the White Paper 'Building Britain's Recovery' published in December 2009.</p>

 We continue to be greatly concerned about Iran's nuclear programme. The Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has issued a number of reports on Iran, all making clear that Iran has shown no sign of suspending its enrichment related activities as required by six UN Security Council resolutions. The figures in his September 2010 report showed Iran had produced 2803 kg of low enriched uranium since the start of operations in February 2007, and that Iran had also produced a total of 22 kg of uranium enriched to nearly 20%, a significant step towards weapons grade enrichment.</p>

However, we visit Western Sahara regularly, as well as keeping abreast of developments through United Nations peacekeeping mission in Western Sahara (MINURSO) and other contacts in the region. We would of course expect to send a representative to the territory as part of our regular visits to the region in the future.</p>

 We have not had any discussions with the Moroccan Government on people reported missing following the recent violence in Western Sahara. We are concerned by reports of violence and loss of life at the camps outside Gdiem Izik and Layounne and are following the situation closely. Our ambassador at Rabat is in close touch with the Moroccan authorities at a senior level and has urged transparency.</p>

 Officials in both London and Rabat have discussed recent violence in Western Sahara with their Moroccan counterparts. The UK also chaired a meeting of the UN Security Council on 16 November to gather further information about recent events from Assistant Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Atul Khare, and UN Envoy to Western Sahara Ambassador Christopher Ross. I will discuss this issue with the Moroccan authorities when I visit Morocco later this year.</p>
