 DFID has talked at length with affected governments and humanitarian agencies operating on the ground to ensure that the needs of all vulnerable groups are adequately met. In particular, DFID is supporting programmes through the United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF). This includes &#163;2,250,000 to UNICEF&#039;s Child Protection programmes in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. This programme includes assessments of the needs of children, the monitoring of vulnerable groups and advocacy on behalf of children with the relevant government bodies. DFID has also provided &#163;400,000 to the Save the Children Fund&#039;s programme in Sri Lanka that includes child protection activities.

No representations have been received about the time scale for the commencement of payments. DFID spending on health in Malawi in financial year 2004&#150;05 on existing commitments to Government and NGO programmes will be &#163;11 million and is expected to increase by 50 per cent. with the new programme in 2005&#150;06 and subsequent years.

<p><a name="50307w08.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </b> 
 We are committed to improving recruitment and retention of teachers. Nationally, there are around 29,000 more qualified teachers working in schools than there were in 1997. In Wandsworth, the latest statistics show that teacher vacancies have fallen from 3.8 per cent. in 2002 to 2.1 per cent. in 2004.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w08.html_para0">
We have put in place a number of measures nationally to improve recruitment and retention. For example, graduates training to teach receive bursaries of up to &#163;6,000; and new teachers of shortage subjects receive golden hellos of up to &#163;4,000 on starting teaching.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w08.html_para1">
In London, the London Challenge seeks to make London a world leader for secondary education, including making London one of the most attractive places to teach. Significant changes have been made, including the introduction of a new inner London pay scale. For example, an experienced classroom teacher at the start of the upper pay scale in London now earns &#163;34,851, compared to &#163;29,385 outside London. From April 2004, teachers working in London have been able to apply for interest-free equity loans of up to &#163;100,000, through the London Challenge Key Teacher Homebuy scheme, in order to be able to afford a home in London.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w08.html_para2">
The Chartered London Teacher status is now available to teachers working in London. It rewards the skills and expertise of London teachers and provides a one-off payment of &#163;1,000 for those who achieve the status, and provides recognition of professional achievement that teachers will carry with them throughout their careers. And a new &#039;Preferred Supply Agency&#039; list has been established to make it easier for Headteachers to access agencies which endeavour to provide better trained teachers and better value for money.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w08.html_para3">
Furthermore, London Challenge is funding a teacher recruitment project, to offer a free teacher recruitment service to London schools in challenging circumstances for September 2005. Through this project, GOL are working with Battersea Technology College. GOL has already met with the head teacher to discuss staffing needs and is creating a pool of candidates for vacant posts. Currently, the staffing picture across Battersea in both primary and secondary schools is stable.

 In 2002/03 the difference between the AS/A2 base rates for school sixth forms and further education colleges was 10.5 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w08.html_para4">
At the 2002 Spending Review a record funding increase for the FE sector was delivered. The increased funding enabled the Learning and Skills Council to deliver a 4.5 per cent. increase in funding rates in 2003/04 for all colleges that agreed development plans. In the same year, school sixth form funding rates increased by 3 per cent.&#151;resulting in a narrowing of the funding gap to 9 per cent. FE colleges that delivered against their plans received a further 5 per cent. increase in funding rates for 2004/05 compared with a 4 per cent. increase for schools&#151;a further narrowing of the gap to 8 per cent. We expect a similar step in funding rates in 2005/06, further reducing the gap to 7 per cent.

<p><a name="50307w09.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 require every school to have a room appropriate and readily available for use for medical and dental examination and treatment and for the caring of sick or injured pupils. How these are staffed is a matter for local determination. For example, medical and dental examination and treatment will be done by local health professionals under local NHS arrangements, while school staff (such as a first aider) may care for a sick or injured pupil. Further Education sector institutions, as independent corporations, are responsible for the health and safety of their learners and they are responsible for determining what medical facilities or accommodation they need to have in place. The Learning and Skills Council is accountable for ensuring that FE institutions with which it contracts have in place effective arrangements for ensuring the health and safety of learners.

 Details of Royal Armoured Corps and Royal Artillery units that have deployed in an infantry role in Iraq since the end of hostilities are set out in the following table. It is not unusual for non-infantry units to deploy in an infantry role as every soldier in the British Army is trained as infanteer first, and as a specialist second. Such units would not, however, primarily be deployed in an infantry role during war fighting operations. My hon. Friend may be assured that there is assessed to be no increased risk in deploying such units in this role and that they receive the same pre-deployment training as Infantry Battalions. All units, upon return from an &#039;out of role&#039; operational tour, will undertake a routinely planned training programme designed to bring it back up to competency in its specialism. The duration of such a training programme will vary according to an individual unit&#039;s specialism.

 Routine independent sampling for radioactive contamination around HM Naval Base Clyde is carried out annually by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and involves a wide range of tests on air and land samples at numerous sites up to five miles from the naval base.

The results are published annually in SEPA&#039;s Radioactivity in Food and Environment Report, which is available on their website at www.sepa.org.uk. The latest available report, which was published in 2003, verifies that existing discharge arrangements between SEPA and the Ministry of Defence provide effective control over the levels of radioactivity that are discharged into the environment. No tests are carried out of water samples, as this source would not yield a reliable indication of the impact of contamination.

This Census data is not used in either the Fire or the Capital Financing Formula Spending Share formulae, and is therefore not used in the calculation of RSG for single service fire authorities only, i.e. LFEPA, metropolitan fire authorities and combined shire fire authorities.

<p>
<a name="50307w20.html_para5">
The UK&#039;s arrangement with Trinidad and Tobago in this field is based on what is often referred to as the &quot;Commonwealth scheme&quot;, which dates back to 1920 and effectively operates on the basis that the judicial systems of Commonwealth countries are&#151;in general&#151;sufficiently similar to allow maintenance orders made in the courts of one jurisdiction to be registered and enforced in the courts of another jurisdiction. Since there is no treaty regulating these arrangements, however, there is no formal mechanism by which the authorities of the initiating jurisdiction can put pressure on the authorities of the receiving jurisdiction if things go wrong or if a lengthy delay occurs.

This particular application was to register and enforce an English maintenance order in Trinidad and Tobago, and the application was first made in February 2002.

All EU member states have incorporated the Code of Conduct into their export licensing procedures, according to their national laws. There is no common interpretation of this commitment among member states. In the UK, exporters are required to seek a licence before exporting controlled goods or technology. A licence will not be issued if approval would be inconsistent with, inter alia, the UK&#039;s interpretation of the China embargo. The UK&#039;s interpretation of the embargo was set out by the then Minister of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the late Derek Fatchett, in a reply on 3 June 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 240&#150;41 to my hon.

<i>[holding answer 3 March 2005]:</i> The EU Code of Conduct sets a high standard for all member states&#039; assessment of applications to export all item on the EU Common Military List. All EU member states have incorporated the Code of Conduct into their export licensing procedures, according to their national laws. The list includes all the items listed in the question, although some helicopters and logistics management systems may be purely for civil use, and therefore not licensable. To ask what specific equipment the code &#039;forbids&#039; is to misunderstand the way it functions. The code obliges member states to refuse to license the export of any item on the list if, inter alia, there is a clear risk that it might be used for internal repression, aggressively against another country, or to assert by force a territorial claim. There is also a provision in the code which provides for denial of export licences for equipment which may affect &quot;the national security of the UK, of territories whose external relations are the UK&#039;s responsibility, and of allies, EU member states and other friendly countries&quot;. The code applies to exports to China and all other countries, and has proved effective since its inception in 1998. It is the criteria in the Code of Conduct, rather than the Arms Embargo on China, which have formed the basis for the clear majority of the licence refusals made by EU member states in respect of China.

 We are concerned about the extension to the Citizenship and Entrance to Israel Law, which was made on 31 January, and its impact on Arab Israelis and Palestinians from the Occupied Territories.

 We have made frequent representations to the Israeli Government expressing our concern over continued settlement activity and the routing of the separation barrier.

In January 2005 officials participated in an EU-China export controls seminar, and later this month a Chinese delegation will travel to the UK to continue this cooperation. These talks stress the importance of taking account of the use to which strategic exports are to be put in the country of final destination and the importance of refusing exports where there is a clear risk that they might be used for internal repression. The Government has not to date raised with China the specific shipment that the right hon. and learned Gentleman refers to. But the Government would not approve export of goods which might be used for internal repression or external aggression, or where we were concerned that equipment would be re-exported and used for these purposes. We have serious concerns about the export of arms to Zimbabwe, a country with a track record of armed internal repression. It is also a further indictment of the skewed priorities of the Mugabe regime if they believe arms purchases of this kind matter more than relieving the woeful humanitarian situation.

<p><a name="50307w24.html_spnew0"><b> Malcolm Wicks </b> 
<i>[holding answer 3 March 2005]:</i> In order to judge whether some of the Deemed Buyback conditions are met, three figures have to be calculated:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(a)</i> the scheme must calculate the amount of scheme rights that are actually available in respect of this member;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(b)</i> the scheme then calculates how much this would be if the scheme had been funded to the level of the statutory minimum funding requirement;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(c)</i> the Inland Revenue calculate the amount required to restore State Scheme rights to the level they would have been had the person never been contracted-out.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w24.html_para0">
In order to take advantage of the Deemed Buyback process, the full amount of scheme rights that are actually available in respect of the member held by the scheme must be paid over to the Inland Revenue before the member is restored into State Earnings Related Pension Scheme/State Second Pension. This includes voluntary contributions which are held by the scheme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w24.html_para1">
The full amount of cash in the scheme should be paid to the Inland Revenue because Deemed Buyback works by giving a member more SERPS than the payment represents. It would not be appropriate for a scheme member to keep some of the funds held in the scheme and thus give them a larger subsidy than needed at the expense of the taxpayer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w24.html_para2">
Alternatively, as Deemed Buyback is one of a number of options available to a member for securing their accrued rights, they may decide it is in their best interest to keep their voluntary contributions and scheme rights and, for example, use them to secure an annuity.

 The majority of those schemes referred to were ineligible for inclusion on the list of schemes potentially eligible for the FAS because insufficient information, in some cases including information on the solvency position of the employer, had been provided.

Plans are subject to regular review and updating as the business changes and risks are identified, managed or eventually closed.

Since 2001, the Government have significantly extended and improved civil rights for disabled people in areas such as employment, education, access to goods and services and transport. Disabled people in Coventry, South will have benefited from these improvements in disability rights. Similarly, families with severely disabled 3 and 4-year-old children who are unable, or virtually unable to walk will have benefited from the Government&#039;s decision to lower the minimum age entitlement to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance from April 2001, while older and less well off carers have gained extra help through the provisions within the National Carers Strategy.

Through Jobcentre Plus, we are promoting work as the best form of welfare for people of working age. The number of people in work is at historically high levels of over 28.5 million; in Coventry, South, the proportion in employment has risen to 68.4 per cent.

Significant progress has been made in eradicating child poverty and the latest figures (for 2002&#150;03) show that, in the UK, there were over half a million fewer children in relative low income than there were in 1996&#150;97. Since 2001&#150;02 incomes for lone parents in receipt of benefit have risen by more than prices or the cost of living. In April 2005 the child allowance rate in income support for a child up to 18-years-old will have been increased by 40 per cent. since 2001&#150;02. Child rates in income support and jobseeker&#039;s allowance are also being increased above inflation in April 2005 in line with child tax credit upratings. All of this has benefited 2,400 families in Coventry, South.

The need for face-to-face facilities for jobsearch and other aspects of our business has been superseded in many instances by new business processes and the use of information technology. For example, over the last 12 months we have seen an increase of over 40 per cent. in the number of hits on our jobsearch website. Encouraging our customers to use these new channels enables us to focus on those customers who need greatest help, through the intervention of personal advisers.</p>

<p><a name="50307w27.html_spnew0"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 There are a number of incitement offences in law which provide protection against anti-Semitic and extreme anti-Israel incitement. In particular, this includes the incitement to racial hatred offence in the Public Order Act 1986 which makes it an offence to use threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour with intention or likelihood that hatred would be stirred up on the grounds of colour, race, nationality or ethnic or national origins.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w27.html_para0">

 The National Offender Management Service is developing a joint prison probation strategy for establishing and maintaining links with employers. These links are focused on sectors that have significant labour shortages nationally and regionally, such as construction, catering, industrial cleaning, utilities, sports and fitness, driving and distribution. Opportunities are also being explored in horticulture and information communication technology. These sectors were identified following consultation with the Confederation of British Industry, Jobcentre Plus and Sector Skills Council.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w32.html_para0">
The Prison Service is taking the lead on a cross Government work programme for engaging with employers which has been agreed by the Employment, Training and Education Sub-Board of the Reducing Re-offending Programme Board. This work programme includes officials from the National Offender Management Service (NOMS), the Probation Service, Jobcentre Plus, the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) and the Learning and Skills Council. National and local employers will be invited to be involved as the work programme develops. Its aim is to build on existing work to encourage employers to contribute to the training of offenders and to commit to the recruitment of those who achieve an agreed level of skills.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w32.html_para1">
At a local level, employer links are being developed and maintained through the Heads of Learning and Skills and Resettlement Managers in establishments. They work closely with Jobcentre Plus, Learning and Skills Councils and voluntary organisations to involve employers in work and training programmes for prisoners and to encourage them to recruit prisoners on their release. From April 2005 the Learning and Skills Councils will assume responsibility for the skills training of all offenders, and will be seeking to meet local labour market needs. This will increase opportunities for linking with employers at a local level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w32.html_para2">
The Prison Service is currently developing an employer database, holding information on employers who are willing and able to offer work to ex-offenders. This will enable prison to access information about employment opportunities in their local area, and also nationally to assist prisoners who are held at establishments outside their home areas.

Arts for offenders are supported through the curriculum in prisons and through financial support provided centrally to several national arts organisations to actively promote arts activities in prisons. Most prisons now have a Head of Learning and Skills, funded by the Department for Education and Skills, and they will determine the part that arts activities and arts organisations can play within the establishment. At a major prison Arts conference last year to celebrate and promote arts activities for offenders, a guide was launched for Heads of Learning and Skills and Managers in the Voluntary Sectors on provision of voluntary sector activities in prisons. This includes a consistent and joint approach to joint working on setting up, monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of provision.

 Public confidence in the criminal justice system (CJS) is assessed using questions in the British crime survey. Latest data shows that the proportion of people who believe the CJS is effective in bringing people who commit crimes to justice has increased to 42 per cent.

<p><a name="50307w34.html_wqn4"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures he plans to introduce to reduce the level of violent crime.  [218791]</p>




<p><a name="50307w34.html_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 British Crime Survey figures&#151;the most reliable long-term indicator of underlying trends in violence&#151;indicate that the level of violent crime has fallen by 36 per cent. since 1995, when there was a peak of over 4 million violent incidents, and by 26 per cent. since 1997.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w34.html_para23">
The Government have taken action to ensure better policing and better prevention and protection against crime. At the end of August 2004, there were nearly 140,000 police officers in service, an all-time record. The Street Crime Initiative, launched in 2002 in 10 police force areas to tackle robbery, secured a 17 per cent. reduction in robberies in those areas in the first year. The levels of robbery have continued to fall, with the number of recorded robberies in the year to September 2004 down by 18 per cent. compared to the previous 12 month period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w34.html_para24">
Nevertheless, the Government continue to take the issue of violent crime and the impact it has on people&#039;s lives very seriously. That is why we have introduced a number of measures to tackle violent crime, and will continue to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w34.html_para25">
Almost half of all violent crime is alcohol-related and the Home Office, jointly with the Department of Health, are tackling this through the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy which was announced on 15 March 2004. There have since been two Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaigns led by the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers, the first in 92 police areas in the summer of 2004 and the second in 180 police areas during the Christmas and new year period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w34.html_para26">
The two campaigns focused on tackling violent and disorderly behaviour by drunken troublemakers and the illegal sale and consumption of alcohol by under-18s. During the most recent campaign, the police and their partners visited over 31,000 licensed premises, carried out &quot;sting&quot; operations in nearly 1,000 of these, issued over 4,000 fixed penalty notices for alcohol-related offences, made over 6,000 arrests and confiscated alcohol from over 2,800 adults and juveniles. Further campaigns of this kind will be held.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Mar 2005 : Column 1625W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w34.html_para27">
We are also running the Tackling Violent Crime Programme in six police force areas. This programme aims to help local areas reduce violent crime and improve local partnership working.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w34.html_para28">
On 21 January we published a number of proposals in a consultation document, &quot;Drinking Responsibly&quot;. These include the introduction of:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Alcohol Disorder Zones&quot;, with costs recovered from the pubs and bars which cause the most disorder;</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">an immediate 24-hour banning order on the sale of alcohol for premises found to be persistently selling alcohol to underage drinkers; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Drinking Banning Orders&quot; for persons issued with three fixed penalty notices or three alcohol or disorder-related convictions, excluding them from pubs and bars within a specified period for a fixed period of time.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w34.html_para29">
We are also taking action against other types of violent crime. The fight against domestic violence will be reinforced in July 2005 when the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 takes effect. Courts will have greater powers to protect victims of domestic violence against further harassment by being able to issue restraining orders, even when a defendant has not been convicted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w34.html_para30">
Finally, we recognise the damaging impact of hate crime on community cohesion and public perceptions of safety. We have introduced proposals to make incitement to religious hatred a criminal offence under the Serious and Organised Crime and Police Bill.

<p><a name="50307w35.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 We have introduced a range of measures across England and Wales to improve early intervention and the response to offending.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w35.html_para0">
The youth justice agencies have been completely reorganised to improve delivery , through establishment of the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales and multi-agency youth offending teams in all local areas .
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w35.html_para1">
For under 10s we have introduced the child safety order, parenting contracts and parenting orders. The parenting measures also extend to over 10s.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w35.html_para2">
For over 10s who offend we have introduced structured reprimands and final warnings ; and for those who go to court the referral order with restorative justice panels, reparation order and action plan order. The Youth Justice Board has developed the intensive supervision and surveillance programme, which provides a strict and closely monitored regime for prolific and serious young offenders who might otherwise receive a custodial sentence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w35.html_para3">
We have also published our proposals to focus sentencing more clearly on the prevention of offending, by strengthening the range of community sentence interventions and introducing a specific intensive supervision and surveillance order.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>7 Mar 2005 : Column 1626W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>





<p><a name="50307w35.html_wqn1"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he plans to take to reduce the number of young people released from custody who re-offend within two years.  [219359]</p>




<p><a name="50307w35.html_spnew1"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Most young people who are sentenced to custody receive a detention and training order (DTO). The DTO is a two-part sentence, the first half spent in custody and the second in the community. The intention is to work with the young people during their time in custody to tackle their offending behaviour and to prepare them for life after release. The second (community) part of the order seeks to build on what has been begun, particularly by providing educational, training or employment opportunities. Youth offending teams (YOTs) are involved in both parts of the order and are responsible for putting in place the interventions during the community part.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w35.html_para4">
The Youth Justice Board (YJB) is working to enhance community interventions and to strengthen continuity between the two parts of the order. Young people who receive custodial sentences tend to be those with a high risk of reoffending, but the integrated approach embodied in the DTO seeks to give them the best chance of turning away from offending and making a positive contribution to the community.

<p><a name="50307w35.html_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The Youth Justice Board (YJB) oversees the operation of the youth justice system, including ensuring that Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) understand their role and how best to carry it out. It has established a performance management framework, designed to ensure local services work together to prevent children and young people from offending in the first place and to reduce the risk of further re-offending by existing offenders. It has introduced effective practice principles based on research evidence of what works in reducing offending and this is being rolled out across England and Wales. This is being supported and underpinned by the development of a National Qualification Justice professionals. The YJB is committed to ensuring that 80 per cent. of the youth justice workforce has benefited from professional training by March 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50307w35.html_para5">
The YJB has also been working worked closely with the antisocial behaviour unit in the Home Office to ensure that YOTS along with their local authority partners and the police put in place targeted prevention programmes aimed at diverting children and young people from antisocial and sub criminal activity. The YJB has developed guidance for YOTS for dealing with antisocial behaviour issues, which is due to be published shortly. Also the forthcoming draft Youth Justice Bill proposes to clarify the YOTS&#039; role in supporting Antisocial behaviour initiatives.
