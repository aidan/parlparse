<a name="80129w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister what has been the cost of media presentations and press conferences given by the Prime Minister, other than those held at No. 10 Downing Street. [25184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 January 1998]:</i> The Prime Minister has held press conferences outside Downing Street at a number of international events--the Summit of the Eight in Denver, European Councils, the launch of the UK Presidency and the Anglo French Summit, for example. Information about the cost of these events could only be provided at disproportionate cost to the taxpayer.

<P>
<a name="80129w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Fyfe: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will make it Government policy that no <i>(a)</i> assistance, <i>(b)</i> trade deals and <i>(c)</i> armament sales, be provided to Afghanistan while it remains in the control of the Taliban regime. [23982]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 January 1998]:</i> In view of the continued fighting between the Taliban and the Northern Alliance trade between the UK and Afghanistan is negligible. There is an EU arms embargo on sales of military equipment to Afghanistan. At the instigation of the UK Presidency, the EU adopted a new Common Position on Afghanistan on 26 January which calls on Afghanistan's neighbours to halt the supply of arms to the factions and support the UN's peace efforts.

<P>
<a name="80129w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister by what means an individual can establish whether he is the subject of an MI5 file in cases where the category of the file is no longer the subject of security service interest. [26228]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 In order to safeguard the operational effectiveness of the Security Service it has been the policy of successive Governments not to disclose information about the operations of the Security Service including about whether the Service holds or has held files on any individual.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w01.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the reports and recommendations of the pay review bodies. [26729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w01.html_spmin3"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The 1998 reports of the five pay review bodies have been published today. Copies are available in the Vote Office and the Library of the House. I am grateful to the Chairmen and Members of the pay review bodies for the work they have put into them.




<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 1998 : Column: 308</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para0">The Government have twin objectives: to run a stable economy in which inflation is low and there is long-term prosperity; and to reward the effort and dedication of those working in many of our most important public services, including schools, hospitals and the Armed Forces, while leaving as much money as possible for front line services.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para1">In the evidence the Government submitted to the pay review bodies, we stressed the need for their recommendations to be affordable to ensure that Departments can maintain the delivery of services within their agreed spending plans. We also made it clear that pay increases throughout the economy should be compatible with the Government's overriding economic objective of stable growth and long-term prosperity. Responsible decisions now on pay, in both the private and the public sectors, will help to secure jobs and prosperity in the future.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para2">Against this background, in considering the recommendations of the independent pay review bodies, the Government have sought to strike a balance between ensuring that the pay settlements for these important public sector groups are fair; that they are affordable within Departments' existing spending plans; that they are consistent with the Government's inflation target of 2.5 per cent; and that they are responsible in terms of the long-term stability of our economy.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para3">The main pay recommendations average some 3.9 per cent. The Government believe that this is high in relation to inflation, both the headline rate (3.6 per cent.) and the underlying rate (2.7 per cent.). It is also significantly higher than the average of 3.3 per cent. for last year's recommendations, which were introduced in stages by the previous Administration to accommodate the public expenditure costs.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para4">After careful consideration the Government have decided to accept this year's main pay recommendations in full. However, to ensure that Departments can accommodate the costs without damaging front line services and to ensure that these awards do not lead to unwelcome increases in pay pressures throughout the economy more generally, we have decided that it is essential to stage their introduction. Full implementation will therefore be achieved by December this year following a first-stage increase of two per cent. for each group from April.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para5">The main pay recommendations are as follows:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) has recommended increases of 3.75 per cent. in the basic military salary for all ranks and classes except Privates Classes I, II and III and Lance Corporals Class III, for whom they recommend increases of 4.2 per cent.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Review Body on Doctors and Dentists Remuneration (DDRB) has recommended general increases of 4.2 per cent. except for General Medical Practitioners, for whom they recommend increases of 5.2 per cent.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine (NPRB) has recommended increases of 3.8 per cent. in national pay scales.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The School Teachers Review Body (STRB) has recommended increases of 3.8 per cent. in teachers' pay.




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>29 Jan 1998 : Column: 309</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Review Body on Senior Salaries (SSRB) has recommended:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) increases of 3.5 per cent. in the minimum and maximum values of each of the pay ranges for the senior civil service. Within the ranges, Departments will determine individual salaries on the basis of performance.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) new pay ranges for senior military officers within which the pay of individual officers will be determined according to job weight.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(c) increases of 3.5 per cent. in judicial salaries.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para6">The effect of staging is that, on average, the rates to be paid from April 1998 are 3.3 per cent. higher than those paid from April last year, and the rates to be paid from December 1998 will be 3.9 per cent. higher than those paid from last December. The average first-year increase will be 2.7 per cent. in 1998-99, compared with the rates of pay in force at the end of 1997-98. But since those rates did not apply throughout the year, the more appropriate comparison is between the pay received in the corresponding months of each year. The Government believe this represents a fair deal for these hard working and dedicated public sector staff, on whom the whole country depends.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para7">In addition, the Government are separately taking action to improve training and development, and address concerns about recruitment and retention, in nursing and other professions allied to medicine. We are providing for an extra 1,300 training places for nurses this year, launching a national recruitment campaign and implementing more family-friendly employment policies.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para8">The staging arrangements will apply to all groups. They will extend to the recommended increases in the minima and maxima of the senior civil service pay ranges and the awards departments will determine for the senior civil service and senior military officers within the framework set by the SSRB recommendations.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para9">Pay increases for MPs and Ministers are linked to the pay ranges for the senior civil service, which means their awards will be treated in the same way as other groups. They will, therefore, receive an increase of 2 per cent. on 1 April. The balance of the 1998 recommendation will be paid on 1 April 1999; in the same way, 0.75 per cent. is due on 1 April 1998, resulting from the staging of last year's awards, which other groups received in December 1997.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para10">As agreed last year, Cabinet Ministers will in 1998-99 forgo, for a second year, the substantial increases recommended by the SSRB in 1996 to which they would be entitled.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para11">The Reports are substantial wide-ranging documents. This response addresses the main pay recommendations. Many other detailed recommendations will also be accepted, although some will require further consideration and discussion as necessary. In particular the NPRB recommendation for additional discretionary increments will need to be addressed as part of wider NHS pay discussions; and the DDRB recommendation for the enhancement of GMP's net remuneration will need to be considered and discussed as proposed.
<P>

<a name="80129w01.html_para12">The Government have asked the SSRB to resume work, which had been temporarily deferred, on the pay of Lords Ministers outside the Cabinet.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what discussions he has had with ministerial colleagues regarding the financial crisis in Asia; and if he will make a statement. [23871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 January 1998]:</i> The financial turbulence in Asia was discussed at length by European Finance Ministers at the ECOFIN meeting on 19 January, which the Chancellor chaired. HM Treasury, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Bank of England continue to monitor developments in the region very closely.
<P>

<a name="80129w02.html_para1">Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors of the potential participants in the supplemental finance assistance package for Korea--the UK, Australia, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United States--issued a statement on 24 December 1997, welcoming the Korean authorities' announcement of additional measures to strengthen macroeconomic policy and accelerate structural reforms, and the disbursement of US$5 billion by the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
<P>

<a name="80129w02.html_para2">The potential participants stated that they would be prepared to support action to advance by early January existing commitments of official finance, including the acceleration of IMF disbursements, and the disbursement of a substantial portion (US$8 billion) of the supplemental financial commitments made bilaterally--in the context of a significant voluntary extension of the maturities of existing claims by international banks on Korean financial institutions. The UK's share of this US$8 billion would be US$440 million.
<P>

<a name="80129w02.html_para3">Following discussions between the major commercial banks involved, the IMF and the Korean authorities, I understand major commercial banks are generally rolling over their short term lending to Korea. Discussions are under way on a medium term agreement providing for a significant extension of the maturity of this debt. Bilateral official finance, including the UK's facility, has not yet been disbursed.
<P>

<a name="80129w02.html_para4">The IMF also released a statement on 24 December, which welcomed Korea's intensification and acceleration of its macroeconomic policy adjustments and structural reforms, and indicated the IMF's intention to accelerate the resources available to Korea under the existing stand-by credit.
<P>

<a name="80129w02.html_para5">Since these statements were made, the IMF disbursed US$2 billion on 30 December 1997, and a further US$2 billion on 7 January 1998. This brings the total IMF disbursement to US$13.1 billion.
<P>

<a name="80129w02.html_para6">The financial turbulence in Asia is of global concern and requires a global response. As an open economy, the UK is deeply interested in economic prosperity in Asia. 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 1998 : Column: 312</I><P>
The UK has worked closely with other G7 colleagues, especially Japan, and will work with the IMF and the World Bank to help resolve the current crisis.
<P>

<a name="80129w02.html_para7">Her Majesty's Government are confident in Asia's long-term economic prospects. The factors which have led to the tremendous growth in the region are still there. Now what is needed is a strong commitment from countries throughout the region to necessary policy reforms in conjunction with IMF and World Bank, to restore confidence.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when he will reply to the letters of 18 September, 23 June and 30 July 1997 from the hon. Member for Twickenham. [25219]<P>

<P>
<a name="80129w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The hon. Gentleman should by now have received a reply, dated 28 January, from my right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor to his letter of 18 September which referred to letters to the Lord Chancellor from his constituent of 23 June and 30 July. The officials involved in handling correspondence are aware how seriously the Lord Chancellor regards complaints against the judiciary, and the consequent need to deal promptly and properly with such correspondence. Steps have been taken to avoid such delays in future.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the Law Society's ability to ensure that when a solicitor acting as a trustee has been negligent, those concerned will be compensated for resulting losses whenever they occur; and if he will make a comment. [24806]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have not made such an assessment. This is a matter for the Law Society. If the negligence or the quantum of the negligence is disputed, it would be a matter for the courts.

 At present the small claims leaflets are available only in English and Welsh. By April 1998 they will also be available in Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu. Court forms are available only in English.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w02.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Burnett: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps have been taken following the National Audit Office report, "Handling Small Claims in the County Courts" (HC 271, of Session 1995-96), to make the small claims procedure more accessible for <i>(a)</i> non-English speaking litigants and <i>(b)</i> the disabled. [24872]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> A contract has been let to translate all seven small claims leaflets into the following languages:

<P><I>29 Jan 1998 : Column: 314</I><P>
Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Gujarati, Hindi, Punjabi and Urdu. It is expected they will be available to court users from April 1998. <i>(b)</i> Court users are now asked to let the court know if they need special facilities so that arrangements can be made to accommodate them. Some courts have installed Minicom and loop systems and the Court Service will pay the cost of interpreters for deaf litigants and witnesses in civil hearings. A review will also commence in April 1998 which will look at disabled provision in all the courts to identify what needs to be done to improve access and facilities in line with the Disability Discrimination Act.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what percentage of county courts provide <i>(a)</i> wheelchair access, <i>(b)</i> disabled toilet facilities and <i>(c)</i> facilities for persons with seeing and hearing disabilities. [24960]<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There is a National Register of Public Service Interpreters, which provides a list of qualified interpreters who adhere to a code of conduct and a standard of service delivery. Civil courts do not however, provide interpreters. It is for the parties to obtain, and pay for, any such requirements.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what representations he has received in respect of the piloting of the fast track regime prior to any introduction of fixed costs; and if he will make a statement. [25003]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Some support for the idea of piloting the fast track was expressed in response to the Working Paper "Judicial Case Management", published in July 1997. In line with Lord Woolf's recommendations hypothetical case studies are in hand but no final decision about the basis for a fixed-costs regime has yet been taken.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The documentation of withheld records kept by the Public Record Office, and in particular of withheld extracts from documents, is not in a form which would enable a listing of unavailable records from 1967 to be produced by their titles, within the time available and without disproportionate cost.

The Environment Agency is responsible for certifying comprehensive studies. We have asked the Agency to ensure that the scientific basis for these studies is rigorously tested.

 A specific figure for the funding of the bridleway network is not available. Revenue expenditure for local authorities on public rights of way, including bridleways, is taken into account in the calculation of local authorities' standard spending assessments (SSAs), as used in the distribution of revenue support grant. It is not covered by a distinct SSA component, but is included together with expenditure on many other services within the district level sub-block--"All Other Services".

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how the Government plan to ensure that the matter of global warming is addressed by the <i>(a)</i> WTO, <i>(b)</i> IMF, <i>(c)</i> G7 and <i>(d) </i>OECD. [25480]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Global warming, or climate change, is already discussed at Ministerial and official meetings of the OECD, and was a feature of the G7 discussions in Denver last year. The Government are committed to taking forward further discussions regarding action arising from the Kyoto Protocol in these fora.
<P>

<a name="80129w04.html_para0">The WTO Committee on Trade and Environment held useful and informative discussions with the secretariats of a number of multilateral environmental agreements last summer, and intends to repeat the exercise this year; we hope very much that the secretariat to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change will be able to participate.

<a name="80129w04.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Energy Products Directive is still under discussion within Europe, and its final form, if agreed, is unlikely to be identical to the draft. It is, however, clear that the measures in the directive would make a small but significant contribution towards delivering the UK's climate change objectives.

 The Environment Agency's charges to companies are subject to annual Ministerial review.

 None. It is the role of the Environment Agency, rather than the Secretary of State, to regulate the import and use of waste for secondary liquid fuels.

 The overarching Terms of Reference for DETR's CSRs include a requirement to take particular account of the policy aim of sustainable development. Individual CSRs are reflecting that, and other policy aims, in their work. One of the Department's CSRs is also looking specifically at environment policy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w07.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Our broad and vigorous standards agenda was set out in "Building Excellent Schools Together" (BEST), the Education White Paper for Wales, published in July last year.
<P>

<a name="80129w07.html_para6">We have introduced legislation to realise our objectives. The Schools Standards and Framework Bill proposes the legislative measures necessary to raise standards at primary and secondary level in both Wales and England. Amongst other things it provides for smaller infant classes, places a duty on local education authorities to support schools in raising educational attainment standards and secures the basis upon which these authorities will act to support schools in setting and meeting targets for continuous improvement. The Teaching and Higher Education Bill (currently in the House of Lords) will give teachers scope to lift professional standards through a General Teaching Council for Wales. The legislation proposed will also allow local education authorities LEAs and further education

institutions to make provision for post-16 students jointly to better meet students' needs and to reduce duplication of courses.
<P>

<a name="80129w07.html_para7">We have set out a range of challenging new all-Wales targets through BEST aimed at raising standards in schools in Wales across the board. Working in partnership with ACCAC and OHMCI the Welsh Office is also implementing an all-Wales strategy to raise levels of achievement in literacy and numeracy. We are providing additional resources to support schools in this work--&#163;50.267 million for recurrent costs in schools within the 1998-99 local government revenue settlement, and &#163;65 million of capital funding over the lifetime of this Parliament for much needed school renovation and repair work. We will also be making nearly &#163;30 million available in 1998-99 through the Grants for Education Support and Training (GEST) programme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what assessment he has made of the yearly costs to the NHS of meeting the nursing costs of long-term care. [25912]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 None, but the costs of long term care are a matter of concern to this Government and one of our manifesto commitments was the establishment of a Royal Commission to work out a fair system for funding long term care of the elderly across the UK. The Commission was established last December and will report in 12 months.

<P>
<a name="80129w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 Before reaching decisions on the changes to be introduced next year, the implications for each school of a number of models were examined, and I am satisfied that there is no unjustified re-distribution of resources. The longer-term objective of full commonality will ensure equity of treatment in funding for all schools, regardless of the area or the school sector in which they are located, and is therefore in line with policy appraisal and fair treatment principles.

<a name="80129w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
The inclusion of the mammalian meat and bone meal in livestock feed has been prohibited since 29 March 1996, and since that date a total of 2,430 visits have been made to feedmills for the purpose of taking samples of ruminant feed for testing for the presence of mammalian protein.
<P>

<a name="80129w08.html_para0">Of a total of 3,394 samples taken, five samples have given apparently positive results. On further investigation, one positive sample was in material imported from another member state, and the authorities were informed. It was established that the positive results in three samples were not due to the presence of mammalian protein, and the other positive sample proved negative on retesting.
<P>

<a name="80129w08.html_para1">There have therefore been no prosecutions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 Recent expansion of nursery provision has occurred under the aegis of the "making Belfast work" and Londonderry regeneration initiatives and, more recently, the EU special support programme for peace and reconciliation. Nursery provision approved by the Department of Education under these initiatives must:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>be sited where it will have maximum educational impact, through targeting areas of greatest social and educational need;

<BR>

<P>

<a name="80129w08.html_para2">Under the Government's planned expansion of pre-school education provision, new nursery provision will only be approved if it is included in an education and library board's pre-school education development plan. These plans will target places initially on children from socially disadvantaged circumstances and the oldest four-year-olds--those with July and August birthdays.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimates for staff reductions were included in the business case for the new computer system at the Immigration and Nationality Directorate; and what revisions have been made to take account of the delays in the programme for installation. [26074]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The estimated savings projected in the business case were based on staff reductions of 898 by 2001-2002. The business case estimated the benefit of the Programme to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate by balancing the savings against the charges which would be payable to Siemens Business Services. The majority of these charges are directly geared to the savings and do not become payable until the new computer system is operational. No revision to the business case will be made until revised dates for the installation and piloting of the solution have been agreed.

 Measures being taken to deal with the problem of absconding include the use of dedicated enforcement teams throughout the country; working in co-operation with the police and other government agencies; the use of intelligence for the effective targeting of resources; the establishment of a full time Port Absconder Tracing Team working in the Metropolitan Police Area; and the speeding up of Home Office procedures to reduce the potential for absconding.

 Sums due as a result of charge liabilities under the Immigration (Carriers' Liability) Act 1987 (ICLA) are public moneys owed to the Consolidated Fund of Her Majesty's Treasury. The Ports Directorate of the Immigration Service is responsible for recovering amounts owed by carriers under the ICLA and pursues a pro-active debt recovery strategy aimed at reducing the amounts outstanding as quickly as possible.

 These figures are available only for 1997 and are set out in the table. Figures before 1997 could be produced only at disproportionate cost. It must be made clear that some of the incurred charges may have been paid since these statistics were compiled or may be about to be paid under an agreement negotiated with the Home Office.

 My right hon. Friend has received three such letters from individual members of the public.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 I am placing in the Library a copy of the questionnaire, which we sent to 84 organisations. We received responses from six local authorities; one representative educational organisation; five charities; four large manufacturers; three small manufacturers; ten financial and other service organisations; eight large organisations involved in marketing; and nine retailers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The purpose of the first data protection principle is to ensure that personal data are processed fairly and lawfully.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Police powers to carry out road checks are set out in legislation. The Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 provides that the police may establish a road check to deal with persons unlawfully at large or where there is a serious arrestable offence involving those travelling or considered to be travelling in a vehicle. Section 13A of the Prevention of Terrorism (Temporary Provisions) Act 1989, as inserted by section 81 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, also created a new power for the police to stop and search vehicles for the purposes of preventing terrorism.
<P>

<a name="80129w10.html_para0">In addition, section 163 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 (as amended) provides that a person driving a mechanically propelled vehicle on a road must stop the vehicle on being required to do so by a constable in uniform.

[25896]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Since 1 April 1996, when the Business Appointment Rules in their current form came into effect, 24 members of staff across the Department and its agencies have reported offers of employment. These resulted in 19 applications for approval under the Rules.
<P>

<a name="80129w10.html_para1">Staff are made aware, on appointment, of their obligations under the Business Appointment Rules and again, on leaving. General reminders are issued from time to time but it is the responsibility of the individual to comply with the requirements.
<P>

<a name="80129w10.html_para2">There is no fully effective comprehensive mechanism for monitoring compliance with the Rules once individuals have left Crown employment. The emphasis is on ensuring that staff are fully aware of their obligations under the Rules before they leave, and on giving the individual the opportunity to discuss the matter and, if they wish, to make representations in cases where conditions are imposed.
<P>

<a name="80129w10.html_para3">Any failure to comply with the Rules could come to the Department's notice in any number of ways. Any condition which prohibits a former member of staff from dealing with the Department on behalf of an outside employer would, of course, be monitored.

Its purpose was to develop materials for use in warheads, to conduct research into the chemical properties of such materials and to design chemical engineering processes for their manufacture. It also operated certain associated chemical plant. During its existence two largely classified series of reports were produced dealing with materials and technical matters entitled, (i) Reports/ Laboratory Reports/Materials Reports and (ii) Technical Memoranda 1959-90.

 The Ministry of Defence conforms with national legislation on ionising radiation and holds all those records which it is required to keep on classified radiation workers, including submariners. With regard to mortality from cancer among submariners, an examination conducted under the auspices of the Medical Research Council has concluded that working in submarines was not associated with any increased cancer mortality.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The potential problems associated with classical swine fever in Germany are not new. There has been an on-going problem with CSF in the Community for 10 years, but the disease has not spread to the UK.
<P>

<a name="80129w11.html_para0">European Community legislation lays down control measures, including movement restrictions, to prevent the spread of CSF. The situation is kept under continuous review by the EC Standing Veterinary Committee on which the UK is represented. The SVC may adopt additional controls on an ad hoc basis as and when the need arises. In the past few days, the SVC has imposed a prohibition on exports of pigs and pig semen from specified areas in the region of MecklenburgVorpommern in Germany.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Sugar Beet Research and Education Committee has been the subject of a non-departmental public body prior options review. Departments are asked to look at the functions the body carries out; to assess whether they are still needed; and to decide whether the current arrangements provide the best way of carrying them out.
<P>

<a name="80129w11.html_para3">The SBREC has carried out its functions well, and I am very grateful to its past and present chairman and members, who have given valuable service to the industry over the years. Although the committee has no statutory basis, its work is linked to certain statutory arrangements which date back to 1938 and require my Department to be closely involved with the research programme. I believe there is no need for the Government to be so closely involved in these arrangements, but that there is a case for industry-funded research and education to continue, and that it would be more appropriate, if the industry agrees, for these to be under the aegis of a development council for sugar beet. My Department is therefore consulting interested parties on a proposal to establish such a council to take on the functions currently undertaken by the SBREC.
<P>

<a name="80129w11.html_para4">In deciding whether to establish a development council, Ministers have to follow the procedures in the Industrial Organisation and Development Act 1947. In particular, they need to be satisfied that its establishment is desired by a substantial number of persons engaged in the industry.

<a name="80129w11.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Compensation for farmers disposing of cattle over thirty months old, apart from those suspected of having BSE for which separate arrangements apply, is available only through the over-30-months scheme run by the Intervention Board.

I am currently considering how the intention to prohibit fur farming can best be implemented and an announcement will be made as soon as possible. There will be public consultation on any proposals for legislation to ban fur farming.

 Member states are required to test meat for a wide range of veterinary drugs, including banned substances and are responsible for implementing and policing the relevant directives in respect of their own national production.

<a name="80129w12.html_para0">Any third country wishing to export fresh meat to the European Union must submit residue testing plans to the Commission.

<P>

<a name="80129w12.html_para1">Any third country which permits the use of growth promoting hormones, banned in the European community since 1988, is required to guarantee that no animals and no meat coming from animals to which they have been administered will be exported to the Community.

<P>
<a name="80129w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 All consignments of animal products imported directly into the United Kingdom from outside the European Union are subject to checks at designated border inspection posts, including checks on the certification requirements on specified risk materials introduced under the Specified Risk Materials Order 1997. Single market rules only permit random spot checks at destination on animal products traded within the Community. Consistent with those rules, a daily sample of randomly selected consignments fro EU member states are subject to documentary checks by Ministry officials for conformity with the new unilateral controls relating to specified risk material.

<a name="80129w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 For 1997-98 we have allocated &#163;3.1 million winter pressure moneys and an additional &#163;145,000 for breast cancer services to the Leeds Health Authority over the allocation made by the previous administration.
<P>

<a name="80129w13.html_para0">The increase in funding for 1998-99 of &#163;1 billion for the National Health Service in England more than doubles the increase planned by the previous Government. Leeds HA were allocated &#163;339.9 million. This represents an increase of &#163;15.9 million (&#163;4.90 per cent). This is above the England average increase of 4.70 per cent.

 Pharmaceutical services are provided to patients in both England and Wales and in Scotland mainly by pharmacists. However, general medical practitioners in all three countries may dispense medicines to patients who would otherwise have difficult access to them. In England and Wales patients must be resident in a designated rural area more than one mile from a community pharmacy, otherwise they must satisfy the health authority that they would have serious difficulty obtaining medicines. In Scotland, Health Boards instruct doctors to provide such services where they conclude that patients would not have access to a pharmacy. It is not clear that the Scottish system offers any major advantages over that operating in England and Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) Regulations 1992 allow dispensing doctors to dispense to patients living more than a mile from the nearest pharmacy, within a controlled locality (designated by the health authority). We have received a number of representations from pharmacists about doctors dispensing medicines to patients in outlying areas from a surgery located in a market town or adjacent to a community pharmacy.

 Officials have recently had discussions with the Commission for Racial Equality (CRE) regarding the disparity in the numbers of awards granted to consultants from ethnic minorities. A number of measures are being introduced in the 1998 awards round to secure better data, monitoring of outcomes, and representation of ethnic minority consultants on awards committees. Some changes to the criteria for awards were also suggested by the CRE, and accepted for implementation in the 1998 awards round. The revised criteria are set out in the published Guide to the NHS Consultants' Distinction Awards Scheme, copies of which are available in the Library. These measures have been welcomed by the CRE. We are considering what further action might be taken to assist in addressing this issue.

 The National Screening Committee, chaired by the Chief Medical Officer, advises the Government about implementing national population screening programmes and reviewing the effectiveness of new and existing population screening programmes in the light of emerging evidence.

This fuel is owned by utilities in the United Kingdom and in overseas countries, including Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland. Decisions relating to the timing of reprocessing of the contracted quantities of spent nuclear fuel owned by individual utilities are an operational matter for BNFL.

 <i>[holding answer 22 January 1998]:</i> Information on the occasions since 1980 when civil nuclear reactors have been shut down for safety reasons, their dates and reasons for shut down and the dates when power generation recommenced is not recorded centrally. To provide the information requested for 35 currently operating civil power reactors in England and Wales and Scotland and nine which are now under-going decommissioning over a 18 year period could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="80129w14.html_para0">In addition to outages ie. a shutdown for re-fuelling, maintenance and repair on a schedule agreed by the regulator--the Health and Safety Executive's Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII)--there are other occasions when reactors have to shut down ("trip"). The substantial in-built redundancy of safety systems at all nuclear generating sites ensure a trip if there is a fault in one of the many back-up systems on the reactor. Also, a significant proportion of the trips are not related to the safety of the reactor, but to failure in the ancillary equipment for example turbines or National Grid transmission faults.
<P>

<a name="80129w14.html_para1">However, any incidents of significance or potential significance for the health and safety of the workforce or the public at all UK civil nuclear installations, including nuclear electricity generating sites, are reported in the Health and Safety Executive's "Quarterly Statement of Incidents at Nuclear Installations" published since 1976.

 Under Sections 39 and 40 of the Electricity Act 1989 the Director General of Electricity Supply has powers to set standards of performance in connection with the provision of electricity supply services by public electricity suppliers to tariff customers in individual cases and standards of overall performance by public electricity suppliers. He has used these powers to introduce in July 1991 Guaranteed Standards of Performance which cover a wide range of services, including one on restoring electricity supplies after faults. These Standards were revised in 1993 and 1995. Currently the Guaranteed Standard of Performance for restoring electricity supplies after faults lays down that customers are entitled to claim a payment if the electricity supply is not restored within 24 hours of a fault being reported. The payment is &#163;40 for domestic customers and &#163;100 for non-domestic customers for the first 24 hours and a further &#163;20 for every additional 12 hour period during which the supply remains off. Customers are required to submit a claim in writing. The Director is currently consulting on a number of further changes which could lead to increased payments.

 The Competition Bill introduces general prohibitions against anti-competitive agreements and abuses of market dominance.

Under the Bill it is the responsibility of the Director General of Fair Trading, the Competition Commission, and ultimately the courts, to examine whether particular behaviour is caught by the prohibitions. The purpose of the Bill is to set in place a new framework of law against which the competition effects of individual cases may be assessed by these bodies.

 Under the provisions of the Access to Health Records Act 1990 individuals have the right to access personal health information in health records kept on manual files recorded after November 1991. The 1990 Act does not prevent access to records made before 1991 but it is for the relevant health professional to decide to allow access on an informal, voluntary basis. The Data Protection Act 1984 gives an individual the right of access to personal information in health records which are held on computer. With both of these Acts access can be denied or restricted only in certain specified circumstances such as where access to the information may cause serious physical or mental harm to the individual.

The European Commission's own internal project cycle management guidance stresses the importance of adequate stakeholder consultation and involvement in the project cycle, but continuing efforts are required to ensure this is always fully reflected in the design and implementation of projects and programmes. During the UK Presidency, we will continue to promote the greater use and development of adequate stakeholder participation through dialogue with Commission officials in Brussels and in delegations, and through our participation in the Commissions Management Committees. We have also seconded a Social Development adviser to work in the Commission to use his expertise to assist the Commission in this area.

 A project to provide training from UK development assistance to the Kenyan Police was approved in 1995. The project has funded the training of trainers and helped to develop the syllabus for a Senior Command Course which is being delivered by Kenyan police trainers in Kenya. The syllabus includes a section on the management of civil disturbances based on the philosophy of minimum force and the rule of law. The first course was evaluated by an independent consultant in September 1997. Course participants were invited to submit recommendations to the Commissioner of Police following the course. A key theme identified by the trainees was the need to change from a police 'force' to a police 'service'. This was reinforced by recommendations for the wider introduction of community policing and a less confrontational approach to the management of civil disturbances.

<a name="80129w16.html_para0">In 1996, as part of the International Commanders Programme, three Kenyan Police Officers attended the Hounslow training centre for half a day to observe UK training methods in public order management.

This visit was complemented by a presentation by Bramshill Police Training College on the UK's approach to conflict resolution by peaceful means.

 Under the arrangements agreed by the International Development Association (IDA) Deputies in February 1997, it was agreed that the use of uncommitted resources of SDR700 million ($1 billion) under the Interim Trust Fund would be determined following consideration of decisions by the United States authorities on the payment of the amount needed to clear the United States' arrears to the IDA tenth replenishment, and the first tranche of its pledge to the IDA eleventh replenishment.
<P>

<a name="80129w16.html_para3">The United States Foreign Appropriations Act, which became law on 26 November 1997, provides $1,034.5 million for IDA to clear IDA-10 arrears and for the first tranche of IDA-11 contributions. IDA Executive Directors therefore approved, on 23 December 1997, a recommendation from the World Bank's President to amend the Resolution establishing the Interim Trust Fund to lift the procurement restrictions against SDR700 million ($1 billion) of uncommitted ITF funds. Any credits funded from the SDR700 million will now be open to procurement from countries with the IDA contributors (including the US) and eligible borrowers.

 It is not possible to provide precise estimates of the total numbers of young people who will require help from the New Deal. We will offer help to every 18 to 24-year-old who becomes eligible for the New Deal, and sufficient places will be available to meet this commitment. In October 1997, just over 120,000 18 to 24-year-olds had been claimant unemployed for six months or more; every month about 15,000 to 20,000 young people reach six months' unemployment.

 Prior to 1974 there was no statutory obligation to uprate benefits. Increases in Retirement Pensions occurred occasionally on an ad hoc basis. From 1974 to 1979 Retirement Pension was uprated by the higher of earnings or prices. Since 1980 and every subsequent year upratings have been in line with prices.

Mr. Patel now appears to be in dispute with this representative. We have no jurisdiction to intervene in this dispute and have advised Mr. Patel to pursue his claim through the appropriate legal channels.

 Our Embassy in Beirut provides regular reporting on the Israeli and Syrian presence in Lebanon.

We are playing a full part in efforts to bring about such a settlement.

 The European Union has consistently expressed full support for the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity of Lebanon, and has consistently called for full implementation of UNSCR 425, which requires the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanese territory.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he requested legal advice on whether the massacre in Rwanda in 1994 constituted genocide under the terms of the Genocide Convention.[25477]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w21.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 Janaury 1998]:</i> Since 1 May 1997, we have not had cause to seek legal advice on whether the massacre in Rwanda in 1994 constituted genocide under the terms of the Genocide Convention.
<P>

<a name="80129w21.html_para1">The UN Security Council resolution establishing the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), makes the strong presumption that genocide, as defined in the relevant UN Convention, took place in Rwanda. The UK fully supports action through the ICTR and by the Government of Rwanda, to bring to justice those responsible for acts of genocide.

[25961]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80129w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 The UK is opposed to commercial whaling and has supported the International Whaling Commission's (IWC) resolutions on numerous occasions calling on Norway to halt all such operations. We are, therefore, disappointed that Norway has announced a further increase in its 1998 catch quota of Minke whales. The UK will continue to work with like-minded countries to try to ensure that there is no resumption of international trade in whale products.

 Our Embassy in Ankara complained to the Turkish authorities about the arrest in Istanbul on 2 September 1997 of Mr. Neil Frape, the British Vice Consul (Information). My hon.

 After I decided to replace Miss Bullen, Gaynor Regan was, for a short time, considered for the post. She was an obvious candidate, having worked as my Diary Secretary for four years in opposition.

She was a personal appointment by Douglas Hurd. She was not a career public servant, but was appointed on a fixed term contract which was subsequently extended until November 1997.

 Fees, which are set to recover the cost of processing applications world wide to minimise the burden on the taxpayer, are reviewed annually. We continually look at ways to make efficiency savings to enable us to reduce entry clearance fees. The current fee for a settlement visa is &#163;240. This was introduced on 10 June 1997.
