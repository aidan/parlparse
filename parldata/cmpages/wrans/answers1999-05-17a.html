 Monthly running costs for the DFID Tirana office are &#163;75,000 (inclusive of staffing, rent and utilities). There are currently 10 British recruited and one locally recruited members of staff: the head of office, specialists in camp planning and development, logistics, health, NGO liaison, and an administrator. The head of office holds an initial budget of &#163;1 million for projects with delegated authority of up to &#163;100,000. The Crown Agents are providing, under contract to DFID, the emergency logistics team who are managing the office. Crown Agents may also be used for procurement and other services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the pre-conflict Kosovan ethnic mix in <i>(a)</i> percentage and <i>(b)</i> numerical terms; and what measures he is planning to guarantee the security of non-Albanians in post-conflict Kosovo.

<a name="90517w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 Definitive statistics for Kosovo's pre-March 1999 ethnic make-up do not exist. On the available information, we estimate that Albanians represented between 70 per cent. and 90 per cent. of Kosovo's pre-March 1999 population (approximately 1.6 million). The remainder of the population consisted of Serbs and Montenegrins (perhaps 150,000), Muslims (up to 100,000), and Turks, Romanies and a group known as 'Egyptians' (probably less than 50,000).
<P>

<a name="90517w01.htm_para1">Our aim is a post-conflict administration of Kosovo that safeguards the security of all its people, irrespective of ethnic origin. That can be achieved only by means of a strong international military presence with a NATO core.

 Since 1995 an Ad Hoc Group of States Parties has been meeting in Geneva to consider measures to strengthen the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention. The United Kingdom is responsible for the key sessions on compliance measures and is playing a leading role in the negotiations. The Ad Hoc Group has made considerable progress and is now working on the text of a draft Protocol to the Convention. 1999 has already seen a significant intensification of this work with a total of 16 weeks available for the negotiations, the largest ever number. Much detailed work remains to be done, primarily on the technical aspects of the Protocol, but the UK, together with its EU partners, believes that an effective package of measures can be agreed during 2000. As an indication of the priority the UK attaches to its early and successful completion, we have offered to host the signing ceremony of the Protocol in London.

 My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister gave his support to the US action last August as action against international terrorists.

<P>
<a name="90517w01.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 Building on the New Deal for people aged 25 and over, which was introduced in June 1998 and gave those who had been unemployed for at least two years new subsidised employment and training opportunities, we introduced pilot schemes in 28 areas of Great Britain in November 1998. These have been designed to allow local partnerships more flexibility to try innovative ways of helping this age group back into work. One of these pilots is operating in Coventry, and is using a collaborative approach to delivering services through a range of partner organisations including the local city council. We are supporting their initiatives in helping long-term unemployed people find work, and will be evaluating this and the other pilots to see what works best and how help can be delivered most effectively in future for the benefit of unemployed adults in Coventry and elsewhere.

 Billing authorities are under a duty in relation to each financial year to take "reasonable steps" to ascertain whether any discount applies to a dwelling before calculating the bill. It is for individual authorities to decide what action to take in the light of local circumstances but it usually takes the form of a written request for information from each household. Authorities also have powers to request information from certain public bodies such as the electoral registration officer. If a person receiving a discount fails to notify the authority that he is no longer (or never was) eligible for it he may be subject to a penalty of &#163;50. It is for the local authority's auditor to satisfy itself that the local authority has the necessary procedures in place to fulfil its statutory duties.

 Although no individuals are exempt from council tax, certain types of dwelling are exempt and this includes dwellings occupied entirely by students. Where students share accommodation with non-students, the students are disregarded for the purposes of calculating the household's bill. It is our intention to amend the liability rules to exclude such students from being jointly and severally liable for the bill as soon as Parliamentary time and other priorities allow.

<P>
<a name="90517w03.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government and Civil Aviation Authority take seriously all occurrences of ice and debris falling from aircraft. The primary way to tackle the problem is to ensure that regulations on the safe manufacture and operation of aircraft are adhered to. There are many such regulations: for example, before aircraft can be entered on national registers they must meet the appropriate standards for design and construction of aircraft, including resistance to leakage of on-board water or toilet systems which is the main cause of the build up of ice on the exterior of aircraft.
<P>

<a name="90517w03.htm_para4">The CAA is responsible for the safety regulation of aircraft registered in the UK and applies airworthiness requirements rigorously. They, together with the aviation industry have taken a number of specific, practical steps to reduce the occurrence of ice and debris falling. These steps include:

In the last twelve months, 24 incidents have been recorded of icefall and 16 of other falling objects; this level of occurrence has not risen in the last five years, despite significant increases in traffic over that period.
<P>

<a name="90517w03.htm_para7">It is an offence under articles 48 and 56 of the Air Navigation (No 2) Order 1995 to drop or permit articles to be dropped from an aircraft so as to endanger persons or property. The CAA will investigate incidents reported to them and prosecute offenders if there is sufficient information to identify the aircraft involved. It is not always possible to confirm the precise origin of ice or debris, because of problems in establishing the precise timing of incidents, the trajectory of falling items and the possible number of aircraft in the area at the time.

 The distance depends on the crop.

It is not possible to guarantee that no cross-pollination will occur, even with very large separation distances although the amount of cross-pollination decreases rapidly with distance. The

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what was the outcome of the Energy Council held in Brussels on 11 May; and if he will make a statement.  [84067]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90517w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Council considered several matters of interest to the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="90517w05.htm_para0">On renewables, our strategy was singled out for praise. I called on the Commission to maintain momentum in the promotion of renewable energy by coming forward with a directive giving a framework for fair access of renewables to the internal electricity market. It should minimise distortions, ensure transparency, provide flexibility to distinguish between different kinds of renewables and promote cost-effectiveness and price competitiveness.




<P>
<P><I>17 May 1999 : Column: 254</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90517w05.htm_para1">The Commission made two presentations on the internal energy market. The first concerned progress on implementation of the gas and electricity directives and the second harmonisation measures in electricity. I welcomed the implementation report stressing the importance of developing a real single market in energy (rather than 15 national markets) to enable consumers to reap the benefits that competition can bring in terms of lower prices and better service. I pointed out that agreement on the electricity and gas directives was only the first step. This must be followed by effective and timely implementation in all member states. I expressed disappointment that implementation had been delayed in some cases, urging those member states to put the necessary legal frameworks in place as a matter of urgency, emphasising the potential benefits to consumers. I also pointed out the importance of a level playing field where everyone plays by the rules; it was not acceptable for companies to compete in the markets of others member states while being protected from competition in their own.
<P>

<a name="90517w05.htm_para2">I also welcomed the Commission's harmonisation report which highlighted the main areas where obstacles to the single market persist, such as arrangements for cross-border trading. I emphasised the need to get on with this work urgently so that we can have workable and effective arrangements by the time of the next Council.
<P>

<a name="90517w05.htm_para3">I suggested the Council should regularly review progress towards achieving a single market against specific indicators, such as the number of new market entrants or prices. This will provide a measure of how far consumers are really being offered a competitive supply and benefiting from lower prices. The Presidency's summary supported this approach including the need to take the social dimension into account in liberalising the internal market in electricity. The Commission accordingly undertook to provide regular progress reports to Council.
<P>

<a name="90517w05.htm_para4">The Energy Council held an orientation debate concerning possible elements for inclusion in a strategy on the integration of environmental aspects and sustainable development into energy policy. Ministers had a useful exchange of views which the Presidency summarised.
<P>

<a name="90517w05.htm_para5">The Council also adopted conclusions aimed at reducing standby losses from electrical appliances which encourages an integrated approach--building a consensus and partnership with business on priorities and targets--developing a combination of voluntary and regulatory measures at Community level.
<P>

<a name="90517w05.htm_para6">The Council received information from the Commission on the Energy Charter Treaty, the campaign for take-off on renewables and on progress towards minimising the impact of the millennium bug.
<P>

<a name="90517w05.htm_para7">A full press release on the outcome of the Council can be found on the Council Secretariat web site at http://ue.eu.int/newsroom.

 Figures are not readily available for sorties by the Yugoslav Air Force over Kosovo. However, it is assessed that approximately 180 sorties have been flown in Serbia and Montenegro during the first 49 days of the NATO bombing campaign, an average of four per day. The majority of these flights are believed to be communications and logistic support helicopter flights, whilst just under half comprise fighter and fighter bomber sorties.

 The information requested is not recorded centrally and could only be obtained through examination of individual case records at disproportionate cost. In any event, it would be impossible to ascertain precisely how many of those convicted were citizens of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia because the nationality of those holding falsified travel documents is essentially in doubt.

The figures requested regarding recapture and surrender are not available because prisoners may surrender to another prison.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 28 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>162</i>, on private prisons, what measures are being taken by the Prison Service to improve performance against the contract at <i>(a)</i> HMP Lowdham Grange and <i>(b)</i> HMP Parc.  [83914]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90517w06.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The performance of both prisons has steadily improved since they opened and their present performance is regarded as satisfactory. The performance of the prisons is subject to contract management by the contractor and by the Prison Service through monitoring by the appointed controller of each prison, the area manager and the contracts and competition group of Prison Service headquarters.

<P>
<a name="90517w06.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS) and Immigration Service are committed to the development and dissemination of the intelligence needed to maximise disruption of these criminal enterprises and to secure arrest in as many cases as possible. During the past 12 months, a number of successful operations have been jointly undertaken targeting the racketeers which have resulted in the arrest and conviction of those involved. In addition, profiling and increased awareness have led to the interception of several groups at ports of arrival and to tighter controls over the issue of visas at British missions abroad. Trafficking in human beings is high on the agenda of the European Union; the G8; and the United Nations. My Department is represented on all the relevant working groups.

 Complaints received by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate are not recorded centrally on the basis of subject matter. Information kept centrally is in respect of the number of compensation claims dealt with as a result of maladministration, the majority of which will have arisen as a result of lost documents. This is a lagging indicator as there is often a considerable gap between an incident and the claim for compensation arising from it. The figures for each month since November 1998 are set out:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what efforts are being made by his Department to encourage a speedy conclusion to the pay dispute between the Fire Brigades Union and the National Joint Council for Local Authority Fire Brigades; and to what extent a deal will have to take account of the Best Value regime.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90517w07.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The current dispute between the local authority employers and the Fire Brigades Union is not over pay. It is over modest proposals by the employers for changes to firefighters' conditions of service. These negotiations are not directly a matter for the Government but are for resolution between the employers and the union in the National Joint Council for Local Authorities Fire Brigades.
<P>

<a name="90517w07.htm_para1">The Audit Commission in its report in 1995, "In the Line of Fire", endorsed the need for changes in firefighters' conditions of service to remove provisions which were inflexible, outdated and unjustified. The Government fully support proposals for change which while protecting the legitimate interests of firefighters will, at the same time, deliver Best Value and lead to more modern and efficient public services.

<P>
<a name="90517w07.htm_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> By the very nature of the situation in Kosovo, accounts by refugees remain the main source of information about human rights abuses including rape in Kosovo. Certain aid agencies are able to undertake medical checks, when requested by refugees, to corroborate their claims, though many women are understandably reluctant to submit themselves to these. But the consistency of the hundreds of reports by refugees leaving Kosovo in different camps in Macedonia and Albania makes their evidence compelling and credible. We are making every effort to corroborate all reports of atrocities in Kosovo.

 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> Earlier this year, 150 Early Years Development local plans were approved to guarantee a free nursery place for all four-year-olds whose parents want one and for the first time will deliver good quality childcare places across the country. The Government have made available an additional &#163;390 million over three years to provide an additional 190,000 places for three-year-olds, almost doubling the participation rate of those taking a free place to 66 per cent. by April 2002. In addition, we intend to provide 430,000 additional childcare places in the UK by 2003, at a cost of &#163;470 million.

 EMPTA is covered by Schedule 2 to the Chemical Weapons Convention, which the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons oversees, not because it has commercial uses, but on the grounds that it belongs to a large family of chemicals that are of potential use as precursors in the production of

<P>
<a name="90517w08.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Palliative care is the active total care of patients whose disease no longer responds to curative treatment, focusing on the quality of life and integrating the physical, psychological, spiritual and social aspects of care. Terminal care is an important part of palliative care and usually refers to the care of patients during their last few days, weeks or months, from a point at which it becomes clear that the patient is in a state of progressive decline.
<P>

<a name="90517w08.htm_para8">Pain therapy in palliative/terminal care must be tailored for each patient. Most patients with advanced disease will require pharmacological therapy. Strong opioids, such as diamorphine and morphine, are prescribed for severe pain and must be administered regularly to control pain and prevent pain recurring.
<P>

<a name="90517w08.htm_para9">Medical treatment given to a patient, disabled or otherwise, with the primary purpose of inducing death is illegal. Anyone alleged to have undertaken such action would be open to a charge of murder or manslaughter.

Since then we have published five Bills in draft form for pre-legislative scrutiny by a variety of Committees. Fuller explanatory notes have been published with Government Bills. A Special Standing Committee has been used for the first time on a major bill. Experiments have been conducted with programming Bills during their passage through the House. I am firmly committed to improving the quality of legislation and am looking at further ways of doing so.

Some of the solutions proposed include the provision of more facilities for young people and involving them more in community affairs, and many areas are establishing local crime action teams to address specific issues, including youth crime.

 The consistency of ratings made under the new schemes by the AA, RAC and new English Tourism Council will be much easier to understand than the different ratings we have now and will therefore reflect better what tourists want to know. The ratings will place more emphasis on quality and so provide greater incentive for improved standards. There should be a greater incentive also on providers of accommodation to participate in the schemes, thus increasing the proportion of accommodation which is inspected and rated for use by tourists. These and other benefits should quickly begin to be found when the schemes are launched this September.

 The Government are determined that spectators of all sports should be able to enjoy the action in safety and comfort. Last month, I announced new roles for both Sport England and the Football Licensing Authority in our drive to modernise sports grounds across the country. Sport England is to fund a &#163;10 million improvement scheme over the next four years to help top rugby league and rugby union teams, and the major cricket counties to improve safety at their grounds. In addition, the Football Licensing Authority will be reconstituted as the Sports Grounds Safety Authority and will have an advisory role on safety issues associated with all sports which use outdoor sports stadia, including rugby. I am sure my hon. Friend will agree that these are welcome developments.

 In accordance with the formula for the subscription of the ECB's capital set out in Article 29 of the Statute of the ESCB (Protocol No.3 to the EC Treaty), the UK's share in the subscribed capital of the ECB is 734,055,000 euro.
<P>

<a name="90517w12.htm_para0">In accordance with Article 48 of the Statute of the ESCB, the ECB General Council decided in September 1998 that the national central banks of non-participating Member States should pay up 50 per cent. of their subscription to the ECB's capital. The Bank of England was therefore required to pay up 36,702,750 euro to cover its share in the subscribed capital of the ECB. This amount is settled by offset against the proceeds of the liquidation of the EMI.

The numbers of newly diagnosed cases of breast cancer and incidence rates per 100,000 females in England, 1990-1994 (the last five years for which data are available), are shown in the attached tables. The data for 1990-1992 were published in the ONS <i>Cancer statistics--registrations</i> series MB1 and most recently updated in the CD-ROM, <i>Cancer 1971-1997</i>. Provisional numbers and rates of new cases of breast cancer diagnosed in 1993-1994 were published in the ONS Monitor <i>Estimates of newly diagnosed cases of cancer, England and Wales, 1993-1997</i> (MB1 98/2).
