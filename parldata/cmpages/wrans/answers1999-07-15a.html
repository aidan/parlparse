<P>
<a name="90715w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 We have embarked on a fundamental review of company law, and two reviews of insolvency law are also being undertaken. However, we need to balance giving company directors maximum freedom to perform their duties with providing the public and business with protection against the activities of rogue directors. Over 2,500 unfit directors have been disqualified by the courts in the last two years.

 The Department has received one written representation on the application of additionality for the coming Objective 1 programmes; the issue has also been raised on several occasions with officials.
<P>

<a name="90715w01.htm_para0">The UK complies with the rules on additionality and will continue to do so. For Objective 1, additionality will be calculated for all Objective 1 regions taken together, as required under Article 11 of the new Structural Funds regulation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 A Regulatory Impact Assessment on the costs and benefits resulting from the implementation of the Working Time Regulations, which considers small business, was made prior to implementation.
<P>

<a name="90715w01.htm_para2">We are presently consulting on amendments which are designed to clarify the regulations and help business without removing the protection that the Directive provides to workers.

22. <a name="90715w01.htm_wqn14"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the implementation of the national minimum wage for care home employees.  [90030]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w01.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 I have made no such assessment. The Government has asked the Low Pay Commission to monitor and evaluate the introduction and impact of the national minimum wage and to report by December. The Commission's terms of reference specifically require it to consider the impact on low-paying sectors and I understand that it has recently written to interested parties, including representatives of employers and employees in the care sector, inviting them to submit written evidence.

rates and flexibility on the supply side. The Secretary of State has also announced that we will establish the Small Business Service to improve support services for small businesses. A consultation document on the Small Business Service was published on 1 July.
<P>

<a name="90715w01.htm_para4">We envisage a key element of the Small Business Service to be to offer help to a wide range of people, including those wishing to become self-employed, and to encourage enterprise in socially and economically disadvantaged communities. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has recently appointed Lord Trotman to consider, over the summer, what more the Government can do to help encourage the foundation and growth of small firms. The review will look at the measures taken so far to support small and medium-sized enterprises, covering both tax and public spending programmes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment he has made of the benefits of schemes to support wind energy.  [90032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w01.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Wind energy is one of the more promising renewable energy sources for electricity generation world-wide. The supporting analysis accompanying my renewables consultation paper includes a status report on wind energy and how the technology has been developing in the UK, highlighting the achievements of wind energy projects under the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) and the supporting Research and Development Programme.
<P>

<a name="90715w01.htm_para5">At 31 March 1999, there were 59 wind projects comprising 138 Mega Watts (Declared Net Capacity) operational in the UK. The cost of wind-generated electricity under successive NFFO orders has reduced significantly, with the average price having fallen from 7.98 p/kWh under NFFO-1 to 2.88 p/KWh under NFFO-5, substantially increasing both competitiveness and growth of renewables.

<a name="90715w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Small Business Service will have a clear task to help reduce the burden of regulation on small firms wherever possible. It will work closely with the Regulatory Impact Unit to ensure that the impact of proposed regulations on small business is properly understood and considered at all levels of Government. It will work to ensure that small businesses have access to clear and straightforward information and guidance on

 I welcome the representations from so many quarters of industry and business that something must be done to tackle climate change and to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
<P>

<a name="90715w02.htm_para1">The new climate change levy is intended to encourage energy efficiency in business and to contribute towards our commitments to reduce greenhouse emissions.
<P>

<a name="90715w02.htm_para2">Any assessment of the impact of the levy will depend on the final rates of tax which are set by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. HM Customs and Excise has previously published a consultation document on the design of the levy, which included some rates, but for illustrative purposes only.
<P>

<a name="90715w02.htm_para3">The Government has promised that there will be significantly lower rates of levy for those energy intensive sectors, covered by the EU Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control Directive, which are prepared to enter negotiated agreements with the Government to deliver energy efficiency improvements and/or emissions reduction targets. Discussions with a number of energy intensive sectors are under way to develop outline negotiated agreements for their sectors.
<P>

<a name="90715w02.htm_para4">The Government is determined to work closely with business on the detailed design and implementation of the climate change levy, and will take final decisions in the light of the responses to the Customs and Excise consultation as well as representations received from business and others.

 The Government's review of utility regulation has examined telecoms regulation and the responsibilities of Oftel.

 The sale of retail food in metric units of measurement began in 1973. About 90 per cent. of retail food is now sold in metric weights or measures.
<P>

<a name="90715w02.htm_para6">Under legislation made in 1994, foods sold loose by weight must be priced and weighed in grams and kilograms after 31 December 1999. Retailers will be able to display the weight and price in imperial units alongside their metric equivalents. Consumers will be able to describe in imperial weights the quantity they wish to buy. The retailer will simply provide the equivalent metric quantity.

 The periods allowed for delivering accounts to the Registrar of Companies will be reviewed as part of the fundamental review of company law, which the Department launched in March 1998. It is due to present its final report in the Spring of 2001. Separately, Companies House is reviewing whether the current penalty bands which apply to the late filing of accounts are having the maximum effect in encouraging compliance. The penalties apply equally to trading and non-trading companies.

<P>
<a name="90715w04.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Chris Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1999]:</i> English Heritage does not have powers to take control of an ancient monument in the sense of a compulsory acquisition. Its management of historic sites and properties arises under the direction of myself, or through acquisition or Guardianship arrangements entered into by agreement.

<P>
<a name="90715w04.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Chris Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1999]:</i> English Heritage has policy responsibility for advising Local Authorities on the adequacy of their archaeological services; more specifically it assists with the funding of archaeological posts in local authorities connected with data gathering and the maintenance of Sites and Monuments Records (a contribution of &#163;164,752 in 1999-2000). It also funds survey work, totalling &#163;387,876 in 1999/2000; provides archaeological planning advice to the Greater London Boroughs; provides eight scientific advisers to assist local authorities' archaeological curators (with a ninth post due to be filled shortly); and funds an administrative support post for the Association of Local Government Archaeological Officers.

 <i>[holding answer 2 July 1999]:</i> A 'RESCUE' (The British Archaeological Trust) survey in 1990 indicated that 1,021 people were employed in local government archaeological services in that year; I understand that a forthcoming report by the Institute of Field Archaeologists and the Council for British Archaeology will show that, at September 1998, 795 people were employed. The reduction partly reflects the increase in the provision of private sector archaeological services following the publication in 1990 of Planning Policy Guidance Note 16--Archaeology and Planning.

Sport England is to fund a &#163;10m improvement scheme over the next four years to help top rugby league and rugby union teams, and the major cricket counties to improve safety at their grounds. In addition, the Football Licensing Authority will be reconstituted as the Sports Grounds Safety Authority and will have an advisory role on safety issues associated with all sports which use outdoor sports stadia, including cricket. I am sure my hon. Friend will agree that these are welcome development.

 The Government's objectives for the proposed Millennium Round of negotiations are set out in the Minister of Trade's answer to the question put by the hon. Member for Hazel Grove (Mr. Stunell) of 21 January 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>548-49</i>. The priority for the forthcoming World Trade Organisation meeting in Seattle is to launch a comprehensive set of negotiations which will, among other things, enable developing countries to make solid and substantial gains. A key part of this is the opportunity that broad-based negotiations will offer developing countries to significantly improve their access to markets.
<P>

<a name="90715w05.htm_para0">Agriculture and textiles are particularly important areas for developing countries. The 1994 agreement on Agriculture in the WTO contains a commitment to continue the reform process started in the Uruguay round by further reducing support and promotion for trade in agriculture. The UK actively supports further progress in this area. We will also be vigilant in ensuring the EU's full implementation of the agreement to abolish quotas on textiles and clothing, and will seek an acceleration of this. In the forthcoming Millennium Round of trade negotiations, the UK and the EU are advocating a comprehensive tariff negotiation aiming at reducing tariffs, removing all tariff peaks and at harmonising the tariff structures of all WTO members across all non-agricultural products.
<P>

<a name="90715w05.htm_para1">The Government also strongly supports the EU's proposal that WTO members should agree at Seattle to provide duty free access for essentially all products from the Least Developed countries no later than the end of the round.

 The debt relief measures agreed at Cologne were based on aggregate figures. It is too early to assess with precision the impact of the Cologne proposals for each of the HIPC countries. The impact in each case will depend on the economic circumstance of the country at the time, the precise manner in which the debt relief is delivered and, for some countries, up-to-date information on their total indebtedness. For the many countries still to be assessed for HIPC relief, the estimate of their total indebtedness is uncertain, and the nature of their debt is not fully known. We are pressing the World Bank and IMF to provide information, including on various options for delivering debt relief, and the timeframe over which the costs of these would fall. We

<a name="90715w06.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 On 1 April 1999 the Chief of Defence Logistics (CDL) assumed overall responsibility for the movement of nuclear weapons in the United Kingdom. The responsibility for the day-to-day movement of nuclear weapons is being moved, in phases, from RAF personnel to the Ministry of Defence Police with support from AWE civilians and the Royal Marines. An Implementation Team has been established to manage the transfer, which will be completed by 31 March 2002. The process will occur gradually in recognition of the importance and complexity of the task and the MOD will continue to maintain the highest levels of safety and security during convoy operations.

<a name="90715w08.htm_para0">We are also awaiting the opportunity to examine the detail of a European Commission proposal for a pedestrian protection Directive, which we understand will be put forward later this year. As well as making car fronts safer, such a Directive could provide a Europe-wide mechanism for preventing aggressive bull bars being fitted to vehicles to make them more pedestrian friendly. Increasing the pedestrian friendliness of cars has the potential to reduce significantly the numbers of vulnerable road users who are killed and injured each year.

 <i>[holding answer 13 July 1999]:</i> The main responsibility for enforcement action against unlicensed vehicles rests with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency. The police and traffic wardens in the Merseyside area provide the Agency with reports on unlicensed vehicles seen on the public road. Last year, the Agency took successful enforcement action against some 25,000 evaders in the Merseyside area, bringing in over &#163;2.9 million in fines and penalties. In addition, the Agency and the police conduct campaigns periodically against road tax evaders. These take the form of extensive localised publicity to encourage motorists to relicense their vehicles, or risk being caught in subsequent police checks. The last such campaign in Merseyside was run in March of this year, and resulted in around &#163;0.3 million recovered in additional revenue.
<P>

<a name="90715w08.htm_para1">The Agency also operates a permanent wheelclamping operation in Merseyside as part of a national scheme. The scheme has proved to be very successful in encouraging 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 1999 : Column: 296</I><P>
motorists to relicense their vehicles. Since its introduction in Merseyside in November 1997, almost 2,000 vehicles have been clamped. Some 50 per cent. of these have been left unclaimed and disposed of. The initial publicity of the scheme led to the recover of &#163;0.5 million in additional revenue.
<P>

<a name="90715w08.htm_para2">Further initiatives aimed at reducing the level of vehicle excise duty evasion include measures to improve the quality of the vehicle register and to make it more difficult for motorists to drop out of the licensing system. Planning is being done for the introduction of camera systems in Merseyside and the rest of the country to detect and deter evasion.

<P>

<a name="90715w08.htm_para3">The refund was then issued on 29 June 1999 and cashed on 7 July.

<P>

<a name="90715w09.htm_para7">We are today allocating &#163;517 million of additional resources for investment in London Transport over two years. With the grant already allocated, and with LT's own revenues and investment through PFI deals, this means that we are investing over &#163;1.6 billion on the Underground this year and next. More than &#163;500 million a year will be spent on the core Underground system.

<a name="90715w09.htm_para8">This core investment programme cannot deliver a transformation overnight--years of neglect cannot be quickly overturned.

I shall be monitoring London Transport's performance closely to ensure that they deliver.

 Since existing Incapacity Benefit recipients will not be affected by the proposed new contribution conditions, no estimate has been made of the proportion of all current recipients who would have failed to meet those conditions. However, available data suggest that around 10 per cent. of recent awards of Incapacity Benefit would not have been made under the proposed contribution conditions.

<P>
<a name="90715w12.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how long an employee made redundant has to wait before becoming entitled to claim Jobseeker's Allowance; what other benefits are available during this period; if the same time limit applies if the employee has to make a claim to the Redundancy Board; what plans he has to review this system; and if he will make a statement.  [91427]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w12.htm_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The length of time a redundant employee has to wait before he becomes entitled to Jobseeker's Allowance depends on what payments he is due from his ex-employer. Any holiday pay payable within four weeks of the termination of employment or pay-in-lieu of notice will remove entitlement for an equivalent period to that in respect of which the payment was made. Lump sum statutory redundancy payments do not affect contribution-based JSA but may affect income-based JSA. The rules which apply if the redundant employee is due, but does not receive, these payments from his ex-employer and has to claim compensation from the Redundancy Payments Service have the same effect.
<P>

<a name="90715w12.htm_para2">The availability of other benefits during this period will depend on the individual's circumstances. For those who have not received the monies due from their ex-employer, there are safeguards to protect those most in need: payments of JSA can be made if hardship would otherwise result.
<P>

<a name="90715w12.htm_para3">We have no immediate plans to review the rules for those who receive payments from their ex-employers. We are, however, aware of the effect of the JSA rules 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 1999 : Column: 312</I><P>
on those who do not receive the monies due from their ex-employers and are considering the matter in conjunction with the Department of Trade and Industry to see whether any changes can be made. There are, however, complex issues to be resolved.

The options that have been implemented are the prioritisation of applications based on travel dates; 400 additional staff have been recruited; the Agency is working extended hours; examination processes have been streamlined and straightforward renewal applications are being exceptionally extended by passport offices and main post offices; adverts have been placed in the national and regional media advising the general public awaiting or applying for a passport what to do; and a special telephone helpline for inquiries has been set up.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will publish the results obtained from the pilot tests on the new information technology systems introduced by the Passport Agency at the Liverpool and Newport offices; and if he will make a statement.  [90685]<P>

<a name="90715w12.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The new Passport Application Support System (PASS) is owned, managed and controlled by Siemens Business Services (SBS) under a public-private partnership agreement. The tests carried out at the time of the pilot implementations in Liverpool and Newport were designed and documented by SBS. Agency staff reviewed, agreed and took part in test programmes, but ownership of test documentation rests 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 1999 : Column: 313</I><P>
with SBS, who are free to publish the documentation at their own commercial discretion. The Passport Agency is satisfied with the design and resilience of the PASS Information Technology system, although it will continue with SBS to seek improvement. The Agency will also seek to develop better working arrangements with SBS in passport offices to ensure SBS can deliver an effective operational service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on what date his Department made the decision to permit the recruitment of 300 extra staff for the Passport Agency; on what date recruitment of new staff began; and how many of those staff have been fully trained; how many of the additional 100 new staff have been recruited and trained; and if he will make a statement.  [90589]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w12.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The decision to recruit 300 more staff was taken in late March<i>.</i> Waiting lists from previous campaigns were used to appoint new staff quickly and further recruitment began on 12 April. The 300 staff have been trained to undertake the required duties. Of the further 100 staff, 90 are now in place and have received full training in the required duties. The remainder are due to start by 12 July.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w12.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Yes. I have placed copies of the individual responses to the Passport Agency's consultation exercise on separate passports for children in the Library. Members of the Consultative Panel of Passport Users, who comprise of national representatives of the travel trade, consumer groups and other relevant organisations including Re-unite--the National Council for Abducted Children--were consulted on the question of separate passports for children. The broad conclusion of the Panel was that overall security would be improved by the introduction of the requirement for separate passports, and the change would be a positive one.

 Under the Passport Agency's contracts with Siemens Business Services (SBS) and Security Printing and Systems (SP&S) formerly The Stationery Office Ltd., service credits are available in relation to timeliness of delivery of data to the United Kingdom Passport Agency (UKPA); accuracy of data when delivered to the UKPA; transmission of data to printers; timeliness in printing the passport; system availability; and accuracy of the manufactured product.
<P>

<a name="90715w12.htm_para4">Service Credits of &#163;66,951 have so far been levied on SBS for system availability (&#163;47,232) and accuracy of data passed to the Agency (&#163;19,696). Service credits of &#163;4,489 have been levied on SP&S for accuracy of the manufactured product.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will publish his Department's papers relating to the decision to require a separate children's passport from October 1998; and if he will make a statement.  [90684]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w12.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It would not be appropriate to publish the policy advice that officials have provided to Ministers. The reasons for introducing the requirement for separate passports for children were announced to the House in my reply to my hon. Friend, the Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner), 7 April 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>173</i>, and there has also been widespread publicity including press releases, information to travel agents, libraries and Citizen Advice Bureaus, and via electronic media, to provide the public with the background to the change. Copies of the individual responses to the Passport Agency's consultation exercise on separate passports for children have been placed in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate the Passport Agency and the Home Office have made of the cost of meeting compensation claims resulting from the problems at the Passport Agency; what assessment they have made of the amount which will have to be found from increases in charges made by the Passport Agency; and if he will make a statement.  [90688]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w12.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is not possible at this stage in the year for the Agency to make a reliable estimate of the complete cost of compensation payments. In the 1998-99 financial year the Agency paid around &#163;80,000 in compensation. In the first four months of this financial year the Agency has paid around &#163;37,000. In terms of the impact on the passport fee, if the Agency's total compensation bill in 1999-2000 is &#163;100,000, this would represent 2p of the &#163;21 passport fee. There is, therefore, no reason why any increase in passport fee should result from the level of compensation.

 Section 39 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 required local authorities with social services and education responsibilities to establish youth offending teams in partnership with the police, probation service and health authorities. They will replace existing youth justice teams. The Government expect to implement the provisions nationwide in April 2000.

<a name="90715w14.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Information is not available in precisely the form requested. Data are collected centrally on a financial year basis for racial discrimination. In the 12 months from April 1997 to March 1998, 23 complaints of racial discrimination against Merseyside Police were completed. Seven complaints required formal investigation, but none were upheld. Of the remaining 16 completed complaints, three were withdrawn, five informally resolved and eight granted dispensations by the Police Complaints Authority.

 The Commission is responsible for making efficient use of the financial provision my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary makes for it, and for performing its functions effectively. In the Business Plan for 1999-2000 that it has submitted to him for agreement, the Commission sets out its plans to meet two key challenges: to minimise the delay in reviewing applications from persons in custody, and to increase the number of cases completed per year. Earlier this year, we allocated substantial additional funding to the Commission to enable it to increase its output, and have agreed to a further review of the Commission's resource requirements at the end of this year.

 In the Business Plan for 1999-2000 that it has submitted to my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary for agreement, the Commission has proposed the goals of completing 1,000 cases this year, having 500 under detailed review, and ensuring that the average time an applicant in custody waits for detailed review of their case to begin is not more than 12 months. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary is currently considering the Business Plan.

 The investigation of crime within the Metropolitan Police District is an operational matter for the Commissioner. He tells me that as at 13 July, there were 46 police officers and seven civilian support staff employed full-time on the investigation, with none part-time. These figures exclude work by scientific, investigative and logistical support staff on the investigation of the murder.

<P>
<a name="90715w15.htm_wqn4"><B> Lorna Fitzsimons: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the differences in the level of provision in each United Kingdom region from the not-for-profit sector contractors in community legal services; and what account has taken of this in the allocation of moneys to each region from the Legal Aid Board for provision of not-for-profit contracts.  [90979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w15.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor has agreed that &#163;20 million should be set aside for contracts to support the development of the not-for-profit sector as providers within the Community Legal Service, and that this sum should be viewed as a floor and not a ceiling. As an initial guide, the Legal Aid Board divided the &#163;20 million between its 13 administrative areas on the basis of the number of income support claimants in each area. However, legal aid areas are not constrained by their initial allocations, and the total amount allocated to not-for-profit organisations nationally may exceed the &#163;20 million set aside for contracts with the not-for-profit sector.
<P>

<a name="90715w15.htm_para0">It was the responsibility of each Regional Legal Services Committee (RLSC) to assess the need for legal services in its own region. To determine the need for contracts, each RLSC then considered what services were already being supplied by the not-for-profit sector as a whole within its region, other than work being undertaken under the legal aid scheme, including under pilot contracts with the Legal Aid Board. Some RLSCs decided that, because insufficient information was available on the quality and amount of work done by non-contracted not-for-profit organisations in their region, some of these services should not be taken into account when determining the need for contracts.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w15.htm_wqn5"><B> Lorna Fitzsimons: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what criteria the Regional Legal Services Committee uses to identify the level of need for legal services in respect of housing, immigration and employment matters in Rochdale; what formula they used to assess the level of resources to meet this need in per capita terms; and what steps his Department has taken to monitor the application of <i>(a)</i> those criteria and <i>(b)</i> that formula.  [90978]

<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w15.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The criteria used by the Legal Aid Board's Regional Legal Services Committees (RLSCs) to assess need for legal services in all categories of law are set out in their Strategic Plans, which were published in April 1999.
<P>

<a name="90715w15.htm_para1">As a starting point for more detailed discussion, the North Western Legal Services Committee (NWLSC) carried out a preliminary assessment of need before taking into account local information. The following national data sets were used:
<P>

<a name="90715w15.htm_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Census 1991 information on housing tenure and breakdown of ethnic minority populations;
<P>

<a name="90715w15.htm_para4"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Department of Environment 1996 English House Condition Survey.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90715w15.htm_para5">Although this information was used directly for the three categories, other information on unemployed claimants (NOMIS 1997) and County Court Debt Judgements (Equifax 1996) were also available to the Committee. In addition, indicators of general deprivation, the Index of Local Conditions (Robson Index) and the Underprivileged Areas Score (Jarman Index), were taken into account.
<P>

<a name="90715w15.htm_para6">The draft strategy was widely consulted on through a series of focused meetings on specific subject areas, and conferences organised on a county basis. Written responses, which were also considered in finalising the strategies, were received from other organisations and agencies on the NWLSC network database, including Rochdale CAB, Rochdale Law Centre and Rochdale MBC Advice Services. Rochdale has been assessed as a high priority area for legal services in housing, immigration and employment matters, and subject- specific contracts will definitely be issued in these high priority areas.
<P>

<a name="90715w15.htm_para7">The Legal Aid Board reported to the Lord Chancellor on all the RLSC strategic plans, which included an explanation of the criteria used to assess need. The Lord Chancellor considered the plans and approved them in April 1999. The Legal Services Commission will prepare an Annual Plan setting out how it intends to fund services to meet the needs identified by the RLSCs, and its Annual Report to the Lord Chancellor will report on how it has performed against its Plan. There is no formula used to assess the level of resources to meet identified need on a per capita basis, so there is nothing to monitor in that respect. However, officials are considering how best to monitor the performance of the Board and its successor, the Legal Services Commission, in identifying levels of need and addressing them through the granting of contracts.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w15.htm_wqn6"><B> Lorna Fitzsimons: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how much money has been allocated to the not-for-profit agencies in <i>(a)</i> the North West Area and <i>(b)</i> the bidding area which includes Rochdale from the Legal Aid Board; what percentage has been allocated to date; and by what means additional moneys may be allocated during the financial year.  [90977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w15.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The initial guide allocation of funds for contracts with not-for-profit organisations in the Legal Aid Board's North Western administrative area for 2000-01 is &#163;1,508,000. However, legal aid areas are not constrained by their initial allocations, and the total amount allocated to 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 1999 : Column: 327</I><P>
not-for-profit organisations nationally may exceed the &#163;20 million set aside for contracts with the not-for-profit sector. Funds for contracts with the not-for-profit sector are held at Legal Air Board area level and are not allocated to specific bid zones.
<P>

<a name="90715w15.htm_para8">The deadline for applications for not-for-profit contracts was 1 June 1999. However, the Legal Aid Board will be unable to determine how much money will be allocated to not-for-profit contracts until applications have been received from solicitors in August 1999 and there has been the opportunity to consider the contracted provision across the whole region. Final contract decisions (and therefore the division of the overall controlled budget for civil advice and assistance between solicitors and the not-for-profit sector) will be made by October 1999, and will be subject to organisations meeting the relevant franchise and contract requirements. The Board is currently considering the development of a mechanism for allocating additional moneys, within the overall controlled budget, to not-for-profit organisations during the financial year.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w15.htm_wqn7"><B> Lorna Fitzsimons: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department under what circumstances sums additional to the &#163;20 million which the Chair of the Legal Aid Board has allocated to the not-for-profit sector may be provided to the sector.  [90976]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w15.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 Provided it remains within the overall allocation for civil advice and assistance, the Legal Aid Board may award contracts to those firms and organisations which are best able to deliver services to meet the priorities outlined in each area's Regional Legal Services Committee strategy. This includes not-for-profit sector organisations. A minimum of &#163;20 million has been allocated for use in contracting with the not-for-profit sector. However, this sum could be exceeded if not-for- profit sector. However, this sum could be exceeded if not-for-profit organisations prove best able to meet identified priority needs, provided total expenditure remains within the total controlled budget for civil advice and assistance.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what current length of time is taken to process and issue juvenile national insurance numbers.  [89875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w16.htm_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 July 1999]:</i> Juveniles are registered for national insurance numbers by an automated process involving transfer of information from the Child Benefit computer to the National Insurance Recording System computer on magnetic tape. This is normally done at about the time a juvenile reaches the age of 15 years and 9 months and results in the automatic issue of a plastic national insurance number card.
<P>

<a name="90715w16.htm_para1">The process to register juveniles for national insurance numbers is operating normally and there is no delay to customers. The process takes place over several days for each individual.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w16.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Rendel: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what guidance he has issued to <i>(a)</i> Benefits Agency staff handling juvenile Jobseeker's Allowance claims and <i>(b)</i> employers concerning the issuing of juvenile NI numbers.  [89877]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w16.htm_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 5 July 1999]:</i> Information has been sent to Benefits Agency staff to make them aware that some school leavers will not have details of their national insurance numbers. Benefits Agency staff will have taken action to obtain the national insurance number for the young person. As a consequence, it has been possible for the Benefits Agency to process claims to Jobseeker's Allowance received from juveniles.
<P>

<a name="90715w16.htm_para2">A national insurance number allows employers, who have young persons starting work, to send contribution information to the National Insurance Contributions Office for the correct record. A letter explaining the delay in issuing national insurance number plastic cards was sent to some employers in the week commencing 10 May 1999.
<P>

<a name="90715w16.htm_para3">Employers requiring advice on how to obtain a national insurance number for an employee were asked in the letter to contact the existing employers Helpline. The Helpline provided details of how a written notification of the national insurance number could be obtained.

 <i>[holding answers 5 and 13 July 1999]:</i> There is no delay in the processing of applications for adult registrations for national insurance numbers and there is no outstanding backlog.
<P>

<a name="90715w16.htm_para4">The process to register and issue national insurance number cards for juveniles is now operating normally. However, a backlog of 300,000 juvenile registrations did accumulate in the period June 1998 to January 1999, when problems were experienced in implementing the appropriate NIRS2 software. This backlog was cleared by 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 1999 : Column: 329</I><P>
30 June 1999, with the exception of 17,000 cases where further essential identity inquiries are being made. It is expected that this backlog will be cleared by 30 August 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w16.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Nicholls: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many small self-administered pension schemes there are in existence; how many such schemes have ceased to be approved within the last five years; what he estimates to be the loss to the Revenue when the scheme assets of schemes which have ceased to be approved are transferred offshore; what he estimates the gain to the Revenue will be from his proposals in the Budget to address that abuse; if he will list all the consultees to his proposals to address this abuse; and if he will make a statement.  [90731]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90715w16.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Tax-approved pension schemes enjoy very generous tax treatment to encourage the provision of pensions throughout retirement. Arrangements which abuse these tax reliefs are wholly unacceptable and we will take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that approved schemes are used only for a genuine pensions purpose.
<P>

<a name="90715w16.htm_para5">There are 46,400 tax-approved small self-administered pension schemes (SSAPS) in existence and 447 have ceased to be tax approved within the last five years. SSAPS can lose approval for a wide variety of reasons not necessarily connected to tax avoidance.
<P>

<a name="90715w16.htm_para6">Measures to clamp down on abuses of the pensions tax reliefs through arrangements involving the transfer of scheme assets offshore have been in place since 1994 and were further strengthened in the 1998 Budget. The measures are intended to deter this activity rather than to raise tax.
<P>

<a name="90715w16.htm_para7">As the 1998 changes were to counter emerging tax avoidance schemes there was no advance consultation. The Inland Revenue are currently discussing with the Association of Pensioner Trustees arrangements for enhancing the role of independent trustees of SSAPS as part of the 1998 package of measures.

 Women make up a disproportionate number of the poorest groups in society. They are also more likely to be the primary care-giver to young children in families across the UK. The Government is committed to ensuring that women get a fair deal out of the tax and benefits system. To this end, the measures announced in the latest and previous Budgets boost the incomes of low-paid women and women who work part-time, as well as giving increased financial support to people caring for children.

While the UK's shares of the spurdog and Northern prawn TACs were acceptable, one final share of the Western blue whiting TAC, although a significant improvement on the Commission's proposal, did not adequately reflect the substantial UK interest in this fishery.
