 Part 9 of the draft Marine Bill which we published on 3 April 2008 contains provisions for improving access to the English coast. The draft Bill includes provisions to provide a coastal margin, within which people will be able to walk along a long-distance route for the length of the English coast (with certain exceptions, including, for example, developed land). In addition people will have access to coastal land including the foreshore, beaches, cliffs, rocks and dunes, for the purposes of open-air recreation on foot. It is unlikely that the route itself will be established over the foreshore, but the coastal margin (to which the public will have access for open-air recreation) will be.</p>

 The violence which took place in the Bas Congo province in early 2008 is under investigation by the UN. A report is expected in due course. It has not yet been possible to determine reliably the number of casualties either of the violence on 19 March or of the clashes in Bas Congo in 2008 overall.</p>

The development of democratic governance in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) depends on representation of diverse political views, tolerance of opposition, respect for human rights and effective and accountable state institutions. I support the recent EU statement on events in the province, which called for the authority of the state to be upheld and for talks between the DRC Government and the political leaders of the Bundu dia Kongo, whose members have clashed with the Congolese security forces.</p>

The guidance is clear that any allegations that fell within this definition must be taken seriously and should be examined objectively by someone independent of the school concerned: in the first instance this is typically the local authority designated officer who leads on dealing with allegations in that area. The guidance explains that the police must be consulted about any case in which a criminal offence may have been committed, and that a strategy discussion (which will involve children's social care) should take place when there is cause to suspect a child is suffering or is likely to suffer significant harm. Sometimes allegations will be so serious as to require immediate intervention by children's social care or the police, prior to notifying the local authority designated officer.</p>

 All local authorities and schools must have regard to the special educational needs code of practice which provides advice on their statutory duties to identify, assess and make provision for pupils' special educational needs.

 The impact on businesses was considered in the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006 which was updated June 2006, It found that costs for employers, some of whom already vet staff caring for children, will be offset by savings&#151;for example on repeat work, since the new Independent Safeguarding Authority (ISA) registration will be portable from job to job&#151;as well as by reduced risk of unsuitable employees. This should encourage employers to continue part-time opportunities for under-16s, including work experience. In addition, most employees that young people come into contact with during their employment will not be required to register with the ISA. This is because looking after, training, supervising etc. the young person during the course of their employment is not a part of those employees&#146; jobs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="80424w0013.htm_para2"><a name="08042482000909">It is envisaged that some 11,3 million people will be required to register with the ISA, mostly due to work which under the Act will be &#147;Regulated Activity&#148; with children or vulnerable adults; 525.6 thousand of these are teachers including occasional and supply teachers in England and Wales (January 2007 statistics).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="80424w0013.htm_para3"><a name="08042482000910">Earlier this year the Department concluded a consultation on many aspects of the scheme including issues for business and work experience; We have received useful feedback from stakeholders including the British Retail Consortium and work experience providers on how far regulated activity should cover contact with under 16-year-olds in employment and on work experience. Risk can never be eliminated from our lives, but young people must be introduced to it in a measured way. We remain of the view that part-time work is potentially beneficial for under 16s. It introduces them to the world of work and can develop self-confidence, communication and organisational skills, familiarity with money and dealing with other people. We shall publish the outcome of the consultation in due course.</p>

When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences the principal offence is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.<br>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
1. A person appearing in court can be dealt with for more than one offence at that appearance. The table shows the number of offences dealt with and not the number of persons appearing in court.<br>
2. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

1. A person appearing in court can be dealt with for more than one offence at that appearance. The table shows the number of offences dealt with and not the number of persons appearing in court.<br>
2. It is known that for some police force areas, the reporting of court proceedings in particular those relating to summary motoring offences are less than complete.<br>
3. Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.<br>

 The East of England Development Agency (BEDA) provided initial funding in June 2007 to Disability Essex to enable them to prepare a business case for their new headquarters and training centre which must go through a transparent process in order to secure public money for their projects. A completed capital grant fund application form must be submitted before it can be considered by an independent appraisal panel.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_446"><a name="80424w0020.htm_para4"><a name="08042482002562">I understand that EEDA have not received the necessary capital grant application form from Disability Essex, and unfortunately the cut-off date has now passed.</p>
