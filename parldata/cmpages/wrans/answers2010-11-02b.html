 I have had many discussions with ministerial colleagues on a range of issues, including the effects of the spending review in Scotland. The spending review sets out how the Government will carry out Britain's unavoidable deficit reduction plan, and builds on the foundations for sustainable, balanced, private sector-led recovery set out in the Chancellor's June Budget. Alongside growth, the Government have prioritised fairness, including reforming the welfare system to put it on a sustainable long-term footing, while providing sustained routes out of poverty for the poorest. Scotland and its regions will stand to benefit from these priorities.</p>

 Local authorities that are already publishing items of expenditure of £500 and above suggest there is no additional cost. Rather than creating a new financial burden additional transparency should help reduce wasteful expenditure, which is why local authorities have been asked to publish such information, for example, research by Experian has highlighted that local authorities spend £150 million a year on duplicate payments, which the process of transparency will help avoid.

 The UK pesticides regulatory body-the Health and Safety Executive's Chemicals Regulation Directorate (CRD)-has liaised with other EU regulatory authorities that have imposed restrictions on the use of these pesticides. It also reviews developments on how risks to bee health from the use of pesticides are assessed and monitored. CRD scientists attended the 10th International Symposium of the International Commission for Plant-Bee Relationships (ICPBR) on Hazards of Pesticides to Bees, in October 2008; no new scientific evidence was presented at this meeting, or more recently, to suggest a need for changes to current UK pesticide authorisations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_321"><a name="101102w0001.htm_para21"><a name="10110281000050">Ministers have also considered scientific advice, including views of the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides, on a report issued last year by a number of environmental organisations-the Buglife report 'The impact of neonicotinoid insecticides on bumblebees, honeybees and other non-target invertebrates (2009)'. The conclusion was that this report highlighted a need for data on the impacts of pesticides on overwintering of bees in the pesticides risk assessment process. This is an area where regulatory science has developed recently and which is being addressed by changes to the EU regulatory system. On the basis of current evidence there is no justification for making changes to data requirements in advance of these changes.</p>

 The International Year of Forests (IYF) provides an opportunity to raise awareness of the importance of the world's forests. The Government are committed to tackling deforestation, which contributes to climate change, biodiversity loss and poverty. Internationally, the IYF will provide an opportunity to highlight our achievements in this area, including action to ban the placing of illegally harvested timber on the UK market, and to raise the profile of forest issues worldwide. Here in the UK, the Forestry Commission is planning various initiatives and events to mark the IYF.</p>

 In my letter to all Members of Parliament on 29 October I outlined the Government's plans for the Public Forest Estate in England. The Forestry Commission continues to play an important role in protecting and expanding the trees, woods and forests in England. There will be a new approach to ownership and management of woodlands and forests, with a reducing role for the state and a bigger role for individuals, businesses, civil society organisations and local authorities in a managed programme of reform in which the Forestry Commission will play a crucial role.</p>

 I recently wrote to the Commission about my concerns about possible non-compliance with the EU-wide ban on eggs and egg products produced from hens housed in conventional cages after 1 January 2012 and requested it begins work on a practical enforcement solution to help manage the transition across Europe. This might be through the introduction of an intra-community ban on the trade in eggs produced by hens still housed in conventional cages after 1 January 2012. In practice this would mean that such eggs may only be sold in the member state of production for a limited period only. This will help protect compliant producers and ensure that they are not disadvantaged if there is any delay to the ban, or other member states do not meet the 2012 deadline.</p>

 Following a detailed review of all aspects of visitor management at Parliament, an enhanced training and accreditation programme has been introduced as part of a package of measures designed to regularise and professionalise all aspects of guiding at Parliament. The programme provides refresher training for Parliament's pool of in-house guides, including updates on developments in both Houses, and training in the mechanics of guiding and managing groups. In order to recognise the expertise of the guides, on successful completion of the course guides will receive an accreditation from the Institute of Tourist Guiding.</p>

These are gross costs. The costs are shared between the Commons and the Lords on a 70:30 basis, so the cost to the House of Commons would be £23,930. The costs will be met from within the existing departmental budget. Once the initial round of training is complete, future annual costs are estimated to be £4,710.</p>

 The European Commission wrote to the UK on 17 December 2009 giving its opinion on the complaint raised by the British Chamber of Shipping and their French counterparts regarding e-Borders compatibility with EU law on free movement and data protection. In respect of data protection, the European Commission agreed that it is legal for carriers to collect Advance Passenger Information on EU routes and for this to be transmitted to the UK, subject to the approval of each member state's data protection authority.</p>

Discussions with the Commission on this issue are close to being concluded but we await final written confirmation of the Commission's position, which we expect to have before the end of the year.</p>

 An update of the 1998 TRL research, published 21 April 2009, suggests that an estimated net 80 deaths and 200 serious casualties per year would be avoided if single/double summer time was adopted (based on 2003-07 casualty levels). This takes into account the possible increase in casualties in darker winter mornings as well as the greater reductions expected in the lighter evenings, when more casualties occur. More recent estimates suggest the savings may currently be slightly lower-around 70 deaths and 190 serious casualties. This is due to the recent reductions in overall casualties.</p>

Burma must act in accordance with its obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and all relevant UN Security Council resolutions and we urge Burma to amend its small quantities protocol as soon as possible. We will continue to monitor developments.</p>

 The 2050 pathways calculator presents a high-level framework through which to consider some of the choices and trade-offs which the UK will have to make in the over the next forty years. It shows that it is possible for us to meet the 80% greenhouse gas emissions reduction target in the UK in a range of ways.</p>

Emissions originating from the overseas manufacture of products which the UK imports, such as uranium, are not included in the UK's 80% emissions reduction target for 2050 as defined in the Climate Change Act and consistent with international carbon reporting practice. These 'embedded emissions' are therefore also not included within the 2050 pathways analysis.</p>

Given the need to ensure that the functioning and content of the model is manageable, it has been necessary to keep it as simple as possible. The UK-based emissions from energy infrastructure, materials and processes (such as enrichment and fuel fabrication) are intended to be captured within the 'Industry' sector of the 2050 pathways calculator, and no explicit assumptions were made about emissions from the specific processes mentioned in the question.</p>

 The Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS) White Paper set out that once a community had expressed an interest in the geological disposal facility siting process, local Government should take the lead role in initiating further discussions with local partners and organising community engagement.

 There is no legislation that deals specifically with school uniform. Although governing bodies are responsible for deciding whether there should be a school uniform and how it should be sourced, guidance by the Department for Education makes clear that governing bodies should keep the cost of uniform under review, and be able to demonstrate that best value has been achieved. Governing bodies are also asked to ensure that the uniform chosen is widely available in high street shops, other retail outlets and internet suppliers, rather than from an expensive sole supplier. This guidance is reinforced in the School Admissions Code, that schools should not seek to operate as sole suppliers in order to raise funds through the sale of school uniforms, and to ensure that their policies and practices do not disadvantage any children.</p>

In addition to providing information to the bereaved family concerned, and to enable a death to be formally registered, these verdicts are used by statisticians so that trends in causes of deaths can be recorded and reported, and any trends in public mortality identified and action taken where appropriate.

 Data held centrally by the Ministry of Justice on the Court Proceedings Database do not contain information about the circumstances behind each case, beyond the description provided in the statute under which proceedings are brought. It is therefore not possible to separately identify whether offences were committed by squatters for: non-payment of council tax; robbery; carrying out unauthorised works to a listed building; television licence evasion; criminal damage; arson; trespass; or using utilities without contacting the suppliers. Similarly it is not possible to separately identify those persons prosecuted for burglary whose apparent purpose was to squat.</p>

 Currently, only funding worth £237 million is ring-fenced for social care. This is a very small proportion of total social care expenditure. We therefore do not anticipate that removing the ring-fence will have a significant effect on overall social care funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_544"><a name="101102w0004.htm_para86"><a name="1011035000556">However, the Government have taken the decision to simplify and streamline grant funding to local government, by rolling around £4 billion of specific grants in 2010-11 into the unhypothecated formula grant and reducing grants for local government from over 90 to fewer than 10. This includes £2.4 billion of social care grants.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_545"><a name="101102w0004.htm_para87"><a name="1011035000557">Streamlining local government funding will enable local authorities to redirect funds to protect the delivery of the essential frontline services that matter most to their local communities. Local authorities must be accountable primarily to their communities for how they prioritise resources. It will also allow councils to pool and align budgets with partners, reducing duplication and enabling resources to be targeted at the most effective solutions.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_546"><a name="101102w0004.htm_para88"><a name="1011035000558">The national health service will also make funding available to be spent on measures that support social care, which also benefits health. This funding will be up to £1 billion in 2014-15. We will set out more detail on how the NHS should use this funding to support social care in the '2011-12 Operating Framework'. There will, therefore, be more funding hypothecated specifically for social care in the upcoming spending review period than this year.</p>

 Voluntary sector organisations play vital roles in health and social care, delivering innovative, high quality, user-focused services, and achieving outcomes that can provide real social value. They have a strong track record of designing services based on insight into clients' needs, to which they are often well placed to respond flexibly to those needs.</p>

As set out in the "Operating Framework for the NHS in England 2010-11", the Department plans to make a phased move towards an 'Any Willing Provider' model for community services, which will address barriers and open up opportunities for future statutory provision by independent and voluntary sector providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_550"><a name="101102w0004.htm_para92"><a name="1011035000750">The spending review also recognises the importance of social care in protecting the most vulnerable in society. In recognition of the pressures on the social care system in a challenging local government settlement, the coalition Government have allocated an additional £2 billion by 2014-15 to support the delivery of social care. This means, with an ambitious programme of efficiency, that there is enough funding available both to protect people's access to services and deliver new approaches to improve quality and outcomes.</p>

<i> [holding answer 28 October 2010]:</i> Students are not normally eligible for social security benefits as they should be supported by the higher education system. However, there are exceptions which enable disabled students receiving disability living allowance to receive employment and support allowance. Disability living allowance is not normally payable before a three month qualifying period. The Government have no plans for allowing exceptions to these rules in respect of students.</p>

From November 2010, students who become too ill to continue with their studies and, with the agreement of the university or college authorities, suspend (rather than abandon) their participation on the course will no longer be treated as having a student loan available to them when working out how much they may be entitled to. If a student suspends a course in those circumstances and has drawn-down their loan, we will only take it into account for the period the loan is intended to cover.</p>

 Firstly, it is important to note that the work capability assessment (WCA) is not condition-based.  <br>


<meta name="Date" content="2 Nov 2010">

<notus-date day="2" month="11" year="2010" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>2 Nov 2010 : Column 800W</b><br>
Rather than making assumptions about someone's capability for work based on their condition, it looks at their functional ability. This is because a health condition or disability will affect people in different ways and at different levels of severity, and we do not want to write people off by assuming that their health condition or disability is a barrier to work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_592"><a name="101102w0005.htm_para39"><a name="10110312000512">From March 2009 to March 2010, the Department led a review of the WCA, which engaged with medical and other experts and specialist disability groups. It conducted detailed case-study analysis, and concluded that generally the WCA is accurately assessing individuals for the right benefit. It also made a number of recommendations for improving the assessment, which we have accepted and plan to implement from spring 2011.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_593"><a name="101102w0005.htm_para40"><a name="10110312000513">In addition, we have commissioned Professor Malcolm Harrington to undertake the first of five independent reviews of the operation of the WCA. He is supported by a small scrutiny group which includes Paul Farmer, chief executive of Mind. Professor Harrington is evaluating the fairness and accuracy of the assessment. We look forward to receiving his report later this year and will give careful consideration to his recommendations. Where necessary, we will make changes to improve the WCA.</p>
