To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many inmates re-offended within six months of release from prisons in Wales in 1997.  [31365]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 It is difficult to provide figures in precisely the form requested. Figures routinely available centrally are rates of reconviction for "standard list offences" within two years of release. The latest available figures are for prisoners discharged in 1993, when the reconviction rate for those released from prison in Wales was 60%.
<P>

<a name="80227w01.html_para0">Standard list offences include all indictable offences and some of the more serious summary offences (a complete list of standard list offences can be found in Appendices 4 and 5 of Criminal Statistics England and Wales, 1996, Cm 3764).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures were taken by the police during the last 12 months to raise public awareness of domestic violence.  [31359]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Domestic violence is a serious crime which we are determined to tackle. All police forces now have a domestic violence policy and a unit with specific responsibility for domestic violence. How particular forces raise awareness of this issue is a matter for the chief officer of the individual police force. A new Inter-Departmental publicity campaign on domestic violence is currently under consideration by Ministers.

<P>
<a name="80227w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Animal Procedures Committee does not issue licences, but it can advise the Secretary of State on matters relating to the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.

opinion on this subject and two of its members sat on the Department of Health committee, chaired by Professor Kennedy, on the ethics of xenotransplantation.
<P>

<a name="80227w01.html_para2">The Home Office has also considered the views expressed in a report entitled "Animal-to-human organ transplants: A medical and legal perspective" which was recently submitted by Doctors and Lawyers for Responsible Medicine. Xenotransplantation Concern has also recently contacted the Home Office. Officials have invited the organisation to submit its concerns in writing.
<P>

<a name="80227w01.html_para3">The Animal Procedures Committee considered at its January meeting Imutran's application to continue an existing, licensed programme of work. It recommended, inter alia, that before deciding whether to grant the licence the Secretary of State should consult with the Department of Health and the United Kingdom Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority on the issues of the transmission of retro-viruses from pigs to humans and on whether clinical xenotransplantation was still perceived as a likely eventual outcome of the ongoing research. A final decision on Imutran's application will not be made until we have received their reply.

<a name="80227w01.html_para9">Whilst Customs produce estimates of the value of their drug seizures, police forces do not make similar estimates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Based on the values of the claims examined so far, we now believe the overall cost of the compensation schemes for large-calibre handguns and small-calibre pistols, including Home Office and police administrative costs, will be about &#163;128 million. This figure is subject to further revision as the values of those items being claimed under the small-calibre Scheme are received in the Home Office Firearms Compensation Section, and the exact details of the claims under the large-calibre Scheme still to be registered, become known. The great majority of payments under Options A and B of the large-calibre compensation scheme should be completed by the end of March, and most, if not all, of the payments under Option C should be made by the end of the year. Payments under the statutory surrender scheme for small-calibre pistols should also be completed by the end of the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Home Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is his policy on disclosure of details of military and related police assistance provided to foreign governments; and if he will make a statement.  [32535]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Military and related police assistance is provided in support of a range of foreign and defence policy aims. It can be an important factor in the development of the United Kingdom's relations with countries in all parts of the world, and can make a significant contribution to regional stability by promoting military effectiveness, which helps to deter aggression. This assistance is a key element of defence diplomacy. All requests for military assistance are considered in the light of the Government's wider foreign policy.
<P>

<a name="80227w01.html_para11">Many foreign governments regard such assistance as contributing to their national Security and are thus sensitive about public disclosure of information about it. Because of this sensitivity it has been the practice of Ministers to decline to answer questions concerning the detail and nature of training assistance. This convention has continued to apply since the introduction of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information, which recognises defence, security and international relations as reasons for withholding information.
<P>

<a name="80227w01.html_para12">My Department, in conjunction with the Foreign and Commonwealth office and others, has been considering this practice against the Government's commitment to openness. As a result, my hon. Friend, the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs and I, have decided that the public interest would be served by greater disclosure of the details of military and related police assistance provided to foreign governments. In future, details of the amount of assistance provided by our Armed Forces will be produced annually and published in my Department's Performance Report, starting with that to be produced following the end of this financial year. These details will include the numbers of overseas personnel trained, by country, the numbers of United Kingdom personnel involved in providing training or assistance overseas, again by country, and levels of any subsidies provided by my Department. My hon. Friend will publish details of the training subsidy programme funded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. This information will also be made available to the public on request.
<P>

<a name="80227w01.html_para13">All other requests for information in relation to training and assistance provided will, with immediate effect, be considered on their individual merits, but with a presumption towards disclosure unless this would be against the public interest as governed by the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. In practice it is possible that information may need to be withheld where foreign countries have legitimate security concerns, where our bilateral relations might be damaged or significantly weakened by disclosure, or where disclosure would harm our own national security. We would also not normally intend to make available personal details of students or training personnel, for reasons of personal privacy, or provide information which might threaten the safety of individuals. Where specific harm could be demonstrated by a contractor to his sales prospects as a result of releasing information on military 



<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 1998 : Column: 375</I><P>
assistance, this would be weighed against the public interest in deciding to what extent disclosure should proceed. But the amount of information withheld will be kept to the minimum.
<P>

<a name="80227w01.html_para14">This new practice represents an appropriate balance between the need to ensure that genuine defence and foreign policy interests are protected, and legitimate Parliamentary and public interest in these matters. It will ensure that significantly more information is available than has previously been the case.
<P>

<a name="80227w01.html_para15">I will be writing to those Members who have been given holding responses to questions about the details of our military assistance programmes while the review has been underway, and will place copies of my letters in the Library of the House.

 There are no hard and fast rules for the roulement of British forces engaged in peacekeeping deployments. We do, however, take very seriously indeed the need to minimise the disruption caused by overseas 



<P>
<P><I>27 Feb 1998 : Column: 376</I><P>
deployments. In general, we aim, where possible, to rotate personnel engaged in peacekeeping operations at intervals of between two and nine months.
<P>

<a name="80227w02.html_para0">In all cases, consideration of the length of any given deployment reflects the nature of the task, the size of the pool from which the deployed personnel are drawn and the time elapsed since the last deployment (of either the individual or unit). Other factors may, however, cause certain categories of personnel to be rotated more frequently than others. The specialist surgeons, physicians and anaesthetists deployed to Bosnia, for example, are frequently rotated, thereby allowing them to maintain currency in specialist skills that cannot be trained for in theatre. Conversely, where individuals or units with more unique capabilities are deployed, and where their skills cannot easily be replaced in theatre, such personnel may be rotated less frequently than others.

 Reliable budgetary statistics are not available. However, the World Bank estimated total outstanding debt in 1996 at US$ 12.8 billion, equivalent to 200% of GNP. It was 36% in arrears. There is little detailed information on public expenditure. The World Bank is mounting a mission next month to tackle this. We hope to provide an expert for the team.

 The benefits system recognises that parents who are caring for a disabled child have additional costs. That is why Income Support includes a carer premium and disabled child premium which may be paid in addition to any other premium. The premiums are also available to working lone parents who qualify for Housing Benefit and/or Council Tax Benefit.

 The baseline survey began in September 1997 and will be carried out over a 12 month period.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what actions he is taking regarding the concerns expressed about the standards of pupil welfare at the Royal Ballet School.  [32273]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 We have taken firm steps to deal with those concerns. Richmond upon Thames Social Services Department has reported to me on the findings of its inspection of pupil welfare arrangements at the Royal Ballet School. It has recommended that the School should develop written policies and procedures for implementing equal opportunities and for dealing with complaints and with bullying; improve its pastoral support system and its methods of communicating with parents; review aspects of its approach to ballet teaching and pupil assessment; and enhance staff supervision, support and training. The Government endorse these recommendations. We have asked the School to prepare an action plan to implement these recommendations within a specified timescale, and the Social Services Department to monitor progress and undertake a follow-up inspection in the Autumn. We are also inviting OFSTED to undertake a full inspection of other aspects of the School's working during 1998-99.

 The White Paper "A Voice for Wales" noted that the Assembly would need to work in close partnership with those Whitehall departments responsible for developing policies or preparing secondary legislation for England, on matters which in Wales, would be the responsibility of the Assembly. It also noted that the Assembly's officials and their Whitehall counterparts would need to consult each other on a range of issues; the basis of the consultations would be set out in concordats.
<P>

<a name="80227w06.html_para4">The Government have produced guidance setting out the principles which might govern the concordats. Copies of the guidance have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses of Parliament.

The amounts earned are not collected by the Department but it is likely that the vast majority receive expenses amounting to less than the national average wage.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what criteria will be applied to determine whether the disease transmission risks associated with xenotransplantation are of a magnitude to rule out the commencement of clinical trials.  [31686]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The rapid rate of progress in the scientific knowledge surrounding xenotransplantation is such that any set criteria used to determine disease transmission risks would quickly become outdated. Nevertheless, the safety of the individuals concerned and of the public in general must be foremost in the consideration of any proposal to undertake a xenotransplantation procedure. Our position remains that clinical trials in xenotransplantation involving humans will be allowed to take place only when we are fully satisfied that the risks associated with such procedures are acceptable, taking account of all the available evidence at the time.
<P>

<a name="80227w07.html_para1">We are advised by the United Kingdom Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority (UKXIRA) on these issues and on the acceptability of applications to undertake clinical trials in xenotransplantation involving humans. Any application will be assessed on its own merits and will be expected to include a full assessment of the microbiological risk of the proposed procedure. The UKXIRA will be assisted in its deliberations by independent assessors who will offer expert advice in all the relevant fields. The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens has agreed to set up

 Many public sector organisations have adopted codes of conduct which make provisions for the disclosure of private interests of their members and staff. Such codes reflect the specific circumstances of individual organisations, and seek to balance the privacy of individuals and the interests of the public. The main provisions are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Civil Servants</i>. The conduct rules for civil servants require staff to disclose any interests, including membership of the freemasons, which conflict with their official duties. Civil servants in the Crown Prosecution Service will be covered by the arrangements proposed by the Home Secretary for the criminal justice system.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Executive non-departmental public bodies</i>. Codes of conduct for staff and board members are mandatory and should include rules for publicly declaring potential conflicts of interest.</FONT></UL>

 The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has supplied the following breakdown of Air Proximity (Airprox) incidents in UK airspace in each of the last 10 years for which figures are available. The figures include both civil and military incidents.

to issue a consultation paper on night restrictions at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted; when he intends to publish the results on night noise contours; and if he intends to undertake further research into sleep disturbance.  [32604]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w09.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I am publishing today a consultation paper on the night restrictions for Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted Airports. We want the consultation to be as open and accessible as possible; therefore this will be a two stage process. This preliminary consultation to seek views on all aspects of the regime is the first stage. When we have considered the responses to this consultation, we will make detailed proposals for the next regime. There will then be another consultation on these proposals before a decision is made.
<P>

<a name="80227w09.html_para6">We believe this two stage process will help us formulate proposals to find the right balance between environmental and economic interests. Because of the need to allow time for consultees, especially representative bodies, to make their responses, this will delay the introduction of the next night restrictions regime beyond October 1998. For winter 1998-99, the movements limits and noise quotas for the three airports will be the same as they are for winter 1997-98. For summer 1999, we are inviting comments on our intention that the movements limits and noise quotas will be the same as those for summer 1998, In the light of those comments we shall then give further consideration to the movements limits and noise quotas for summer 1999. The hours of the restrictions, the system for classifying aircraft and other aspects of the regime will remain as they are at present until the new regime is introduced.
<P>

<a name="80227w09.html_para7">A report on night noise contours is being published today. Its main conclusion is that there is not enough research evidence at present to underpin scientifically robust night contours relating noise to annoyance. One major area that the report identifies for further investigation is the effect of sleep disturbance at the beginning and end of the night, in particular, the significance of sleep disturbance in determining annoyance. I am therefore announcing today a research trial on sleep disturbance. Its aim will be to assess methodology and analytical techniques, to determine whether to proceed to a full scale study of either sleep prevention or total sleep loss.
<P>

<a name="80227w09.html_para8">Copies of the consultation paper and of the report on night noise contours will be placed in the House Library. The closing date for responses to the consultation paper is 29 May 1998.

<a name="80227w09.html_para9">In addition, I am directing all waste collection authorities in England to investigate if their present plans need updating. Where an authority identifies the need to revise its plan, I hope that the revised plan can be in place by the end of the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he intends to issue new traffic management and parking guidance for London.  [32297]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w10.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We have today published new Traffic Management and Parking Guidance for the London local authorities, the Traffic Director for London and the Highways Agency. Copies have been placed in the Library. The new Guidance establishes the framework for traffic management measures and parking controls across London and aims to make them serve a wider set of environmental, social and economic priorities, and to encourage greater use of alternatives to the car.
<P>

<a name="80227w10.html_para0">In particular, the Guidance includes new aims for red routes and parking control initiatives both of which seek to encourage a shift from the use of the car for personal travel to public transport, walking or cycling; and to traffic management programmes which reduce accidents, congestion, pollution and car dependency.
<P>

<a name="80227w10.html_para1">This new approach heralds a shift away from a preoccupation with vehicles and instead places the emphasis on moving people and goods. The guidance gives greater priority to the needs of buses, pedestrians, cyclists and people with disabilities in traffic management and parking.

 <i>[holding answer 29 January 1998]:</i> The Government are seeking urgent advice from experts on the implications of the judgment and how best to take matters forward. It is too early to say what the total cost of compensation is likely to be, as there is no way of knowing how many claims might be received and for what conditions. The DTI, in conjunction with the plaintiffs' solicitors, is currently devising arrangements to allow relevant claims to be processed systematically and valid claims to be settled as soon as is practicable.

 The UK environmental industry has tremendous potential to generate new technologies to boost the UK economy while at the same time finding solutions to environmental problems.

<P>
<a name="80227w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 February 1998]:</i> As a result of the introduction of the opening of the market, cable operators now provide digital services in competition to BT to many people living in Scotland. Licences were granted to operators in 1997 to provide radio fixed access services to many areas in the UK including many parts of Scotland. Radio fixed access technology is being introduced to provide digital services across Scotland.
<P>

<a name="80227w11.html_para2">Mobile operators have also rolled out digital networks in the Central Belt and East Coast of Scotland, and there are plans to roll out to remote rural areas over the next two years.
<P>

<a name="80227w11.html_para3">The Government therefore have already taken steps to improve the provision of digital telecommunication services in Scotland. As competition develops further, access to and choice of digital services may well increase.

Compensatory arrangements for delays to the introduction of retail electricity competition are included in the electricity supply price controls which will run from April 1998.

<a name="80227w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 At present approximately 50 per cent. of children in custody are held in secure accommodation for both Protestant and Catholic boys at Lisnevin. Under the Criminal Justice Order (NI) 1996, custodial orders must reflect the seriousness of offending. The prospective Criminal Justice (Children) Order would reduce the circumstances when children may be remanded in custody. The combined effect should be a reduction to the more serious and persistent offenders and those given custodial orders. Many of these will require secure accommodation and this, rather than religion, will be the principal criterion in deciding to which Centre a boy will be placed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how expenditure by the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland on preparations for events celebrating the new Millennium will be funded.  [32400]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w11.html_spnew8"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 The Department of the Environment is empowered by Parliamentary approval through Supply Estimates and the confirming Appropriation Orders to provide financial support to certain events promoting Northern Ireland. The events celebrating the new Millennium should also promote Northern Ireland's image in a positive manner. However, as they may be novel and different from current promotional activities, Parliament's approval for expenditure in the current financial year on preparations for such events will be sought in a Supplementary Estimate for the Environmental and Other Services Vote (Department of the Environment Vote 4). Pending that approval expenditure up to an estimated &#163;60,000 will be met by repayable advances from the Civil Contingencies Fund. I am also examining the possibility of seeking Parliament's approval for new legislation which would specifically authorise such expenditure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w11.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Children, and those concerned with their welfare, will, in addition to the usual remedies, have recourse to the child protection procedures established in accordance with guidelines issued by the Department of Health and Social Services. In addition, the treatment and welfare of children in juvenile justice centres will be subject to independent inspection by the Social Services Inspectorate of DHSS and children will have regular access to Independent Representatives employed by NIACRO.

 Since its inception in 1973, Lisnevin has provided secure accommodation for both Catholic and Protestant boys. Mixing boys of both religions has not given rise to any significant problems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will make a statement on how the open training schools are classified for use for certain religious groups and the date on which such classifications or changes in classifications were made under the Children and Young Persons (Northern Ireland) Act 1986.  [31625]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80227w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 As St. Patrick's, St. Joseph's and Rathgael (formerly Malone and Whiteabbey) Training Schools were approved before the Children and Young Persons (Northern Ireland) Act was commenced, it was not necessary to classify them under section 137 of that Act. However St. Patrick's Training School is regarded as providing accommodation primarily for Catholic boys while Middletown Justice Centre is classified for use primarily by Catholic girls. Rathgael is not classified by religious denomination, but as most Catholic boys and girls in the open system are accommodated at St. Patrick's and Middletown Catholic Training Schools, in practice most of the children referred to it are Protestant.
