Following the successful summit, the Department for Culture Media and Sports has issued guidance on a range of innovative and tough conditions as well as on the introduction of the 'yellow card/red card' scheme to encourage earlier and stronger intervention to tackle problem premises.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps her Department is taking to reduce alcohol misuse and anti-social behaviour in London, with specific reference to south- west London. [236942]</p>

 The Home Office work in relation to tackling alcohol misuse is focused on areas prioritised on the basis of perceptions of drunk or rowdy behaviour and police-recorded crime statistics for less serious wounding. However, the Home Office is taking a number of steps to tackle alcohol misuse and ASB in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_34"><a name="81124w0002.htm_para2"><a name="0811249000257">For example, in relation to tackling alcohol misuse, we are rolling out bespoke media campaigns in seven priority areas. These &#145;Know Your Limits'-based local media campaigns will take place from December 2008 to March 2009. These campaigns will communicate the national responsible drinking &#145;Know Your Limits&#146; messages using a tailored approach for each local area. The areas where this will take place are Stoke-On-Trent, Stevenage, Southampton, North East Lincs, Weymouth, Durham and Barking and Dagenham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_35"><a name="81124w0002.htm_para3"><a name="0811249000258">Additionally, we are holding a series of two-day bespoke regional practitioner training workshops (the first of which took place in London on 28 to 29 October) on the application of the Licensing Act 2003 and practical enforcement of offences under it; and the use and enforcement of other alcohol-related tools and powers, including designated public places orders (DPPOs) and alcohol disorder zones (ADZs). The second event, in Cambridge, was held on the 18 to 19 November. These workshops will be accompanied by the publication of a comprehensive digital support package early in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_36"><a name="81124w0002.htm_para4"><a name="0811249000259">Also, in October 2007, four Home Office-funded alcohol arrest referral (AAR) projects began operating, one of which was in Ealing in south-west London. Alcohol arrest referral schemes aim to reduce offending among people arrested for alcohol related offences by providing them with advice on the links between unsafe drinking levels and offending. It is hoped that if the AAR schemes, such as Ealing in south-west London, demonstrate a reduction in the level of re-offending, local authorities will be persuaded, due to the savings to the CJS, to re-prioritise funding in order to pay for future provisions. A further nine pilots, funded by the Home Office started in November 2008; of which one, Islington, is in London.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_37"><a name="81124w0002.htm_para5"><a name="0811249000260">Further, five London boroughs are benefiting from the Tackling Violent Crime Programme: Barking and Dagenham, Westminster, Greenwich, Southwark and Newham. This funding is aimed at the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership's work in aiming to reduce alcohol related violent crime and domestic violence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_38"><a name="81124w0002.htm_para6"><a name="0811249000261">In relation to antisocial behaviour, the Home Office have provided practitioners with a toolkit to tackle antisocial behaviour, which they operate according to local priorities as well as a practitioner website and advice line. In south-west London, a multidisciplinary antisocial behaviour team operates many initiatives, based on prevention and enforcement that engage, educate and promote awareness among young people, engage with residents and tackle antisocial behaviour in families.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_39"><a name="81124w0002.htm_para7"><a name="0811249000262">Additionally, in autumn 2007, antisocial behaviour practitioners in London suggested that assistance in using ASB preventative tools and powers to combat alcohol-related disorder would be useful. Government Office for London was successful in drawing down &#163;25,000 from the Home Office to fund a research project examining this very issue and a well-received guide&#151;&#145;What Works to Tackle Alcohol-related Disorder?: An Examination of the Use of ASB Tools and Powers in London'&#151;was completed by London South Bank university earlier this year.

As well as cases where the FMU has directly intervened, this statistic also includes incidences where the unit has provided support to an individual facing potential forced marriage who has made an anonymous call for advice to the public helpline and incidences where the FMU has provided referral support and guidance to agencies handling a case locally. We believe that this figure represents only a fraction of the total number of incidences of forced marriage in the UK, with many more being handled by local statutory or voluntary sector agencies without referral to the FMU and a far greater number going unreported.</p>

 Directive 2008/50/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, came into force on 11 June and must be transposed into national legislation by 10 June 2010. DEFRA will work with the devolved administrations to achieve this.</p>

This is because, despite the improvement we have seen in recent years, we are unlikely to meet the current 2010 deadline for nitrogen dioxide. For PM10&#151;where the problem is confined chiefly to London&#151;the deadline has already passed and we are still exceeding the limits in some areas. The problem with nitrogen dioxide is mainly about existing pollution from traffic in London and in other major cities across the UK.</p>

The due date for compliance with the limit value for nitrogen dioxide is 2010 and we expect to submit an application for this pollutant in 2010, again after a period of consultation. If applications were granted by the Commission, the maximum period of &#145;extra time&#146; for implementation would be an extension to 2011 for PM10 and until 2015 for nitrogen dioxide.</p>

Quantities of discards are estimated quarterly using data collected by scientific observers aboard commercial fishing vessels. They are required to record the quantity landed and discarded, and the species and size composition of the discards each time the fishing gear is hauled. Deploying scientific observers in this manner is expensive and time consuming, with the result that it is usually only possible to sample a small proportion of the overall fishing trips in a given area. As a result, it is necessary to extrapolate from the limited sampling to provide estimates for the entire fleet. Although the sampling is intended to cover a representative sample of the fleet, this does mean that the estimates of total discards are subject to uncertainty.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="81124w0007.htm_para9"><a name="0811249000717">Each geographical area is referred to as a policy unit and across England and Wales there are approximately 860. In 38 of these, the flood risk management policy option will be to provide no active intervention. In practice this means that the Environment Agency will continue to monitor flood risk, but will not carry out maintenance on watercourses and defences. Flood risk in these areas is relatively low and the policy reflects the current practice of low intervention to manage risk.</p>

 Fly-tipping occurs in both urban and rural areas. The Government, working with local authorities and the Environment Agency, aim to reduce fly-tipping through better prevention, detection and risk-based enforcement. As members of the National Fly-tipping Prevention Group, DEFRA works closely on this issue with large, private landowner organisations, many of whom have strong rural interests. We are funding the Environment Agency to undertake some specific work this year with these organisations, including the National Farmers Union and Country Land and Business Association, to quantify the extent of fly-tipping on private land and identify best practice to tackle the illegal dumping of waste in these areas.</p>

 The majority of pesticides are used in agriculture. Pesticides Safety Directorate's impact assessment, which was published in May 2008, therefore focused on the agronomic impacts of changes to pesticide availability arising from these proposals. It recognised that there could be wider implications, but did not analyse them in detail, as the agronomic assessment provided sufficient indication of the potential impacts to determine our response. On 5 November the European Parliament Environment Committee voted on a range of amendments that reduce the potential impact of the new regulation on the availability of pesticides.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 November 2008]:</i> The UK is working to meet ambient air quality limit values in the shortest time possible. The UK Air Quality Strategy that was published in 2007 provides full details, and can be found on the DEFRA website. Over the past 10 years the quality of our air has improved and apart from some hotspots alongside busy roads in major cities we are meeting our current objectives for all pollutants in 99 per cent. of the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_124"><a name="81124w0009.htm_para1"><a name="0811249000814">In response to difficulties faced across Europe, the new ambient air quality directive (2008/50/EC), which replaces the earlier 1996 directive and three other related directives, provides in Article 22 for a notification procedure for member states to be able to seek authorisation from the EU Commission for additional time to meet the limit values for particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_125"><a name="81124w0009.htm_para2"><a name="0811249000815">On PM10 limit values, in September the Government made the European Commission aware that, subject to public consultation, the UK intends to submit an Article 22 application for an exemption for those few parts of the UK where there have been breaches, including London, from the obligation to apply the limit value until 2011. Most other member states will also be submitting applications. We expect to consult early in 2009.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_126"><a name="81124w0009.htm_para3"><a name="0811249000816">On nitrogen dioxide, the limit values are extremely challenging and despite efforts to date, the UK, like most other member states, expects to report breaches beyond the 2010 compliance deadline. The problem is mainly concerned with existing pollution from road traffic both in London and in other major cities across the UK. Again, subject to public consultation, the Government expect to submit in 2010 an application to the Commission which would give the possibility of a further five years to meet the limit values for nitrogen dioxide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="81124w0009.htm_para4"><a name="0811249000817">For both these pollutants, securing such postponement of attainment deadlines is subject to submission of detailed plans that will need to satisfy the Commission that the limit values can be achieved by the extended deadlines. We are determined to tackle remaining hotspots of pollution and to meet our EU obligations.</p>

In addition to being a prime sports fish for the sea angling sector, bass is a particularly important stock for the inshore fishing fleet. Given the pressures faced by this fleet and the relatively healthy state of the stock, I have no plans to increase the minimum landing size of bass.

 Her Majesty's Courts Service (HMCS) calculated the cost of public law family proceedings, was &#163;40 million. The increased fees were set on this basis, and an additional &#163;40 million was built into the local authority settlement for England and Wales. This figure applies to all three years of the settlement and will form part of the baseline for future spending reviews. It is likely to exceed the actual expenditure on court fees for local authorities as it assumes that the maximum fee is payable in each case. It does not allow for any savings arising from early resolution or fast track procedures recently introduced under the revised Public Law Outline.</p>

 In the past year the Ministry of Justice has received a number of requests for information and details of policy relating to Sharia law and Sharia councils and their position on family issues. Earlier this year this Department conducted an initial review of the research into Sharia councils in England and Wales and we intend to commission further research in the form of a scoping study. We hope that the scoping study will assess the feasibility of identifying Sharia councils, their members and users; explore the feasibility of obtaining data to establish the number, scope and clientele of Sharia councils in relation to Sharia family law and determine how Sharia councils, members and users can best be engaged in future research.</p>

At present there is no mechanism in civil proceedings to record how many draft consent orders embodying the terms of an agreement reached by the use of a Sharia council have been enforced within the meaning of the Arbitration Act 1996 or those that have been held not to comply with English legal tenets. Judges in England and Wales will only know that the consent order they are scrutinising comes from a Sharia council if this is made known to them by the parties.</p>

Among the remainder, enfranchisement of prisoners varies depending the nature of offence committed by, or length of the sentence imposed on, prisoners, while in some countries the decision as to whether an individual prisoner is permitted to vote remains at the discretion of the sentencing court.

 The Government&#146;s stance on piracy has been reviewed. This has resulted in a move to a more proactive posture whereby Royal Navy units in the region will actively seek out pirates, and we have issued them with more robust guidance to deal with any pirates encountered. The Royal Navy contributes to counter-piracy operations through three international efforts:</p>

On 10 November EU Foreign and Defence Ministers met at the General Affairs and External Relations Council and agreed the joint action to set up the EU mission. A further joint action to launch the mission is expected in early December. The UK offer is subject to sufficient forces being generated for an operation likely to begin in December.</p>

 As part of its ongoing action plan, MOD is currently undertaking censuses of all IT and digital media as recommended by the Burton report. As a result, some adjustment of historic figures previously reported is expected. However, we take any loss of media storage devices very seriously. We have put in place revised, robust procedures. New processes, instructions and technological aids are also being implemented to mitigate human errors and raise awareness of every individual in the Department.</p>

This was in accordance with normal practice, which reflects the fact that giving estimated values for subsequent increments which are not yet approved or under contract could adversely affect the Department's position in future commercial negotiations.

 When service personnel leave the armed forces, their healthcare needs are the responsibility of the NHS. Service leavers, particularly those who have medical problems or who are considered vulnerable, receive advice about the help available to them by MOD welfare services and are given information about the ex-service charities (such as the Royal British Legion and Combat Stress). This is reinforced by outreach events and information from the Department. More specifically, NHS-led community mental health pilots are running at five sites offering a best practice, culturally sensitive, veterans&#146; mental health service; another one will begin shortly in Scotland.

These reports are supported at the strategic health authority level and allow for local monitoring and service development.

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) are making progress towards the implementation of the recommendations in the clinical guideline produced by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence in 2004. We have estimated that the cost of funding up to three cycles of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) in all PCTs is in the region of &#163;170 million a year above the cost of the present level of provision. The estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty; it does not take into account recent progress made towards the full implementation of the NICE fertility guideline, for example in the East of England strategic health authority, and it varies with differing assessments of factors such as the number of people seeking treatment in the future and the range of costs of IVF treatment.</p>

This meant that some PCTs were unable to respond. However, Professor Richards was confident that the data collected from the 80 PCTS who did respond fully were representative of the picture across the country. For example, the results of the Department of Health survey are consistent with a survey conducted by the Rarer Cancers Forum, the results of which are set out in chapter 2 of Professor Richards&#146; report, &#147;Improving access to medicines for NHS patients&#148;.

 The humanitarian situation in Somalia continues to be of great concern to the UK Government. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) does not have an official estimate of the proportion of the Somali population unable to access to aid due to the withdrawal of humanitarian agencies. However, a contingency plan has been put into place and other agencies have stepped in quickly to fill the gap left by the withdrawal. Our partners, including the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), World Food Programme (WFP) and UNOCHA, remain responsive, and operational on the ground despite the difficult conditions and aid is still being delivered to the most vulnerable. Reports from the WFP indicate that 2.3 million Somalis will receive food aid in November.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 October 2008]:</i> Government policies and programmes affect the lives of millions of people and in order for them to work they must be communicated effectively. However, this has also to be done with cost efficiency in mind and there are strict rules to ensure value for money on Government advertising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_424"><a name="81124w0035.htm_para3"><a name="0811256000163">Much Government advertising aims to alert people to things that can save lives&#151;and we make no apologies for campaigns like this&#151;such as wearing seat belts, not drinking and driving, quitting smoking and what to do in an emergency. We also use our communications work to protect public funds, for example through our work to drive down benefit fraud.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="81124w0035.htm_para4"><a name="0811256000164">The other main area of activity is in recruiting people to important frontline services such as in attracting more people to become nurses and police, which are crucial to the public's welfare.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="81124w0035.htm_para5"><a name="0811256000165">Advertising spend within the DWP covers both campaign advertising and recruitment advertising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"><a name="81124w0035.htm_para8"><a name="0811256000168">The majority of departmental spend on advertising is via the Central Office of Information (COI) rosters.</p>

 The Department uses three indicators to monitor levels of child poverty; they were established in 2003 following a lengthy period of consultation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="81124w0036.htm_para0"><a name="0811256000245">Absolute low income measures whether the poorest families are seeing their income rise in real terms. The threshold is fixed as equal to the relative low income threshold for the baseline year of 1998-99 expressed in today&#146;s prices.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="81124w0036.htm_para1"><a name="0811256000246">Relative low income measures whether the incomes of the poorest families are keeping pace with the growth of incomes in the economy as a whole. This indicator measures the number of children living in households below 60 per cent. of contemporary median equivalised income. This is the indicator which is used to measure performance against the public service agreement target to halve child poverty by 2010-11.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_444"><a name="81124w0036.htm_para2"><a name="0811256000247">Material deprivation and low income combined provides a wider measure of people&#146;s living standards. This indicator measures the number of children living in households that are both materially deprived and have an income below 70 per cent. of contemporary equivalised median income.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_445"><a name="81124w0036.htm_para3"><a name="0811256000248">Since 1998 progress has been made against all of the indicators. 600,000 children have been lifted out of relative low income between 1998-99 and 2006-07, a shift from 3.4 million children to 2.9 million children. The number of children living in absolute low income has halved from 3.4 million to 1.7 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_446"><a name="81124w0036.htm_para4"><a name="0811256000249">Between 2004-05, the first year data were available, and 2006-07 the number of children in the UK defined as poor using the combined indicator of relative low income and material deprivation fell by 200,000 from 2.2 million to 2.0 million on the particular material deprivation threshold that was chosen.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_447"><a name="81124w0036.htm_para5"><a name="0811256000250">Low income is not the only dimension to poverty and a child&#146;s quality of life, including access to health care, education and a safe environment, are critical.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_448"><a name="81124w0036.htm_para6"><a name="0811256000251">The three indicators are therefore underpinned by the broader Opportunity for all indicators. Opportunity for all is the Government&#146;s report on poverty and social exclusion which includes a wide range of poverty and social exclusion indicators for children and young people (as well as working age adults, older people and communities) including health, education and housing.

<i> [holding answer 18 November 2008]:</i> At all stages we have taken the proper course of action based on the Government&#146;s wider social and public policy, legal advice and economic factors pertaining at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_474"><a name="81124w0040.htm_para8"><a name="0811256001070">Income from the Post Office card account has come to form an increasingly important part of the Post Office&#146;s income, as well as providing vital footfall to sub-postmasters. The loss of this business would mean there would be a real risk of a significant number of unplanned closures which would impact most on those vulnerable customers who rely on the Post Office and do not have easily accessible alternatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_475"><a name="81124w0040.htm_para9"><a name="0811256001071">Global economic events have made people, particularly the most vulnerable in our society, more concerned about financial transactions. The Post Office is a trusted brand, and is seen as a safe, secure and reliable provider of services in these turbulent times. Now is not the time for the Government to do anything to put the network at risk, particularly as Post Offices are often the only providers of financial services in remote areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="81124w0040.htm_para10"><a name="0811256001072">Taking all of these factors into account, we believe that awarding Post Office Ltd another contract is the right thing to do in public policy terms, because it will help maintain the existing Post Office network which provides vital services to vulnerable customers in areas where there is often little or no alternative provision. We are also clear that it represent best value overall to the taxpayer.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_477"><a name="81124w0040.htm_para11"><a name="0811256001073">We recognise the importance of competition in the awarding of public contracts, but we have concluded that, in these exceptional circumstances, protecting vulnerable groups by preserving a viable Post Office network justifies the award of a contract outside the competitive process. These are exceptional times and we believe that this is a proper and proportionate response.</p>

 The operation of disciplinary procedures, including those that result in suspension, is a matter for local determination. To support schools in this area there are a variety of sources of advice available to help governing bodies with their responsibilities. The DCSF's &#145;A Guide to the Law for School Governors and Staffing&#146; guidance set out the statutory responsibilities falling to schools as employers. This guidance is available through www.governornet.co.uk and www.teachernet.co.uk. These sources also provide access to an extensive range of additional guidance material including materials from the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service. Schools are therefore able to draw from a wide variety of guidance when devising their policies and handling disciplinary cases.</p>

This is considered reasonable, has proven not to have caused undue financial hardship to the sector, and is in line with the level of borrowings guidance to the Higher Education sector.

The key elements of that affordability judgement are a reasonable level of commercial bank borrowings within a financial forecast that demonstrates robust financial health by the third year after project completion and improving still further beyond then, with a robust risk management plan in place to demonstrate financial solvency against a range of downside scenarios going forward. This is carefully assessed before the LSC gives consent for a college to enter into a capital project.</p>

 Our counter-narcotics policy on Afghanistan aims to achieve an Afghan drugs trade divided from the insurgency and prevented from undermining security, governance and the economy, to the point where the Government of Afghanistan can take responsibility for delivery of its own counter-narcotics effort.

 The UK remains very concerned by the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and the recent unconfirmed reports of armed forces of the Democratic Republic of Congo (FARDC) soldiers raping and killing civilians. Unfortunately there are not yet any comprehensive statistics for such incidents in 2008. With the ongoing conflict in Eastern DRC, sexual violence is used to humiliate and intimidate women and sometimes men of all ages, tearing up families and whole communities. With UK support, the UN Peacekeeping Mission in the DRC (MONUC) mandate was amended in December 2007 to include a requirement to protect civilians against sexual and gender-based violence (SGBV). The UN has appointed a Senior Adviser on Sexual Violence, who is working with international partners and the DRC government to develop a plan of action and coordinate initiatives to deal with the problem. The UK also took the lead in drafting UN Security Council Resolution 1820 which recognises SGBV as a peace and security issue.</p>

There is a high level of awareness about Britain in Hong Kong; 80 per cent. of Hong Kong visitors are repeat visitors.</p>

 Zimbabwe's social and economic decline has forced many Zimbabweans to leave the country during the last few years. The vast majority of these migrants do so through irregular means, thus making it impossible to estimate numbers accurately. The post election violence saw a significant increase in requests for formal asylum and refugee status in neighbouring countries, especially in Botswana. We are aware that 822 Zimbabweans have been granted refugee status in Botswana, the majority of whom are accommodated at the Dukwi refugee settlement. The government of Botswana have worked very closely with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and ensured that those received in Botswana are provided with the necessary protection for their safety and security. In response to the increased number of Zimbabweans crossing into Botswana, the UK provided funds to the UN Children's Fund (UNICEF) to assist with upgrading sanitation/hygiene facilities at the refugee centre.</p>

 Once sites have been declared surplus for operational purposes and placed on the register, there is a 40 working day window for public sector agencies and Departments to identify new uses for this land. If the sites can be used beneficially elsewhere in the public sector they will be sold at market value in accordance with guidance in HM Treasury&#146;s guidance and brought back into beneficial use. Ultimately local planning authorities are responsible for preparing regional strategies and local development frameworks and these take account of the suitability of particular sites in their area for the development of housing.

 Since the publication of the Transport 10 Year Plan of 2000, the Department for Transport (DFT) has set a requirement for a 25 per cent. contribution from promoters towards the costs of light rail projects.

 Where a traffic authority closes a road temporarily for a special event, it has the freedom to choose whether or not it recovers its costs from the person promoting the event. If an authority opts to recover costs, the amount of the charge is also at the authority&#146;s discretion provided that, when deciding the charge, the authority has regard to the cost of anything that needs to be done in connection with the closure.

<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>
Key Coefficient of Variation (CV) Statistical Robustness<br>

** 5 = CV&lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise.<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt; 20 Estimates are considered acceptable.<br>
**** CV = 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes.<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>

<i> [holding answer 18 November 2008]:</i><i> </i>Local authorities, as with all other participants in the Carbon Reduction Commitment, will be included if they meet the threshold of electricity consumption of 6000 MWh measured through half hourly meters during 2008. It will be for the local authorities themselves to assess their electricity consumption to establish whether they are above the threshold. DECC does not therefore have a list of local authority or other participants at this stage, though we expect most top tier authorities will be included.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 November 2008]:</i> The Carbon Reduction Commitment will begin in April 2010. The first phase, between April 2010 and March 2013, will be an introductory phase in which an unlimited number of allowances will be sold at a fixed price. This will allow participants to gain experience of the scheme before the &#147;capped&#148; phases begin in April 2013. There are no pilots of the scheme in operation. Allowances will be sold at a fixed price in the first phase and auctioned in subsequent phases rather than allocated.</p>

 DECC has been working with DEFRA estates, which maintains 3-8 Whitehall Place, in considering the application of various technologies that would improve the energy efficiency of the building. DECC intends to implement the guidance provided in Good Practice Guide 286&#151;Energy Performance in the Government's Civil Estate. As well as considering ways to improve the building's energy efficiency, we are also looking for opportunities to reduce our carbon, energy and water consumption through changes to the way in which we work. However the use of micro generation and onsite renewables at this building, with its central London location, is unlikely to be viable. 100 per cent. of the electricity supplied to 3-8 Whitehall Place is however generated from renewable sources. Electricity for other DECC locations, including Atholl House and temporary accommodation in Ergon House and 1 Victoria Street, is procured under a green tariff In addition, DECC is considering the feasibility of the connection of 3-8 Whitehall Place to the Whitehall District Heating System.</p>

1. These are actual gross expenditure figures of the Nuclear Directorate (ND) itself for 2003-04 to 2007-08 and forecast for 2008-09.<br>
2. ND recovers some 97 per cent. of these nuclear installations costs (and a pro rata share of the additional associated HSE overhead and central costs) as income through charges to industry under the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 and Health and Safety (Fees) (Amendment) Regulations 2007. Since 2007-08 this has also included 100 per cent. recovery of the Office for Civil Nuclear Security costs (and a pro rata share of the additional associated HSE overhead and central costs) recovered under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, the Energy Act 2004, the extant security provisions of the Nuclear Installations Act 1965 (as amended) and, in respect of nuclear material, the Import of Goods (Control) Order 1954.<br>
3. HSE has issued indicative ND budget allocations for 2009-10 and 2010-11 (&#163;29,973k and &#163;30,930k respectively) but these will shortly be revised as part of HSE's annual planning process to reflect expected activity in these years.<br>
4. HSE will set budgets for 2011-12 and beyond upon receipt of its spending review 2010 settlement in due course.<br>
5. The figures for 2007-08 onwards include the Office for Civil Nuclear Security and the UK Safeguards Office who joined HSE from the Department for Trade and Industry on 1 April 2007 (&#163;2.3 million and &#163;0.3 million respectively).<br>
