<a name="71124w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Heathcoat-Amory: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if, in his review of avoidance of direct taxes, he will examine the use of Jersey-based capital gains tax avoidance schemes by British companies. [12587]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B>

<a name="71124w01.html_wqn1"><B> Ms Kelly: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the legislation which would need to be enacted prior to the United Kingdom joining a single currency. [15338]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993 requires an Act of Parliament before the UK would be able to move to the third stage of economic and monetary union. In addition, as confirmed in the Chancellor's statement on 27 October 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>583-88, </i>whenever a decision to enter is taken by the Government, it should be put to a referendum of the British people, and this would require legislation. Separately, the Bank of England would need to be compatible with the terms of the Treaty which apply if we were to join and there would be changes needed to related UK legislation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer from what decisions relating to the European Single Currency--other than those determined in treaties or protocols concerning the operation of the European Monetary Institute, the European System of Central Banks or the statutes and duties of the European central banks--member states unable or unwilling to participate in the single currency, or the representatives of their respective central banks, will be excluded. [15436]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 All decisions relating the European Central Bank (ECB) will be taken pursuant to the Treaty establishing the European Community, including its various Protocols, in particular Nos. 3, 4, 8 and 11, which collectively lay down the rights and obligations of participating and non-participating member states and their National Central Banks.
<P>
<P>

<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 November 1997]:</i> The UK is in agreement with all other Member States that the ECOFIN Council will remain the decision-making body for economic and financial issues after the start of stage three of EMU, as it is now.

<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gibb: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the members of the Tax and Benefits Task Force chaired by Mr. Martin Taylor. [16845]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 Martin Taylor chairs a Task Force on which the Treasury, Inland Revenue, the Department of Social Security and Department for Education and Employment are represented by senior officials. It is not the usual practice to name individual officials.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many public appointments he has made since 1 May; and how many and what percentage of these <i>(a)</i> receive remuneration and <i>(b)</i> are of (i) Afro-Caribbean and (ii) Asian origin. [16782]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Chancellor's Department and Agencies have made 31 public appointments since 1 May 1997, of which eight (26 per cent.) receive remuneration. The information about ethnic origin cannot be provided since to do so would risk identifying individuals without their consent. My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster has provided information for all departments in an aggregated form.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will calculate the revenue impact of imposing an additional 1 per cent. annual tax on individuals whose assets exceed &#163;1 million. [17040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 It is not possible to assess precisely the number and wealth of millionaires in the United Kingdom at any one time. The only available estimates are derived from inheritance tax data on a year-of-death basis. On this basis it is provisionally estimated that living individuals with net marketable wealth--that is, excluding pension rights--exceeding &#163;1 million in 1994, the latest available year, owned assets totalling &#163;116 billion, of which 1 per cent. represents just over &#163;1 billion.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Fox: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his answer of 13 November, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>625</i>, on exchange rates, if he will publish the available evidence which suggests that the use of foreign currency is fairly stable over time. [16899]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 November 1997]:</i> The following figures, which are the most recent available, show exports and imports invoiced in foreign currency from 1979-88. It suggests that the proportion of trade invoiced in foreign currency was generally stable over that period, after allowing for a likely once-off adjustment by businesses to the lifting of foreign exchange controls.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 I am publishing The National Asset Register today. Copies are available in the Vote Office.
<P>

<a name="71124w01.html_para0">The National Asset Register fulfils the Government's Manifesto commitment to publish a thorough inventory of the assets they own. Publication demonstrates the Government's commitment to greater openness and accountability by letting the nation see what assets the nation owns.
<P>

<a name="71124w01.html_para1">This is the first time that any Government have had such a comprehensive picture of all the assets they hold. The National Asset Register will be an invaluable starting point in helping departments to identify whether they are making the best use of their assets and achieving value for money. It demonstrates the Government's commitment to maintaining prudent and sound financial management.
<P>

<a name="71124w01.html_para2">To help departments do this the Treasury has also introduced two new measures to encourage departments to get the best from their assets:
<P>

<a name="71124w01.html_para3">First, at present any receipts from the sale of surplus assets must be surrendered to the Consolidated Fund unless the Treasury agrees that the department concerned can retain them to increase its gross spending power. (The receipts then count as negative public expenditure so do not increase net spending or the Control Total.)
<P>

<a name="71124w01.html_para4">From 1 April 1998 until 1 April 2001 when the new resource budgeting arrangements are in place, the Treasury will allow departments to retain 100 per cent. of the receipts from assets of which they dispose, subject to certain limits. These limits are that:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
the value of an individual sale does not exceed &#163;100 million;
<BR>
the value of the total sales for any financial year does not exceed 3 per cent. of a department's cash-limited vote; and
<BR>
the receipts can only be used to finance capital spending. They cannot be used to finance current spending.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="71124w01.html_para5">These limits are necessary to ensure that these sales do not distort the Government's overall spending allocations.
<P>

<a name="71124w01.html_para6">Second, Departments are also being encouraged to make better use of assets they retain. This more effective management may include increasing commercial activity which has generally been constrained by lack of incentives for departments and by current Treasury guidance.
<P>

<a name="71124w01.html_para7">Under the new arrangements Departments will be helped to maximise the value they retain from their assets by

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
being able to retain receipts from commercial activity;
<BR>
being encouraged to develop relationships with the private sector to bring in any necessary skills and expertise;
<BR>
the Treasury's Private Finance Task Force will provide support to Departments; and
<BR>
this new approach in being developed in partnership with departments which are being consulted on the arrangements.

Average graduate earnings would be expected to increase more rapidly than average earnings for full-time workers as a whole, thus reducing the average length of the repayment period for any given amount of loan;<P>

<P>

Repayments will not begin until a graduate has a gross annual income of &#163;10,000 and will stop if at any time their income falls below this threshold;<P>

The figures for 'maximum loan available' are based on the assumption that the graduates enter higher education in 1999-2000 and are therefore eligible for a 100 per cent. maintenance loan (as opposed to the 75 per cent. loan available in the 1998-99 transitional year). They also assume that loans will be uprated annually in line with inflation.<P>

 We issued guidance to Local Education Authorities (LEAs) on how to bid for the next tranche of New Deal for Schools funding on 5 November. In deciding allocations, we shall consider LEAs plans to meet their most urgent building needs as a whole. We are asking LEAs to assess the condition of their school buildings objectively in four priority bands. This will allow us to compare the needs of LEAs consistently across the country.

<a name="71124w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 For county schools, we do not allow separately for design fees when we allocate Annual Capital Guidelines (ACGs) or Supplementary Credit Approvals (SCAs); design fees are part of the project costs which LEAs meet from borrowing and other sources of funding at their disposal. For voluntary aided and special agreement schools, LEAs may bid for grant aid for design fees in the annual capital bidding round in October each year or, in the case of statutory proposals, before publication. The annual bidding letter sets out the priorities for distributing resources to schools. Authorities may bid to replace a school in the Exceptional Basic Need (EBN) category. EBN funding is only given if the building will have to be taken out of use within the next twelve months; repair is impracticable; and no alternative provision exists.

<a name="71124w03.html_para0">For New Deal for Schools allocations in 1997-98, we gave priority to bids to cover the development costs of innovative Public Private Partnerships and building work which could be completed between 30 September 1997 and 31 March 1998.

<P>

<a name="71124w03.html_para3">Costs are estimated on the basis of the additional costs over and above those which would be incurred by a compliance with existing chemical control regimes. The CBA shows estimated one-off costs in the range of &#163;5-&#163;20 million, with annual costs of around &#163;6.7 million, depending on the number of new products placed on the market. This estimate of annual costs takes account of the significant reduction in costs achieved by the simplified administrative procedures negotiated by the United Kingdom. HSE are currently updating the cost estimates in the CBA in discussion with the Chemical Industries Association.

However, the details of the regime provided for in the Protocol will be elaborated after Kyoto.

<a name="71124w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 I met Lord Sainsbury of Turville on 20 October 1997 for the first and only time since the General Election. We had a wide-ranging discussion on a number of issues relating to the policy areas of my Department. In particular, the meeting covered rail freight, lorry weights, mixed-use housing and retail developments and the speed and consistency of the planning process generally.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions by how much the interest rate bill of local authorities rises for each 1 per cent. rise in interest rates. [16861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I estimate that English local authorities currently hold about &#163;5 billion in variable rate debt, on which additional interest payments of &#163;50 million would arise if interest rates rose by 1 per cent. generally.
<P>

<a name="71124w04.html_para2">Further, if authorities borrow an additional &#163;2 billion in 1997-98, broadly in line with the issue of new credit approvals, then a 1 per cent. rise in interest rates would increase interest payments on this new borrowing by about &#163;20 million.
<P>

<a name="71124w04.html_para3">Local authorities currently hold around &#163;10 billion in bank deposits and other short-term investments and might therefore earn additional interest of up to &#163;100 million, if rates rose by 1 per cent.
<P>

<a name="71124w04.html_para4">However, the additional costs or income arising from the increase in interest rates would tend to be offset over time by compensating changes in HRA subsidy and Revenue Support Grant paid to local authorities by central government.

 Maps of acid deposition in the UK based on work carried out for my Department have recently been published in reports by the Review Group on Acid Rain and the Critical Loads Advisory Group. Copies have been deposited in the House of Commons Library.
<P>

<a name="71124w04.html_para5">Research into the sensitivity of trees to acid deposition is being carried out both in the UK and elsewhere in Europe. From the research, maps of the sensitivity of forest ecosystems to acid deposition have been developed on a UK and European scale. The areas of the UK forest at risk of damage can be identified by combining the maps of sensitivity and acid deposition.
<P>

<a name="71124w04.html_para6">In addition, surveys of woodland tree condition in the UK are carried out annually. While these do not assess directly the impact of acid rain, the have provided evidence that, during the past few years, the previous decline in tree health has been reversed.
<P>

<a name="71124w04.html_para7">Acid rain and damage to sensitive ecosystems including trees is an on-going transboundary problem. The UK was one of the first countries to ratify the Second Sulphur Protocol under the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution. This commits the UK to an 80 per cent. reduction in its 1980 sulphur emissions by 2010. My Department is currently taking an active part in negotiations in the EU and UNECE aiming to provide further protection to the environment from acid deposition.

The first draft of the Code has recently been prepared for the Marine Safety Agency (MSA) by the Sea Fish Industry Authority. The MSA is convening an early meeting of the Fishing Industry Safety Group's Technical Sub Group to discuss the draft Code and to consider its further development.
<BR>
Publication of the Code, which will provide guidance on the regulations which implement the Framework Directive on the introduction of measures to encourage improvements in the safety and health of workers at work and associated daughter directives, is dependent on progress on its development and on consultation with the fishing industry. We aim to introduce the regulations to implement the Directive early in 1998 and, subject to completion of the Code, to bring them into force by 31 March 1998.

 My right hon. Friend has no such plans. Members of the Committee of the Regions are appointed by the Council of Ministers of the European Union following nominations by member states. Under the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993 United Kingdom members of the Committee must be elected members of a local authority at the time of their nomination. Any change to the method of appointment, including the direct election of members, would require a Treaty amendment agreed by all European Union member states acting unanimously.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made on his Thames 2000 river transport initiative. [17708]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that excellent progress has been made as a result of my Thames 2000 initiative on proposals to establish new passenger transport services on the River Thames by the Millennium, and to leave a permanent legacy thereafter.
<P>

<a name="71124w06.html_para0">Today I can announce three new developments which, taken together, should provide the blueprint for securing a new future for passenger transport on the Thames, which I believe is an important ingredient in developing a modern, integrated transport system for the capital. As well as providing an important access route to the Millennium Experience, the aim is to secure a lasting legacy of new investment and high-quality services, which will provide a convenient and attractive new means of travel for Londoners and for visitors.
<P>

<a name="71124w06.html_para1">The initiative has been taken forward at my request by the Cross River Partnership, which includes the London Boroughs of Southwark and Lambeth, the Cities of Westminster and London, the Port of London Authority, London Transport and others, in collaboration with the New Millennium Experience Company and the Government Office for London.
<P>

<a name="71124w06.html_para2">First, the Cross River Partnership and the New Millennium Experience Company have formally invited a shortlist of potential operators to tender to run new River services. Some of these would serve the Millennium Experience, with direct services from dedicated central London piers and downstream "park-and-sail" sites, as well as a shuttle service to Greenwich. Operators are also being invited to tender for longer-term services, including a "hopper" service linking key central London destinations, and "express" services to central London from both up-stream and down-stream. Potential operators may bid for any or all of these services.
<P>

<a name="71124w06.html_para3">Second, the Partnership has drawn up a programme of new infrastructure works along the River. This will provide high-quality new piers at key locations, including close to Waterloo and Blackfriars Stations. It will also secure the much-needed improvement of some existing piers, and improved linkages with other public transport 



<P>
<P><I>24 Nov 1997 : Column: 376</I><P>
modes. The Partnership has sought funding from the Millennium Commission for this project. Matching funding will come from a variety of sources, including local authorities, the PLA, the Single Regeneration Budget and the private sector. The New Millennium Experience Company is also developing new piers on the Greenwich peninsula and downstream.
<P>

<a name="71124w06.html_para4">Finally, we have been working with members of the Partnership to develop new arrangements for managing piers and passenger services on the Thames. Our intention is that a new agency should be set up with responsibility for managing piers and for promoting and co-ordinating river passenger services in London. This agency would in due course come under the aegis of the new London Transport Authority proposed in the "New Leadership for London" Green Paper as part of the plans for a new Greater London Authority. In the interim a shadow agency will be set up under London Transport to commission the new river services and manage piers.

<P>

<a name="71124w06.html_para5">In making appointments to the Board of the Housing Corporation, candidates are sought who, in addition to their individual areas of expertise and knowledge, are able to take a broad view of housing policy and related issues. Candidates should be able to contribute usefully in directing a major Non Departmental Public Body and to make constructive contributions to the development of social housing policy at the national level. The Board needs members with a range of skills and expertise extending from knowledge of finance and regulation to an understanding of how housing policy impacts on other areas of social welfare.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will publish the results of the monitoring conducted by his Department into the effects on waiting times of the last increase in the small-claims limit. [17456] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The last increase in the small claims limit was made on 6 January 1996 and, as the monitoring of waiting times was introduced that year, the information requested could only be provided at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w06.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Burnett: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to increase the resources of the small claims court to ensure that the proposal to raise the small claims limit from April 1999 does not result in increased delays. [17408]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The proposed increase in the small claims limit must be considered along with the other civil justice reform proposals. Resources will be allocated to reflect changes in workload consequent upon implementation of the reforms as a whole.

We believe it is, as the Prime Minister said in May, a reasonable basis for negotiation. The development under this Government of a wider constitutional reform programme, including our commitment to devolution elsewhere in the United Kingdom and to better protection of human rights through incorporation of the ECHR, may also have helpful implications for an agreed outcome to the current negotiations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what measures he has proposed for the NHS to ensure that the interests of pensioners are not overlooked, with particular reference to <i>(a)</i> hip and other joint operations and <i>(b)</i> bed blocking. [16105]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 While the National Health Service in Wales does not discriminate against pensioners, who receive access to services on the same basis as other patients, I am keen that the interests of elderly people are not overlooked. I stressed the point when announcing recently the provision of an extra &#163;9.5 million this year for the NHS in Wales. Whilst I urged the Service to use the money to improve their emergency services, reduce the need for people to be admitted to hospital and reduce delays in discharging patients, I stressed that Trusts must not forget their elective surgery obligations.
<P>

<a name="71124w07.html_para0">The Patient's Charter guarantees that
"a patient will receive a hip or knee or a cataract operation within 18 months of being referred to their doctor".
However, this guarantee embraces the total patient population and does not target any one group. Latest figures provided by Health Authorities show that there were 35 breaches to this guarantee during the last quarter--this is an improvement from the June quarter when there were 85 breaches. As yet we do not know where the breaches lie, but this will be thoroughly investigated.

<UL>(2) what was the total cost incurred by the Sports Council in making representations to the public inquiry into the proposed speed limit on Lake Windermere. [14605]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The then GB Sports Council (GBSC) consulted a wide range of sports interests groups before deciding to support the opponents of the proposed speed limit upon Lake Windermere. Anglers and walkers organisations included:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
Salmon and Trout Association;
<BR>
Furness and South Cumbria Fisheries Consultative Association;
<BR>
Northern Federation of Sea Angling Societies;
<BR>
Fly Dresser' Guild;
<BR>
Ramblers Association; and
<BR>
Northumberland Long Distance Walkers' Association.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="71124w07.html_para1">In 1996-97, the GBSC and its successor, the English Sports Council (ESC) spent &#163;7,200 on the Lake Windermere speed limit issue. In 1997-98 to date, the ESC has spent &#163;4,600. Information on GBSC spending in previous years could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="71124w07.html_para2">The Lake District National Park Authority successfully appealed to the High Court to have the original decision not to introduce a speed limit quashed. A hearing took place on 18 November at which the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions did not oppose the Authority's legal challenge. He is now required to re-consider the whole issue afresh and a further round of representations is necessary.

<a name="71124w10.html_para0">Projected funding for next financial year: The allocation of funds for the next financial year will be determined as part of the MOD's long term costing, which is the process by which the Department recosts and adjusts its internal plans. The Department's internal plans represent projections and assumptions, which inform advice to Ministers on the affordability of particular elements of the defence programme and it has been the policy of successive Governments not to publish detailed information arising from this. Accordingly, I am withholding the information requested in the third part of the question which constitutes internal discussion and advice, under exemption 2 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government information.
 <i>Minister's Statement</i>: In February 1997, when in opposition, I addressed the Royal United Services Institute. When considering the question of re-fostering links between military and civilian society I made the following comments in respect of cadet forces:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
" . . . cadet forces are, in my view, perhaps the most under-utilised of all in reaching their true potential of civil utility, particularly in offering opportunities for self-development, initiative, character building and leadership qualities among our young people, many of whom are forced by circumstances into blind alleys".
 Whilst it would be inappropriate to comment upon future funding levels whilst the Strategic Defence Review work progresses, I can confirm that the Government's commitment to cadet forces, as a major national youth organisation, remains undiminished. Their value both to the civilian community and to our Regular and Reserve Forces is acknowledged, and they will receive our continued support.

 The breakdown of the educational background of all presently serving officers in the Armed Forces is not readily available. However, figures are available regarding the educational background of those more recently joining the Armed Forces for direct entry officer training. The latest figures from the three officer training establishments show that 80 per cent. of those joining Britannia Royal Navy College in Dartmouth, 45 per cent. of those entering the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, and 82 per cent. of those entering RAF Cranwell come from State schools.

<P>
<a name="71124w10.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Reid </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 November 1997]:</i> No period of notice was specified. The arrangements were to facilitate the commitment of US funding and did not constitute any form of lease. As with all sites that are made available to the United States Visiting Forces, termination of occupation would be a matter for the Governments of the United Kingdom and United States under arrangements that exist for our mutual defence.

We remain committed to the goal of nuclear disarmament and continue to hold the International Court of Justice in high regard. We have said that we will press for multilateral negotiations towards mutual, balanced and verifiable reductions in nuclear weapons and, when satisfied with progress, will ensure that British nuclear weapons are included in multilateral negotiations.

 Enlargement of the European Union is a priority for us. It will fulfil Europe's historic destiny and will enhance security and stability. Enlargement must remain an all-inclusive process.
We broadly agree with the European Commission's recommendations on the applicants' readiness for membership based on the criteria laid down by the Copenhagen and Madrid European Councils of June 1993 and December 1995 respectively. Generally speaking, these criteria require the new Member States to be able to take on the obligations of membership. Membership of the Western European Union is not such an obligation.
The criteria agreed by WEU Member States at Maastricht in 1991 established the eligibility of countries for different categories of WEU membership as and when they assume membership of NATO, the EU or both. The UK will welcome applications for these respective categories from new NATO and EU Members States should they choose to apply.

<P>

<a name="71124w14.html_para5">The report concludes that all the past dumpings which were identified during the searches of records would give rise to doses well within the International Commission on Radiological Protection's recommended dose limit for members of the public. Moreover, in all cases except one, the report states that the calculated doses were at a level considered trivial in radiological protection terms. Only in relation to the disposals in Liverpool Bay area were peak critical group doses estimated to have been above the 'trivial' level, and even these were well within the recommended dose limit. The NRPB conclude that, since estimated doses from the dispersion of radionuclides in marine waters are not significant in radiological protection terms, there is no need for additional environmental monitoring in connection with the disposals.
<P>

<a name="71124w14.html_para6">The NRPB consider that the only eventuality which could give rise to a significant calculated dose is if one of the two anti-static devices dumped off the Isle of Arran in 1958 were to be washed ashore or trawled up and handled by a member of the public. They conclude that the likelihood of this situation occurring is extremely low but advise that it may nevertheless be prudent to ensure 



<P>
<P><I>24 Nov 1997 : Column: 410</I><P>
that trawlermen and organisations responsible for dealing with material washed up on beaches are made aware of the possibility and advised to seek expert assistance if there is reason to suspect that one of these sources has appeared.

<a name="71124w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Since the European Commission's proposed Directive is substantially consistent with current United Kingdom legislation (The Patent Act 1977), no specific assessment has been made of the impact of the proposed Directive. The Patents Act has been in place throughout the development of the modern biotechnology industry in the United Kingdom, which already employs over 10,000 people, a figure forecast to rise to 14,000 over the next two years. A sound intellectual property regime is considered essential to financing support for small and medium biotechnology companies and to safeguard their contribution to improving the quality of life through developments in this technology.

The Employment Tribunals Service was established as an executive agency on 1 April 1997. The Agency spent to 31 October 1997 &#163;97,000 on publicity and advertising. We expect to spend &#163;146,000 in the current financial year. This mainly covers the cost of explanatory leaflets for the public and, where appropriate, advertisements to locate parties who we are otherwise unable to trace.

<P>
<a name="71124w17.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 The MMC found that a number of entrenched practices by suppliers and dealers of domestic electrical goods operated against the public interest by causing retail prices to be higher than they would otherwise be. I announced on 30 July 1997 my proposals to prohibit these practices, and that consumers would benefit from lower prices through stronger competition and more choice of retail outlets.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement on the use of recommended retail prices in <i>(a)</i> electrical retailing and <i>(b)</i> newspaper distribution. [16576]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 In relation to electrical retailing, the MMC found various practices which encouraged retailers to adhere to recommended retail prices, and concluded that the level of retail prices was influenced by recommended retail prices, and that tackling only the associated practices would be an insufficient remedy. They therefore recommended that recommended retail prices themselves be prohibited in these markets. I accepted their recommendation in my announcement of 30 July 1997.
<P>

<a name="71124w17.html_para2">In relation to newspaper distribution the MMC, in its 1993 report, made no adverse findings against the publishers' practice of displaying newspaper cover prices, which are in effect recommended retail prices.

 It is the Department's policy, as far as practicable, to inform Parliament of major policy decisions before making announcements to the media.
<P>

<a name="71124w17.html_para3">Some announcements are market sensitive, and there is a need to ensure that the information reaches the market in an orderly fashion. The contents of MMC monopoly and merger reports and my decisions on them are, for example, market sensitive. My normal practice is to announce my decision to the market at the same time as the report is published and laid in Parliament.

 I have seen the press report to which the hon. Member refers. The report was speculative, and inaccurate in a number of respects.

 All civil nuclear material in the UK, including plutonium, is subject to Euratom safeguards and to the terms of the tripartite UK/Euratom/IAEA safeguards agreement. These require the regular provision of information by nuclear operators to the Euratom Safeguards Directorate. The UK's plutonium stocks, along with other civil nuclear material in the UK, are also subject to inspection by safeguards inspectors. Details of the reporting and associated procedures are set out in Commission Regulation (Euratom) No. 3227/76. I have placed copies of the Regulation in the library of the House.

 UK deep-mined and opencast coal output in 1997 are likely to be about 31 million tonnes and 17 million tonnes respectively. The previous administration published energy projections for the UK as Energy Paper 65 in March 1995 which is available in the libraries of the House indicated that coal burn in 2000 was likely to fall within the range 14.6 to 23.7 million tonnes of oil equivalent.

<P>
<a name="71124w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 From 1 September 1996, the registration period for both adult continuing care and child capitation was harmonised to provide patients with a period of continuing dental care for 15 months following each course of treatment. The most recent estimate is that registration numbers may gradually fall by about 4 million as a result of this change. However, the actual effect on the number of patients registered with a dentist will depend on the response to the incentive for many patients to attend the dentist on a more regular basis.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w19.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of fluoridation of water supplies rests not on the results of a few studies but on the assessments of the very extensive, relevant published scientific literature on the effects of fluoride (including human exposure to fluoride present naturally in drinking water), and on the results of more than half a century of fluoridation. No serious side effects have been identified from fluoridating water by one part of fluoride per million parts of water (the optimum level), but we continue to monitor and evaluate the progress of the programme.

 After considering the issue of sponsorship in great depth, the Government have proposed excluding formula one from the scope of the proposed EU Directive on tobacco advertising and sponsorship which is currently being negotiated. The Government have always made it clear that it is pursuing twin objectives of reducing smoking and of safeguarding sport from any effects arising from the loss of tobacco sponsorship. The fact is that a blanket Europe-wide ban on formula one 



<P>
<P><I>24 Nov 1997 : Column: 425</I><P>
sponsorship would mean not only fewer grand prix in Europe but, perversely, more tobacco advertising on our TV screens beamed in from events from outside the European Union.

<P>
<P>

 With effect from April 1998, health authorities will be able, under amendments to the National Health Service (General Medical Services) Regulations 1992, to give general practitioners financial incentives beyond those set out in the Statement of Fees and Allowances to enhance the provision of local general medical services. Subject to local priorities which the health authority will determine, this may include the provision of specified general medical services tailored to the needs of those living in nursing and residential homes.

 There is no clear pattern in the overall incidence of cancers when comparing the north and south of England. Stomach, lung and cervical cancers are registered more frequently in the north of England than the south, but female breast cancer and malignant melanoma rates are lower in the north. Death rates from all cancers combined are higher in the north of England.

 We are already consulting across the National Health Service and the clinical professions on a set of 15 provisional health authority and trust clinical indicators.

<P>
<a name="71124w19.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 We inherited record numbers of patients waiting for treatment from the previous Government. We cannot expect to turn this round overnight. Our immediate priorities are to ensure that the National Health Service deals effectively with emergencies during the winter and that by the end of next March there are no patients waiting more than 18 months for admission to hospital. We are determined to have shorter waiting lists by the end of this Parliament. The wide-ranging action plan for waiting lists and times announced by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 18 November and the considerable extra resources we have made available to the NHS for this year and next will ensure that we begin to turn the tide.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w19.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Central funding for the previous Government's waiting list initiative ran from 1987-88 to 1993-94 inclusive. Since then the money has been built into health authorities' recurrent revenue baselines and is no longer centrally earmarked for waiting list initiatives. It is for health authorities, as purchasers, to assess their population's needs and to target resources through contracts to ensure that those needs and national priorities such as waiting list and waiting time targets are met. It is also their responsibility to monitor the clinical standards and quality of care of any hospital with which they contract, whether this is an independent hospital or National Health Service trust.
<P>

<a name="71124w19.html_para5">Guidance to health authorities and general practitioner fundholders effective from April 1998 is that they should explore the scope to make maximum cost-effective use of local NHS capacity before thinking about use of private sector provision.

<P>

 Information is collected on removals from waiting lists but this does not differentiate between the various reasons, which include death. Patients may die from any one of a wide range of causes, in common with the rest of the population, while waiting for treatment and the cause may have nothing to do with the condition for which they were on a waiting list.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what criteria his Department will use to measure the savings achieved from the elimination of excess NHS bureaucracy; and by what date he expects to achieve his target for these savings. [16663]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71124w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The Government are committed to reducing National Health Service bureaucracy. As a first step, we are tackling the worst features of the internal market and reducing NHS management costs in Great Britain by &#163;100 million in 1997-98. The NHS Executive has set targets for 1997-98 with every health authority and trust in England to reduce their management costs.
<P>

<a name="71124w20.html_para0">The NHS Executive calculates the costs of managing the NHS using two measures: health authority costs; and trust management costs. Health authority costs are monitored quarterly through regional offices. Where there is significant deviation from plan, it is for the NHS Executive regional offices to negotiate recovery plans for those health authorities concerned. Trusts report their management costs in their annual accounts. It is for the regional offices to ensure that trusts are taking the necessary steps to deliver the savings by the end of the year. Current information indicates that both health authorities and trusts are on target to achieve their 1997-98 plans by the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="71124w20.html_para1">We will shortly be announcing further actions to reduce NHS bureaucracy linked to functional and structural change, as part of our plans to replace the internal market.

 The Great Britain criminal injuries compensation scheme is one of the most generous in the world. In 1996-97 it paid out over &#163;210 million to some 47,000 victims of crime.

We intend to include proposals for the Parenting Order and the establishment of Youth Offender Teams in the forthcoming Crime and Disorder Bill.

 The Sex Offenders Act 1997 requires offenders who have been convicted of sex offences against children and other serious sex offences to notify the police of their name and address and any changes to these details. The police will work with the Probation Service and other agencies to use this information to protect children and vulnerable people by alerting agencies and individuals of the presence of an offender in their area when appropriate. The Crime and Disorder Bill will also introduce provisions to allow for the extended supervision of sex offenders.

 Illegal use of a bus lane is an offence under section 36 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 and carries a maximum fine of &#163;1,000. An offence can be dealt with under the fixed penalty procedure, in which case the penalty is currently &#163;20.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about appeals to the Child Support Agency.
<BR>
I am unable to give you precisely the information that you have requested, so I have provided as much information as is available. Although appeals were received during the first year of operation, reliable information on this area of performance has only been collected since April 1994. From that date to 30 September 1997, 25,754 appeals have been received by the Agency.
<BR>
Not all appeals sent to the Agency are sent to the Independent Tribunal Service and not all of those sent to Independent Tribunal Service are heard by a tribunal. Some will be withdrawn by the appellant, others may lapse or be ruled as outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal before they are allocated a hearing.
<BR>
From April 1994 to September 1997 26,280 cases have been lodged with the Independent Tribunal Service (during the same period the agency has completed or in some way reviewed approximately 1.1 million assessments). More cases have been lodged with Independent Tribunal Services than have been recorded as received by the Agency, as this includes some cases which were received by the Agency in 1993-94. Of those cases lodged with Independent Tribunal Services 17,091 have been cleared by a hearing, 12,990 of which have been returned to the Agency for reassessment; the reassessment requested can be linked to the reason for the appeal, or may be a result of other factors which have come to light during the appeal process. This represents 49 per cent. of cases lodged with the Independent Tribunal or approximately 1 per cent. of assessments completed or reviewed during this period.
<BR>
I hope this reply is helpful.

 In addition to a &#163;100,000 British Partnership Scheme, administered by the British Embassy in San Salvador, which enables support to be provided for small local development projects, we are currently supporting the following projects through the Department for International Development (DFID) Joint Funding Scheme.

<a name="71124w25.html_para3">It is likely that additional projects in El Salvador will be supported this year through the block grant arrangement of the Joint Funding Scheme, which operates on the basis of claims in arrears. Twenty-eight CAFOD, Christian Aid and Oxfam projects in El Salvador were supported in this way last year.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the 1997 proposals for demining to be administered by the European Community Humanitarian Office in Northern Iraq. [16979]<P>

<P>
<a name="71124w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The European Community Humanitarian Office (ECHO) does not itself administer projects. It works in partnership with NGOs, UN and other international agencies that are themselves responsible for project administration.
<P>

<a name="71124w25.html_para4">In 1997 the only ECHO funded partner for demining in Iraq was the British NGO Mines Advisory Group (MAG). MAG has a contract for &#163;680,000 primarily to supply

mine detectors and other equipment such as protection jackets, helmets etc. ECHO has also provided &#163;1.5 million for medical support for land mine victims. Britain contributes about a seventh of the cost of the ECHO programme.

 There will be no separate budget allocation for mixed credit projects. In announcing the closure of the ATP scheme the White Paper on International Development also made it clear that any new mixed credit projects will be managed within agreed country programmes.

 The issue has been discussed with the Government of Zimbabwe by British Ministers and officials. We have told the Government of Zimbabwe that we cannot support the rapid programme of land acquisition that they seem to envisage. We would be willing to support a properly prepared programme of land reform as part of a partnership to eliminate poverty.
