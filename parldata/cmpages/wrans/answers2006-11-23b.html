The campaign consists of a series of posters, a website and a supporting TV Filler film. Earlier this year, the Department also ran a new cycle safety campaign aimed at teenagers with Emap magazines and TV channels, featuring a website and a comic to support it. &#145;Cycle Smart&#146;, which includes a comic, website and posters, is aimed at younger children and uses Disney characters to communicate simple cycle safety messages.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_50"><a name="61123w0003.htm_para5"><a name="06112375000217">Firstly, the implementation of the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive provides a significant opportunity to modernise and simplify the UK&#146;s consumer law framework. We are still considering how to implement the Directive, but one option is to provide access to civil and criminal investigative powers for almost all breaches of the Directive. Given that the Directive contains important provisions that are new to UK law, this would effectively extend Trading Standards&#146; existing powers. We are also considering placing a duty to enforce on Trading Standards and the OFT in order to ensure effective enforcement of the Directive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_51"><a name="61123w0003.htm_para6"><a name="06112375000218">Secondly, the Consumer Protection Co-operation regulation will provide enforcers, including Trading Standards departments, with a new power of on-site inspection to investigate civil infringements of consumer law. In addition, the regulation formalises co-operation arrangements on the enforcement of intra-Community laws that protect consumers&#146; interests. It will therefore place a legal requirement on enforcers to provide mutual assistance for the exchange of information and co-operation on cross-border cases.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_52"><a name="61123w0003.htm_para7"><a name="06112375000219">In addition, the Government will be establishing the Local Better Regulation Office which will work in partnership with Trading Standards to reduce administrative burdens on business.</p>

The process will include the main users and producers of cluster munitions and is an essential preliminary step towards any negotiations on a new and legally binding protocol which could restrict the manufacture, stockpiling, use and transfer of those cluster munitions which are of greatest humanitarian concern.</p>

Six of the 24 destroyed bridges have been fully repaired and detours have been built around all other bridge locations. DFID provided six temporary bridges to the Lebanese authorities to help improve humanitarian access. 68 per cent. (1.7 million cubic metres) of rubble has been cleared.

2. The impact on council tax benefit was estimated using the Policy Simulation Model of the Department for Work and Pensions. This uses data from the 2004-05 Family Resources Survey up-rated to 2006-07 prices, benefit rates and earnings levels, and is calibrated to latest published forecasts and policies. Results are subject to sampling and reporting errors and estimation assumptions, and are therefore indicative only. No behavioural changes are assumed.<br>

However, a number of factors including: the extension of the role of a firefighter&#146;s to cover, for example, fire safety; improved personal protective equipment and clothing; a better understanding of risk management; and good occupational health services, a normal retirement age of 60 is now justified as a firefighter&#146;s life expectancy is now the same as the wider population.</p>

The postcode of the Dental Practice was used to allocate dentists to specific geographic areas. PCT &amp; SHA areas have been defined using the Office for National Statistics All Fields Postcode Directory.<br>
Dentists consist of principals, assistants and trainees. Information on NHS dentistry in the community dental service, in hospitals and in prisons are excluded.<br>
The data in this report are based on NHS dentists on PCT lists. These details were passed on to the BSA who paid dentists based on activity undertaken. A dentist can provide as little or as much NHS treatment as he or she chooses or has agreed with the PCT. In some cases an NHS dentist may appear on a PCT list but not perform any NHS work in that period.<br>
Most NHS dentists do some private work. The data does not take into account the proportion of NHS work undertaken by dentists.<br>
PDS schemes had varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with corresponding GDS data, PDS registrations are estimated using "proxy registrations", namely the number of patients seen by PDS practices in the previous 15 months. PDS proxy registrations were not estimated for periods before September 2003 - actual registrations were used before this date.<br>
Data for 2003 and earlier do not include those PDS schemes that do not have any registrations (e.g. dental access centres), and is therefore not directly comparable with later data.<br>
The boundaries used are as at 31 March 2006. Source: The Information Centre for health and social care NHS Business Services Authority (BSA)<br>

The previous NHS Act 1977 used the terms necessary or desirable. The same terminology was originally adopted in the drafts of the new NHS Act published on the Department&#146;s website in February and May 2006.</p>

The development of new drugs and medical and veterinary technologies is still dependent on the information and insights derived from the well designed, properly conducted and carefully regulated use of animals, including primates. There is no immediate prospect of an end to the use of primates while the benefits to humans, animals and the environment outweigh the costs to the animals involved and until there are suitable alternatives available.</p>

Such a ban would also raise potentially complex legal issues with respect to World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules and European Community Law. The importation of non-human primates is an issue where the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is the lead Government Department. The controls in the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 relate only to the use of such animals.</p>

However, I can confirm that during 2005 and 2006 the Animals Scientific Procedures Inspectorate (ASPI) visited four overseas non-human primate breeding or supplying centres in the Netherlands, Vietnam and China.</p>

To this end, the UK has committed &#163;2.5 million to provide the Government of Lebanon with security sector assistance to allow it to exercise full control of its territory. As part of this the UK is in the process of giving 50 Land Rovers to the Lebanese armed forces. We also called on the international community to take immediate steps to extend its financial and humanitarian assistance to the Lebanese people. We are also working closely with other international partners on co-ordinating security assistance. The UK has contributed &#163;22.3 million in humanitarian and reconstruction assistance.</p>

The fundamental purpose of NATO&#146;s nuclear forces is political: to preserve peace and prevent coercion. Since the height of the cold war NATO has reduced the number of sub-strategic nuclear weapons in Europe by over 95 per cent. The remaining US nuclear weapons based in Europe are in the sole possession and under constant and complete custody and control of the United States. These arrangements for basing US nuclear weapons in Europe are fully compatible with the Non-Proliferation Treaty.</p>
