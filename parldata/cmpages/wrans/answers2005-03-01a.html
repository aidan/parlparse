<p><a name="qn_0"><a name="50301w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office whether years spent in the Civil Service Pension Scheme up to 2013 will continue to attract pension rights based on the final salary of the employee on their retirement at age 65 years following the proposed changes to the scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [218185]</p>








<p><a name="st_0"><a name="50301w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The Cabinet Office&#039;s consultation document, Building a sustainable future&quot;, proposes that pension rights earned before April 2013 by staff in post on 5 April 2006 will continue to be calculated by reference to a pension age of 60 and their final salary whenever they choose to retire or leave service.


</p>







<p><a name="qn_1"><a name="50301w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what assessment he has made of the effect that the changes to the Civil Service Pension Scheme retirement age will have on serving prison officers who may become unable to carry out their prison work beyond the age of 60 years due to physical incapacity; and if he will make a statement.  [218186]</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50301w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The Cabinet Office&#039;s consultation document, Building a sustainable future&quot;, proposes that the new pension arrangements will, as now, include provisions for members who have to retire before pension age because of ill health or physical incapacity. The document also recognises that the physically-demanding nature of some members&#039; jobs may not be compatible with a pension age of 65. Officials are discussing with employers of civil servants in physically-demanding occupations (including the prison services) the most appropriate way to handle these groups.


</p>







<p><a name="qn_2"><a name="50301w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </b> 
 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office what estimate he has made of the number of people who transferred pension rights from the armed forces to the Prison Service who will work for a number of years at the end of their careers without building up any further pension rights; and if he will make a statement.  [218188]</p>








<p><a name="st_2"><a name="50301w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 No assessment of the number of people who transferred pension rights from the armed forces to the Prison Service has been made. The Cabinet Office&#039;s consultation document, Building a sustainable future&quot;, addresses the issue of restrictions on benefits and asks whether we should allow members to build up their pension without limiting them to 40 years&#039; service.

 To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office how many serving <i>(a)</i> prison officers and <i>(b)</i> other civil servants will be affected by the changes to the Civil Service Pension Scheme.  [218189]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Mar 2005 : Column 1016W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="st_3"><a name="50301w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The Cabinet Office&#039;s consultation document, Building a sustainable future&quot;, proposes that the main changes to the Civil Service Pension arrangements should apply to existing staff from 1 April 2013, but that some changes might apply before then. As at 31 March 2004, there were 617,000 members of the scheme, of which some 27,000 are prison officers. The Scheme Actuary estimates that, of those members who are likely to be in post on 5 April 2006, 420,000 will still be in service in April 2013.

 Despite large increases in Government funding&#151;up from &#163;312 million in 1997&#150;98 to &#163;570 million in 2005&#150;06&#151;there is still not enough to fund all worthwhile proposals from the flood and coastal defence operating authorities (the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards). Defra therefore operates an objective and published priority scoring system which is intended to direct our finite funds to best effect nationally, to maximise the benefit obtained from the programme as a whole.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w06.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_47">The current scoring system was introduced in 2003 after extensive consultation following a pilot introduced in 1997. In summary, proposed projects are scored on three elements&#151;their estimated economic benefits, the number of people they are likely to protect and protection and enhancement of environmental and/or heritage assets. All three are compared to cost so that projects are treated fairly regardless of size. The higher the score, the higher the priority.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w06.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_48">In order to be eligible for funding from Defra, projects must achieve Defra&#039;s published threshold score for the year in which they start. The threshold scores were last revised in November 2004 to take account of changes in operating authorities&#039; investment plans. Because of an increased demand for grant nationally, the thresholds had to rise and are now 19 for projects to start in 2005&#150;06 or 2006&#150;07 and 15 in 2007 08.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w06.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_49">The scoring system has no effect on the overall sum available for grant aid. It does not attempt to allocate funding to projects in an absolute sense but simply to rank proposals in a relative priority order. Defra is then able to allocate its funding to projects in priority order. The actual threshold score which a project must achieve will depend on available funding compared to need nationally. The thresholds are set by analysis of forward plans provided to Defra by operating authorities each year&#151;proposals for funding are compared with available funds and I set the lowest threshold that can be afforded for the following financial year, together with indicative estimates of the likely thresholds for the following two years. The latter are reviewed a year later in the light of updated authorities&#039; plans.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w06.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_50">The threshold is the same for all projects and is applied broadly equally to all operating authorities.

<a name="stpa_79">The Government has concluded that SFI&#039;s forest management standards and chain of custody system do meet the Government&#039;s contract criteria for assurance of legal harvesting but do not provide the required assurance of Sustainable forest management. The issue for the Government is not with SFI&#039;s forest management standards, which were found to be adequate, but with the chain of custody system which does not enable the consumer to determine the percentage of certified timber in the finished product. The Government could accept a combination of an SFI certificate and additional verification of the certified timber element but, as matters stand, a certificate alone would not suffice. Action to Implement this assessment will be effective from May 2005.

<p><a name="st_67"><a name="50301w08.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Defra&#039;s priority is to maximise the protection of people and assets in relation to the funding available. While there is no bias in the priority score system against rural projects, it is however true that projects are less likely to go ahead in sparsely populated areas as these will tend to score less highly than projects which protect larger numbers of people or higher asset values for a given cost. Most of the components making up the priority score of a given project are compared to cost so the crucial measurement is on benefits per unit cost and not on the absolute benefits of proposals. This ensures smaller projects are considered on an equal footing to larger ones.

 Upon accession to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) in 1991, South Africa submitted an initial report providing a full inventory of its nuclear materials. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) conducted a number of inspections to verify the completeness of South Africa&#039;s report. They concluded that there was no evidence that the inventory was incomplete.

<a name="stpa_107">In 1993, however, the then South African Prime Minister F. W. de Klerk revealed that South Africa had been pursuing a nuclear weapons programme in the 1970s and 1980s, but that this programme had been abandoned in 1989. A team of IAEA technical experts travelled to South Africa in April 1993 to assess whether South Africa had indeed abandoned its programme. They found nothing that was inconsistent with South Africa&#039;s declaration.

 As at 16.00 on 23 February, we have confirmed that 65 British nationals died in the tsunami. Of those, 35 have been repatriated to the UK.

 We are aware that delays in identifying victims adds to the distress of the families concerned.

More details of the process can be found on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website, www.fco.gov.uk/tsunami.

<a name="50301w11.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_109">The police have considered the merits of the three main ways in which bodies may be identified. Dental records, fingerprints and DNA may each be of value, either separately or in conjunction. The approach is decided on a case-by-case basis, because the precise value of each method depends on factors such as the condition of the body and the availability of ante mortem data. Most matches so far have been based on dental records.

 To date DFID has not directly funded any research into the development of malaria vaccines. However, the Chancellor, Gordon Brown, recently announced that the Government are ready to work with other governments to enter into agreements to purchase malaria vaccine in advance in order to ensure a secure market. This funding mechanism, known as the Advanced Purchase Commitment (APC), will aim to attract private investment into vaccine development and production. The Treasury estimates that an APC for malaria would cost the UK &#163;48 million per year giving a total of &#163;288 million over the next six years.

 Since 2001, there have been three occasions, including the current Indian Ocean disaster, that DFID has requested the Ministry of Defence&#039;s assistance to provide relief to countries affected by disasters. In 2001 following the Gujarat earthquake, DFID refunded &#163;98,000 to the MOD for the transportation of UK search and rescue teams to the disaster site. In 2004, following hurricanes Ivan and Jeanne, DFID refunded &#163;13,000 to the MOD for the replacement of relief items held on the naval task force that were provided, at DFID&#039;s request, to the affected countries. The marginal costs of MOD assistance in support of the humanitarian relief effort in response to the Indian Ocean earthquake-Tsunami is estimated at about &#163;2.5 million.

 To date, no single route has been served by both a military and a civilian plane on DFID&#039;s behalf. Calculations of costs per task are based upon the flying time between the two locations. There are other variables such as airport handling charges but these would be common to both military and civilian charter or repositioning costs. In comparing costs of military and civilian aircraft carrying out similar tasks with the same payload, the best comparator is the rate charged per flying hour. For the C-17, tasked by DFID to transport relief items to countries affected by the Indian Ocean disaster, the MOD quoted an hourly flying rate of approximately &#163;1,975.

<p>
<a name="50301w16.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_142">These centres will reach 4,731 children under five resident in the areas. 176 new child care places will mean that 469 full-time child care places are available within the eight areas. Gloucestershire have been given indicative allocations of &#163;1 million for capital development and &#163;355,000 of revenue funding for the development of these children&#039;s centres.

<i>[holding answer 28 February 2005]:</i> The rights of general practitioners (GPs) partners in partnership agreements to paid sickness leave is a matter for their partnership agreement. For GPs who are salaried, employed either by general medical service contractors or primary care trusts, their entitlement to sick pay should reflect that available to hospital doctors. Under other forms of primary medical contracts, e.g. personal medical services or alternative provider medical services this will be a matter for locally agreed contracts.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first&quot; period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

3. University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust was formed on 1 April 2000 following the merger of Leicester General Hospital NHS Trust, Leicester Royal Infirmary NHS Trust, and Glenfield Hospital NHS Trust. Leicestershire Mental Health Service NHS Trust was established in 1993 and dissolved in April 1999. Fosse Health, Leicestershire Community NHS Trust was established in1994 and dissolved in April 1999. Leicestershire and Rutland Healthcare NHS Trust was established 1 January 1999. The new trust replaced the Leicestershire Mental Health Service and the Fosse Health, Leicestershire Community NHS Trusts. Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust was established in April 2002. The new trust came into being when it changed its name from Leicestershire and Rutland Healthcare NHS Trust to Leicestershire Partnership NHS Trust.<br>

 The letter in question was sent to all the chairs of Fire and Rescue Authorities (FRAs) in England.

<a name="stpa_268">An internal investigation showed that the version of the Outline Business Case (OBC) that was acquired by the FBU was the same as that circulated in confidence to Fire and Rescue Authority chairs. Forensic analysis showed that at some point between it being sent out to FRAs and the FBU placing it on their website it was electronically manipulated by a technically competent person. That analysis also showed that it was not leaked by anyone at headquarters.

<p><a name="st_302"><a name="50301w34.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The 14 Civil Contingency Reaction Forces (CCRFs) are based on the 14 TA infantry battalions spread across the country and, should the need arise, would be manned by members of the Volunteer Reserve Forces, albeit mainly the Territorial Army. A list of qualified volunteers up to a maximum of 500 per CCRF is maintained by each CCRF Headquarters in order that they can respond at short notice to a crisis. But CCRF volunteers are not permanently employed by the armed forces, nor are they held at permanent readiness.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_301">It is, however, a fundamental principle that volunteers for the CCRFs agree to be mobilised at relatively short notice. We expect to be able to deploy a CCRF within 24 hours should the need arise, although this may be tempered by the need for additional training depending upon the nature of the crisis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_302">The list of CCRF volunteers is dynamic and reflects the availability of individuals as their personal circumstances change. When an individual becomes unavailable, whether through operational deployment or any other change in circumstances, they cease to be a member of the CCRF and another volunteer is brought forward to replace them. In this way the CCRF capability is maintained.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_303">Volunteers receive five days training per year, in addition to their normal reservist training. Details of individual training activities are not held centrally, but in general the additional days are used to ensure familiarisation and integration with the local authorities and the emergency services and to ensure that the procedures for mobilisation are well practised.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50301w34.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_304">It should be borne in mind that the CCRFs are neither an automatic nor the only option to respond to a request from the civil authorities for military assistance. Regional commanders will identify the best choice from all available units, regular or reserve, depending on the nature and urgency of the request.
