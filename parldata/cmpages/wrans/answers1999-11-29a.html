To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list (i) the original in-service date, (ii) the current in-service date, (iii) the estimated and actual costs, (iv) the years of expected peak expenditure and (v) the prime contractor for all the endorsed staff requirements. [98583]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the use of equipment supplied to Indonesia's armed forces by United Kingdom suppliers; and if he will make a statement. [99297]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 We are in regular contact with our Embassy in Jakarta about the use of such equipment. We have made it clear to Indonesia that UK-supplied defence equipment should not be used in East Timor or against civilians in violation of human rights standards.

<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many targets have been agreed between his Department and (i) local authorities and (ii) other bodies apart from his own agencies and non-departmental bodies since May 1997.  [99478]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 November 1999]:</i> With the exception of the Public Service Agreement with HM Treasury my Department has no targets agreed with other bodies at the Departmental level. However the Public Service Agreement is consistent with the wider goals of the Government. At a lower level some elements of the Department and the Armed Forces will share goals with outside bodies. It would not be possible to provide a comprehensive list of such shared goals without disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what date the tender documents for the site at the Old Ranges, Shoeburyness, have to be lodged with Donaldsons of 70 Jermyn Street, London SW1; and when the tender documents will be available to possible bidders.  [100055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The sales brochure specified that the extra site would be sold by means of Best Offer bids, and that proposals should be received by 12 noon on Friday 10 December 1999, at the agents, Donaldsons, 70 Jermyn street, London. Donaldsons wrote to all prospective purchasers on 24 November 1999, explaining the basis upon which offers should be made. There is no requirement for formal tender documentation given that the site is not being sold by Formal Tender.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Stinchcombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the impact of the Army Terms of Service (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1999 on the ability of young people in the armed forces to leave after enlistment; and what is the minimum period of service for which such young persons will have to enlist.  [100193]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 All recruits to non-commissioned service in the Army enter on an Open Engagement of 22 years reckonable service from age 18 or the date of joining, whichever is the later. The Army Terms of Service (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1999, which came into effect on 1 November 1999, increased the minimum commitment period for newly recruited soldiers from three to four years. Those enlisted after this date will, therefore, serve for an additional year before they have the right to discharge to the reserve.
<P>

<a name="91129w01.html_para0">The Army Terms of Service (Amendment) (No. 2) Regulations 1999 have no effect on the statutory right to discharge provisions. A recruit under the age of 18 can leave the Army free as of right within the first six months of service (having served at least 28 days and having given 14 days notice); for those aged over 18, the statutory right to discharge ends three months after joining for duty.
<P>

<a name="91129w01.html_para1">New recruits who do not exercise this right are committed to serve for four years from their 18th birthday or 4.25 years after attestation, whichever is the later. Provision does, however, exist for personnel of any age to be discharged from the service at any time for a number of reasons, including compassionate.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence by what date war widows will be able to keep their armed forces pension on remarriage.  [99094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The payment of widows' pensions is being examined as part of the review of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme which is currently under way. We hope it will be concluded by next summer. It is not possible at this stage to comment on the outcome.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what discussions Ministers or his officials have held with the Department of Social Security in respect of war pensions for widows; and if he will make a statement. [100310]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 MOD and DSS officials have worked closely on the joint MOD-DSS review of compensation for members of the armed forces who suffer illness, injury, and death for reasons attributable to service. The MOD and DSS routinely discuss war pensions issues, including arrangements for war widows. There are also day-to-day contacts between DSS War Pensions Agency and the MOD Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency about the handling of individual cases.
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what would be the cost of war widows retaining for life attributable pensions awarded under his Department's armed forces pension scheme.  [100313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 We estimate that the cost of war widows retaining for life their attributable pensions would be between &#163;2 million and &#163;3 million per annum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will set out the current pay scales for <i>(a)</i> non-regular permanent staff staff sergeants and <i>(b)</i> MOD civil service executive officers.  [99932]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The current pay scale for a non-regular permanent staff (NRPS) staff sergeant, effective from 1 April 1999, is &#163;20,613 per annum on appointment, rising to &#163;20,723 after nine years.
<P>

<a name="91129w01.html_para2">With effect from 1 August 1999, the maximum point on the executive officer pay scale was increased from &#163;18,264 to &#163;22,727. The minimum was also increased, from &#163;11,914 to &#163;12,523.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what is the value of redundancy payments made to non-regular permanent staff replaced by Executive Officers as Territorial Army financial systems administrators; and how many NRPS FSAs over 50 years of age have been pensioned off.  [99934]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w01.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 To date there have been no redundancy payments made to non-regular permanent staff (NRPS) financial systems administrator (FSA) personnel, including those over age 50, who are being replaced by civilian Executive Officers (EOs). It is not currently possible to provide the value of redundancy payments which will be made because such payments will be determined individually and will be calculated on the basis of length of NRPS service and rate of pay on discharge.
<P>

<a name="91129w01.html_para3">The number of NRPS FSAs over the age of 50 is not held centrally, but is being collated, and I will write to the hon. Member with this detail and a copy of my letter will be placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what has been the cost of repairing and refitting the Joint Services Adventure Sail Training vessel Broadsword in the past year; and what would be the cost of purchasing an equivalent new boat.  [99931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Joint Services Adventure Sail Training vessel Broadsword completed an extensive package of work in May 1998 to extend her life for a further 15 years. The total cost of this work was &#163;256,000. Since then, the only costs incurred on Broadsword have been for repair work associated with her participation in the Transglobe Inter-Savings global yacht race, which has not yet completed. It is estimated that the repair work undertaken to-date will cost about &#163;14,000. No refit work is planned for 1999-2000. The cost of purchasing an equivalent new boat is estimated to be about &#163;700,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) for what reason Territorial Army financial systems administrators have each received substitution pay of &#163;10 per day; and what has been the total cost to his budget;  [99929]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many Territorial Army financial systems administrator posts are being civilianised; what is <i>(a)</i> the average and <i>(b)</i> the maximum number of training weeks required to train executive officers as FSAs; what is the cost of that training; what is the cost of (i) subsistence and (ii) travelling expenses per person per day for that training at Worthy Down; and whether overtime will be payable to civilianised FSAs.  [99933]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The post of Financial Systems Administrator (FSA) was civilianised with effect from 1 July 1999, and this will affect some 78 non-regular permanent staff (NRPS). The executive officer (EO) grade civil servants who will fulfil this function in future will each undergo a maximum of 18 weeks training at the School of Employment (SET) Training at Worthy Down before taking over the job fully. One additional member of staff has been temporarily employed to assist in running courses at SET at a cost of some &#163;35,000 to minimise the impact of this surge in requirement on existing courses.
<P>

<a name="91129w02.html_para0">The travel and subsistence costs for EOs attending these courses depend on an individual's circumstances. Where EOs stay in the Officers' Mess at Worthy Down, they will receive daily subsistence of &#163;5 in addition to the cost of accommodation. If they stay in a hotel, the rate is up to a maximum of &#163;25 in addition to the cost of accommodation. It is not possible to provide a meaningful figure for travelling expenses because each individual's circumstances are unique. Executive officer FSAs will be entitled to claim overtime.
<P>

<a name="91129w02.html_para1">Until such time as the executive officers take over these responsibilities, the NRPS staff sergeants who are currently filling the posts are entitled to substitution pay which equates to &#163;10 a day. In order to provide an overall cost, it would be necessary to refer to individual records and this has not been possible in the time available.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what motor mileage allowance rates his Department offers to <i>(a)</i> ministers and <i>(b)</i> civil servants using their own vehicles for official business; and what has been the cost of each in each of the last five years.  [98699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Home Office Ministers, when travelling on official business, may use a private car instead of an official car, and claim mileage allowances in the same circumstances and on the same terms as Home Office civil servants. However, all five Ministers use the Government Car Service. The vehicles available to me, while purchased by my Department, are operated by the Metropolitan Police.

<a name="91129w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 While there are powers in Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 which allow an Immigration officer to board and search an aircraft and to require the production of a passenger's documents, Immigration officers do not routinely examine passengers' travel documents prior to their leaving an aircraft. However, Immigration officers regularly attend arriving flights and check travel documents shortly after disembarkation in order to identify inadequately documented passengers. This practice has grown since the late 1980s in order to deal with the increasing number of passengers who destroy or otherwise dispose of their travel documents and tickets after departure for the United Kingdom. The procedures have been developed to establish the proof of carriage so that charges under the carriers' liability legislation can be effectively pursued and also to minimise the difficulties and costs in removing persons where the identity of the carrier and the port of embarkation cannot be established.

Under the Directive, the majority of programmes broadcast by Channel 5 must be of European origin. Channel 5 met that licence condition in 1997 and 1998. For these years, the proportions of European-originated programming transmitted by Channel 5 (other than news, sports coverage, games, advertising and teletext services which are exempted from the Directive) were 60 per cent. and 52 per cent. respectively. A high proportion of Channel 5's European-originated programming is produced in the UK.

 It is not possible to say what the impact of the levy on the agricultural industry will be. That will depend on a number of factors, including future energy consumption and what use the industry makes of electricity generated from 'new' renewable sources of energy or in 'good quality' combined heat and power plants. The use the industry makes of the proposed system of enhanced capital allowances for energy saving investments will also have an impact. In addition certain sectors of the industry will be eligible for an 80 per cent. discount on the rates of the levy if they enter into energy saving agreements with the Government. All sectors of the industry will also benefit from the lower overall rates of the levy announced by the Chancellor in his pre-Budget Report statement.

 To support and promote the UK shipbuilding industry, in July 1998 the Department established the Shipbuilding Forum whose membership comprises representatives of the shipbuilding and shiprepair industry, trades unions, equipment suppliers and customers, both private and public sector. Also involved are the National Training Organisation for the marine sector and relevant Government Departments. The Forum's terms of reference were to consider the current situation of the shipbuilding and shiprepair industry and how to improve its competitiveness so as to increase its share of the European market, leading to increased output,

profitability and employment. The Forum produced a Report (a copy of which was placed in the Library in May 1999) and a subsequent Implementation Plan containing Recommendations--more than 40--addressed to all the participants, not just to Government. The Forum believes that these Recommendations will go a long way towards improving the fortunes of the UK shipbuilding and shiprepair industry.
<P>

<a name="91129w06.html_para5">The Department has already implemented most of the Recommendations addressed to it, most of which related to improvements to the Shipbuilding Intervention Fund (SIF) and the Home Shipbuilding Credit Guarantee Scheme (HSCGS). The Department has agreed to include an element of profit in SIF calculation; has extended SIF to conversion contracts; and has extended access to SIF to a number of previously excluded yards. The HSCGS has been improved by allowing contacts offering "pure cover" and by allowing US dollar and euro financing. In addition my Department has supported financially two projects being undertaken by the Shipbuilders and Shiprepairers Association aimed at improving productivity in shipyards, both new building and repair/conversion.
<P>

<a name="91129w06.html_para6">As well as these measures we are working in the EU and the OECD to find effective international trade disciplines to tackle unfair trade practices, such as low pricing from Korea. The Industry Council achieved a positive conclusion on this issue at its meeting on 9 November, making clear the EU's determination to deal with Korean unfair pricing and agreeing further actions to this end, including re-engaging Korea in bilateral consultations and pursuing possible actions under the World Trade Organisation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the principal activities of his Department and its agencies which provide business for <i>(a)</i> Crown post offices and <i>(b)</i> other post offices; if he will assess whether the level of business generated in each case is likely to increase or decrease over the next five years; and which new areas of business for post offices are likely to be developed by his Department and its agencies over the same period.  [99554]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 By the nature of their operations and activities, this Department and its agencies do not directly provide business for Crown or other post offices and this position is not expected to change over the next five years. Currently no specific new areas of business for post offices are foreseen by this department but the targets for electronic delivery of services (50 per cent. by 2005, 100 per cent. by 2008) represent a real opportunity for additional business for the Post Office network across all public services delivered by central Government. Moreover, equivalent targets are now being set for local Government and there is an opportunity for the Post Office network to gain further business in delivery of services which are the responsibility of local Government. In addition to these Modern Government initiatives, the potential to provide a wider range of banking and other financial services through the Horizon automated system could facilitate an increase in the levels of business generated by or with Government Departments and agencies.

<P>
<a name="91129w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce Government approval of the Post Office's Strategic Plan for 1999-2004. This is a five year rolling Plan which will be updated annually. The Plan, as submitted by the Post Office Board meets the requirements set out in the Post Office White Paper (CM 4340) and represents a key element in the new arm's length relationship that the Government is now establishing with the Post Office in fulfilment of the reforms described in the White Paper. The Post Office will now be pursuing and developing their strategy and this will be reflected in the Plan for 2000-05, which the Board will be presenting to me next spring.
<P>

<a name="91129w06.html_para7">For the Post Office both to modernise and improve services to customers in this country and to develop into a significant global player in distribution markets poses tough challenges, but exciting opportunities. In an increasingly competitive market place for postal services these challenges should not be underestimated as the Post Office itself fully recognises. This means that the Post Office must successfully build on current initiatives and seize commercial opportunities as they arise in the UK and internationally.
<P>

<a name="91129w06.html_para8">The key features of the Strategic Plan are commercially confidential, and as such will not be published. However, on the basis of the Plan the Government have set a post-tax profit target of &#163;350 million for the financial year 1999-2000. This figure excludes any exceptional provisions which may be made for the Horizon automation project. As already announced, the Government have set the external financing regime (excluding adjustments for Horizon and acquisitions) as 50 per cent. of the post-tax profits for this year, and therefore, if the Post Office achieves the profit target, this equivalent of a commercial dividend will be &#163;175 million. In the unlikely event of the Post Office falling short of the profit target the minimum figure will be &#163;140 million. The Post Office will not pay dividends until it becomes a plc but in the meantime will set aside the relevant amount in its reserves.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 A number of studies have been published estimating substantial income gains to the world and the European Union from further trade liberalisation. Two recent ones are by the European Commission and the OECD. The Commission study covers agriculture, industrial tariffs and services; the OECD study does not include services. These studies do not provide separate estimates of the impact on the UK. However, on the assumption that the UK gains in line with its share of Community output and external trade, it is possible to provide a broad indication of the likely effects on the UK economy. On this basis, the European Commission and the OECD studies suggest that further trade liberalisation could bring income gains for the UK of between $8 billion and $19 billion (&#163;5 billion and &#163;11 billion) per year in terms of 1998 prices and incomes. This is equivalent to an income increase of between &#163;210 and &#163;480 per year for the average UK household. All such estimates are sensitive to assumptions made, particularly about the form, scope and scale of further liberalisation. I shall also be writing to the hon. Member with further information.

 Except in respect of a few provisions specifically to protect those under 18 the proposals seek to protect the interests of those using bureaux equally, regardless of age. The effect of the proposals to restrict fee charging to hirers in certain circumstances are assessed in the Regulatory Impact Assessment in the consultation document. Changes to the controls on fee charging to workseekers are set out in Annex 1 of the document. The proposals seek to ensure both that bureaux are able to respond to hirers' requirements promptly and that neither hirers, workers nor third parties are put at risk as a consequence of bureaux not doing necessary checks to establish the suitability of those they are supplying. Careful consideration is being given to all the representations received. I have no plans to establish a code of practice. The reasons why this approach is not considered practicable are set out in chapter 4 of the consultation document.

However, in the case of chronic bronchitis and emphysema in addition to the costs agreed for successful claims the Department has also agreed to make payments in respect of all claims on the Register (some 62,000) held by the Department's claim handlers as at 14 June 1999, whether the claimant is successful or not. These costs range from &#163;25 to &#163;100 per claim depending on the date of claim and number of claims held by the solicitor and are in recognition of client care work carried out after the Judgment and before the signing of the Agreement.

 The Right of Appeal against the refusal of visas for visits was withdrawn in 1993. There has therefore been no extra cost to UK Embassies and High Commissions over the past five years in this respect. An appeal system for family visits is to be introduced within the next 12 months.

The UK's defence in these proceedings has been handled by the Attorney-General in person, assisted by a legal team composed of officials and outside counsel.

The last meeting of the General Affairs Council on 15 November confirmed the EU's willingness to provide the Danube states and the Danube Commission with active support in their efforts to devise and implement a solution, and that it was prepared to examine an EU contribution to the clearance on the Danube on the basis of proposals to be put forward by the Danube Commission.

<a name="91129w09.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary greatly regrets these tragic deaths and sent a message of condolence to the Iranian Foreign Minister. They are another very distressing reflection of the efforts and commitment that Iran has made to combat the narcotics trade.
<P>

<a name="91129w09.html_para3">Hon. Members will recall that, in March this year, the UK donated &#163;300,000 to the United Nations International Drugs Control Programme to provide Iranian frontier personnel with 1,020 bullet proof vests. I should like to announce that, following discussions with the Iranian authorities in Tehran over the weekend, the Government are donating a further &#163;1 million to UNDCP for projects in Iran and separately giving &#163;150,000 of bilateral drugs assistance. The UNDCP programme covers training and equipment primarily to strengthen counter-narcotics work at Iran's borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan. Our proposed bilateral assistance covers training and equipment for the border with Turkey and airport controls, areas not covered by the UNDCP programme. Our overall assistance package will improve the capacity of Iranian drugs control agencies to combat the traffickers and to stop drugs entering and leaving Iran.
<P>

<a name="91129w09.html_para4">No suppliers have yet been nominated for the goods covered by this assistance package. The export from the UK of some of the goods concerned may be subject to control and an export licence might need to be granted if they are sourced from the UK.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary raised our concerns about these detentions with Foreign Minister Kharrazi during their meeting at the United Nations General Assembly on 21 September.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w11.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Action Data System (ADAS) has failed twice in the last 12 months at these stations--once at Pentland and once at Oban. At Oban the failure was caused by an engineer shutting off the power, followed by a temporary failure of the auxiliary electricity supply. On both occasions, the system was restarted within an hour.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w11.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 No experiments have been carried out to establish Coastguard response times as these are covered by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) Service Standards. The target response time for a Coastguard presence at the reported scene of an incident in the area covered by the Oban Coastguard District is 30 minutes. This is a national target response time which is reported to the MCA Headquarters monthly, and reviewed locally by Coastguard management, through regular operational readiness inspections. The expectation is that this target will be met 95 per cent. of the time, since some remote locations can cause teams to take up to an hour to arrive.

 The Action Data System, as modified for compliance for the year 2000 (ADAS 2000), is used to record data about incidents dealt with by HMCG. This system was operational at all Coastguard Stations by September 1999. The new Integrated Coastguard Communication System (ICCS) will replace the existing equipment which is nearing the end of its life. Operational roll out will start in May 2000, and finish three years later.

<P>
<a name="91129w12.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The new UK Sustainable Development Strategy, published in May this year, said that the Government wished to see high level sustainable development frameworks for each English region by the end of 2000. These frameworks will set out a regional vision for sustainable development. They will need to have the support of a wide range of stakeholders and should be agreed by Regional Chambers. Although they will not be in the lead, RDAs will be one of the key partners in the preparation of frameworks.
<P>

<a name="91129w12.html_para1">One of the tasks identified for these frameworks will be to build consensus on how the national policy and target on renewable energy will be taken forward in each region. Government Offices are initiating work to produce regional assessments and targets for renewable energy provision based on regional resource studies. The Government hope that frameworks will draw upon this work and elaborate a regional approach to renewable energy delivery, including regional targets.
<P>

<a name="91129w12.html_para2">The frameworks should take account of issues raised by the RDA strategies for sustainable development and, in turn, will inform future revisions of the RDA strategies.

 <i>[holding answer 26 November 1999]:</i> The details of transport provision over the Millennium period are primarily a matter for decisions and announcement by individual transport operators taking account of local needs and in consultation with local authorities and other relevant bodies. Many bus and rail transport providers will operate special timetables to enable members of the public to get to and from Millennium celebrations. In developing such timetables, operators have maintained close contact with police and emergency services.

<a name="91129w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 My Department keeps the operation of disabled facilities grants under regular review, to ensure that they continue to provide prompt and sympathetic treatment for all disabled people who need adaptations to their homes. The allowances in the test of resources are reviewed and uprated annually, to ensure that they reflect changes in living costs. Last year, we announced that we would increase the resources available for the grant by a quarter over the following three years, and this should enable local authorities to deal with applications more promptly. Local authorities are required by law to deal with applications as quickly as possible, and we advise them in guidance to ensure that applicants with the most pressing needs are dealt with first.

For example, the Commission may, for a purpose connected with the performance of its functions, carry out research or provide advice or information, or make proposals or give other advice to any Government agency or other public authority as to the practical application of any law.

 It is not right that some self-employed non-resident parents avoid their obligations to their children by refusing to provide details of their income to the Child Support Agency.

 We are pressing on with our pensions reforms.

This will give more help in retirement to low and moderate earners, carers and some long-term disabled people with broken work records. By 2038, everyone who has a working life of employment or caring will retire with a State Pension above the means-tested threshold.

<P>
<a name="91129w15.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The White Paper published on 1 July gave details of our plans to impose a default rate of maintenance liability. It is important that maintenance starts flowing quickly and reliably to children. Where exceptionally it is clear that there is going to be a delay in assessing maintenance, we plan to impose a default rate until the CSA has enough information to calculate the true liability.

<P>
<a name="91129w15.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Our plans for the reform of child support were published in the White Paper "Children's Rights and Parent's Responsibilities" (Cm 4349) on 1 July 1999. Legislation announced in the Queen's Speech in November 1999 will set out the detail of the reforms.
<P>

<a name="91129w15.html_para1">Section 6(1) of the 1991 Act provides that parents with care on Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance can be required to apply for child support. Our plans to change this provision were set out in Chapter 4 of the White Paper. Currently, child support arrangements cannot be made unless a parent specifically applies for maintenance. While every effort is made to ensure parents with care are not put at risk by the child support process, this rule can actually increase the risk that parents face. This is because when non-resident parents receive notification that the parent with care had applied for child support, some feel that they have been 'shopped' to the Department of Social Security.
<P>

<a name="91129w15.html_para2">Under the new scheme, it is planned that a separate application for maintenance will not be required for parents with care on benefit. Claiming Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance will be enough to start the child support process, unless a parent with care specifically asks us not to pursue maintenance. A parent with care who opts out will be asked to show that she has good cause for doing so. If it is clear that the child support process would cause her or her children harm or undue distress no further action will be taken. Otherwise, a benefit penalty may be imposed.

 We estimate that setting a threshold of &#163;125, below which no account would be taken of pension income, would increase benefit expenditure by &#163;10 million in the first year, &#163;45 million in the third year and &#163;120 million after ten years.

<P>
<a name="91129w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Decisions on claims for Industrial Injuries benefits are made by decision makers, taking into account the medical evidence provided by medical advisers trained in Disability Assessment Medicine. It is for the decision maker to judge whether the medical examination report is adequate for the purpose of deciding a claim. The on-going medical quality monitoring of the medical advisers' examination reports suggests that they are maintaining the same standards as pertained when the doctors were responsible for decision making. However following the introduction of lay decision making in July this year the quality of the medical report is further enhanced by a requirement that medical advisers give clear, unambiguous and jargon-free reasons for their opinion.

<P>
<a name="91129w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The Industrial Injuries scheme provides benefits for employed earners disabled by asbestos-related illness arising out of and in the course of their employment. This benefit compensates people for a loss of faculty which results in disablement; it is not based on issues of 'fault'.
<P>

<a name="91129w16.html_para5">Under the provisions of the compensation recovery scheme, benefits paid as a result of asbestos-related illness can be recovered if the person suffering from the illness is awarded third party compensation. Benefits are recovered from the compensator from the date of claim to benefit in respect of the disease, subject to a five year maximum. The compensator may reduce the compensation payment to take account of this liability, but only where compensation and benefits are paid for the same need. Compensation for pain and suffering cannot be reduced.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Medical Services doctors receive a five day training course instructing them how to apply their medical knowledge to the legislative criteria. It includes considering the raw materials, radiological and pathological findings and clinical presentation. Each doctor is then assigned to a more experienced colleague who acts as a supervisory mentor until he or she is assessed as capable of working alone. Work is then audited regularly with quality assured processes to assess any need for further training, and the training is kept under constant review. Forms used to record medical assessments for respiratory prescribed diseases require the doctor to record details of the claimant's smoking habits.

<P>
<a name="91129w16.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if it is his policy that all those claiming a social security benefit on the grounds of suffering from an asbestos-related disease should have undergone a CT scan to improve diagnosis.  [99573]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 It is not our policy that such Social Security benefit claimants should have undergone a CT scan.
<P>

<a name="91129w16.html_para6">CT scans involve considerable exposure to ionising radiation. It would be incompatible with EU and UK legislation on reducing radiation exposure to set any such requirement when it is possible to award benefit on the basis of other evidence of an acceptable nature, such as ordinary chest radiographs. It is important to note that the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council (which advises the Secretary of State on this benefit) recommended in 1996 that awards for bilateral diffuse pleural thickening should be based upon the chest radiograph rather than a CT scan.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many pensioners are entitled to means-tested benefit in 1999; and how many will be so entitled after the implementation of the increases in the basic state pension and the minimum income guarantee for pensions announced in his up-rating statement, when broken down between the different benefits.  [99448]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 As at May 1998, the latest date for which information on all means-tested benefits is available, the estimated number of pensioners (aged 60 or over) who were entitled to means-tested benefit was 3.08 million. We estimate that a further 25,000 pensioners will become entitled to the minimum income guarantee from next April because of its link with earnings growth. 6,000 pensioners will become entitled to Housing Benefit and 9,000 will become entitled to Council Tax Benefit for the same reason.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what discussions <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> his officials have had since 27 March 1998 concerning the Lord Chancellor (Tenure of Office) (Amendment) Bill [Lords] 1998; if he will make a statement on the statutory provisions concerning disbarment from holding the position of Lord Chancellor as it affects (i) Jews, (ii) Muslims, (iii) Buddhists and (iv) members of other non-Christian religions; and what steps he proposes to ensure there is no religious requirement in <i>(a)</i> holding the office of Lord Chancellor and <i>(b)</i> carrying out the functions of Lord Chancellor.

 <i>[holding answer 26 November 1999]:</i> The Lord Chancellor and his officials have held preliminary discussions with the promoter of the Lord Chancellor (Tenure of Office) (Amendment) Bill, the noble Lord Alderdice, and his advisers. The purpose of the discussions is to consider how legislation could provide for alternative arrangements to be made in the event of a Lord Chancellor considering that it was not proper for him or her personally to exercise ecclesiastical functions attached to the office of Lord Chancellor. The discussion follows proposals made during the debates on the Bill which Lord Alderdice introduced last year.

<a name="91129w17.html_para1">I am not aware of any extant statutory provisions which would disbar any person from holding the office of Lord Chancellor on the ground of his or her religious persuasion.
<P>

<a name="91129w17.html_para2">The Government do not propose to take any steps to change any existing law which governs the holding of the office of Lord Chancellor, or the carrying out of the functions of that office. Traditionally, it has not been regarded as appropriate for the Government to introduce legislation intended to facilitate the holding or performance of such office by individuals of particular religious persuasions.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what would have been the hourly rate for legal aid work in magistrates courts had fees been raised annually in line with inflation, detailed by each year, in each of the last five years.  [100470]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The majority of magistrates court criminal cases are paid for by a standard fee. Hourly rates are paid on non standard cases. Of cases receiving criminal legal aid, 9 per cent. are currently paid by non standard fees and account for 35 per cent. of expenditure. Although hourly rates have not increased during the period in question, the average amount paid in a case has increased from &#163;1,554 to &#163;1,649. Had the hourly rates increased in line with inflation, the rates would be as detailed.

 The Lord Chancellor and I are both very grateful to Professor Genn for undertaking the research in "Paths to Justice". The report reveals that the perception of judges is inconsistent with the true facts, as evidenced by the high level of satisfaction with judges which most court users report--a level of satisfaction which is remarkable, considering that in every court case there has to be a winner and a loser, and therefore a disappointed party. It is important that deserved public confidence in the judiciary is maintained.

 The causes of chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis are not fully understood, nor is there a generally agreed method of treatment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91129w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We welcome the recent Age Concern report which highlights this important issue.
<P>

<a name="91129w21.html_para1">Discrimination of any kind, whether it is on the basis of age, race or gender, is completely unacceptable in the National Health Service. Treatment should rest entirely on clinical need. We are determined to provide older people with care that meets their needs--fast, efficient and sensitive. The provision of first class care on the NHS is a priority for this Government. That is why we are developing the National Service Framework (NSF) for Older People. This, for the first time, will set national standards for the care of older people, driving up the quality and reducing the variations of that care. The NSF will be published next year. The development of the NSF has involved many groups, including the patients and carers themselves. However, until the NSF is in place, we will continue to improve and modernise the services we provide. Thus last year we extended the annual immunisation programme for influenza to ensure that everyone aged 75 and over can have the 'flu vaccine free of charge. Over the next three years we will be expanding cataract services to increase the number of cataract operations from 170,000 a year currently to 250,000 a year--this will benefit thousands of older people. From 1 April this year all people aged 60 and over are entitled to free eye tests regardless of income or health status.

<P>
<a name="91129w22.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 "The Report on Confidential Enquiries into Maternal Deaths in the United Kingdom 1994-1996" recommended that the early identification of women at risk of postnatal mental illness or self harm should become part of routine practice. At the maternity booking stage, brief details should be taken about the presence or history of maternal psychiatric disorder, alcohol or substance abuse, severe social problems and previous self harm. Mechanisms should be in place to ensure effective psychiatric liaison as well as to provide appropriate support. The report's recommendations were widely circulated to health professionals in the National Health Service in November 1998.

 The information is not collected centrally in the form requested. However, there were an estimated 613 finished consultant episodes recorded with a primary diagnoses of puerperium (post natal depression occurring within six weeks of delivery) during 1996-97, the latest year for which information is available.

 A major programme of action to improve services for children in the public care has been set out in the Government's Response to the Children's Safeguards Review: the launch of the three-year "Quality Protects" programme; and in the White Paper "Modernising Social Services". The "Quality Protects" programme set new national objectives to transform the management and delivery of children's social services. A special grant of &#163;375 million over three years has been made available to support the changes.

<P>
<a name="91129w22.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer my predecessor as Economic Secretary gave him on 1 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 807W. There is no evidence that IMF support has been used to subsidise the South Korean shipbuilding industry, and this year South Korea has made net repayments to the IMF.
<P>

<a name="91129w22.html_para1">The UK Government strongly support Korea's IMF programme, the benefits of which are now being felt as that country recovers from financial crisis. However, the Government fully acknowledge the necessity to monitor that the terms and conditions of the programme continue to be fully respected. This point was underlined by the Industry Council on 9 November in the context of a discussion of the European Commission's first monitoring report on the situation in the world shipbuilding market.

 The Monetary Policy Committee is charged with setting interest rates to ensure the Government's inflation target of 2.5 per cent. is met, and hence the introduction of a National Minimum Wage is not expected to have any material effect on inflation.
