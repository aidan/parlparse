<i> [holding answer 27 April 2009]:</i> The cost of calling 0845 numbers remains lower than many alternatives and, where it is possible, using BT landlines to call 0845 numbers is usually the lowest cost option. Research was carried out in 2008 to estimate the additional telephony charges DWP would incur by switching all existing 0845 services to 0800. We do not have a precise amount, but it is estimated that the switch would cost &#163;10 million a year. In addition, there would be one-off transition costs of changing literature and raising awareness with staff, estimated at &#163;1 million.</p>

We understand that not everyone has access to a BT landline and if that is the case, we will always call back if asked to do so, so that we absorb the cost of the call.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Coventry South of 13 May 2009, <i> Official Report</i>, column 865, on Rover Group: pensions, what estimate his Department made of the extra costs which would be imposed consequent on the changes to the operation of the Pension Protection Fund in respect of people who took early retirement before the relevant scheme entered that fund; and what assessment he made of the capacity of the Pension Protection Fund levy to meet those extra costs.

 As at April 2008, the estimated cost of removing the 90 per cent. compensation limit and the compensation cap for the people who had taken early retirement before April 2005 in a scheme that had already been admitted into the Pension Protection Fund was around &#163;4 million. That figure is based on the number of individuals affected at that time and does not reflect the costs in relation to early retirees in schemes which entered the PPF after April 2008 or those which may do so in the future as such information is not readily available. The pension protection levy is a matter for the board of the Pension Protection Fund, but any extra costs would be borne by levy payers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="90604w0003.htm_para1"><a name="09060436000244">The estimated costs are one factor in the Government's decision not to change the way in which the Pension Protection Fund treats early retirees. The second is equality of treatment between those people who receive PPF compensation. Removing the compensation limit and the cap for some individuals who were under scheme pension age at the time their pension scheme entered the Pension Protection Fund would introduce inequalities in treatment of individuals under normal pension age and lead to a two tier system. The 90 per cent. limit and the cap ensure consistent treatment based on the individual's age at the time their pension scheme enters the PPF. They ensure that people who are able to take early retirement are not placed in a more beneficial position than those who stay in employment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="90604w0006.htm_para3"><a name="09060440000185">The measurement of fraud is a complex issue. Historically IPS has counted as fraudulent only those cases which it has been possible to confirm absolutely as fraud. In recent years IPS has been engaged in a programme of work to better understand the nature and level of fraud within the passport application process and the success of existing measures in preventing fraud. This work has established that there were a significant number of cases in which IPS routinely prevents the issue of passports to fraudsters without actually recording those cases as fraudulent.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="90604w0006.htm_para4"><a name="09060440000186">As a result, processes to provide a more accurate measure of IPS performance in countering fraud have been developed and refined. This is the reason for the significant step change in success that IPS is now able to report. IPS currently uses a tiered approach to recording fraudulent applications based on the level of likelihood of fraud. Fraud is now categorised as confirmed fraud, probable fraud and possible fraud.</p>

 The information set out as follows shows the amount of grant payable from 2001-02, the earliest year for which we have the information, to the governing bodies of those voluntary aided (VA) schools with a religious character. This is then shown as a proportion of the total departmental capital programme (including PFI credits) for all schools. Some VA schools will also have received some funding from programmes other than the main VA programmes but as these records are maintained mainly at local authority level we do not keep records of the amounts.

 Asbestos Containing Materials (ACMs) were used extensively as building materials in Great Britain and the majority of schools are likely to contain them as are many other buildings both domestic and non-domestic. It has been estimated that more than 500,000 non-domestic premises, including schools, still contain ACMs.</p>

In particular, pre-fabricated schools&#151;so called system-built schools&#151;of the CLASP, SCOLA and Hills types commonly used ACMs. The HSE records over 1,400 CLASP schools in the UK, and it has been estimated there are 13,000 system built schools.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) has re-oriented its programmes to minimise the impact of the crisis on the poorest. We help countries through our country programmes, for example through social protection programmes, and by working through multilateral organisations.

Many countries have benefited from exceptional debt relief under the heavily indebted poor countries initiative (HIPC). Through our country programmes we are providing budget support to certain selected countries which helps them to manage their budgets.</p>
