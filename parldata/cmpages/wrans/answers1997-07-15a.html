<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Garnier: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs when he last discussed the case of Mordechai Vanunu with the Foreign Minister of Israel; when he next plans to discuss this case with the Foreign Minister of Israel; and if he will make a statement on the Government's policy with regard to the conviction and imprisonment of Mordechai Vanunu. [6311]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Fatchett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 July 1997]:</i> I have not yet had the opportunity to meet the Foreign Minister of Israel, and there is no meeting planned in the immediate future.
<P>

<a name="70715w01.html_para0">We have no formal standing to intervene in this case as there is no evidence of any illegality prior to Mr. Vanunu's departure from the United Kingdom. However, we do take opportunities to raise with the Israeli authorities the matter of Vanunu's solitary confinement: this was done most recently on 1 July, with the Israeli Ambassador.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 7 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>330</i>, what rules of procedure governed the <i>(a)</i> Amsterdam summit and <i>(b)</i> preceding IGCs in the last five years; what rules of procedure govern other international Heads of Government meetings attended by the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement. [8536]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Intergovernmental Conferences to consider amendments to the treaties are governed by Article N of the Treaty on European Union (TEU) and are conducted by consensus. Beyond this, there are no formal rules of procedure for European Council meetings. It is for the incumbent Presidency to decide how to conduct summits.
<P>

<a name="70715w01.html_para1">Other international heads of government meetings, such as meetings of NATO and the Commonwealth, are similarly not governed by formal rules of procedure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Berry: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has for further consultation on the recommendations of the Law Commission's report "Mental Incapacity" (Law Com. No. 231); and over what period. [8696]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government recognises the importance of clarifying the law in this area to provide a clear framework for those involved in making decisions on behalf of incapacitated adults and to ensure that the welfare and interests of the incapacitated person are adequately protected. It is hoped that progress will be made on the subject at an early opportunity.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what changes he plans to make to the qualifying criteria for legal aid as it affects asylum seekers. [8706]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Sir Peter Middleton is currently reviewing all aspects of the provision of legal aid. He will produce a preliminary report in September. It would be premature to comment further. The Legal Aid Board is reviewing how the existing test is applied in practice, to make sure that legal aid reaches those, but only those, whose cases merit it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received concerning the closure of Hendon police station; and if he will make a statement. [7546]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I have received no representations concerning the closure of Hendon police station. I understand that as long ago as 1992, the Metropolitan Police's building strategy identified the need for a new police station in the London Borough of Barnet and a new Area Headquarters for 2 Area. The investment of an 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 1997 : Column: 95</I><P>
&#163;8.8 million new building was based on relinquishment of other now redundant police buildings, leading to a review of policing strategy and tactics in the Borough. The findings were published as "Policing Barnet 2000", which included recommendations to amalgamate the Golders Green and West Hendon Divisions and to close Hendon police station due to its age, running costs and usage.
<P>

<a name="70715w01.html_para2">I understand that the closure of Hendon police station has been set for 15 October. Colindale police station, which replaces Hendon and is a charging station as well as being the new 2 Area Headquarters, opened on 10 March.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department on what occasions <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b)</i> officials have refused to (i) arrange and (ii) attend meetings with hon. Members to discuss matters relating to interests registered by those hon. Members under categories 1, 2, 3, 4(b), 8 and 9 in the Register of Members' Interests. [8089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) made it clear that, when hon. Members are meeting Ministers or others on topics in which they have an interest, the onus is on the hon. Member to declare that interest not the Minister to know (paragraph 63 of Cm 2850). It is not practicable for Ministers and officials, amongst their other duties, to vet requests for meetings against the Register of Members' Interests. Should evidence of non-declaration emerge, or contravention of the Resolution of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, the matter would be brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will ensure that <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b) </i>officials in his Department refuse requests from hon. Members to (i) arrange and (ii) attend meetings relating to interests held by those hon. Members under categories 1, 2, 3, 4(b), 8 and 9 in the Register of Members' Interests. [8086]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) recognised the value of enabling hon. Members to retain interests outside the House, provided these were properly declared, both in the Register of Members' Interests and on other occasions. Subject to these requirements, and to the rules of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, hon. Members are free to seek meetings with Ministers and officials, who will consider such requests alongside the many other approaches from individuals and organisations concerned to press their own interests or those of others.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Campbell-Savours: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) on what dates since 1 May <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b) </i>officials in his Department have met commercial lobbyists to discuss matters relating to the business of his Department; and if he will introduce a register of such meetings; [8087]




<P>
<P><I>15 Jul 1997 : Column: 96</I><P>

<P>
<UL>(2) on what dates since 1 May <i>(a)</i> Ministers and <i>(b)</i> officials in his Department have attended meetings with organisations representing (i) commercial and (ii) non-commercial interests organised by commercial lobbying firms; and if he will introduce a register of such meetings. [8088]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister explained in response to the hon. Member for Newport, West (Mr. Flynn), on 2 June, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>99</i>, Ministers and officials in the Department receive deputations from many groups who are concerned to press their own interests or those of their clients, which Ministers and officials take due care to consider within the wider public interest and Government policy. It is not practicable to distinguish particular groups as lobbyists, not least because some reputable and representative bodies themselves use the services of commercial lobbyists to advise them on government relations. Ministers are however always ready to provide information on meetings held with outside bodies.

<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will list the local authorities who applied for but failed to receive assistance for the installation of CCTV in <i>(a)</i> 1994-95, <i>(b)</i> 1995-96 and <i>(c) </i>1996-97; [7914]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Closed circuit television (CCTV) Challenge Competitions have been held in 1994-95, 1996-97 and 1997-98. There was no competition in 1995-96 so I have given figures for the three years for which there have been competitions. In all three rounds, bids were invited from local partnerships. Bidding partnerships did not necessarily have local authority involvement. We are not able to identify bids which have local authority involvement but which have not been led by a local authority. There are some 760 bids which have not named a local authority as the lead partner. Numbers of successful and unsuccessful bids where a local authority was specified as the lead organisation are detailed in tables, copies of which have been placed in the Library.

 In accordance with the normal conventions, we do not have access to the papers of the previous Administration. The papers have now been transferred to the Criminal Cases Review Commission. It is being treated as a priority case, and we understand that the Commission are working towards taking a decision on it as soon as possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We welcome the use of multi-agency projects to promote fire safety messages and will consider how far such schemes should be promoted nationally in the light of the pilot's success and the recommendations of the Community Fire Safety Task Force, which is due to report in the autumn.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will give for the Interdepartmental Review of Victim Support <i>(a)</i> the expected completion date and <i>(b)</i> the cost of conducting the review. [8231]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I assume that the Question is referring to the Interdepartmental Working Group on Vulnerable or Intimidated Witnesses. The Group aims to report to Ministers by the end of the year. The Group is chaired by the Home Office and includes officials from various Government Departments and agencies as well as representatives from the Association of Chief Police Officers, Victim Support and the Local Government Association, who will participate as part of their normal duties. The costs of the review will therefore be met from the running costs of the individual Departments and agencies involved. It is not possible to predict the costs of the review in advance.

<P>
<a name="70715w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Joyce Quin: </B> 
 Detailed guidance on searching is set out in the Prison Service Security Manual, although there are currently no specific guidelines on the searching of women during menstruation, pregnancy, after birth or after operations. A copy of the Manual is in the Library.
<P>

<a name="70715w02.html_para0">I have asked the Prison Service to review searching policy, with particular regard to strip searching. The review will consider the legal and policy framework and the need for revised procedures. The review team will take into account the usefulness of the current procedures; monitoring and statistical issues; relevant research; and whether the procedures should be different for women prisoners. I will announce the report's conclusions once it has been completed.

<a name="70715w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The estimate for implementing the 1997 Act is about &#163;135 million. This is made up of &#163;50 million for the large calibre handguns that are surrendered, and &#163;80 million for ancillary equipment. There will be administrative costs of up to &#163;5 million.

<a name="70715w02.html_para1">The estimate for implementing the Firearms (Amendment) Bill is &#163;31 million, of which &#163;12 million will be for small-calibre pistols and &#163;19 million for the cost of the ancillary equipment used with those pistols.

 <i>[holding answer 14 July 1997]:</i> The UK co-sponsored SCR 986 (now renewed as SCR 1111) to help alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people by allowing the Iraqi Government to export oil worth $2 billion mainly for the purchase of humanitarian supplies. The impact of sanctions was a major consideration for the UN when setting the level of Iraqi oil exports permitted under SCRs 986 and 1111.

 I expect the review of the Aid and Trade Provision to be completed within a few months. In the meantime I shall not approve any new ATP projects in Indonesia.

<a name="70715w03.html_para1">Our existing support for sustainable forestry in Indonesia is likely to continue, with increased emphasis on benefits to poor people living in forest areas. We shall be looking for opportunities to support local non-government organisations in East Timor and if possible projects supporting Trade Unions in Indonesia. Other proposals will be considered on their merits.

<BR>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me as the Director of the Office for National Statistics to reply to your recent questions (7769 and 7700) on unemployment in the Northavon parliamentary constituency and South Gloucestershire unitary authority.
<BR>
The measure of unemployment, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS), is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed people who are: a) without a job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. However, largely because it is a sample survey, information is not available from the LFS in as much geographical detail as from the claimant count measure described below.

<BR>
ONS also publishes the monthly claimant count, which is based on the administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployment-related benefits (i.e. Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support or National Insurance credits) at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed on as unemployed and available to do any suitable work. Essentially, all people who attend an Employment Service office to sign are counted, irrespective of whether they are actually receiving benefit.
<BR>
The data you have requested can only be derived from the claimant count, as the labour force survey does not give details on duration of unemployment below county level.
<BR>
The figures in the attached table are for April 1997, the latest date for which figures are available.

 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) made it clear that, when Members are meeting Ministers or others on topics in which they have an interest, the onus is on the Member to declare that interest not the Minister to know--para 63 of Cm 2850. It is not practicable for Ministers and officials, amongst their other duties, to vet requests for meetings against the Register of Members' Interests.

<a name="70715w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) recognised the value of enabling Members to retain interests outside the House, provided these were properly declared, both in the Register of Members' Interests and on other occasions. Subject to these requirements, and to the rules of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, Members are free to seek meetings with Ministers and officials, who will consider such requests alongside the many other approaches from individuals and organisations concerned to press their own interests or those of others.

Ministers and officials in the Treasury and the Chancellor's other Departments receive deputations from many groups who are concerned to press their own interests or those of their clients, which Ministers and officials take due care to consider within the wider public interest and Government policy. As it is not practicable to distinguish particular groups as lobbyists, a register of such meetings is not kept.

<BR>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as the Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent question on unemployment in the Warrington North parliamentary constituency.
<BR>
The measure of unemployment, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS), is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed people who are: a) without a job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. However, largely because it is a sample survey, information is not available from the LFS in as much geographical detail as from the claimant count measure.
<BR>
Information about those ILO unemployed who are not claiming unemployment related benefits is collected for the LFS. However, no such information is available below county level.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Gordon Brown: </B> 
 I represented the UK at the Economic and Finance Council--ECOFIN--of the European Union in Brussels on 7 July.
<P>

<a name="70715w05.html_para0">Most of the formal session was taken up by an open debate on Luxembourg's plans for work in ECOFIN during their Presidency of the EU. Key areas in the next six months include preparation for the Special Employment Summit, taking forward preparations for stage three of EMU and work on all financial aspects of enlargement of the Union and the Agenda 2000 dossier.
<P>

<a name="70715w05.html_para1">The series of "structured dialogues" with Ministers of the Central and Eastern European countries continued with a discussion of capital liberalisation and reform of the financial sector, both in formal session and over lunch. Ministers from the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic and Poland outlined the progress their countries had made in these sectors. It was noted that, while progress had clearly been made, weaknesses remained and needed to be addressed. Hungary will host a seminar later this year to discuss further work.
<P>

<a name="70715w05.html_para2">The Council carried out an examination of Italy's convergence programme for the period 1998 to 2000. It acknowledged the progress made by Italy on inflation, interest rates and currency stability. It welcomed the commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit, while stressing the need to implement structural reforms so a low deficit could be sustained in the longer term. The Council also noted the need to reduce the high level of accumulated government debt.
<P>

<a name="70715w05.html_para3">The Council discussed informally a draft regulation on the technical specification for euro coins. No member state indicated disagreement with the substance of the regulation. I noted that the text had not yet cleared Parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="70715w05.html_para4">The Council discussed informally the EC Budget for 1998. Formal discussions will take place at the Budget Council meeting on 24 July.
<P>

<a name="70715w05.html_para5">In further informal discussions, the Council agreed that ECOFIN should examine all issues related to Agenda 2000 and that the Presidency would propose that the meeting between Asian and EU Finance Ministers in September should include consideration of money laundering.
<P>

<a name="70715w05.html_para6">The Presidency informed the Council that a meeting between EU and EFTA Finance Ministers would take place over dinner on the eve of the 13 October ECOFIN.

 Article 2 of the Social Protocol says that financial consequences, other than administrative costs, of the Social Chapter shall not be applicable to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. This exemption could be achieved by means of a rebate on the UK's contribution to the EU budget. The Government has decided, however, that pursuing such a rebate in future would be inconsistent with the agreement reached at the Amsterdam Council enabling the UK to participate in Council discussions under the Social Chapter. It has also decided not to seek reimbursement of its contribution to past budget years. The total claim which will be written off as a result of this decision--initially estimated at &#163;1 million for budget years 1995 and 1996--will be reported in a note to the Consolidated Fund account.

 It is a criminal offence to execute, or cause to be executed, works to a listed building without first obtaining listed building consent. This includes the theft of architectural features. The current penalty for conviction in a Magistrates' court is a fine of up to &#163;20,000 or imprisonment for up to six months (or both), whilst on conviction in the Crown Court an unlimited fine or a prison sentence of up to two years (or both) may be imposed. In determining the amount of any fine, a magistrates' court or the Crown Court must have regard to any financial benefit which has accrued or may accrue from the offence.

<a name="70715w06.html_para0">Planning Policy Guidance Note 15: Planning and the Historic Environment recommends that owners of listed buildings take precautions to safeguard architectural and other valuable features, especially when historic buildings are vacant or being refurbished.

 The obligations placed on the BBC in respect of its archives are set out in its Royal Charter and its Agreement with the Secretary of State. These include broad obligations to establish and maintain archives containing material relevant to the objects of the Corporation, and to make the archives available to the public with or without charge. The BBC's Information and Archives Department provides a full range of library and information services. Changes in arrangements for the delivery of these services within the BBC will not affect the BBC's archives or public access to them. While we have had no discussions with the BBC on this point, we are confident that it is continuing to maintain its archival responsibilities under the Royal Charter and Agreement.

 The Arts for Everyone main scheme invites applications from established organisations for between &#163;500 and &#163;500,000 for new arts activities. There have been two rounds this year. 1,000 applications were received for the first round (closing date 31 March 1997), totalling some &#163;150 million. Funding decisions will be made by the Arts Council of England in August 1997, with a planned public announcement of awards in the middle of September.

<a name="70715w06.html_para3">The second round (closing date 30 June 1997) received 700 applications seeking some &#163;70 million. Funding decisions will be made by the Arts Council of England in November 1997.

 Each water company has now responded in a generally positive and constructive way to our proposals for action. I have today placed copies of each company's response in the Libraries of the House, together with a short analysis of them prepared by my Department.
<P>

<a name="70715w09.html_para1">All water companies will now provide free supply pipe leakage detection and repair services to their household customers. Eight of the smaller companies have told me that they will limit the number of free repairs to any one service pipe. Two other of the smaller companies have decided to replace leaking supply pipes free of charge.
<P>

<a name="70715w09.html_para2">All companies are taking action to promote water efficiency. All tell me that they are making significant efforts in the provision of water saving devices. Most are actively distributing devices to reduce toilet flush volumes or else are making them available free on request. A very few companies have decided to conduct trials before committing themselves to widespread promotion; they should take very careful note of what the majority of companies have done and are doing. Most water companies already offer free water efficiency audits to household customers. The remainder are developing or evaluating the service they intend to offer and I want them to go firm very soon. All water companies confirmed that they have in place a wide variety of measures to encourage water efficient gardening. All companies see clear roles for the Environmental Task Force in promoting water efficiency.

compensation schemes for drought-related supply interruptions. I want to see these eight licence amendments made by October. I also want the six other companies which indicated that they are minded to accept licence amendments to resolve their reservations with the Director General and to have the amendment process agreed by the same time. That also applies to the one company which still declares itself unable to accept licence amendment. All companies have expressed a willingness to consider compensation payments if they have to issue advice to boil or refrain from using mains water for reasons within their control.
<P>

<a name="70715w09.html_para4">Those companies which have not already done so are now moving to agree with the Environment Agency a publicly-available drought contingency plan. I am pleased that the industry is united in taking this action in advance of our bringing forward legislation to make it a statutory requirement when Parliamentary time allows.
<P>

<a name="70715w09.html_para5">We asked companies to do more to explain to their customers their water supply performance targets and how well they are being met. Altogether, I believ'e that companies are taking appropriate action. But none should rest contented with their efforts.

 The Government is very interested in the opportunities offered by cleaner fuels, including ultra low sulphur diesels such as "City Diesel", particularly their potential to play a part in the improvement of urban air quality. My Department is currently sponsoring comparative trials of both cleaner conventional fuels and alternative fuels, including natural gas, liquefied petroleum gas and bio-diesel. "City Diesel" is included in the trials, which will provide an indication of both the emissions reduction potential of the fuels and of the practicability, reliability and driveability of vehicles which use them. The results of the trials will be published later this year.

 Of the sites owned by the London Docklands Development Corporation in the Isle of Dogs area which have a residential use, the Corporation have spent &#163;8.773 million since 1981 on a range of preparation works. Repairs and enhancements to River walls, River walkways and a pier account for just over half of that expenditure. These works have fed through into land values. Actual and forecast receipts from the subsequent sale of the sites to private developers total &#163;19.916 million with the excess of income over expenditure invested by LDDC in regeneration programmes. Additionally, in two instances (Arnhem Wharf and Masthouse Terrace) where LDDC undertook preparation works, 62 per cent. and 49 per cent. respectively of the subsequent residential development has been for social housing; in a third instance (Maconochies Wharf) the development has been a self-build project.

 Junction 10 to 11 is a relatively new junction on the M3 and only 2 years of accident data are available 1995-1996 with 1 and 6 accidents respectively). For small areas or short road lengths, longer time periods are required to ensure a robust estimate.

Data for 1996 are due to be published in August 1997 and a copy will be placed in the House of Commons Library.

Three of these products produced higher levels of a specific phthalate than expected on extraction by a test apparently developed by the Danish EPA.

Internet Watch offers ISPs a service, facilitating their compliance with existing law. An ISP who chose not to co-operate within the framework would risk prosecution and the full force of the criminal law. Internet Watch has already proved successful in bringing about the removal of illegal material, and in passing details to the police.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what action Her Majesty's Government have taken in support of the European Commission's appeal against the World Trade Organisation's ruling on the EU banana import regime; what is Her Majesty's Government's policy towards the import of bananas from the West Indies to Europe; what assessment he has made of the impact of United Kingdom policy on the Caribbean banana industry; and if he will make a statement. [7476]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The UK has supported the European Commission's robust defence of the EU banana regime in the World Trade Organisation. We are continuing that support during the appeal to the Appellate Body. The EU policy of offering preferential access for bananas from the West Indies and other traditional ACP suppliers is one that the UK supports. The Government is well aware of the importance to the West Indies of continuing access, given the dependence of their economies on banana exports.

<P>

<a name="70715w13.html_para3">Although the Directive was adopted in 1973, it was only after the adoption of the CE Marking Directive in 1993, that an approach was first made to the Department by a manufacturer of plastic conduit, for an opinion as to whether the Directive covered such items.
<P>

<a name="70715w13.html_para4">Cable management products, such as plastic conduit, will fall within the scope of the Low Voltage Directive only if they are items of electrical equipment as described within the meaning of Article 2 of the Directive. In order to answer the enquiry a detailed analysis was undertaken by my Department to clarify the meaning of electrical equipment. As the Directive does not define what is meant by electrical equipment it is necessary to base this on the ordinary English language usage of the term in the context in which it appears in the Directive. The natural meaning of these words and hence the scope of the Directive, implies a product which operates between the voltage limits set, is not an electrically passive product and has the potential to generate electrical, mechanical, thermal or other hazards, all arising from its electrical, nature which must be protected against, as required by Article 2 of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="70715w13.html_para5">At a meeting of member States on 8 and 9 July to discuss a proposed European Commission guidance document on the Directive, the European Commission requested that the Department review its position.

 There are currently four solar powered (photovoltaic) domestic housing schemes in the UK, comprising a total of 14 homes in the private sector. However, there are over 40,000 homes with active solar heating and many more with passive solar design features. The current cost of installing photovoltaic (PV) panels (1.5--3.0kWp) onto a domestic house is typically between &#163;10,000 and &#163;15,000 per property. PV electricity costs typically around 5--10 times more than conventionally generated electricity, depending on specific circumstances. However, the technology is developing rapidly, and with continually falling costs due to economies of scale, PV may become a strategically important electricity generating technology in the future.

<a name="70715w15.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Chief Executive of the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency. I have asked the Chief Executive to write to the hon. Member.
<i>Letter from C. G. Winsland to Mr. Gordon Marsden, dated 15 July 1997:</i>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><P>
<BR>

<BR>
I am replying to your Question to the Secretary of State for Defence about the factors which may delay maintenance payments made by Service personnel as this matter falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of the Armed Forces Personnel Administration Agency (AFPAA).
<BR>
There are 3 general processes employed by the Agency to make maintenance payments from Servicemen's pay:
<BR>
(a) Automatic credit transfer through the Bankers Automated Clearing System (BACS).
<BR>
(b) Payable Orders in the form of a cheque, which are sent by post and are drawn against HMPMG account.
<BR>
(c) Allotment or payment books which are pre-funded and against which credits are drawn on the due date.
<BR>
In each case, the method of payment is dictated by the Child Support Agency (CSA), the Court, or the dependant. The 3 systems have proven to be effective and payments are rarely delayed, other than through exceptional circumstances such as postal delays, technical failure in the BACS system or the production of the payable orders. In the vast majority of cases, payments deducted from pay due on the last working day of each month are credited to the separated partner's account or paid by cheque on the same day.
<BR>
Usually, AFPAA is directed to make payment to the CSA or Magistrates Court for them in turn to issue funds to the individual. From past experience, this can be the most significant factor in any delay between the deduction of maintenance from a Serviceman's pay and subsequent payment to a separated partner. If your question relates to a specific case, I would be happy to initiate a review if you can provide the necessary detail.

 Following a competitive tender, 26 abattoirs in Great Britain have been contracted by the Intervention Board to slaughter cattle under the Over Thirty Month Scheme. Selection was made on the basis of criteria which included quality and volume of service, suitability of premises, price and geographical location to ensure reasonable access for producers. Proportionally greater capacity has been provided to the traditional dairy areas, including the North West of England, and the number of liveweight markets acting as collection centres for entry to the scheme has not changed.
<P>

<a name="70715w16.html_para5">Inevitably, with the number of abattoirs being reduced from about 50 to 26 to reflect the much lower throughputs in the scheme, some producers will have to travel greater distances. But those in Staffordshire are relatively well served under the new arrangements, despite there being no scheme abattoirs in the county. In fact, distances for them will be less than those for a great many producers elsewhere in the country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 The pensions of employees of the House who are members of the House of Commons Staff Pensions Scheme (HOCSPS) should not be affected by the budget proposals. The HOCSPS is analogous to the Principal Civil Service Scheme and is operated on a pay as you go basis. Since it is not a funded scheme and consequently has no investments the abolition of tax credits should have no effect on the value of pensions payable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70715w17.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Ann Taylor: </B> 
 The final value of the pension in respect of any individual on any honourable Member's staff will depend on a wide range of factors, including the level of contributions paid to the individual's pension arrangements, the choice of investment vehicle selected from time to time by the individual, and the level of annuity rates prevailing at the time when the individual

Whether or not the Budget will affect the final value of the pension will depend on all of these factors, as well as on economic variables such as the future progress of the investment markets. The ultimate pension levels are not guaranteed, either before or after the Budget.

 The average daily prisoner population in Scotland in 1996-97 was 5,992 compared with 5,632 in 1995-96 and 5,395 in 1992-93. During 1996-97, the average daily remand population increased by 3 per cent. to 1,021, the highest number recorded in the past five years. The number of adult prisoners and young offenders sentenced increased by 6 per cent. and 10 per cent. respectively. The rise in the number of adult prisoners in 1996-97 can be attributed to the increase in the number of short-term prisoners from 2,022 in 1995-96 to 2,183 in 1996-97.

 Rate relief provided to qualifying sports clubs in Scotland is already harmonised. Non-profit-making sports clubs in Scotland are eligible for mandatory relief. If relief is granted 100 per cent. of the cost is borne by the Exchequer.
