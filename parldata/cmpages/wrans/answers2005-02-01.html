 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate the Government have made of the cost of raising a child to the age of 18 at 2003&#150;04 prices.  [211700]</p>




<p><a name="50201w01.html_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The Government have not estimated the cost of raising a child. Since 1997 the Government have radically reformed the way they provide support to families with children, driven by two principal objectives:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">to support all families with children, recognising that families with children face additional costs; and</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">to deliver progress on its goal to eradicate child poverty, by offering greatest support to those most in need, while maintaining incentives to work.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w01.html_para1">
From April 2005, this new system of financial support for families will deliver, through child benefit and child tax credit, a range of support from &#163;17.00 to around &#163;60 a week, compared to a range of &#163;11.05 and &#163;28 a week in 1997.

<p><a name="50201w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Boateng: </b> 
 The Government are committed to achieving value for money from its PFI programme and keeps all aspects of the programme under review to ensure that this objective is being met. The Government have made clear that PFI should only be used where it is the appropriate to do so and where a full value for money analysis shows that it offers the best value for money in comparison with alternative procurement routes. This value for money analysis and robust competition in the bidding process, both of which were highlighted as key factors in the decision to use PFI in the value for money guidance issued by the Treasury last summer, ensure that the public sector pays a fair price for the services it receives from PFI projects and for the risks which the private sector bears.

Sites are included on the basis that they meet the EC habitat directive&#039;s selection criteria (annex III of the directive) and are thus considered to be most in need of conservation at a European level.

 European Community import rules require all products of animal origin imported from third countries to enter the Community via specified border inspection posts (BIPs) where they are subject to veterinary examination to ensure the import conditions are being observed. The system of veterinary examination is operated in the UK by local authorities and is monitored by Defra and the European Commission&#039;s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) to ensure effective controls are in place. There are currently 29 BIPs approved to inspect animal products in the UK.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w04.html_para1">
Commission Decision 2001/881 required that each BIP listed be subject to a yearly inspection by the FVO veterinary experts, unless reduced inspections to certain BIPs had been agreed by the Standing Veterinary Committee (now the Standing Committee on the Food Chain and Animal Health).

<a name="50201w04.html_para2">
Commission Decision 2005/13 amended Commission Decision 2001/881 and specifies that the frequency and scope of missions by the FVO to border inspection posts should be decided on the basis of risks to the animal and public health in the Community. Factors to be taken into account include patterns of trade in the Community, statistical data available under veterinary legislation, the results of previous missions by the Office, and any identified problem areas. The UK supports this approach.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w04.html_para3">
Veterinary experts of the Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) work to assure effective control systems and to evaluate compliance with European Union (EU) standards. The FVO does this mainly by carrying out inspections in member states. The veterinary inspectors

<p><a name="50201w04.html_spnew3"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 On each occasion Defra officials are required to consider carefully what form and extent of hospitality should be offered and if it can be justified. This is considered both by the host and the authorising officer, who have to bear in mind the need for economy and the limited funds available.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w04.html_para6">
This will take into account the extent to which participation by representatives from a variety of organisations including business, voluntary organisations and local government assists the Department in forming and testing out policy as well as distances involved and inconvenience to most taking part.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w04.html_para7">
The figures detailed in the following table includes a variety of forms of hospitality including events such as lunch provided for participants at Defra consultative events on farming issues, environmental issues and others of the many issues dealt with by the Department.

Examples include the event at which the Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy was launched and a new delivery team headed by Sir Don Curry was set up.

<p>
<a name="50201w04.html_para9">
The figure for 2001&#150;02 provided is for a full year and includes three months of DETR expenditure from 1 April to 8 June when Defra was created. MAFF and DETR did not use the same chart of accounts to record expenditure. It was, therefore, necessary to carry out a mapping exercise to match up expenditure under the Defra structure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w04.html_para10">
Hospitality was not separately identified in the expenditure transfer from DETR and may have been absorbed in incidental codes. For the remainder of that year only &#163;1,953 was recorded against Environment. This would suggest that there may have been some misunderstanding on coding within the ex-DETR directorates during the transition and initial months of Defra&#039;s existence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w04.html_para11">
The other factor that may have had an impact on the figures for 2001&#150;02 was the foot and mouth crisis. The Department was very focused on dealing with this crisis and this would have reduced the number of events held where hospitality expenditure would have been incurred.

Defra conducts the majority of its litigation in house with other cases being dealt with on its behalf by the Treasury Solicitor&#039;s Department and by external solicitors. Defra came into existence in June 2001 and therefore has no records prior to that date.

This will usually correspond to the number of new actions/cases but not necessarily so. The number will include arbitrations and other ADR resolution and also claims which were resolved prior to the issue of proceedings and did not in the event proceed to court. Information about the number of actions is therefore approximate. Defra does not hold information in a centralised readily accessible format as to the number of settlements, number of court cases and the costs of each settlement, because collectively such information would involve disproportionate effort and it is not clear that it would help performance.

<i>[holding answer 25 January 2005]:</i> The Commission published on 8 December 2004 its proposals for a regulation on total allowable catches and related measures for fishing in 2005. In relation to North sea cod, these proposals included maintaining the total allowable catch at the same level as 2004, a further strengthening of the days at sea rules and a series of closed areas in the North sea. fisheries Departments received numerous representations on the Commission&#039;s proposals from fishing interests, environmental organisations and others. The recently established North Sea Regional Advisory Council produced advice for the Fisheries Council on the proposal. The Government was also informed by advice from its fisheries scientists. At the Fisheries Council on 21&#150;22 December 2004, the Commission withdrew its proposals for closed areas but secured agreement to a strengthening of the days at sea regime.

 The Government announced in the 2004 Spending Review the Department&#039;s plan to generate efficiencies of &#163;13 million a year by 2007&#150;08 through the Modernising Rural Delivery Programme. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Feb 2005 : Column 774W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Establishment of the Integrated Agency will generate efficiencies from a number of sources, principally reduced estates and staff costs from the merger of the three constituent organisations and the application of Gershon principles to deliver better value for money from back office services. These will contribute at least &#163;6.5 million cumulative efficiencies by 2007&#150;08 with further efficiencies in 2008&#150;09 and 2009&#150;10.

 The Sixth Edition of the RAF Manual of Flight Safety, officially described as Air Publication (AP) 3207, was issued in March 1993. This was superseded by the Seventh Edition, issued in 1998, which was itself replaced by a Joint Service Publication (JSP) 551 in July 2003. It is likely that the Sixth Edition will have been subject to a number of amendments (effected by replacing loose-leaf pages) during its period of currency. It is therefore unlikely that we could &quot;reconstruct&quot; the original version of the Sixth Edition, even if a copy of its later state were to come to light.

It is the nature of such documents that there is no reason for anyone to retain them once they have been superseded; perhaps more so once they have been replaced a second time. Therefore it is unlikely that any systematic search would reveal a copy of the Sixth Edition of AP 3207.

In the case of AP 3207 the organisation responsible for its production, the RAF Institute of Flight Safety, has itself been superseded by the Joint Service &quot;Defence Air Safety Centre&quot; (DASC). We have asked the DASC whether they have a copy of the Sixth Edition, but the only version of AP 3207 they hold is a copy of the Seventh Edition, which had itself been subject to three sets of amendments before it was replaced by JSP 551.

 There has been a British military presence in one form or another in Belize (former British Honduras) since the late 17th Century. In modern times the Regular British Army went to Belize in 1948 and a garrison has been there continuously since this time.

<p>
<a name="50201w07.html_para0">
Between 1 January 1984 and 31 December 2004, 27 Service personnel died in non-combat situations in Belize. It is not possible to provide information on deaths prior to 1984 as centrally held death records are known to be unreliable. A breakdown of these deaths by year is provided as follows.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made on identifying areas of support his Department can give to ensure the involvement of the Sea Cadet Association in celebrations of the 200th Anniversary of the Battle of Trafalgar.  [210681]</p>




<p><a name="50201w07.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Ingram </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 January 2005]:</i> The Royal Navy will be providing accommodation and transport around the Portsmouth area, and subsidised food for Sea Cadets participating in the Trafalgar 200 (T200) commemoration programme. Sea Cadets will be actively involved in all T200 events as a visible demonstration of the &quot;Past Glories&#151;Future Horizons&quot; theme. It is planned that over the three days the Fleet are in the Solent (the rehearsal day, the review day and the dispersal day) there will be 2,000 cadets on board ships in the Fleet Review, allowing them to experience the Review at first hand. Significant participation is also planned at both the Son et Lumiere and the International Drumhead Ceremony and for the International Festival of the Sea around five hundred cadets will be involved in a multitude of displays. Furthermore, it is planned that places for Sea Cadets will be made available at the St. Paul&#039;s Cathedral Service on 23 October and, on the same date, naval cadets will play a key part at the &quot;Celebrations in the Square&quot; Grand Finale event in Trafalgar Square.

<a name="50201w08.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Digital Television</h3>


<p><a name="50201w08.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Wyatt: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps she is taking to ensure that residents of multiple dwelling units can access digital television prior to analogue switch-off; and if she will make a statement.  [211736]</p>




<p><a name="50201w08.html_spnew0"><b> Estelle Morris  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2005]:</i> One of the challenges in completing digital switchover will be to make sure that residents in flats and other multi-dwelling units can access digital television services. Many residents living in multi-dwelling units already access digital television services either through communal systems that are capable of transmitting digital signals or through the use of other antennae.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para0">
In order to help identify the issues for residents who live in multi dwelling units, we established a dedicated Housing Communications Group as part of the Digital Television Action Plan. The Housing Communications Group includes representatives from leading housing bodies including the Chartered Institute of Housing, the National Housing Federation, the National Landlords Association, tenants groups such as TPAS and TAROE and representatives from the Digital Television Group.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para1">
In June 2004, DCMS and DTI wrote to all local authorities, registered social landlords and around 70 housing bodies to alert them to digital switchover and to encourage them to factor this in when preparing plans to develop new housing stock or refurbish or upgrade existing stock.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para2">
In August 2004 we commissioned NOP to carry out a research project to investigate the progress made by social landlords. This research will enable us to have a better assessment of what is needed and to get a representative picture of when social landlords believe they will be able to upgrade systems for digital switchover. We hope to publish the findings of this study very shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para3">
We have also started work, in association with the Chartered Institute of Housing, to produce comprehensive new guidance later this year setting out the options available to landlords who have properties 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Feb 2005 : Column 785W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
with analogue communal systems which need to be upgraded. The guidance will be aimed at both the private and social sector landlords and housing developers. We also plan to issue separate guidance for householders which will cover the issues for tenants living in MDUs.
</p>





<p><a name="50201w08.html_wqn1"><b> Annabelle Ewing: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport pursuant to her answer of 24 January 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 44W, on digital switch-over, what the few remaining issues relating to digital switch-over are that require to be resolved prior to the Government confirming the timetable for switch-over.  [212021]</p>




<p><a name="50201w08.html_spnew1"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 The remaining issues include the precise coverage requirement (number of transmitters to be converted, mode and power combinations), the regional order, the Technical Trial in Wales and most of all, consideration of the interests of the most vulnerable consumers.

 The Annual Public Library Statistics, published by the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy for the years 1999&#150;2000 to 2002&#150;03 (the latest available) show the overall expenditure by Wakefield libraries as follows:

<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para4">
The expenditure will be underpinned by funding from a number of sources, national, local and self-generated. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Feb 2005 : Column 786W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Non ring-fenced core funding for public libraries is paid to the 149 library authorities in England as part of the Local Government Finance Settlement. DCMS does not hold a precise figure but I understand that Wakefield has added some uplift to the 2004&#150;05 libraries budget and I commend them for that. I also understand that the Library Service itself has been energetic in forming partnerships and accessing external funding; this is also highly commendable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para5">
Wakefield&#039;s libraries, in common with those in the rest of the United Kingdom, are connected to the internet through a &#163;120 million national lottery grant, which established the People&#039;s Network.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w08.html_para6">
Additionally, my Department is funding the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council &#163;5 million over the three years ending 2005&#150;06 to implement the Framework for the Future Action Plan and Library Improvement Programme which is designed to encourage improvement across the public library sector in England generally.

<p><a name="50201w10.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 AIDS is a centrepiece of the British Government&#039;s agenda for the G8 presidency this year. By the end of 2005 DFID wants to have agreement among donors and the international system on a well co-ordinated and funded plan to tackle AIDS so that we can move forward on treatment, prevention, care for orphans as well as research into better treatments, vaccines and microbicides. DFID will also work to maintain momentum for HIV prevention and take forward efforts to bring together HIV prevention efforts with sexual and reproductive health services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w10.html_para1">
The UK supports efforts to provide increased, and eventually universal, access to treatment and care for people with AIDS. We support the WHO and UNAIDS &#039;3 by 5&#039; goal to provide anti-retroviral therapy to three million people in developing countries by the end of 2005, of which two million will be in Africa. DFID is advocating for equitable provision to women and children, and if appropriate, encourage a target of at least 50 per cent. of treatments being directed to women and children.

<a name="50201w10.html_para2">
A recent report (January 26) of the progress of the WHO programme showed us that in the second half of 2004, the number of people on ARV therapy in developing and transitional countries increased dramatically from 440,000 to an estimated 720,000. This shows that progress can be achieved with an effective, coordinated, sustained country led HIV/AIDS response. However, ARV treatment is only one element of the treatment needs of HIV positive people in poor countries, many of whom do not have access to good nutrition, clean water, antibiotics or even testing so that they know that they are positive.

<p><a name="50201w10.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 One third of the world&#039;s population still lacks access to essential medicines. The UK Government are committed to increasing access to medicines in developing countries, including for the treatment of HIV and AIDS. There has been significant progress in this area. A combination of increased donor 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Feb 2005 : Column 793W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
financing, competition from generic medicines, offers by research-based companies and improved health systems has led to a reduction in the price of first line antiretroviral medicines of as much as 98 per cent. over the last four years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w10.html_para3">
The UK Government have contributed to this reduction in prices in a number of ways. We worked with our international partners at the World Trade Organisation to reach the decision of 30 August 2003 allowing developing countries with no, or insufficient, manufacturing capacity in their pharmaceutical sector to import copies of patented medicines. These can be imported from countries such as India, following the issuing of a compulsory license in both the importing and exporting country. This important decision should help to increase the supply and availability of quality medicines.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w10.html_para4">
DFID has significantly increased its funding for AIDS related programmes, including for treatment. The Department has committed to spend at least &#163;1.5 billion on AIDS- related programmes over the next three years, and have doubled our funding to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria. Increased donor financing to buy medicines has contributed to the reduction in prices by increasing demand.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w10.html_para5">
DFID has also committed over &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 to strengthen developing country health systems. This includes support to pharmaceutical procurement systems. Good quality systems can help to reduce prices. In addition, the UK supports the World Health Organisation&#039;s (WHO)&#039;s work on &#039;pre-qualification&#039; which increases access to quality, affordable medicines&#151;both patent and generic&#151;in developing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w10.html_para6">
The UK Government have also worked directly with stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, to increase access to medicines. In 2001 the Prime Minister established a high level UK &quot;Working Group on Increasing Access to Essential Medicines in the Developing World&quot;. This reported in November 2002, recommending more support for research and development for diseases disproportionately affecting developing countries, and a global framework to facilitate voluntary, widespread, sustainable and predictable, differential pricing by pharmaceutical companies. This was followed in June 2004 by &quot;Increasing access to essential medicines in the developing world: UK Government policy and plans&quot;, which detailed how the UK Government are working in partnership with developing country governments, donors, international agencies, NGOs and the private sector to increase access to medicines.

 Despite the difficulties of estimating the effects of trade reform, World Bank figures indicate that eliminating all barriers to trade in goods would generate an extra US$250 billion&#151;$620 billion in global income, up to half of which would go to developing countries. They further estimate that a pro-poor outcome to the Doha Development Round of negotiations could reduce the number of people living on less than $2 a day by 144 million, with sub-Saharan Africa seeing the greatest reduction&#151;over 60 million.

We need to keep the Doha Development Agenda as ambitious as possible in order to realise these gains.

<p><a name="50201w13.html_spnew0"><b> Derek Twigg </b> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2005]:</i> The Department is deeply concerned about the distress bullying causes and the effect it has on lives and we are determined to help schools tackle the problem. Our guidance pack &#039;Bullying: Don&#039;t Suffer in Silence&#039;, the anti-bullying Charter and the anti-bullying website www.dfes.gov.uk/bullying offer detailed advice on preventing and addressing bullying.

<a name="50201w13.html_para0">
In November 2003 to June 2004 we ran a series of regional conferences, part of the &#039;Make The Difference&#039; campaign. These conferences, which were well attended, offered an opportunity for schools and other partners to share good practice on this issue and to learn at first hand about what has worked elsewhere. In July 2004 we funded the Anti-Bullying Alliance (ABA), a grouping of voluntary sector organisations, including Childline and the NSPCC. The Alliance works to support schools in addressing bullying behaviour. November 2004 saw the launch of the first ever National Anti-Bullying week which featured a variety of events including a Radio One campaign and a new public information film. An event on countering racist bullying will be taking place in March 2005.

[213126]</p>




<p><a name="50201w13.html_spnew1"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 We recognise the importance of ensuring that children are protected from domestic violence. In framing the regulations, guidance and staff training that will govern the operation of information sharing databases, or indexes, we will address protection from domestic violence. This will include the facility for certain details, such as an address, to be blocked out or not to appear on the index at all where a parent has good cause to believe that the inclusion of such information may lead to a crime being committed. It will include ensuring that training for index managers and users covers the right of the child to be protected from harm and the fact that this qualifies the right of a parent to access to information, for example, about a child&#039;s current address. We will also ensure that similar issues are addressed as appropriate in the guidance and training for introduction of the Common Assessment Framework.

My earlier response provided details of the Education and Youth parts of the council only, and indicated that colleagues at the Department for Culture, Media and Sport would be writing to you with a short summary of what happened on the culture part. However, I have since been advised that outcomes of all parts of council meetings should be provided by written parliamentary answer.

1. Incapacity benefit and severe disablement allowance figures are rounded to the nearest hundred. The figures include incapacity benefit credits-only cases.<br>

2. Disability living allowance and attendance Allowance figures are rounded to the nearest hundred. A change in methodology from 2002 means that, after that date, there is a small increase in case loads due to some terminated cases being included.<br>

3. Carer&#039;s allowance figures are rounded to the nearest five. The figure includes those entitled to carer&#039;s allowance but not receiving it due to overlapping benefit rules.<br>

2. Information for new deal for disabled people relates to people gaining a job and is from the start of the programme in July 2001 to March 2003.<br>

Information is not available on numbers leaving the programme.<br>

3. Information is not available on the length of time new deal 50 plus leavers have not claimed a benefit. Information provided is on those gaining a job and receiving the new deal 50 plus employment credit up to March 2003, and recorded job entries from April 2003 to October 2004.<br>

4. Information is not available on the length of time new deal for partners leavers have not claimed a benefit. National information for new deal for partners (on jobs gained) is for the period May 1999 (start of the programme) to March 2004. A regional breakdown is only available for the period April 2002 to March 2004.<br>

5. Information is taken from the DWP Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study which contains all benefit claims that can be linked to the records on the New Deal Evaluation Database. These records currently cover the period July 1999 to March 2004.<br>

6. The period July 1999 to March 2003 has been used for information provided on leavers from new deal for young people, new deal 25 plus and new deal for lone parents, and people gaining a job through new deal for disabled people, to allow a full 12 month period to elapse before subsequent benefit claims.<br>

7. The proportion not claiming a subsequent benefit does not include people who continued an existing benefit claim which started before the start of the job and continued after the job start.<br>

8. The working age benefits referred to are: jobseeker&#039;s allowance, income support, incapacity benefit, severe disability allowance, invalid carer&#039;s allowance, bereavement benefit, and widow&#039;s/widower&#039;s benefit.<br>

The quantity of files destroyed increases because the department continues to create large volumes of paper records, notably in case files, which once they reach the end of their business life are automatically destroyed.

 The Home Office has maintained a consistent approach to the retention and destruction of files. The requirements to keep records of Government business are set out in the Public Record Act. The National Archive (TNA) produces guidance that further details the requirement so that only material of historical significance is held and transferred to it for permanent preservation. That guidance sets out how long different types of record should be held for and a process for scheduling disposal. The Department has consistently followed this guidance to ensure that records are held for as long as required to meet business needs, that ephemeral material is then destroyed and that only material of long term historic value is transferred to TNA.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w19.html_para6">
Since 1999, the Home Office has produced 86 schedules for the disposal of records which are specific to its administrative activities.

<p>
<a name="50201w20.html_para5">
<i>(a)</i> The Council Decision provides for certain areas covered by Title IV of Part Three of the treaty establishing the European Community to be governed by the procedure referred to in Article 251 of the treaty. That procedure provides for qualified majority voting in the Council and the application of the co-decision procedure in the European Parliament. The move to QMV and co- decision is not new. The treaty of Amsterdam, in force since 1999, provided that five years after its entry into force, member states would take a unanimous decision to move some or all immigration and asylum measures to QMV and co-decision. Within the Nice treaty, in force since 2003, member states adopted a declaration slightly amending the Amsterdam arrangements. The move to QMV and co-decision for asylum measures became automatic, once common rules and basic principles had been agreed. Member states reaffirmed that they would endeavour to move remaining immigration measures, or parts of them, to QMV and co-decision from 1 May 2004 or as soon as possible thereafter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w20.html_para6">
<i>(b)</i> The Government supported the move to qualified majority voting because EU co-operation on asylum and immigration issues over the last five years has been valuable to the UK and we are keen to see measures in this area adopted without the delays experienced under unanimous voting in a Council of 25 member states. The Council decision has no effect on the UK&#039;s Title IV protocol, negotiated at Amsterdam. We will continue to be able to opt-in to immigration and asylum measures which are in the UK&#039;s interest. The decision also does not affect the UK&#039;s frontiers protocol, which allows us to maintain our own border controls.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the original deadlines for connecting the prison and probation services&#039; OASys IT systems have been met. [199895]</p>




<p><a name="50201w23.html_spnew2"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Roll out of the probation and prison OASys IT systems has gone well. The prison service completed its roll out by the end of 2004 and all probation areas have been using OASys IT since last summer. However our plans to connect the two systems are behind schedule.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w23.html_para0">
We decided that it made sense, first, to pilot a limited version of the software that would provide the connection between the two systems, with full deployment of the final version of the software to follow at a later date. At the beginning of 2004 our aim was to begin the pilot in July and have the final version ready for deployment in September, with a view to completing roll out across the probation service and prison service around the end of 2004.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Feb 2005 : Column 839W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w23.html_para1">
The pilot began in July as planned, linking one probation area to several prisons. However the effort needed to develop and support the pilot was greater than expected, which delayed completion of the final version of the software until the end of November. The final version is now in use across the prison service and in the pilot probation area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w23.html_para2">
Plans for roll out across the rest of the probation service have been put back in order to give priority to work that will enable OASys to support implementation of the sentencing provisions of the 2003 Criminal Justice Act in April. We now expect to achieve full connectivity between the prison and probation OASys IT systems by autumn 2005.

<p>
<a name="50201w23.html_para4">
In restructuring Stage 2, some elements, such as drill work and passing out parades, were removed. The approach of the modernised programme is to encourage student officers to take on increased personal responsibility for development, in particular their fitness. This philosophy should help to raise the long-term fitness of student officers, and help them maintain good fitness levels throughout their police careers.

 The investigation into the murder of Private Mario Clarke is being conducted by a Murder Investigation Team (MIT) from the Metropolitan Police Trident team. The MIT&#039;s strength is that of a normal MIT with one Detective Chief Inspector, three Detective Inspectors five, Detective Sergeants and 23 Detective Constables and support staff. Private Clarke&#039;s widow Deveen has been contacted in Jamaica by the Family liaison officers directly and in addition through other members of the family when her movements made communications difficult. An inquest into the murder was held on the 22 September 2004 by the coroner Mr Reid. The result was a verdict of unlawful killing. The Met have indicated that as Deveen Clarke did not attend the inquest it was not necessary to make public funds available.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much has been spent on <i>(a)</i> preparation, <i>(b)</i> publication and <i>(c)</i> delivery of &quot;The Sharp End&quot; magazine.  [210012]</p>




<p><a name="50201w25.html_spnew5"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 &quot;The Sharp End&quot; magazine is for frontline police officers, Community Support Officers and police staff. It aims to inform them about changes which are making a difference to their working lives. The Government have a duty to explain how its policies impact on this key audience, and our research shows they would welcome it.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w25.html_para4">
The Sharp End complements the local information police officers receive from their Chief Constables and other sources. The first issue included articles on new antisocial behaviour powers, best practice on cutting burglary, preserving scenes of crime and using new techniques such as automatic number plate recognition, the introduction of new equipment such as non-lethal weapons (&#039;tasers&#039;) and how officers can stay fit for their job.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w25.html_para5">
Total costs for the magazine this financial year have been &#163;588,604.94 which is broken down as follows:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(a)</i> Preparation: &#163;140,769.99&#151;this covered the research phase including production of a test issue of the magazine</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(b)</i> Publication: &#163;251,397.00&#151;this covers the design, production and printing of three issues of the magazine</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>(c)</i> Distribution: &#163;196,437.95&#151;this covers direct mailing of sample magazines to forces, distribution of three issues of the magazine, subscription list building and order fulfilment. These costs relate largely to the launch and set up of the magazine and therefore will reduce considerably next financial year.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w25.html_para6">
This represents good value for ensuring that all frontline police have information about issues affecting their working lives.

<p><a name="50201w26.html_wqn0"><b> Sandra Gidley: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what estimate he has made of the percentage of drug assisted sex attacks that go unreported;  [199964]
</p>



<p>(2) what plans he has to fund a campaign in the run-up to the Christmas party season to alert women to the dangers of leaving drinks unattended;  [199966]
</p>



<p>(3) what assessment he has made of the prevalence of <i>(a)</i> drink spiking and <i>(b)</i> drug rape following drink spiking. [199967]</p>




<p><a name="50201w26.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The recorded crime information collected centrally and held on the Home Office Court Proceedings, does not allow the separate identification of rapes involving drugs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w26.html_para0">
Results obtained by the Forensic Science Service from a study involving 1,014 cases of claimed drug facilitated sexual assault between 2000 and 2002 showed that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">2 per cent. of such cases were due to a deliberate administration of drugs intended to disinhibit the victim.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Alcohol was detected in 81 per cent. of cases where samples were taken soon enough to be able to detect it.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w26.html_para1">
Findings from the 2001 BCS Inter-Personal Violence Module found that in 5 per cent. of rape cases since age 16, victims said that they were drugged in some way. The BCS IPV module also suggests that only 15 per cent. of victims of serious sexual assault report it to the police.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w26.html_para2">
In November 2004 the Association of Chief Police Officers launched Operation Matisse, a six-month study which will assess the extent of drink spiking and sexual assault in seven police force areas. It is the first co-ordinated study on drug-facilitated sexual assault, and will provide valuable information on which effective action to tackle this particularly sinister crime can be based.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w26.html_para3">
The Government did not fund a campaign specifically to warn against drink-spiking in the run-up to Christmas. We believe that the consumption of alcohol, whether intentional or unsolicited, is a bigger factor than drugs in sexual assault, and we intend to focus awareness raising work on this issue, as part of the Alcohol Harm Reduction Programme for England.

 The Milliyetci Hareket Partisi (MHP) is a far-right nationalist party that currently holds no seats in the Turkish Parliament. An ANAR poll published on 18 January 2005 suggests that support for the MHP is still below the 10 per cent. threshold required for a party to enter parliament. Their attempts to block the passage of key EU harmonisation legislation on the death penalty and minority language rights when they were part of the previous coalition government was a matter of concern. The MHP has been particularly vehement in its rejection of any kind of cultural rights for the Kurds.

 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what his estimate is of the outstanding value of Legal Aid debts; and what action is being taken to recover these debts.  [211484]</p>




<p><a name="50201w32.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Lammy: </b> 
 The Legal Services Commission had debts due to it at the end of the financial year 2003&#150;04 of &#163;262 million. Much of this debt&#151;around 72 per cent.&#151;secured by the registration of a statutory charge against property and is not, generally, immediately collectable. The LSC allows the funded client to postpone the operation of the charge, subject to certain conditions, and the debt is not repayable until the property is sold or upon the death of the client.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w32.html_para6">
Cases relating to the statutory charge have since 1988 attached interest. The rate of interest is linked to the Bank of England base rate and currently stands at 5 per cent. simple interest. &#163;50 million of the gross debt due to the Commission relates to interest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50201w32.html_para7">
Other debts due to the LSC are normally immediately repayable and are pursued by a debt recovery team. In 2003&#150;04, the LSC successfully recovered &#163;28 million worth of debt. Some of these debts may be owed by funded clients (for example unpaid contributions towards funding legal aid) and are difficult to recover given the limited financial circumstances of the clients.

 There are no Government guidelines or legislative provisions regulating whether a referendum may be held during a general election, local election or devolved Parliament or regional assembly election.

The Government are aware of the views of the Electoral Commission published in 2003 ahead of Parliamentary and local government elections in Scotland and the Assembly elections in Wales and Northern Ireland that referendums should not be held at the same time as other major polls.

Since September 1997, the number of consultants in neurology has increased by 56 per cent., and we are working towards increasing their numbers further by expanding the number of specialist registrar (SpR) opportunities in the specialty. In addition, the number of nurses employed in the national health service has increased by 77,500 since 1997 and there are now around 1,250 general practitioners with special interests providing acute services in clinical specialities, including neurology. The new national MRI mobile scanning units are also adding over 15 per cent., more diagnostic capacity to the NHS and the independent sector will provide additional staff to ease pressure on existing NHS diagnostic teams.

It is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs), in partnership with local providers, to assess the needs of their local community, to commission services and to identify the resources and number of professional staff that they need to deliver those services.

The duration of post-registration training varies greatly and as service and training costs are closely related it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the total cost of training.

Note:<br>

Costs for years three to five are estimates as the actual cost to the national health service of providing clinical placements for medical undergraduates is not known. The cost in year six is the level at which funding is provided centrally. It does not include various additional costs such as out-of-hours payments, which are met by employing trusts.<br>

<i>[holding answer 25 January 2005]:</i> The introduction of assistant practitioners and advanced practitioners in radiology departments is one of a range of initiatives that are contributing to an increase in workforce capacity. This is being supported by a national radiography recruitment and retention project, which is encouraging the expansion through the use of innovative skill mix and career escalator models. &#163;3.4 million has been made available to support this.

<p><a name="50201w38.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton: </b> 
 It is the responsibility of primary care trusts (PCTs) to assess and make provision for the healthcare needs of their local communities. PCTs have the resources to commission services and identify the number of professional staff that they need to deliver those services. The flexibilities provided by the new general medical services (QMS) and alternative provider medical services (APMS) contracts will assist PCTs in securing local workforce capacity. In addition, the Department is working closely with those PCTs who have been identified as having specific problems in general practitioner and other health professional recruitment. This work will be disseminated to share good practice across all PCTs, strategic health authorities and deaneries. &quot;NHS Employers&quot;, the new employers organisation for the national health service, will provide advice and support to local NHS organisations still experiencing recruitment difficulties.

A range of recruitment and retention initiatives are in place to help expand the NHS workforce across England. These include improving pay and conditions, encouraging the NHS to become a better, more flexible and diverse employer, help with accessing child care, increasing training, attracting back returners and running national and international recruitment campaigns. As a result of these measures, between September 1997 and March 2004, the total number of qualified nurses employed in the NHS has increased by 77,500. The primary care workforce has also expanded. Between September 1997 and September 2003, the
