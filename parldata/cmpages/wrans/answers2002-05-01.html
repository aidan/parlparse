<a name="20501w01.html_wqn0"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will issue guidance to waste disposal authorities to advise them not to enter into long-term waste disposal contracts prior to the conclusions of the review into waste policy being undertaken by the Performance and Innovation Unit.  [23187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2001]:</i> This should not be necessary since such contracts should be designed so as to provide sufficient flexibility to be able to take account of and respond to changed circumstances during the lifetime of the contracts, including any future statutory performance standards or new opportunities for increasing recycling and composting.

<a name="20501w01.html_wqn1"><B> Nick Harvey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what the average fine imposed on people who imported illegal meats into the country has been in each of the past 10 years; and if she will make a statement;  [51771]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many people have <i>(a)</i> been arrested and <i>(b)</i> received a fine for importing illegal meats into the country in each of the past 10 years; and if she will make a statement.  [51775]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Central records are not available for a 10-year period.
<P>

<a name="20501w01.html_para0">Last year, HM Customs and Excise arrested three people for offences under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) involving illegal meat imports. Of these, two were convicted as a CITES offence, both received prison sentence of four months. The third person was acquitted but convicted under a separate Animal Health charge resulting in a penalty of a conditional discharge for one year and costs of &#163;100.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Carmichael: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if radioactive waste material is used to produce <i>(a)</i> consumer goods and <i>(b)</i> other products within the UK; and which manufacturing sectors use radioactive waste in the production of their products.  [51979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Radioactively contaminated metal, such as that recovered from decommissioned nuclear plant, is sometimes sold on to the scrap metal market after it has been treated to reduce its radioactivity content. In order to allow the metal to be sold, its radioactivity level must be below the 0.4 Becquerel/gram regulatory exemption 



<P>
<P><I>1 May 2002 : Column 774W</I><P>
level set out in Schedule 1 of the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 and the Substances of Low Activity (SOLA) Exemption Order. The material is then no longer considered to be radioactive. Once it has been sold on to the scrap metal market, it is not possible to identify the products or manufacturing sectors in which it is used.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations she is making in respect of EU plans to review active ingredients in agro-chemical products; and if she will make a statement on the impact that rapid phasing out active ingredients will have on small UK agro-chemical businesses.

<P>

 The Department has played an active role in supporting the EU review programme for older pesticides. We believe that it is vital to ensure that all active ingredients used in pesticides meet modern standards of human and environmental safety.
<P>

<a name="20501w02.html_para0">I recognise that a significant number of pesticide products will be withdrawn as a result of the review process and this will have an impact on some small agro-chemical companies. I believe that there will also be new opportunities particularly for companies developing environmentally friendly alternative methods of plant protection including certain microbial products. In developing the EU pesticides regime we will endeavour to ensure that the regulatory requirements for such products are proportionate to the risks they pose.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w02.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 There is no requirement in the Commons Registration Act 1965, or other legislation, for the Commons Registration Authorities to be notified when grazing rights are separated from the land with which they were previously associated. Consequently no figures on the number of cases are available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the implications of the House of Lords ruling in the case Bettison v Langton and others for the future management and protection of common land.  [53020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w02.html_spnew3"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Bettison v Langton judgment made it conclusive in law that rights of common of grazing, registered for a fixed number of animals as required by the Commons Registration Act 1965, could be severed from the common land to which they were originally attached. This judgment could have significant implications for the management of common land.
<P>

<a name="20501w02.html_para1">We have already issued guidance to the Commons Registration Authorities on how to record severance on the register of common land if they are notified it has taken place. In the consultation document "Greater Protection and Better Management of Common Land in England and Wales" we invited views on the idea of preventing severance. We expect to announce our conclusions soon.

<P>
<a name="20501w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2002]:</i> The Department has no plans to ban imports of fruit treated with carbaryl. Carbaryl has been withdrawn from use in the UK because it was not supported by any agrochemical companies, when the relevant approvals were reviewed. However, it remains approved in other countries including some in the EC.
<P>

<a name="20501w02.html_para2">Residues of carbaryl in imported fruit are controlled through the Pesticides (Maximum Residue Levels in Crops, Food and Feeding Stuffs) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999 (as amended).

<P>
<a name="20501w02.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 As set out in paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 1 to the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949, it is a statutory requirement to hold a local inquiry if an objection is duly made by a local authority and not withdrawn, Otherwise, if any representation or objection duly made, for example by a statutory body or a member of the public, is not withdrawn, the Secretary of State has the discretion either to cause a local inquiry to be held or to afford any person who has made a representation or objection the opportunity of being heard by a person appointed for the purpose. As well as whether or not to hold an inquiry, the Secretary of State has some discretion to determine its scope. An announcement will be made soon.

 As I have previously said, the time to take stock of all the aspects of the role and activities of Sea Fisheries Committees will be once we know the outcome of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20501w03.html_para0">Waters around the UK are regularly patrolled by surveillance aircraft equipped to detect pollution. The data held for 2001&#150;02 by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) indicate that more than 150 such flights were made under arrangements put in place by the MCA and that more than 20 per cent. of these flights covered the west or south-west of the UK and would therefore have covered part of the Bristol channel. In addition, civil and military pilots are encouraged to report sightings of pollution. Every incident spotted, or reported, is investigated and, whenever possible, those parties responsible for committing pollution offences are prosecuted.
<P>

<a name="20501w03.html_para1">The UK also has legislation in place to ensure a properly planned system of waste reception facilities in ports, in order to leave no excuse for ships to resort to the unacceptable practice of discharging their waste at sea. The MCA has approved 36 waste management plans for ports or parts of ports around the Bristol channel, an area of coastline stretching from Milford Haven to Newquay. In 2000, the European Community adopted a directive to establish a port waste reception facilities system across the Community; like other member states, the UK is working on the implementation of this directive, which will come into force in December of this year.

 Implementing rural proofing is an on-going process across Government. Individual Departments and the Countryside Agency are working together to develop rural proofing strategies and to rural proof individual policies. DEFRA officials are also involved. As the agency's first annual report recommends, the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Rural Renewal will review progress in the autumn, and take a close and continuing interest in the subject generally. The Countryside Agency will report again next year on progress with rural- proofing, so there is a regular external monitoring and evaluation process.

<a name="20501w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Since the tragic death of Private Simon Jeans, our consular staff in London and Zagreb have offered full consular assistance to his family. It is difficult to be precise on the exact numbers of contacts and representations made with them, but there have been many. We approached the Croatian courts on numerous occasions for information about the case, and attended all court hearings with Private Jeans' family. Our consular division in London last spoke with Simon Jeans' father, Terry, in May 2001, and our pro-consul in Split last met with Mr. Jeans in August 2001, when he visited Croatia.
<P>

<a name="20501w03.html_para3">The hon. Member will be aware that Private Jeans was a serving member of the British Army at the time of his death. As such, the Ministry of Defence was and continue to be the lead Department in this case. Private Jeans' family are aware there is very little our consular staff can do with regards to the case in Croatia, as it is now a legal matter. Under international law we are unable to get involved in the judicial process of other countries. Nevertheless, Mr. Jeans and the MOD have been in regular touch.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what the Government's position is on the European Commission's phase-in proposals for the receipt by newly admitted member states of the European Union of <i>(a)</i> funds due under the Common Agricultural Policy and <i>(b)</i> structural funds.  [51623]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w03.html_spnew8"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> The Government consider that agricultural spending should support restructuring in the candidate countries to modernise their agricultural economies. The Government therefore welcome the emphasis on rural development in the Commission's proposals as this is the most effective way to help new member states restructure agriculture sectors. As regards the proposal to phase in direct payments, the Government note the arguments provided in the Commission's issues paper about the damaging effects of high direct payments in the new member states. The Government consider it important to evaluate fully all relevant aspects, including whether other options may better help restructuring.
<P>

<a name="20501w03.html_para4"><i>(b)</i> The Government welcome the emphasis within the overall financing proposals on Structural and Cohesion Funds, to tackle the new member states' restructuring and developmental needs. The sums provided will need to respect the budget ceilings agreed at Berlin in 1999, as well as the needs and the absorption capacity of the new member states.

 In my statement on ITV Digital on 26 April 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 594, I promised that I would continue to keep the House updated in coming weeks. Since then, the administrator has surrendered the three multiplex service licences held by ITV Digital, and the pay services are no longer available.
<P>

<a name="20501w04.html_para1">As I suggested would happen in my statement last week, the Independent Television Commission is now beginning a re-tendering process, on an accelerated time scale with a view to awarding licences at the end of a six-week period. I understand that, during this period, the ITC will liaise with the administrator and broadcasters providing the digital terrestrial free-to-air services with a view to ensuring that ITV Digital subscribers will continue to be able to receive these channels, including the five main terrestrial channels, through their set top box. We expect that companies interested may wish to use the ITV Digital assets, and that they will liaise with the administrator to do so. There is a real opportunity to benefit from the expertise and technical experience now existing, enabling a successful business to emerge, and ensuring we maintain our world leadership in digital television.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w04.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My Department gives no financial support to Granada and Carlton. To promote the availability of digital free-to-air television services, the Government have set the percentage of qualifying multiplex revenue payable by digital terrestrial licensees at nil for the duration of their licences. This means that the ITV companies do not make payments to the Treasury on the proportion of their advertising revenue attributed to viewing in homes that have digital television.

 <i>[holding answer 29 April 2002]:</i> Any disruption of tourism will be unwelcome, but weekend closures, while disruptive to tourism, are unavoidable if essential work is to take place. Any closures are considered by Railtrack, train operating companies, the relevant rail passenger committees and the Strategic Rail Authority. I am advised the weekend closures are preferable to closures during the week which would cause wider disruption for business as well as leisure travellers. The closures have been planned to avoid the Commonwealth games. The tourism industry, like other business sectors, will be looking forward to benefiting from the main line upgrade. Improved rail services are essential to ensure the long-term health of the tourism industry in the north-west.

Sport England provides over &#163;6 million of exchequer funding to sports governing bodies and all are required to ensure that they have proposals for the development of women as a condition of funding. Sport England also fund the Women's Sports Foundation (WSF) which is the only organisation in the UK that is solely committed to improving and promoting opportunities for women and girls in sport at every level. More women than ever are finding that regular physical exercise can lead to improvements in health, self-confidence and well-being. Women's team sports such as football and rugby are among the fastest-growing sports in the country.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) how many training jumps from <i>(a)</i> balloons and <i>(b)</i> aircraft recruits to the Parachute Regiment are required to make as part of their training;  [52592]
<P>
<UL>(2) what aircraft are used by the Royal Air Force to provide parachute training for recruits to the parachute regiment; and if he will make a statement on the adequacy of capacity to provide this basic training.  [52593]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Recruits to the parachute regiment are required to complete a minimum of eight jumps from aircraft in order to qualify as a military parachutist. The use of balloons ceased in 1995. Basic parachute training is carried out from RAF Brize Norton and the aircraft used are a Skyvan, for an initial familiarisation jump, and a C130 Hercules, for the remaining qualifying jumps. During the last financial year, four basic parachute courses were cancelled due to Hercules aircraft unavailability, caused by operational commitments. Although this has had no effect on the ability of the regiment to carry out its assigned duties we are currently looking at how greater use of the Skyvan could reduce the Hercules requirement to support the basic parachute course to the essential minimum number of jumps that must be done from the operational platform.

 Contracts have been placed with five laboratories to carry out a pilot study to determine a test that will identify the presence of depleted uranium in urine.

 I am pleased to support the Budget measures announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 17 April.

Herefordshire has an above-average number of small businesses, which will benefit from a reduction in the starting rate of corporation tax from 10 per cent. to zero and a 10 per cent. cut in the small companies' rate; a reduction in the red tape and compliance costs imposed by the VAT and payroll administration systems; and a new &#163;30 million training fund to bring small businesses up to the Investors in People industry standard. Further details of these measures, and of other measures to benefit businesses of all sizes, can be found on www.budget.treasury.gov.uk.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced on 18 December 2001 that, following an adverse report by the Competition Commission under the Fair Trading Act 1973, she had accepted undertakings from the four main supermarket chains that they would abide by a Code of Practice concerning their relations with their suppliers.
<P>

<a name="20501w07.html_para1">Normally undertakings are negotiated by the Director General of Fair Trading with the parties who will be asked to sign them; there is no third party involvement. Exceptionally, at the recommendation of the Competition Commission, supplier organisations were in this case given the opportunity to comment on a draft.
<P>

<a name="20501w07.html_para2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry received around 35 representations on the Code before it was issued on 18 December, and around five afterwards.
<P>

<a name="20501w07.html_para3">The Code came into force on 17 March 2002. The Director General of Fair Trading will monitor the operation of the Code.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w07.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The TRIPs agreement allows the Governments of WTO member states to decide for themselves whether to allow the patenting of plants in their own countries. However, the agreement does require WTO member states to protect plant varieties by other legal means if patents are not available. The UK supports this flexibility in the agreement and there are no plans to remove it.
<P>

<a name="20501w07.html_para4">The TRIPs agreement also confirms the internationally established principle that it is not possible to be granted a valid patent for something which is already known. According to this principle, neither traditional varieties of staple food crops nor related traditional knowledge can be patentable in themselves, even in countries where the patenting of plants is allowed.

 The Government have not yet put any formal proposals to the European Commission for its Third Report on Economic and Social Cohesion, which is not due to be published until late 2003 or early 2004. However, from my statement at the Namur Informal Council on Regional Policy in July 2001, the Commission will be aware of the Government's view that the next reform of the Structural Funds must ensure that they contribute better to the Lisbon agenda of improving Europe's competitiveness and modernising its economies. Improvements are needed in both the effectiveness of the funds and the means to evaluate their impact and added value. Also, greater efforts must be made to simplify the funds and remove unnecessary bureaucracy, while maintaining proper financial control.

I have placed a copy in the Libraries of the House. As well as regular contacts between my officials and business players, we are planning, in conjunction with the FCO, an expanded programme of activities for 2002, including speaking events, newsletters and a new enlargement section on DTI's website.

<P>

<a name="20501w08.html_para14">We have also reformed the teachers' pay system to ensure that those teachers who perform well are well rewarded. The introduction of the threshold for experienced teachers, leading to the upper pay scale, has provided a career structure which will allow our best classroom teachers, in time, to earn over &#163;32,000 at today's rates, excluding additional allowances. And we have implemented cost of living pay rises at above inflation rates for all teachers in each of the last four years.
<P>

<a name="20501w08.html_para15">All teachers working in the London area are paid mandatory London allowances on top of their basic salary. These allowances were increased last year by 30 per cent. and are currently inner&#151;&#163;3,105; outer&#151;&#163;2,043; and fringe&#151;&#163;792. In addition, schools are able to pay recruitment and retention allowances to individual teachers of up to &#163;5,262 per annum. Schools can decide to pay this as a lump sum covering up to three years.
<P>

<a name="20501w08.html_para16">It is open to local authorities to help teachers with housing, relocation and travel costs through the Recruitment and Retention Fund established by my Department. We have made &#163;77 million available to 2003 for this purpose. And we have made &#163;250 million available to 2004 to help key public sector workers, particularly nurses, teachers and police, to buy homes in or near the communities they serve through our starter home initiative scheme.

 The ending of Government recognition of national training organisations (NTOs) and the licensing of sector skills councils are separate issues. 



<P>
<P><I>1 May 2002 : Column 803W</I><P>
Organisations formerly with NTO status are independent bodies led by employers, often with responsibilities wider than those which were required for NTO recognition. The continued funding and operation of these organisations is therefore a decision for the board of each body. New contracts have been awarded by my Department to 62 former NTOs from April 2002 for the delivery of specific essential work in support of occupational development. These contracts will conclude on 31 August 2002. The new Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA), working with other public agencies, will make arrangements for the delivery of essential work to support occupational development from September 2002.
<P>

<a name="20501w09.html_para1">Sector Skills Councils (SSCs) represent a new deal with employers across the UK to improve skills and productivity performance in significant industry and business sectors. SSCs provide the opportunity for collective action by employers, in partnership and with the support of Government, to identify sector skills priorities and lead action to meet them. There is no timetable for introducing the new network as the decision to form a SSC rests with employers. Where employers want to form a SSC, and can meet the published SSC standard for the award of a licence, my Department will supplement employers' investment by contributing up to &#163;1 million each year to support the Council's core work.

<a name="20501w09.html_para2">Employers in the construction, engineering and hospitality sectors have yet to make a formal expression of interest to the SSDA about forming a SSC for their sectors.

 It is our policy that all parties to an appeal should be discouraged from delaying its consideration.

Where an inquiry is to be held the Planning Inspectorate's aim, in every case, is to fix as early an inquiry date as possible. Each principal party to an appeal is only permitted one refusal of a date offered for the inquiry before a date, time and place for the inquiry is fixed.

<a name="20501w10.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The four new schemes recognised in the regulations are voluntary, and offer small businesses the opportunity, should they wish to take it up, to save money through not having to go through local authority building control. This is particularly important in relation to replacement glazing where as a result of changes we made to Part L of the regulations&#151;that part dealing with the conservation of fuel and power, it became controlled fitting and subject to building control.
<P>

<a name="20501w10.html_para9">The Fenestration Self Assessment Scheme (FENSA) was introduced to ease the burden of this change. We estimate that the typical cost of going through local authority building control for replacement glazing would be about &#163;120 for a contract with a value of less than &#163;2,000. Overall we have estimated the cost of not introducing self-certification to be &#163;106,400,000 in the first year, and the overall financial benefit to be &#163;104,685,000.

<a name="20501w11.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 From the figures in the regulatory impact analysis we undertook prior to making statutory instrument No. 440, we estimate that the average saving per window installation contract would be around &#163;117 compared to using local authority building control. In relation to consultation I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on Tuesday 23 April 2002, to my hon. Friend the Member for Crosby (Mrs. Curtis-Thomas), <i>Official Report,</i> columns 179W-80W.
<P>

<a name="20501w11.html_para0">There will be no requirement to demonstrate compliance with these regulations prior to the sale of a house. However, prior to the sale of a property, a search may reveal that the installation of a window has taken place without either the issue of a certificate from a person registered with the Fenestration Self-Assessment Scheme (FENSA), or evidence of a building notice given to a local authority. This though is highly unlikely to prevent the sale of a house, although in some circumstances it could delay the process. Householders would be advised in any event to keep receipts and other such records necessary to ensure a smooth transition during the sale of any property. In relation to publicity, I am pleased with the level of public awareness in relation to the changes so far. However, I will keep the situation under review and if there is evidence that more publicity is required, we shall provide it. I do not, at this stage, see any need for direct mailing of merchants, builders or retailers.

 Our comprehensive agenda for reform of the local government finance system was set out in last December's White Paper "Strong Local leadership&#151;Quality Public Services". Our finance reforms will give councils more space to innovate and respond in ways that are appropriate to local circumstances by providing local authorities with greater freedom to borrow, invest, trade, charge and set spending priorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w12.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Since 1997 the Department has produced a number of good practice guidance documents for transport operators on what actions they can take to protect their staff from assaults at work. The guidance covers the training of staff, the recording and monitoring of incidents, and management practices which could help staff who have been assaulted. For example, earlier this month we published guidance and a good practice case studies report on improving personal security in bus travel for passengers and staff.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what proposals the Government have to increase the number of night buses and night bus routes.  [53644]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w13.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Whether to provide night bus services is primarily a matter for commercial operators outside London, and for Transport for London. Local authorities outside London may however subsidise the provision of a service where they consider it necessary. There are already night bus services operating in a number of towns and cities.
<P>

<a name="20501w13.html_para1">Bus services in London are the responsibility of the Mayor and Transport for London. They have already made significant improvements in night bus services and more are planned. For example, 16 new night bus routes have been introduced since April 2000, and frequencies have increased on many others. There has also been a 20 per cent. growth in the number of night bus passengers in London in the last year.
<P>

<a name="20501w13.html_para2">As a devolved matter under the Scotland Act 1998, bus services in Scotland are primarily a matter for the Scottish Executive. I understand that the frequency of night bus services in Glasgow will be increased from 26 May.

 <i>[holding answer 30 April 2002]:</i> In 1999&#150;2000 support for asylum seekers was provided by the Department for Social Security (now Department for Work and Pensions), the Department of Health and the Home Office. The Department of Social Security (DSS) provided support to those asylum seekers who made their application for asylum at a port of entry until such time as an initial decision was made on the claim. But the costs of support provided by the DSS were met by the Home Office. The Department of Health was responsible for funding the support costs of unaccompanied asylum seeking children. The Home Office was responsible for payment of grant to local authorities who were supporting asylum seekers who had either applied for asylum in country or who, having applied at a United Kingdom port of entry, had received an initial negative decision on their claim and were appealing against that decision.
<P>

<a name="20501w13.html_para13">In 2000&#150;01 support for asylum seekers was mainly provided by the Home Office. Support was provided either directly by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) or by grant paid to local authorities to meet the direct costs of those supported under the interim provisions. In 2000&#150;01 the grant to social services departments caring for unaccompanied asylum seeking children was also met by the Home Office. The DSS provided support for those asylum seekers who applied for asylum at a port of entry prior to 3 April 2000 and who had not received an initial decision on their claim. Again these costs were met by the Home Office.

 <i>[holding answer 26 April 2002]:</i> There are no classes of offences for which bail is either automatically granted or refused. The Bail Act 1976 establishes a presumption in favour of bail and then sets out exceptions to this presumption, so that the defendant need not be granted bail where he or she presents a bail risk. For example, where there are substantial grounds for believing that if released on bail the defendant would fail to return to court, would commit an offence, interfere with witnesses or otherwise obstruct the course of justice. Each decision is at the discretion of the courts and each case is considered on its own merits.

The primary aim of this technology would be to improve document security by the addition of a machine readable biometrics templates. Smart card technology would be one option for data storage. Other options are optical memory, 2D bar codes and magnetic strip. The use of smart card (i.e. microcomputer chip) technology would be expensive but would also provide the opportunity to develop other applications, particularly if used on a passport card. These investigations have centred on technology standards and the experience of other Governments and organisations using electronic data storage for biometric templates.

This information comes from the Youth Justice Board. I will write to the hon. Member with police force area breakdowns as soon as they are available. 40 of the parenting orders imposed following a crime by the child have resulted in breach action. Discharge and other breach statistics are not routinely collected.

 The facility at Belmarsh is designated as a High Secure Unit. Any person wishing to have an open visit with a category A prisoner, irrespective of whether that prisoner (convicted or on remand) is located in the Unit or elsewhere at Belmarsh, is required to submit to the prison an application form and two passport sized photographs of themselves. A security check is then undertaken, generally by the relevant police authority. Once those checks are complete, a decision on whether to allow the applicant to have open visits is then made.
<P>

<a name="20501w17.html_para0">The 33 prisoners currently located in the High Secure Unit have made a total of 196 applications for visitors to be made 'approved visitors' and receive open visits. Of this number 72 visitors have been cleared for open visits, 16 are currently receiving discretionary closed visits and 108 are awaiting clearance.
<P>

<a name="20501w17.html_para1">Applications from the prisoner for a person to become an approved visitor are normally processed within 24 hours of receipt by the issue of the appropriate form for the visitor to complete. Returned forms from the visitor are normally processed within 48 hours of receipt and passed to the relevant police authority. Upon completion of police checks, a final decision is then taken by the prison, normally within 48 hours. Time taken for visitors to return application forms and for the police to complete appropriate checks is beyond the control of the prison.

 The facility at Belmarsh is designated as a High Secure Unit (HSU). All prisoners in the unit can arrange visits as set out in the guidelines of Standing Order 5 and subject to those visitors being on the Approved Visitors Scheme. Convicted prisoners receive two visiting orders per month, plus a further visiting order should they be on the enhanced level of the incentive and earned privileges (IEP) scheme. Those prisoners held on remand receive two visiting orders per week, plus a further visiting order should they be on the enhanced level of the IEP Scheme.

<P>

<a name="20501w17.html_para5">The computer managed telephone system allows for the duration of calls to be no more than 15 minutes. However, there is no limit to the number of calls any prisoner may make during the association period. Each prisoner may have a maximum amount of credit in his telephone account of &#163;60 on which to spend on calls, except for those classed as foreign nationals, where no maximum limit exists.

 The facility at Belmarsh is designated as a High Secure Unit. All prisoners (whether on remand or convicted) may apply to the education department for assistance and advice on educational matters. Work is undertaken on a self study basis, although there are no vocational training courses. A basic skills analysis has also been undertaken to identify the individual needs of prisoners which also took into account the fact that a number were foreign nationals. Prisoners have access to computer facilities, which may be used whenever they are unlocked and on association.

 In September 2000 the Government established an Organised Crime Task Force in Northern Ireland. The task force, which I chair, bring the various agencies that can make a difference, such as the police service of Northern Ireland and HM Customs and Excise to agree crime types for concerted multi-agency action. The agencies have scored a number of notable successes against smuggling gangs and other organised criminals over the past year, including the largest ever UK seizure (over 42 million) of smuggled cigarettes at Warrenpoint in November 2001. In February 2002 the police broke up a heroin distribution network and charged 15 people with serious drug offences.

 The conclusion, and the continuing implementation, of the agreement itself are great achievements for inclusivity, drawing into Government people from across both major traditions. Northern Ireland can be proud of them. But it is the responsibility for all in public life in Northern Ireland to ensure that no part of either community there feels left behind by the process, and that all aspirations are fully respected.

<a name="20501w18.html_spnew3"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 I am grateful for the opportunity to highlight the efforts being made in Northern Ireland by the PSNI to get the "don't do drugs" message across to children in our schools. It is an essential part of the overall anti-drugs strategy, with education at one end of the spectrum allied to detection and prosecution at the other. The PSNI recognises the value of including the anti-drugs message in the Citizenship and Safety Education (CASE) Programme which provides a platform for them to work in partnership with teachers and parents. The overarching aim is to encourage responsible behaviour in young people and empower them to live safely and that must include avoidance of drugs.
<P>

<a name="20501w18.html_para0">It is of course impossible to say precisely how effective the incorporation of the drugs education programme is in terms of numbers deterred from drug abuse, but the theme is "Education", recognising that it is better to education the young on prevention than simply to concentrate on catching offenders.

<a name="20501w18.html_spnew5"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Police Service of Northern Ireland recognises the importance of education in promoting individual safety for young people and families and to help create safer communities. The Citizen and Safety Education (CASE) Programme has been developed in an attempt to establish close links between the police and the school community through the central themes of Protection, Education and Prevention. CASE provides a platform for police to work in partnership with teachers and parents. Together, they seek to present information and promote skills, attitudes and values, which encourage responsible behaviour in young people and empower them to live safely.
<P>

<a name="20501w18.html_para1">The issues covered in the programme include the role of the police, vandalism, bullying, peer pressure, stranger danger, road safety, internet safety, abuse, respecting others, young people and the law, underage drinking, solvent abuse and drugs and the law. Over 80 officers are involved in the CASE programme and it is hoped to significantly increase that number for the next academic year. Of the 1,182 schools in Northern Ireland, PSNI is currently working in 940, focusing on pupils at Key Stages I, II and III.

 At the talks at Weston Park last summer, both the Irish and UK Governments recognised that there is an issue to be addressed, with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of organisations now on ceasefire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before 10 April 1998. Such people would, if convicted, stand to benefit from the early release scheme. The Governments accept that it would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued. Consideration continues of the best way to discharge this commitment.

 Power sector reform is a key development challenge for India. In many states, power subsidies take a large proportion of the government budget, squeezing out expenditure on anti-poverty programmes. A high quality power supply is also critical for economic growth.
<P>

<a name="20501w20.html_para1">DFID is supporting the reform and restructuring of the power sector in three states, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. Power sector reform is highly complex and also new to India, and assistance has been requested from DFID and other donors to help design and carry forward the structural changes needed to reform the sector and place it on a proper commercial footing.
<P>

<a name="20501w20.html_para2">In all three states, DFID is making available assistance, including experts with international experience of successfully carrying out similar work, following competitive tendering processes to ensure maximum value for money. Most of the support so far has been provided by Indian experts, even when international companies have been engaged. Expatriate inputs are limited to specialist areas where international experience is of greatest benefit and local expertise is not available. These are long term projects, designed to respond flexibly to local needs. They are reviewed regularly, including market comparisons to ensure that value for money is maintained.
<P>

<a name="20501w20.html_para3">In Andhra Pradesh, considerable progress has been made in helping the state government achieve its objectives on power reform, but the process has been more difficult and has taken longer than originally envisaged.

 Since 1997 my Department has committed almost &#163;11 million in support of the Rwanda Revenue Project. This particular project began in September 1999 and finished in March 2002, with a budget of &#163;2.3 million.
<P>

<a name="20501w20.html_para6">In April 2000, DFID concluded that management capacity problems in the RRA were more severe than at first thought and DFID inputs were increased accordingly.

By the end of the project, we had succeeded in reforming the corporate services and management of the RRA. Proper financial organisation had been put in place; and information technology strategy had been developed and implemented; training in internal audit procedures had been completed; the RRA were acting on the recommendations made in an organisation and staffing review; and the RRA had a corporate plan in place, against which they were measuring their own performance.

<a name="20501w20.html_para7">Our assessment is that this project has achieved good value for money.

 The Rural Access Programme in Nepal is an ambitious programme of rural transport infrastructure and related activities aimed at eliminating rural poverty.

<P>

<P>

<a name="20501w20.html_para9">The outcome of this review is that there will be improved modalities for working in conflict affected areas and on conflict issues. This will include working with organisation with an established local presence and by strengthening and empowering existing groups and adopting working methods that bridge the divides giving rise to the current conflict. Also, there will be a reduction in the numbers of international consultants without compromising quality and supervision, through a more rapid localisation of key positions in the technical assistance team.

<P>

<a name="20501w20.html_para10">An improvement in revenue collection became clear from late 2000. During the last year of the project the VAT department exceeded its revenue targets, the RRA modernised its tax and customs departments and revenue collections were also on target. It is our assessment that this project has achieved good value for money, initially through rebuilding the capacity of the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) which had been shattered by the genocide, and then through significant improvements in revenue collection.
<P>

<a name="20501w20.html_para11">The Rwandan Minister of Finance has described the project as DFID's most important support to Rwanda.

 Technical Assistance for Public Enterprise Reform in Orissa is a component of the Orissa Public Sector Reforms project, the purpose of which is to help the Government of Orissa allocate increased resources to the needs of the poor and improve the effectiveness of its resource use in order to reduce poverty. The assistance has been provided by international consultants selected following a competitive tendering process; Indian experts are also involved. An independent evaluation of the project was conducted in November 2001. It included both value for money considerations and technical review.

 Introduction of VAT is a complex and difficult process and DFID was asked for technical assistance to help the Government of Andhra Pradesh ensure that they were ready to implement the new system by the original target date of April 2002.

<P>

<a name="20501w20.html_para13">DFID has regularly monitored the project. The last annual review in December 2001 concluded that the project was completely on track, resulting in Andhra Pradesh being one of the few states in India ready for the target date.

 Phase 1 of the Western India Rainfed Farming project gave an economic rate of return of about 40 per cent. and had a substantial impact in reducing the poverty of over 50,000 poor tribal people. Phase II, which began in 1999, is expanding the coverage to over 500,000 people.
<P>

<a name="20501w20.html_para14">The 2002 annual review of Phase II found that the project is well on the way to achieving its objectives, and is having a significant impact on the lives of the poor in the project area.

 DFID awarded a three-year contract for the management of the Russian President's Management Training Initiative (Main Phase) to the British Council under a waiver of competition in March 1999. The waiver was granted at that time, as the British Council was the only UK company with the necessary expertise to undertake this work. In order to ensure the key consideration of value for money, a Project Compliance Investigation was undertaken prior to contracting which confirmed that the British Council costs offered value for money. A comprehensive review of the performance of the project was undertaken by DFID's Eastern Europe and Central Asia Department in June 2001. The review team concluded that the project has been going well and its purpose "to achieve improvements in the performance of 540 enterprise managers" was likely to be completely or largely achieved and still offered value for money.

In Anguilla, up-to-date financial accounting systems were successfully commissioned in the Treasury Department and the Ministry of Finance in January 2001; and we are considering further possible support to provide on-line access for other Anguillan Government Departments. The real test of project success will be the extent to which the information and data that it provides is used effectively. It is too early properly to assess this, but we shall be monitoring progress carefully.

 The Technical Co-operation Training Scheme for Jamaica came under DFID's global TCTP, which provided a centrally administered mechanism for giving training awards to overseas candidates linked to our individual country programmes. The programme in Jamaica ended in 1998. Value for money considerations were taken into account when the contract for running the global programme was awarded to the managing agent. The impact of the training in terms of contribution to individual project objectives in Jamaica was assessed as part of our regular project monitoring procedures.

 The Adult Morbidity and Mortality Project (Phase 2) provides quality health and poverty data from four selected districts, which is used to inform national public policies. In Tanzania, like many low income countries, vital registration systems are barely used, and large scale surveys can only be undertaken every five years or so. An independent review in August 2001 confirmed the viability and cost-effectiveness of the model.

 There is no single definition of debt sustainability, which can be applied to all developing countries. For the heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC), the international community has agreed two transparent thresholds: the net present value (NPV) of external debt should be below 150 per cent. of export earnings and 250 per cent. of Government revenues.
<P>

<a name="20501w21.html_para1">We regularly discuss these issues with developing countries. We have also funded two meetings this year at which representatives from the HIPC countries debated these issues and fed their views into the on-going evaluation of the HIPC initiative by the Operations Evaluation Department of the World bank.

 The enhanced heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative, which was agreed in September 1999, provides deeper debt relief to poor countries committed to eradicating poverty. Up to $100 billion debt could be written off for the 42 HIPC countries, reducing their debts by more than two thirds. On average, the 26 countries that have already qualified for HIPC relief will spend three times more on the social sectors in 2002&#150;05 than on debt service over the same period.




<P>
<P><I>1 May 2002 : Column 853W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20501w21.html_para2">An important feature of the HIPC initiative is the recognition of the link between debt relief and poverty reduction in order to ensure the poor benefit from debt relief. Governments are developing national poverty reduction strategies, involving civil society and international donors, specifying how resources, including savings from debt relief, will be spent. As part of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) approach, the World bank and IMF have committed to undertaking poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) of major macroeconomic and structural reforms likely to have significant impact on the poor. The World bank and IMF are leading a programme of work on PSIA and are realigning their programmes with PRSPs in these countries. We are supporting this work by piloting PSIA studies in six countries. We are also working with partner countries on their PRSPs, through our bilateral programmes.

 We have been following closely the impact of falling commodity prices on developing countries since well before the events of 11 September. At the annual meetings of the World bank and IMF in Ottawa last November, we raised this concern and asked bank and fund staff to revisit the debt sustainability analyses of all commodity dependent low-income countries, including HIPCs. The IMF and World bank analysis, published last month, shows that, although the situation varies from country to country, the external debt indicators for most HIPC countries have deteriorated, and several HIPC countries now face unsustainable debt burdens. Following UK pressure, the World bank and IMF boards have agreed to provide additional relief to countries in this situation. This was reconfirmed at the spring meetings last month.

 My Department closely monitors the humanitarian situation in the North Caucasus, including Ingushetia. Assessments by UN agencies and international non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in Ingushetia of the situation in camps for internally displaced people (IDPs) indicate that the situation for IDPs resident in Ingushetia is stable in terms of morbidity and mortality, and that there are no major outstanding humanitarian needs. But agencies agree that a full package of humanitarian assistance will continue to be required in light of the highly dependent nature of this population, and that the quality of assistance provided through humanitarian agencies within the Republic needs to be improved. We are addressing these needs through constant dialogue with, and through financial support to, the UN agencies and INGOs working in the region.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the target has been in each of the last five years for efficiency savings as a percentage of total running costs for each of the non- departmental public bodies for which she is responsible; and if the target was met.  [49643]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w23.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department is responsible for three non-departmental public bodies. They incur no substantial running costs other than reimbursement of the travel expenses of members attending meeting which are essentially fixed costs. Targets for efficiency savings are therefore unnecessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 There are currently 16 members of staff in my Department who are Justices of the Peace. My Department fully supports those who are appointed as magistrates. All members of staff are entitled to 18 days special leave to undertake their duties as a magistrate, if they are appointed. The National Strategy for recruitment of magistrates will seek in part to encourage employers generally to be supportive of employees who wish to be magistrates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w23.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Of the non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) for which the Department is responsible, the majority are Advisory or Tribunal NDPBs which we support directly, not through a grant or grant in aid. Targets for efficiency savings specifically for these NDPBs would therefore not be possible as their staff are not distinct from the main Department and cannot therefore be targeted separately.
<P>

<a name="20501w23.html_para0">The Department is responsible for three Executive NDPBs: the Children and Family Court Advisory and Support Service (CAFCASS), the Legal Services Commission (LSC) and the Office of the Information Commissioner.
<P>

<a name="20501w23.html_para1">CAFCASS was established only in April 2001, and it would therefore not yet be appropriate to set targets for efficiency savings. It is planned that CAFCASS will have a performance measure from 2003&#150;04.

 Officials in the PRO are in very frequent contact with their contractors QinetiQ Ltd, with a view to relaunching the online service as soon as this is practicable. There are a number of trigger points contained in the contract, but at the present time the PRO is concentrating its efforts on monitoring and evaluating the enhancement and testing work being carried out by QinetiQ on the census website. The PRO's top priority is to ensure that the relaunched service provides a consistently good service to users.

<a name="20501w23.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 QinetiQ Ltd is continuing to work on the technical enhancements, which are intended to make the site sufficiently robust to permit general Internet access and are being conducted with a sense of urgency. Once configuring of the technical enhancements is complete, rigorous testing will be undertaken on all aspects of the system. However, the most important consideration is to ensure that the service is re-launched successfully. The system will again be made available to designated service centres as part of the general re-introduction of the site. General on-line searches will be available as soon as practicable following testing and availability at the service centres.

 The Lord Chancellor's Department does not hold specific records of the cost of criminal damage to buildings. Any repair costs incurred are met from contingency funds allocated to cover all reactive maintenance works of which criminal damage would be only one example. It would incur a disproportionate cost to the Department to break down the volume of repairs made and allocate them to specific causes.

 The Department makes an assessment of the costs and benefits of regulations when developing regulatory proposals. Where a regulatory proposal has an impact, in terms of costs, benefits and risks that affect businesses, charities and the voluntary sector, a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) is undertaken to inform policy development. Final RIAs are placed in the Libraries of both Houses when the regulation is presented to Parliament, but are not required for regulations where it has been assessed that no or negligible costs would be imposed or savings made, or those that increase statutory fees via a predetermined formula. Copies of final RIAs are available from the Libraries of both Houses.

2. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for tenure, council tax band and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. 



The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household).<P>

<P>
<a name="20501w26.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Since 1 January 2001 there have been 29 incidents involving the finding of specified risk material (SRM) in meat imported into the UK, of which 28 involved spinal cord. Prior to 1 October 2001, SRM cases were not recorded in a way that distinguished them from other breaches of import controls.
<P>

<a name="20501w26.html_para7">Government records of breaches of import controls relate to all products of animal origin detained at border inspection posts, and do not distinguish meat and meat products from other products of animal origin. Since 1 January 2000 there have been a total of 1,205 such breaches. These cases involved a variety of failings, including the absence of the necessary health mark, or the general deterioration of the meat during unsatisfactory means of transportation. Records prior to 2000 are not available.
<P>

<a name="20501w26.html_para8">The Food Standards Agency advises that the vast majority of consignments of meat imported into the UK fully meet the public health requirements for importation.

<P>
<a name="20501w27.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 This Department and the National Care Standards Commission are in close contact with the Home Office and the Criminal Records Bureau about the processing of applications. In order to improve the throughput of applications the bureau is currently recruiting additional staff and redeploying others over 100 in all. The bureau is also reviewing its application processes to streamline them where possible without compromising security, for example returning incorrectly completed forms to the registered body before the application is entered onto the system.
<P>

<a name="20501w27.html_para0">The decision as to whether or not to prosecute a registered provider or registered manager of a care home for employing someone in the home without receiving a criminal records disclosure as required under regulation 19 of the Care Homes Regulations 2001, will be a matter for the National Care Standards Commission. We expect the commission to consider each case separately. In doing so it will need to determine what other checks the employer undertook before employing the worker and whether or not they would have been in breach of other regulations or conditions of registration relating to staff numbers, or the health and welfare of service users, if they did not fill the vacancy. Where a registered person employs someone and deliberately fails to require that person to apply for a disclosure from the bureau we would expect the commission to seek prosecution for breach of the relevant requirements.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to the answer of 5 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 851W, what the value was of the 18 penalties imposed as a result of allegations of WFTC/DPTC fraud made via the anti-fraud hotline; what the value was of the 530 recoveries; if the two prosecutions resulted in convictions and what the sentence received in each case was; and what the cost is of <i>(a)</i> the benefits anti-fraud hotline and <i>(b)</i> the childminder's hotline in 2001&#150;02.

<P>
<P><I>1 May 2002 : Column 878W</I><P>
referred to in my answer of 5 February, 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 851, penalties of around &#163;10,000 were imposed in the 18 cases which resulted from allegations to the national benefit fraud hotline about working families tax credit (WFTC) and disabled persons tax credit (DPTC) applicants. In addition, approximately &#163;743,000 of tax credits is recoverable in relation to the 530 cases. Both of the prosecutions referred to resulted in convictions. The individuals convicted were given a two-year conditional discharge and 50 hours community service respectively.
<P>

<a name="20501w28.html_para0">Based on figures to date for 2001&#150;02, the Department for Work and Pensions estimates the total annual cost of running the national benefit fraud hotline at &#163;816,000 and the estimated annual cost to running the childminder's hotline for WFTC and DPTC applications during 2001&#150;02 at around &#163;1,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w28.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The child care tax credit is only one component of both working families' and disabled person's tax credits (WFTC and DPTC). In the 12 months to 31 March 2002 almost 8,000 WFTC or DPTC awards were found to be non-compliant but it is not possible to say how many of these included non-compliance in relation to child care charges.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w28.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In the period from 1 October 2001 to 31 March 2002 there have been <i>(a)</i> in the region of 11,000 investigations opened, <i>(b)</i> 310 penalties applied, and <i>(c)</i> 26 prosecutions instigated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20501w28.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The fact that widow's pension is taken into account in tax credits and maintenance payments are not, aligns the treatment with what happens in the rest of the tax system. The maintenance disregard also makes a significant contribution to tackling child poverty.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> Between 1 April 2001 to date, special advisers in the Treasury have travelled overseas on three occasions at an average cost of &#163;5,800. In each case a special adviser has accompanied the Chancellor to IMF and G20 meetings in the USA and Canada and associated events from 27 April 2001 to 1 May 2001, 16 to 19 November 2001 and from 19 to 22 April 2002. Information for the period 2 May 1997 to 31 March 2001 is already in the public domain. All travel by special advisers is undertaken in accordance with the rules set out in the Ministerial Code and the Civil Service Management Code.

 The Inland Revenue has a continuing commitment to detect and counter tax evasion. Resources are deployed with an emphasis on areas of high risk and the Inland Revenue's Special Compliance Office deals specifically with evasion involving offshore accounts.
<P>

<a name="20501w28.html_para1">The Finance Act 2000 introduced a package of measures to improve the UK's ability to exchange tax information with other countries. Effective exchange of information is a key tool in reducing tax evasion by the use of offshore accounts.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) how many forward contracts have been agreed by the Inland Revenue to allow taxpayers to negotiate a fixed regular payment of tax in place of the submission of an annual return in each year from 1997 to date; how many such agreements are in place; when such an agreement was first made; under what circumstances such agreements are made; and what the annual income is to the Inland Revenue from such agreements;  [49292]

 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> The Inland Revenue has made a small number of such agreements, entered into at various dates since 1988, some involving taxpayers domiciled outside the United Kingdom. Typically, the arrangements agree a practical basis for taxing future income and gains where there would otherwise be particular difficulties in establishing an exact figure.

 The Better Quality Services (BQS) programme was launched in 1998 and adopted by the Cabinet Office in the "Modernising Government" White Paper of 1999 as a means of delivering continuous improvements in the quality and effectiveness of Government activities and services. It requires all Government Departments to review every activity and service over a five-year period starting in October 1999. The scheme covers all activities in Departments, agencies and executive non-departmental public bodies, and is similar in remit to the Best Value programme in local government.

 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> Complaints handling is one of the areas covered by the Six Service Standards for central Government. Standard Five states that each central Government Department and agency "should have a complaints procedure or procedures for services it provides, publicise it, including on the internet, and send the customer information if they ask". Information about the Treasury's complaints procedures is on the Treasury's website at: www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/About/ about&#95;complaints.cfm
<P>

<a name="20501w29.html_para0">The Cabinet Office guidance "How to Deal with Complaints" advises Departments and agencies that they should develop a system to record all complaints about service delivery and policy. The Treasury has yet to do this so the information requested is not collected centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="20501w29.html_para1">Information on the numbers of complaints taken up and upheld by the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration is contained in the parliamentary ombudsman's annual reports covering the periods specified. Copies of the annual reports are available in the Library of the House and for the reports from 1997&#150;98 on the parliamentary ombudsman's website at www.ombudsman.org.uk/pca/par01/index.htm
<P>

<a name="20501w29.html_para2">During 2001&#150;02 the Treasury received two new statutory statements of complaint from the parliamentary ombudsman and have responded to both which have been resolved. Since 1 April 2002 the Treasury has received no new statutory statements of complaint.

<a name="20501w29.html_para4">This analysis does not take into account the way in which the new tax credits will respond to rises in income, described in detail in "The Child and Working Tax Credit". The new tax credits respond only to rises in income in the current year of more than &#163;2,500, disregarding the first &#163;2,500 of any rise. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.The figures in the table, which cover the number of households in receipt of either income related benefits or the working families tax credit (WFTC) or new tax credits from April 2003, where at least one person works 16 hours or more, include the effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax benefit.
<P>

<a name="20501w29.html_para5">The effect of tax and benefit changes introduced since Budget 1998, including the WFTC, reduced the number of households facing MDRs in excess of 70 per cent. by around half a million. As WFTC is more generous than the family credit that it replaced, more households benefit from it, hence the larger numbers facing MDRs over 40 and 50 per cent. in 2002&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="20501w29.html_para6">Building on the success of WFTC, the Government will be introducing a new system of tax credits from April 2003. As the new tax credits will be more generous and inclusive than the current system of support, more households will be eligible, and those currently eligible will gain more, hence a greater number will face MDRs over 40 and 50 per cent. from 2003&#150;04.

<P>
<a name="20501w30.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 For 2001&#150;02, around 12 per cent. of the working families tax credit scores as negative tax.
<P>

<a name="20501w30.html_para1">For the working tax credit (WTC) and child tax credit (CTC), the latest available estimates are that about 10&#150;11 per cent. of the new tax credits will score as negative tax in 2004&#150;05 and later years. The proportion will be slightly higher, at about 13.5 per cent., in 2003&#150;04. As part of the transitional arrangements child allowance payments (at enhanced CTC rates) to income support and jobseeker's allowance recipients will still count as social security benefits in the first year of the new credits, and are not included in the tax credit total until 2004&#150;05. As these recipients are likely to have much lower income tax liabilities than other WTC and CTC recipients, the proportion scoring as tax falls in 2004&#150;05.

At present the exemption applies to property transactions in designated wards where the consideration does not exceed &#163;150,000. The Government intend to abolish stamp duty for all non-residential property transactions in these wards, subject to state aid approval.

As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your question on emigration of UK citizens. (53136)
<BR>
The British Nationality Act 1981, which came into force on 1st January 1983, replaced citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies, with British citizenship, British Overseas citizenship, and British Dependent Territories citizenship. Therefore, the attached table shows outward international migration by British citizens during the last five years from 1996 to 2000.

 Three of the four film tax reliefs are used for films, the master copy, tape or disc of which has been certified by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport as a British qualifying film. The changes announced in the Budget would restrict the reliefs to British qualifying films made for theatrical exhibition in the commercial cinema. The fourth relief is used for big budget international productions.
