The Government's response to the Committee focused on the Committee's recommendation that the central point of expertise on timber (CPET):</p>
<a name="60515w0002.htm_brev0"><a name="0605153000159"><ul><p class="tabletext">"should make clear to PEFC that it would be desirable for it clearly and simply to set out the minimum standards it expects all its national members to conform to if it wants continued approval of its scheme.&#148;</p>

However, this assessment was made prior to the process of implementation by national schemes being complete, and therefore a public commitment was made to assess the adoption of these changes by the national schemes endorsed by PEFC within a reasonable timeframe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_43"><a name="60515w0002.htm_para1"><a name="0605153000154">The assessment of changes made is under way but not complete. It has raised concerns with the interpretation some national schemes have made of the PEFC requirement for achieving consensus in the development and revision of standards. In particular, it is not clear that the voting procedures adopted by some of the schemes reviewed would ensure that decisions could be made only in 'the absence of sustained opposition to substantial issues by any important part of the concerned interests'&#151;the definition of consensus adopted by PEFC. In the light of further discussions with interested parties the Government have decided that these interim findings merit further scrutiny before resolving the probationary status of PEFC. This will be done as part of a review of the five forest certification schemes first assessed by CPET in 2004. In the meantime, the Government are continuing to accept the PEFC scheme as assuring compliance with Government contract requirements for legal and sustainable timber.</p>

The provinces of Mpumulanga, Kwa Zulu-Natal and Limpopo suffer the greatest burden of the disease and it is in these provinces where DDT is used, after its reintroduction in 2001.</p>

The nine locations which the Commission identified as having failed to meet the Directive requirements to have secondary treatment in place by 31 December 2000 are at Bangor, Donaghadee, Carrickfergus, Coleraine, Londonderry, Larne, Newtownabbey, Omagh and Portrush. A major capital investment programme is currently underway across Northern Ireland to address deficiencies in the sewerage infrastructure and to achieve compliance as quickly as possible. Since 2000/01, investment on improvements to waste water treatment works has increased tenfold, from approximately &#163;12 million per year to some &#163;122 million per year in 2005/06. Work has been completed at Londonderry, Omagh and Larne and significant levels of expenditure will continue to be invested as Water Service strives to meet the requirements as soon as possible.</p>

For new ISPs or services, we would expect them to put in place measures within nine months of offering the service to the public.

The police will use that information to decide whether it is necessary to take any action to prevent travel. That action can include applying for foreign travel orders, which we introduced in the Sexual Offences Act 2003.

Diversity is a part of this programme. Following induction training, new magistrates undertake mentored sittings to identify any further training needs, using the MNTI 2 competence framework. Any needs so identified are addressed at local level. The new magistrate is first appraised after sitting for 12 to18 months, and thereafter further training follows as for sitting magistrates.</p>

All courts are required to take the guidelines of the Sentencing Guidelines Council into account when sentencing offenders and have to give reasons for departing from them in any particular case. Discrepancies in sentencing in all criminal courts are therefore minimised through the use of these guidelines. Currently magistrates courts use the Magistrates Courts Sentencing Guidelines issued in 2004 by the Magistrates Association but these are to be replaced by guidelines produced by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. Appealing against sentence to the Crown court is another mechanism for ensuring consistency of sentencing in the magistrates courts. Consistency in sentencing is further promoted through the publication of judgments on appeals to the Court of Appeal from the Crown court.</p>

This includes previous employment checks, criminal record bureau (CRB) checks, a List 99 check and, for people who are to be employed as teachers, checks to confirm their teaching status.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="60515w0025.htm_para0"><a name="06051627000118">For individuals working in a number of schools where the local authority is the same, and it is the local authority who is the employer, as long as checks were carried out at the time of the first appointment and there is no gap in employment, further checks should not be necessary. Where employers are different or a gap has occurred each employer must satisfy themselves of an individual's suitability by conducting new checks.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_290"><a name="60515w0025.htm_para1"><a name="06051627000119">Under the new vetting and barring scheme, legislation for which is currently before Parliament in the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill, a person or organisation who employs a teacher will be required to check that the teacher is subject to monitoring in relation to their work with children by the scheme, and is not barred from working with children. The duty on the employer to check applies regardless of whether the teacher is working in an independent or maintained school and regardless of whether another employer has already made a check. An employer can fulfil their duty to check by obtaining written confirmation from a supply agency that the agency has made the check.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_291"><a name="60515w0025.htm_para2"><a name="06051627000120">For a non-teaching position, working with children or vulnerable adults in a registered setting, a CRB check is also required. As part of this the Protection of Children Act (PoCA) and Protection of Vulnerable Adults (PoVA) lists will be checked and it will record if an individual is barred from this type of work.</p>

This assessment process will ensure that local areas will be ready to receive the index when it is made available to them. At that time, we will also have the results of the data matching trials which will inform our data sourcing and deployment plans and provide better information about the quality of key data sources and the nature of the task, both locally and nationally, to best ensure that the index data will be of good quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_293"><a name="60515w0025.htm_para4"><a name="06051627000126">The estimated set-up costs are &#163;224 million over the next three years. This includes the costs of adapting existing systems that will supply the data to the index and ensuring that data are accurate; adapting the day-to-day systems used by practitioners so they can access the index from those systems; introducing robust arrangements to ensure security, and training staff to use the index properly.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_294"><a name="60515w0025.htm_para5"><a name="06051627000127">Estimated operating costs, thereafter, will be&#163;41 million per year. Most of this will pay for the additional staff needed to ensure the ongoing security, accuracy and audit of the index.</p>

However, the Department ceased automatic mailings of publications to schools in England on a phased basis between April and December 2004. Discussions with head teachers, and detailed research, showed that schools wanted to be able to choose the printed publications they needed, when they needed them, and to be able to order multiple copies.</p>

These initiatives support existing opportunities in Personal, Social and Health Education (PSHE), Citizenship, Business Studies and Careers Education for improving young people's understanding of financial issues.

<p><a name="stpa_316"><a name="60515w0027.htm_para5"><a name="06051627000576">As far as teachers are concerned, the Department's supply modelling has allowed for falling rolls by reducing the number of teacher training places in 2005/06 for both primary and secondary teaching. However, overall judgments on the number of teachers required also depend on other factors such as those leaving and returning to the profession and this will vary from one area to another. Because of these factors and local variations, teacher numbers have continued to rise. On a full time equivalent basis, their numbers rose by 3,500 to 435,400 in England in January 2006.</p>

Progress is being made year by year in improving the quality of the school building stock. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority. Given the high levels of funding, authorities have the opportunity to replace temporary classrooms where they are considered to be unsuitable.</p>

The balance of individual local authority housing revenue accounts is based on assumptions made by central Government, and means that some accounts are in surplus while others are in deficit. These assumptions bear no relationship to local rents or local authority decisions. The subsidy system allows surpluses in some local authorities&#146; housing revenue accounts to be used to support other areas where there are deficits.

Where a local authority transfers its housing to an RSL and the receipt it receives is not sufficient to repay the outstanding debt attributable to the housing, the Office will make a one-off payment where the debt is held with the Public Works Loans Board. The one-off payment is made to discharge the Office's continued liability, through the HRA, to pay subsidy on an authority's housing attributable debt that remains after transfer. Since 1997 the Office has repaid &#163;1.787 billion of local authority debt (including early redemption fees) in this way.
