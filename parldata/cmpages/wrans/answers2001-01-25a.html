To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what analysis he has undertaken of the reasons given by those in charge of sub-post offices for resigning from their posts in the last five years; and to what extent <i>(a)</i> the level of remuneration and <i>(b)</i> the perceived complexity of modern post office technology are factors in such decisions.  [146945]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Post Office conducts research on the reasons for resignation of sub-postmasters. That research is not undertaken to a regular timetable and therefore does not provide comparable data. Historical research on sub-postmaster resignations is not available.
<P>

<a name="10125w01.html_para0">However, internal Post Office research from exit interviews with sub-postmasters has been conducted in the last six months. Of the sample of sub-postmasters interviewed, 9 per cent. cited financial viability of the outlet and 6 per cent. cited computerisation of the post office network as the reasons for resignation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many visits the Export Control Organisation's Compliance Unit made to exporters to examine records held with regard to open individuals export licences in <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1998 and <i>(c)</i> 1999, indicating the number of visits to each exporter.  [146654]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The number of visits made by the Export Control Organisation's Compliance Unit are set out in the table:

<P>

<a name="10125w01.html_para1">The totals include visits to a small proportion of exporters who do not hold Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs), but are required to keep records as part of their usage of Open General Export Licences (OGELs).




<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2001 : Column: 654W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10125w01.html_para2">Information regarding the number of visits made to each exporter is not easily accessible and it would, therefore, entail disproportionate cost to establish the number of visits made to each company.
<P>

<a name="10125w01.html_para3">The Export Control Organisation's Compliance Unit visits exporters who hold Open Individual Export Licences (OIELs) on a regular basis. Where the exporter holds a licence for military list and certain dual-use goods it is normal practice to undertake such a visit yearly. For holders of licences for other dual-use goods, visits would normally take place every second year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he intends to publish the commentary clarifying his Department's position on the risks of depleted uranium and certain of his Department's documents recently quoted by the media.  [147737]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is today publishing a paper entitled "Depleted Uranium--Documents explaining the Ministry of Defence position on the risks and health hazards". This demonstrates the Ministry of Defence's determination to be open and transparent on the matter. Copies of the paper are being placed in the Library of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Salmond: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his reply of 15 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 144W, on depleted uranium, what units cleared Devil Dog dragoon range after the discharge of depleted uranium rounds in 1991; and if the personnel involved were warned of hazards deriving from the passage of depleted uranium rounds into compacted sand berms.  [147016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The contemporary (March 1991) official UK file on training areas and ranges contains a detailed note on the condition of Devil Dog dragoon ranges at that time, including that the clearance of the ranges was to be undertaken by the United States Marine Corps.
<P>

<a name="10125w01.html_para4">Although personnel of 49 Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD) Squadron Royal Engineers and 221 EOD Company Royal Army Ordnance Corps (RAOC) were deployed to Devil Dog dragoon ranges in January 1991, 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2001 : Column: 656W</I><P>
this was for the provision of routine EOD cover during 1(UK) Division training, and not for any subsequent clearance of the ranges (although 221 Company destroyed a number of undetonated munitions on the Ranges in January 1991).
<P>

<a name="10125w01.html_para5">Although the deployment of EOD personnel to these ranges was not solely or specifically connected to the use of DU munitions, 221 Company would have been issued with the 14 January 1991 RAOC Technical Ammunition Bulletin, a copy of which was placed in the Library of the House in February 1998. This provided safety procedures for those involved in clearance of DU from any range areas.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the methods used to contain, clean up and immobilise depleted uranium particles fragmented by the test firing of depleted uranium shells at Eskmeals.  [145286]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Depleted Uranium (DU) Charm projectiles were fired into a semi-enclosed butt at VJ Battery on the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) range Eskmeals (formerly part of the Ministry of Defence's Directorate of Proof and Experimental Establishments) during the period between March 1981 and September 1995 when firing ceased. The methods used to contain, clean up and immobilise depleted uranium particles fragmented by the test firing of such shells were in accordance with statutory regulations and were by the best practical means possible following consultation with the Health and Safety Executive. The Environment Agency was also kept informed of these measures throughout the period of the butt's use.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many depleted uranium rounds have been discharged at the range in West Freugh, Wigtownshire; in which years since 1971; and at what targets.  [145929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 During 1998 and 1990, 100 and 215 rounds of depleted uranium ammunition respectively were fired into Luce Bay at the, now, Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) range, West Freugh. These were part of experimental firings to examine the ricochet effects of ammunitions from Goalkeeper and Phalanx following first water impact. The ammunition was not fired at targets.

<P>

<a name="10125w02.html_para0">The future weapons strategy for a UK JSF is still being developed. JSF would allow for the internal and external carriage of a range of air-to-air and air-to- surface weapons, including those meeting UK-specific requirements. In the case of Meteor, modifications would be needed for the missile to be carried internally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what research <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> the chemical defence establishment, Porton Down, has carried out to compare the number of individuals exposed to nerve agent in experiments with the numbers exposed to these same chemicals in the military experimental programmes of other countries.  [146691]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w02.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of DERA at Porton Down has not undertaken any detailed comparison of the numbers of individuals exposed to nerve agents in the course of the Service Volunteer Programme and of those exposed to nerve agents in the military trials programmes of other countries. The number possibly exposed in the UK programme was 3,400.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 14 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 223W, on Porton Down volunteers, if his Department will compile reports on the nerve agent studies involving volunteers as part of the research to establish the definitive numbers.  [146688]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Yes, we intend to identify the numbers of volunteers involved in each of the studies conducted at Porton Down. It is our intention to publish the findings.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) for what reasons the chemical defence establishment, Porton Down, initiated the survey of the health of service volunteers exposed to nerve agents reported in the document "A long-term follow-up of volunteers exposed to GB sarin (CDE Technical Note 175)" in July 1973;  [146689]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will place in the Public Record Office a copy of the document "A long-term follow-up of volunteers exposed to GB sarin (CDE Technical Note 175)".  [146690]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 CDE Technical Note 175 (TN 175) was published in July 1973 and was the second of three similar studies. (The other two were TN 120 published in February 1972 and TN 1010 published in August 1989). The work which led to CDE Technical Note 175 was a small scale study initiated by staff at Porton Down. This was intended to identify any long-term health effect of single exposure to nerve agents during the volunteer programme. An examination of the medical records of individuals exposed to nerve agents during the remainder of their time in service indicated no increased incidence of ill health in comparison to a control group.
<P>

<a name="10125w02.html_para1">I have arranged for a copy of the document to which the hon. Member refers together with TN 120 to be placed in the Library of the House (TN 1010 was placed in the Library in December 2000). Consideration as to whether or not the document should be placed in the Public Records Office will be given under the terms of the Public Records Acts 1958 and 1967.

<a name="10125w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many service volunteers were tested with the oripavine derivative TL 2636 by staff of the chemical defence establishment, Porton Down, and in what years; for what reasons the tests were <i>(a)</i> started and <i>(b)</i> ended; what the results of these tests were; how many technical papers recording the results of these tests have been produced by Porton Down staff; and what research has 



<P>
<P><I>25 Jan 2001 : Column: 658W</I><P>
been carried out by his Department to establish the long-term effects of this chemical on the health of individuals.  [146687]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Service Volunteer Programme at the Chemical and Biological Defence Sector of DERA at Porton Down has undertaken research with the oripavine derivative TL 2636 as an incapacitating agent, part of which has involved service volunteers. The results of this aspect of research are collated in two formal technical papers, one of which covers the period between August 1961 and November 1963 and the second which details a particular trial in January 1968. However, there are several other technical papers which discuss different aspects of the research programme pertaining to this compound.
<P>

<a name="10125w02.html_para2">The volunteer studies were undertaken because there was concern that this or similar compounds may be deployed against the UK armed forces to cause temporary incapacitation. A total of 141 service volunteers were involved in these studies which concluded that oripavine had the potential to cause both physical and mental incapacitation.
<P>

<a name="10125w02.html_para3">To date no long-term follow-up studies have been undertaken, however TL 2636 is a member of the same group of drugs as morphine which has been used clinically for many years. The current evidence suggests that following single, acute doses of such compounds there are no significant long-term effects on health.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the announcement my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence made in the House on 24 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 778-79, about our intention to proceed with the implementation of the Core Competence model for the DERA public-private partnership. Under Core Competence, around three-quarters of the current DERA organisations will be turned into a company, referred to as NewDERA. For strategic reasons, the remainder will be retained within the Ministry of Defence to carry out functions that could not appropriately be transferred to the private sector. This part will be known as the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory.
<P>

<a name="10125w02.html_para4">As part of the PPP implementation process, we are currently carrying out a major programme to identify intellectual property rights within those elements of DERA that will form the new company. This programme is not yet complete, so no list is available. It is our intention that IPR owned by MOD that was developed within those areas of DERA that will form NewDERA should be transferred to the new company. This in essence would mean that NewDERA would be in the same position as it would have been had it been an industry contractor for research and technology work. The balance of MOD-owned IPR currently held by DERA will remain with DSTL.
<P>

<a name="10125w02.html_para5">We are committed to ensuring that NewDERA will have access only to that IPR which it has a right to and is necessary for its continuing business with MOD. Use of third party intellectual property by NewDERA will be subject to contractual constraints involving the owner where required.

<P>
<a name="10125w03.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The judgment was made in 1998 that the Royal Hospital Haslar would not remain viable as a stand-alone military hospital as it did not have the case mix and volume of patients to support the training accreditation required for Service medical personnel. Following an internal review the decision was taken to close Haslar and to open a MOD Hospital Unit at the Queen Alexandra hospital in order to retain a military medical presence in the Portsmouth area. In parallel, it was decided to establish a Centre for Defence Medicine (CDM) to provide a strong professional focus for Defence medicine. After competition, the University Hospital Birmingham NHS Trust, which embraces the Queen Elizabeth hospital and the Selly Oak hospital, was selected as our principal partner in the CDM, and as such, it will play an important part in the running of this important academic, teaching, and clinical centre. There are no plans to relocate any facilities from Haslar to Southampton.

It is not yet certain, however, whether all the capital expenditure will need to be incurred. The annual running costs of the Centre for Defence Medicine will be more than offset by the savings at Haslar and Royal Defence Medical College once the transition is complete.

 On Saturday 20 January coalition aircraft conducting humanitarian patrols of the Iraqi no fly zones, were subjected to repeated attacks from Saddam Hussein's forces, including multiple attacks by surface-to- air missiles as well as anti-aircraft artillery. Faced with these immediate threats to their safety, coalition forces responded in self-defence against Iraq's Integrated Air Defence System.
<P>

<a name="10125w03.html_para7">We are aware of Iraqi claims that civilian facilities were hit and casualties caused by this action. While it is impossible categorically to disprove Iraqi allegations, painstaking battle damage assessment indicates that all weapons released hit their intended military targets, and that there was no damage to any Iraqi civilian facilities. Baghdad's claims, as ever, should be treated with the utmost caution. We know that Iraq systematically claims that military personnel injured or killed in such incidents are civilian. Iraq claims also that targets have been bombed when no weapons have been released.

 The total payments authorised since the inception of the UN Compensation Fund to those who suffered losses as a result of Iraq's illegal invasion of Kuwait in 1990 are $32.2 billion (December 2000). For the more detailed breakdown which the hon. Gentleman has requested I refer him to the website of the UN Compensation Commission at www.unoq.ch/uncc.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what action the United Kingdom Government have taken to implement the judgment of the International Court of Justice in 1995 in regard to the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons.  [147188]<P>

 None. We do not believe that the 1996 Advisory Opinion of the International Court of Justice imposed any new disarmament obligations on the United Kingdom or that it required either a change in our entirely defensive nuclear deterrence policy or in the NATO doctrine of collective self defence.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what the average size of class taught by one teacher was in <i>(a)</i> primary and <i>(b)</i> secondary schools in East Sussex for each year from 1990 to the latest year for which figures are available.  [146695]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 23 January 2001]:</i> The information requested is shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="10125w04.html_para3">Class size data were recently published in a Statistical Bulletin, "Class Sizes and Pupil Teacher Ratios in England 2000" on 20 December 2000, copies of which are available from the Library, or alternatively can be accessed from the Department for Education and Employment statistical website www.dfee.gov.uk/statistics. Figures from this release show that in September 2000, there were just 30,000 infants in classes of over 30 compared with 485,000 in January 1998. Just 2 per cent. of infants are now in such classes compared with 29 per cent. in January 1998.
<P>

<a name="10125w04.html_para4">January 2000 saw a fall in the size of the average junior class in England; and a continuing fall in the size of the average primary class, after rising for a decade. The size of the average secondary class nationally, at 22, is still five below the average primary class. Secondary headteachers are receiving an average of &#163;50,000 this year in direct grant to spend as they choose. If this were spent on recruiting teachers, the average secondary class size could be reduced by up to 0.8.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the reasons for the release of planning decision PNW/5290/219/32 to the public before copies of the decision were received by the participants.  [147220]<P>

<P>
<a name="10125w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Normal practice is to post the decision letter to the applicant and all other parties who appeared at the public inquiry into the proposals, or asked to be notified of the decision, on the same day. It is also normal practice to notify the media at the same time as the other parties. However, I understand in this case due to an administrative error, the local media were notified of the decision electronically on the day the decision letter was posted. We are taking steps to prevent such an error being repeated.

 In line with modernising government principles, my Department actively canvasses outside views on its main policies. Where public opinion research is used it is subject to the usual strict rules that spending must represent good value for money and must not be used for party political purposes. The results of research are made widely available. However, information on each project is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 Radioactive wastes should be managed in ways that protect the safety of the public, the work force and the environment, now and in the future. This is a complex issue and the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations will publish a consultation paper setting out detailed proposals as soon as they are ready. This will begin the process leading to the implementation of a radioactive waste management policy that can attract widespread support across the UK.

<a name="10125w08.html_para0">The introduction of new trains has in part been delayed by the rigorous safety approvals process which is required before any passenger train enters service.

The total number to benefit from the capital limits change across the three income-related benefits is estimated to be 500,000.

1. The figures provided have been calculated using the Policy Simulation Model (PSM). This models the benefit system in 2001-02 and is based on data from the Family Resource Survey (FRS) for 1997-98, uprated to 2001 prices.<P>

2. The effect of earnings uprating the MIG has not been included. The latest changes to the MIG assume equalisation and protection of the rise in the retirement pension only.<P>

3. Figures for floaters are due to capital changes have come from the PSM and are therefore based on data from the FRS. The FRS questions relating to assets and savings are a sensitive section of the questionnaire and have the lowest response rate; Capital holdings are often under reported. Therefore figures should be treated with some caution.<P>

4. Figures for floaters and gainers have been calibrated to administrative records and historical take up assumptions. Floaters have been rounded to the nearest 50,000 cases. For average gains the figures have been rounded to the nearest &#163;0.50. <P>

<a name="10125w09.html_para3">These goals are being pursued nationwide and our achievements are set out in our annual "Opportunity for all reports". Our second report, "Opportunity for all--One year on: making a difference" (Cm4865, September 2000) sets out what progress has been made in the past year, as well as highlighting what more needs to be done. Nationwide statistical information is necessarily more complete than constituency level data, but the following information provides a comparative guide to the effect of the Department's policies and actions in Slough since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="10125w09.html_para4">We are spending an additional &#163;7 billion a year on support for families and children. This includes significant increases in Child Benefit, which is now worth &#163;15 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10 a week for other children: nationally, about 7 million families receive Child Benefit, and in Slough 13,865 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10125w09.html_para5">We have launched the New Deals to help lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over-50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since August 1998 the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,323,600 to 1,044,900; in Slough the number has reduced from 2,100 to 1,200. The number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased over the same period from 955,000 to 909,200 nationally and in Slough from 1,900 to 1,800.
<P>

<a name="10125w09.html_para6">Next year we will be spending &#163;4.5 billion a year extra in real terms on pensioners as a result of our policies. The Winter Fuel Payment has continued to tackle fuel poverty. Last winter, around 10 million pensioners, of whom 13,300 were in Slough, benefited from the payment. We have now extended the scheme to include eligible people from age 60 so that even more older people will benefit. This winter, households that qualify will receive an increased payment of &#163;200. The Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) targets the poorest 1.6 million pensioner families, 2,600 of whom live in Slough. These pensioners will benefit from our alignment of all MIG rates from April 2001, giving single pensioners at least &#163;92.15 each week--a real increase of &#163;12.45 for the poorest pensioners.

 Sudden Adult Death Syndrome is not one single condition but a group of conditions that can result in the sudden and unexpected death of apparently healthy adults. Some deaths, particularly those in young adults, are believed to be due to possible cardiac abnormalities such as cardiomyopathy, a disorder of the heart muscle. There is evidence of a familial link in some of these deaths, and we fully recognise the importance of those thought to be at risk being referred for specialist assessment.

<a name="10125w11.html_para6">The length of the vetting process can vary according to individual circumstances, and it is for Departments and agencies to take this into account in their recruitment and personnel procedures. It is not Government policy to comment on the total numbers subject to security vetting, but in the year 1999-2000, 926 people were refused a CTC, or had such a clearance withdrawn. Information concerning the ethnic and national background of these individuals is not held centrally.

In pursuance of these duties, the Commission conducts regular vetting checks on directors and senior executives of GTech Holdings (the parent company of GTech UK), whether or not they are directly involved with the operation of the National Lottery. The Commission also conducts checks on all GTech UK staff involved with the operation of the UK National Lottery. The Commission does not conduct vetting checks on GTech employees falling outside these categories.

 <i>[holding answer 23 January 2001]:</i> The Government remain firmly committed to achieving more sustainable fisheries management and continue to encourage the European Commission to take greater account of environmental considerations in the management of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Improved integration of environmental objectives and the development of the precautionary approach within fisheries management is a UK priority for the 2002 review of the CFP. This should help to further the sustainable management of fish stocks at Community level.
<P>

<a name="10125w13.html_para2">We are also continuing to pursue a range of measures designed to improve the state of fish stocks around our coasts. These include limitations on the quantities of fish that may be taken and the use of closed areas in which fishing is prohibited or severely restricted, in order to protect juvenile or spawning stocks. Since 1 January 2000, improved conservation measures have applied throughout the EU. These set more relevant minimum landing sizes for the key commercial fish species, enhance gear selectivity and simplify the catch composition rules. Together this should help to reduce discarding.
<P>

<a name="10125w13.html_para3">Under the CFP there is no access for foreign vessels within six miles of EU member states coastlines. Within the 6-12 mile zone, access for foreign vessels is restricted on the basis of historical access rights. The 6 and 12 mile access restrictions operate by derogation from the principle of free access to a Community resource. I am confident that this derogation which is due to expire on 31 December 2002 will be maintained in the forthcoming Review of the CFP. For my part, I shall want to argue then for these access restrictions to be made permanent.

 <i>[holding answer 23 January 2001]:</i> No financial resources are being made available specifically to improve recruitment and retention in the South Buckinghamshire district council area.
<P>

2000-01, 108 for 2001-02 and 106 for 2002-03. It has been agreed that the force can defer 69 of its CFF allocation for 2000-01 into 2001-02. Funding for all the CFF recruits, including those deferred to 2001-02, will be provided from the date of appointment.
<P>

<a name="10125w17.html_para4">We also launched the first ever national recruitment advertising campaign for the police service on 30 August 2000. The campaign is expected to cost &#163;8.2 million (including VAT) in 2000-01. It is not possible to say what proportion of the cost of the campaign has benefited particular forces but, by 14 January 2001, 287 expressions of interest arising from the campaign had been forwarded to Thames Valley police.

 It is not possible to estimate how many convictions there will be each year following arrest for the offence set out in Clause 14 of the Criminal Justice and Police Bill. We expect this provision to have a deterrent effect, restricting the consumption of alcohol in those public places designated in accordance with Clause 15. Arrest will be appropriate only in the circumstances set out in Clause 14, where an individual fails without reasonable excuse to comply with a police officer's requirement that he or she should not consume alcohol in that place or should surrender alcohol and any opened alcohol containers.

<a name="10125w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The maximum sentences available on summary conviction for the offences listed in Clause 1 are given in the table. Clause 3 provides the Secretary of State with a power to determine by order the penalties payable in respect of each offence under the penalty notice scheme, with the restriction that they may not exceed half the amount of the maximum fine for which a person is liable upon conviction. Police officers will have no discretion to vary the amounts of these penalties. No figures for the penalties have yet been set.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many penalty notices he estimates will be issued for each penalty offence under Clause 2 of the Criminal Justice and Police Bill annually to persons <i>(a)</i> who would otherwise be cautioned, <i>(b)</i> who would otherwise be tried and <i>(c)</i> who would otherwise not be proceeded against in any way;  [147224]

<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 It is not possible at this stage to give accurate estimates of the information requested. Numbers of penalty notices issued, and to whom, will depend upon a number of factors, including the levels at which penalties are set and the way in which the police use the new scheme. For the purposes of planning a range of possible outcomes has been considered, varying between 20 per cent. and 95 per cent. of those currently pleading guilty and between 80 per cent. and 50 per cent. of those currently being cautioned being issued instead with a fixed penalty notice.
<P>

<a name="10125w18.html_para0">As for those against whom no action is currently taken, the assumption is that at least 10 per cent. of all notices issued might be in respect of such people.
<P>

<a name="10125w18.html_para1">The Bill includes a power to specify different penalties for different offences. No decision has yet been taken as to what these penalties will be.
<P>

<a name="10125w18.html_para2">A more accurate assessment of numbers will be possible only once decisions have been taken about the level of fixed penalties and in the light of early experience of the scheme.

 This is to be a discretionary power, subject to a sentencing threshold, for the courts to apply when they deem it appropriate. But the number of offenders liable to such a ban, based on 1998 sentencing data, would be in the region of 300 to 400.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10125w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The figures in the Financial and Explanatory Memorandum to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 were based on the possibility that up to 5,000 orders might be made in any one year. We have not revised that estimate and have no plans to do so, since we are not seeking to set a national target for such orders.
<P>

<a name="10125w18.html_para3">It is more important that, where an order is made, it should be made on the basis that it will be the most effective method for dealing with a specific case. Our priority in this area is that local crime and disorder partnerships should be making effective use of all their powers to protect the rights of all citizens to lead their lives free from harassment and disorder.

 The redesigned website was launched in December 2000 as part of the Home Office's ongoing commitment to drive forward e-government. The total cost of the redesign was approximately &#163;150,000 representing Immigration and Nationality Directorate staff costs and external technical and design provision.

 Covert activity such as drug dealing is by nature very difficult to quantify. Figures from the random mandatory drug testing (RMDT) programme provide the best available measure of the levels of drug misuse. The table lists the establishments reporting rates of positive RMDT of less than five per cent. during each of the last two financial years.

<P>
<a name="10125w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Prison Service Staff would be liable to prosecution under section 8 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 only if they took no action to stop illegal activities involving controlled drugs. I am satisfied that prisons operate effective strategies for preventing, as far as possible, the smuggling and using of drugs. Consultation with the Crown Prosecution Service is therefore unnecessary.

 The Licensing Act 1964 made it an offence for anyone to buy or attempt to buy alcohol for consumption in a bar in licensed premises by a minor. The Licensing (Young Persons) Act 2000, which came into force on 23 January, created a new offence of buying or attempting to buy alcohol in licensed premises on behalf of a person under 18. There will continue to be an exemption from these offences in respect of any adult who buys beer, porter or cider for a person aged 16 or 17 years of age for consumption at a meal in a part of licensed premises which is not the bar and is usually set aside for the service of meals.

 No. The Government believe that tackling graffiti is best achieved by dealing with offenders rather than penalising retailers for selling a product that they may, in all honesty, believe is being purchased for legitimate reasons. There are no statutory age limits for the purchase of these products and it is not therefore appropriate to issue guidance to retailers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his policy is concerning drivers who leave retail petrol sites without paying for fuel; how many reported incidents of drive-offs there were in 2000, broken down by constabulary in England and Wales; and how many successful prosecutions in respect of these there have been.

 The offence of 'making off without payment' from petrol stations (commonly known as bilking) is one that industry/retailers and the police have already joined forces to tackle.
<P>

<a name="10125w20.html_para1">The Home Office supports the British Oil Security Syndicate (BOSS), formed in 1991 by the oil industry, together with the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), the Home Office and the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). Its aims are to reduce the amount of crime taking place on Britain's petrol forecourts.
<P>

<a name="10125w20.html_para2">Their scheme 'Forecourt Watch' provides an early warning system to keep retailers informed about crimes being committed on forecourts and provides details of suspects and their vehicles. When a crime is committed local petrol retailers immediately report the incident to the local police who transmit warnings about any suspects and their vehicles to all retailers via a communications system such as 'Ringmaster'. Messages can be transmitted to all scheme members extremely quickly.
<P>

<a name="10125w20.html_para3">Retailers are also encouraged to inform their neighbouring petrol forecourts of the offence so that action can be taken before the crime is committed elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="10125w20.html_para4">A pilot scheme in Lewisham, South London reduced forecourt crimes including drive-offs by 42 per cent. between December 1999 and December 2000.
<P>

<a name="10125w20.html_para5">It is not possible in the statistics collected centrally on recorded crime to identify offences of making off without payment from other similar offences of fraud. Information held on the Home Office Court Proceedings database shows that there were 2,000 persons proceeded against in

England and Wales in 1999 for offences of making off without payment (section 3 of the Theft Act 1978) but this will also include other similar offences such as making off without payment from restaurants, hotels etc. 1,400 of these persons were convicted.
