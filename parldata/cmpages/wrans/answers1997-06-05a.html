To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the difference between total tax revenue and total public expenditure in <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> Scotland and <i>(c)</i> Wales for the current year and each of the subsequent two years. [643]<P>

 The table shows figures for general government receipts and expenditure in Scotland and Wales in 1994-95, the latest year for which figures are available. Estimates and forecasts for later years are not available. The estimates for England are derived as the residual from the published UK figures, after deducting figures for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

<a name="70605w01.html_wqn1"><B> Sir Teddy Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer when the United Kingdom's entitlement to levy VAT at zero rates ended; what powers the Government are exercising to continue zero rates; and if he will seek an assurance from the Commission that it will not challenge these powers in the European Court. [975]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The United Kingdom is entitled to continue applying its existing VAT zero rates. Our zero rates are expressly provided for in EC law under Article 28(2)(a) of the Sixth VAT Directive. This provision is linked to the duration of the 'transitional period', but this continues automatically until such time as any 'definitive' VAT regime is introduced, which would require the unanimous agreement of all Member States. In light of this there would be little to be gained from seeking any assurance from the Commission on the issue.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement regarding the effect of the proposed windfall tax on utilities which have never been in public ownership. [1644]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer will announce details of the windfall levy in his Budget statement.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_wqn3"><B> Sir George Young: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if <i>(a)</i> the privatised train operating companies, <i>(b)</i> Railtrack, <i>(c)</i> the rolling stock companies, <i>(d)</i> bus companies, <i>(e)</i> airports and <i>(f)</i> ports fall within his public definition of companies liable to a windfall tax. [1508]<P>

 The Chancellor of the Exchequer will announce details of the windfall levy in his Budget statement.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the individual companies which he assesses to have made excess profits since they were privatised. [1850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Robinson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 June 1997]:</i> The Chancellor of the Exchequer will announce details of the windfall levy in his Budget statement.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Bruce: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of how the levels of investment and employment in the utilities will be affected by a windfall levy. [685]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Robinson: </B> 
 The Government will take all relevant considerations into account in designing the windfall levy; to this end, we have invited representations from companies on the technical operation of the levy and are consulting the regulators.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much was spent on the refurbishment of ministerial offices in the Treasury between 1992 and 1997. [1800]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 No refurbishment work other than standard redecorations has been undertaken on ministerial offices in the last five years. The cost of decorating Ministers' offices is accounted for along with all other redecoration work in the Treasury and could be separated out only at disproportionate cost.

 Company pensions are taxed through the PAYE systems. Tax deductible donations can be made from them so long as the payroll operator is prepared to make the necessary arrangements with an agency charity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Liddell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 June 1997]:</i> The Chancellor said in his 6 May letter to the Governor of the Bank of England that the Court will be representative of the whole of the United Kingdom. The non-executive members will be appointed for their expertise and will be drawn widely from industry, commerce and finance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister what estimate he has made of the cost to public funds of the two referendums provided by the Referendums (Scotland and Wales) Bill. [1636]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The estimated cost of the referendums will be up to &#163;8 million, of which &#163;5 million will be for Scotland, and up to &#163;3 million for Wales.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Sanders: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister what actions the Government will take to implement the decision of the European Commission of Human Rights in respect of legal rights of British nuclear test veterans to obtain war pensions and compensation for radiation-linked illnesses. [1916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The European Commission of Human Rights has referred two cases relating to British nuclear test veterans to the European Court of Human Rights for decision. The cases will be heard in November 1997 and the Government will contest the cases because we do not agree that the lack of contemporaneous yield and radiation records prevented nuclear test veterans from getting a fair hearing before the Pensions Appeal Tribunal. The studies of the health of the test veterans, conducted by the National Radiological Protection Board and the Imperial Cancer Research Fund, concluded that participation in the nuclear weapons testing programme had had no long term detectable effect on the veterans expectation of life or on their risk of developing cancer.

<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Yes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what action has been taken following a German court's judgment that the Iranian Government were responsible for the Mykonos cafe killing of Iranian dissidents in Germany. [1208]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The EU immediately issued a statement condemning the evidence of official Iranian involvement in these murders and withdrew its Heads of Mission for consultation. The UK associated itself fully with the Declaration issued by the EU General Affairs Council on 29 April 1997. This confirmed that there was no basis for the continuation of the Critical Dialogue between the EU and Iran. Measures were also adopted on ministerial visits, arms sales, visas and intelligence personnel. The EU council decided to keep the relationship with Iran under close review.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many times each European Union member state was prosecuted in the European Court of Justice under the terms of article 169 of the treaty of Rome in 1995 and 1996. [1885]<P>

<P>
<a name="70605w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The enforcement of Community law--commenced under Article 169 of the EC Treaty--has a number of stages which can take more than one year to complete. The latest figures are contained in the Commission's Thirteenth Annual Report on Monitoring the Application of Community Law (1995) which is in the Libraries of the House. The table below from the report, details established infringements by stage of proceeding and Member State for 1991-1995, giving an indicative overall picture. The report for 1996 will be published soon. It will be deposited in the Libraries of the House when it becomes available.

<a name="70605w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The existing criteria against which officials consider licence applications for the export of conventional arms are contained in this Department's guidance booklet for desk officers, a copy of which has been placed in the Libraries of the House. Specific concerns have been expressed in the media and elsewhere about a range of countries where UK defence equipment may have been used for internal repression. The review will not, however, focus on individual countries. Its purpose is to meet our commitment not to permit the sale of arms to any regime which might use them for internal repression or international aggression. It is the latter which requires officials to consider implications of a proposed export of arms for international stability, taking into account inter alia the effect on regional tension and stability and any existing armed conflict.

 The information requested is not available for cases heard in the magistrates' courts. The proportion of all defendants indicted for trial in the Crown Court who were not legally represented (either under legal aid or privately) was 0.8 per cent. in 1994, 0.7 per cent. in 1995 and 0.8 per cent. in 1996. Of those defendants in cases for sentence in the Crown Court, 15 per cent. were not legally represented (either under legal aid or privately) in 1994. The corresponding figures for 1995 and 1996 were also 15 per cent. Of those appellants who appealed to the Crown Court against their conviction and/or sentence in the magistrates' courts, 38 per cent. were not legally represented either through legal aid or privately in 1994. In 1995 and 1996, the figures were 38 per cent. and 34 per cent. respectively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I have no such estimates, and I do not see how useful estimates could be made. Many factors may affect a decision on whether or not to litigate. For example, people have different priorities for how they spend their money, and other factors such as uncertainty about the outcome and costs of the case, and their willingness to undergo the stress of litigation will often affect their decisions.

 For certain proceedings a person may enter into a conditional fee agreement whereby a solicitor can take a case on a "no win no fee" basis. At present conditional fees are available for personal injury cases, insolvency actions and cases before the European Court of Human Rights. I shall shortly be considering the possibility of extending conditional fees to other areas. In addition legal expenses insurance may be available for some types of civil dispute.

 There are no plans at present to change eligibility for legal aid. However there is to be a review of the proposed reforms of the civil justice system and legal aid. We will consider the scope for changes to eligibility for legal aid in the light of the outcome of the review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There are no plans to extend the scope of the legal aid scheme to include defending libel actions. Successive Governments have taken the view that the outcomes of such cases are uniquely difficult to foresee and that even if the general mechanisms against unmeritorious proceedings could be strengthened in some way, they would still not provide an effective safeguard against the potential waste of public money.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Following our manifesto commitment, we are acting to end the primary purpose rule because it is arbitrary, unfair and ineffective and has penalised genuine marriages, divided families and unnecessarily increased the administrative burden on the immigration system. The rule has also placed British citizens resident here at a 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 1997 : Column: 219</I><P>
disadvantage compared with other European Union nationals resident in Britain--to whom no primary purpose rule has applied.
<P>

<a name="70605w03.html_para0">Applicants under the rule had to prove a negative both before the entry clearance officer and on appeal. But, even where applicants lost their appeal, they would then be allowed in where there was a child with right of abode in the United Kingdom or where the marriage had lasted five years. It is also very doubtful that this inherently ineffective and unfair rule has worked to filter out those who sought to cheat the system. This question is not therefore about numbers, but about fairness.
<P>

<a name="70605w03.html_para1">I am determined to build an immigration and asylum system that is fairer, faster and firmer. Ending this rule will allow resources to be focused on the other requirements of the rules, which are known to be fair, effective and enforceable. These include:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
first, showing that the marriage is genuine: the couple must intend to live together permanently as husband and wife: and the marriage must be subsisting. In other words, it must not be a marriage of convenience;
<BR>
secondly, both parties to the marriage must have met; and,
<BR>
thirdly, both parties must demonstrate that they can maintain and accommodate themselves and any dependants without recourse to public funds.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="70605w03.html_para2">The burden of proof in these cases will remain on the applicant. In addition, couples will continue to be subject to a 12 month probationary period, at the end of which they must show again that their marriage is genuine. This will be firmly enforced.
<P>

<a name="70605w03.html_para3">An amendment to the Rules will be made today. Entry clearance officers are being instructed not to refuse entry clearance applications where the refusal depends solely on the primary purpose rule. Similar instructions are being issued to staff in the Immigration and Nationality Directorate. Home Office Presenting Officers are being instructed not to oppose cases on appeal where the refusal was based wholly on the primary purpose rule and the rule will not apply to outstanding applications. However, if an appellant still decides to proceed on his own initiative, he will still have to prove his case to the adjudicator, even though the Presenting Officer will not formally oppose the appeal. Those who have had their case and their appeal refused will be entitled to apply again, on payment of an apppropriate fee.

Press allegations were made in November 1996 that British companies might have been involved in the supply of arms to Rwandan extremists in 1994, but there was no evidence to suggest that arms had been exported from the UK. The Government established an inter-departmental committee to examine rigorously our procedures in relation to the trafficking in arms, to determine whether there had been a gap in our controls.

Two DERA sites currently conduct animal experiments, Porton Down and Alverstoke. In 1993 the former RAF Institute of Aviation Medicine based at Farnborough, concluded a programme of work with animals. The number of animal experiments conducted at each in each calendar year since 1993 are in the table below.

 The Government is considering implications for radioactive waste management policy of the former Secretary of State's dismissal of the United Kingdom Nirex Ltd.'s appeal against refusal of planning permission for a Rock Characterisation Facility at Sellafield.

<P>

<a name="70605w04.html_para5">The previous Government's policy of "waste substitution" required BNFL to return intermediate-level waste to its foreign reprocessing customers (rather than a much smaller volume but radiologically equivalent amount of high-level waste) should the Nirex repository not be established by the time BNFL is contractually obliged to return the waste--i.e. 25 years after they are generated.

<a name="70605w05.html_para2">I have seen the report of the veterinarian who accompanied the pigs on their journey. I do not propose to place it in the Library.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what action he will take in the light of the EU Commission's statement that other member states are not taking enough precautions against risks of BSE in cattle or sheep and the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee's latest advice. [2624]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w05.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 In August 1996 the previous Government introduced a ban on the consumption of the heads of sheep and goats, following a recommendation from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee which had considered whether BSE could exist naturally in sheep. The Committee had also advised that the Government should continue to consider this issue further with its EU partners and implement a programme of further research.
<P>

<a name="70605w05.html_para3">Discussions took place during the latter part of 1996 in the European Union. The Commission proposed EU-wide controls on the use of spleen of all sheep and the brain and spinal cord of sheep which were more than about a year old, based on checking the number of permanent incisor teeth of the sheep. Unfortunately, despite support from the United Kingdom and a few other countries, the majority of Member States rejected this proposal.
<P>

<a name="70605w05.html_para4">I have raised this issue again with Commissioners Fischler and Bonino. The Commission announced on 14 May that it would be making further proposals.
<P>

<a name="70605w05.html_para5">In the light of this SEAC have reconsidered the question. There is still no scientific evidence indicating that there is any BSE in the national sheep population. But SEAC has recommended that it would be prudent for the Government to take early action if Community-wide measures are not agreed quickly, to extend controls, as proposed by the European Commission, to the spinal cord of sheep more than a year old--which account for around a sixth of annual consumption of sheepmeat in the UK--and to the spleen of all sheep. Similar action has already been taken by the Irish, French and Dutch Governments. This is a precautionary measure, designed to ensure that if BSE has been transmitted to sheep, all reasonable steps are taken to avoid any possible risks to consumers no matter how remote.




<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 1997 : Column: 228</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70605w05.html_para6">On the basis of the advice from SEAC, which I am placing in the Library of the House, the Government is today opening consultations on legislation which would extend the existing controls on the heads of all sheep and goats to the spleen, and would require the removal of spinal cord of sheep and goats with at least one permanent incisor erupted (the most practical means of ageing sheep over one year old). It would also ban the use of the vertebral column of sheep and goats in the production of mechanically recovered meat.
<P>

<a name="70605w05.html_para7">The SEAC statement also recommends reinforcing the existing arrangements for scrapie surveillance. The Government's intention is to reinforce the existing legal requirement on farmers to notify all cases of scrapie by providing new powers for the compulsory slaughter of affected animals, with payment of compensation, and by initiating a survey of brains from abattoirs and a postal survey of farms. The results of these surveys will be published. We are today opening consultation on this compulsory slaughter and compensation scheme.
<P>

<a name="70605w05.html_para8">Research into the epidemiology of the disease in sheep and goats is now under way. The new measures will significantly aid this research by providing further incentives for reporting disease, and additional material for research. In addition sheep are currently being selected from New Zealand, one of the few countries generally accepted as being free of scrapie, for use in a number of key long-term experiments. These sheep will provide a valuable resource for future work on scrapie.
<P>

<a name="70605w05.html_para9">The SEAC statement also includes advice on imported cattle. SEAC have advised that action should be taken to extend specified bovine material (SBM) controls to imported central nervous system (CNS) tissues or bovine material containing them. At present the legal requirement for the heads, spinal cord and certain other tissues of cattle to be removed from the food and animal feed chain, prohibited for use in pharmaceutical, cosmetic and medical products and disposed of under controlled conditions, applies only to carcases of bovine animals which have died or been slaughtered in the United Kingdom. The Government is opening consultation on proposals which would mean that the requirement to remove and dispose of specified tissues would apply not only to such carcases but also to bovine material which has been imported into the UK.

It contained a range of special measures to assist beef producers and included provision for supplementary payments to producers pro rata to their entitlement to subsidies under the Beef Special Premium and Suckler Cow Premium schemes in the 1996 scheme years. Provisional payments could however be based on 1995 claims so as to provide urgent financial support. At the time of payment if was made clear to producers that adjustment would follow to reflect

the position relating to 1996 subsidy claims. Beef producers who are being paid these subsidies on fewer animals in 1996 than in 1995 will be required to repay the supplement relating to the difference in numbers. Wherever possible, such overpayments will be deducted from balance payments due under the 1996 beef schemes. All monies recovered under this exercise will be re-distributed to those beef producers who qualified for subsidies on more animals in the 1996 scheme years than in 1995.

 Good progress has already been made towards the creation of a University of the Highlands and Islands. Planned provision for the UHI Project in 1997-98 is &#163;5 million. This is in addition to the &#163;1.3 million which was made available last year. I shall keep under review the general requirements for the Project in future taking account of any implications arising from the report of the Dearing Committee on Higher Education when it is published.

<P>
<a name="70605w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dewar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 May 1997]:</i> The Government is committed to returning the Scottish water authorities to local democratic control. A key consideration in taking this forward will be to ensure, in the light of our Manifesto commitment, that we fully observe both the letter and the spirit of the Nolan Committee's recommended procedures for making appointments to public bodies. We shall introduce change at a sensible pace which does not destabilise the recently constituted water authorities.
<P>

<a name="70605w07.html_para1">I have held discussions with the three current water authority chairmen. Each one of them has told me that he is willing to work closely with the new Government to achieve our objectives. I have therefore told them that I am happy for them to continue to serve until the end of 1997, and that I shall then re-examine the position.
<P>

<a name="70605w07.html_para2">The terms of appointment of roughly half of the present members of the water authorities come to an end on 30 June 1997. I intend, as an immediate first step, to advertise in accordance with the Nolan procedures for new members. We shall then consider those democratically elected local representatives who apply, as well as suitable candidates from other fields, including those current members whose appointments are coming to an end. Overall, I envisage a significant shift in the balance of board membership. The advertisement will make clear that applicants may also be considered for positions as chairmen.
<P>

<a name="70605w07.html_para3">To ensure the water authorities are able to operate effectively in the interim period while the Nolan procedures are being carried through, we shall invite members due to leave at the end of 30 June to accept re-appointment for a further six months to the end of the calendar year. The new appointments will then run from 1 January 1998.
<P>

<a name="70605w07.html_para4">I have asked my officials to conduct a review during this interim six month period of the further steps I might take to strengthen local democratic control. The review 



<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 1997 : Column: 234</I><P>
will consider a wide range of options for the water authorities. It will also consider any possible implications for the Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers Council.
<P>

<a name="70605w07.html_para5">I have asked my officials to consult extensively with all interested parties, including COSLA, the water authorities themselves, and the Scottish Water and Sewerage Customers Council. I have asked them to report to me in November.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Fifty-four representative organisations, who will have small firms in their membership, responded to the 1996 review. Of these representative organisations 22 were in favour of a Statutory Right to Interest and 32 were against.

<P><I>5 Jun 1997 : Column: 235</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70605w07.html_para7">It is clear that late payment continues to cause concern to small firms. A number of business surveys consistently show that a majority of small firms support legislation for a Statutory Right to Interest. A recent NOP survey in fact found that 80 per cent. of UK firms supported such legislation. It is in direct response to the committing concerns of small businesses that the Government will introduce the Fair Payment of Commercial Debts Bill.

 I am due to meet my hon. Friend shortly to discuss the progress of the liquidation of BCCI. I note that a first dividend of 24.5 pence in the pound was paid to creditors in December 1996 and I understand that the delay in paying that dividend was caused by the need to settle a number of legal actions in the UK and in foreign jurisdictions. I hope that the liquidators will be able to complete their work with as much speed as possible so that creditors may receive a further, substantial dividend at an early date.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w09.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Harman: </B> 
 We will introduce pension sharing for divorcing couples. This is an important step towards meeting the Government's objectives of improving the income of women in retirement.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para0">It is the combination of the Basic State Pension and a decent second pension which prevents people from retiring into poverty. But women are less likely than men to have a good second pension.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para1">Women are less likely than men to belong to an occupational pension scheme--in 1991 only 3.9 million women belonged to an occupational pension scheme, compared with 6.8 million men.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para2">Women's occupational pensions are worth less on average than men's: women aged 65-69 have an average income from occupational pensions of just &#163;22 a week, compared with &#163;67 a week for men.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para3">Women are less likely to have a personal pension: only 22 per cent. of women who work full-time have a personal pension, compared with 28 per cent. of men.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para4">As a result, women are more likely than men to be poor in retirement:
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para5">Seventy per cent. of the 2 million people over the age of 60 who depend on Income Support are women.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para6">Around three-quarters of the 1 million pensioners who do not claim the Income Support to which they are entitled--and who lose on average &#163;14 a week--are women.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para7">Women are less likely to have a good second pension because they are more likely to be in part-time or low-paid work, and they are more likely to interrupt their working lives to care for their families.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para8">Women make a vital contribution to the family income by bringing up children or caring for an elderly relative. On divorce, this contribution must be recognised, and where appropriate, pension rights shared.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para9">It is not currently possible to share pension rights between men and women. Under the current arrangements, maintenance payments can be made from one spouse to another--we expect usually from husband to wife--once the pension is in payment. But these payments can stop on the death of the pension scheme member, and a former spouse who re-marries could lose their share of the pension. In addition, these arrangements mean that a financial break between the spouses is not achieved; ties between them remain throughout their retirement.




<P>
<P><I>5 Jun 1997 : Column: 241</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para10">Our proposals will lead to fairer treatment of pensions in financial settlements between divorcing couples and will provide a better and more secure income in retirement for those receiving a share of pension rights.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the clinical implications of the National Blood Authority's proposal to cease blood processing in Liverpool in relation to hospital and domiciliary services; which hospitals are served by the Liverpool centre; and if he will make a statement. [1571]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w09.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The transfer of bulk testing and processing work from the Liverpool to the Manchester Blood Centre is part of the National Blood Authority's major reorganisation programme designed to improve the safety, efficiency and reliability of the Blood Service. The transfer will be carefully monitored to ensure that clinical services to hospitals will not be adversely affected.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para13">The hospitals served by the Liverpool blood centre are Alder Hey Children's, Arrowe Park, Broadgreen, Countess of Chester, Fazakerly, Glan Clwyd, Gwynedd, Maelor, Nobles, Ormskirk, Royal Liverpool, St. Helens, Southport, Walton, Warrington and Whiston. The Liverpool centre will continue to supply those hospitals with blood and to provide them with specialist services.
<P>

<a name="70605w09.html_para14">The plans to reorganise the service were announced in November 1995 after a wide-ranging lengthy and in parts contentious consultation exercise. Implementation of the reorganisation programme, which is being phased to tie in with the introduction of a new national computer system was already well advanced under the previous administration. However, in the light of recent representations on this matter, I have agreed to meet hon. Members from the Liverpool area to discuss, and hopefully resolve, their concerns about the change.

 We have no plans currently to collect centrally, information on those who have suffered adverse effects following radiotherapy treatment, although we are keeping these issues under review.

In May 1994 the Department issued guidance entitled "Quality Assurance in Radiotherapy--A Quality Management System for Radiotherapy".

The Royal College of Radiologists at the Department's request, convened a small group of professionals and lay people in Autumn 1994 to consider guidelines for care of women who have suffered tissue damage following radiotherapy for breast cancer.

The Royal College of Radiologists carried out a confidential clinical review of 126 women who had suffered injury following radiotherapy treatment for breast cancer at 15 centres in the period 1980-1993. The report makes recommendations on the management of breast cancer, particularly on radiotherapy, and for further research.

A sub-group is also considering issuing guidelines for health professionals on the care of women suffering adverse effects as a result of pelvic radiotherapy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what estimate he has made of the amount of money available for education from the abolition of the assisted places scheme in each financial year from 1997-98 to 2001-02, net of the costs of educating within the state sector those pupils who would otherwise have been within the assisted places scheme. [1948]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The previous Government's published expenditure plans for the assisted places scheme in England for the years 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 are &#163;140 million, &#163;160 million and &#163;180 million respectively. The Education (Schools) Bill currently before Parliament provides for no new assisted places to be awarded after the start of academic year 1997-98 and savings will therefore begin to accrue in financial year 1998-99. The Government's spending plans for 1998-99 onwards will be announced in due course and will take account of the savings progressively released from phasing out the scheme. Those savings will amount to about &#163;100 million in total by the year 2000. There will be no significant additional burden on Local Education Authorities from educating children who would otherwise have entered the assisted places scheme search year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 We estimate that nearly 5,000 assisted place holders will leave their schools at the end of the current academic year 1996-97 and a similar number will leave in 1997-98. The numbers leaving in future years will depend on the number of entry places taken up, for the last time, in September 1997 and are likely to increase as previous years' entry cohorts move up through the school and then leave. It is our intention that the scheme will be phased out over the seven years to 2004.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w10.html_wqn10"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many children will continue to hold an assisted place after the scheme has been ended in each year up to 2004; and at what cost to the public purse. [1950]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w10.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 There are some 33,140 assisted pupils in England in the current academic year 1996-97 and we expect that around 38,000 children will hold assisted places in academic year 1997-98. The number of assisted place holders from 1998-99 onwards will depend on the number of entry places taken up, for the last time, this coming September and will reduce year on year until the last pupil leaves in academic year 2003-04.
<P>

<a name="70605w10.html_para0">Current plans, already announced, for expenditure on the assisted places scheme in financial year 1997-98 amount to &#163;140 million. Provision for 1998-99 will be reviewed in the light of our commitment to phase out the scheme while allowing existing assisted place holders to continue their education a participating schools.

 Less than one in seven pupils, on average, at schools participating in the scheme currently hold assisted places. The phasing out of the scheme will have no significant effect on schools' viability overall. Participating schools themselves have made alternative arrangements for supporting some pupils and many will have no difficulty in filling other places with full fee-payers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will establish a statutory commission for disabled people. [2171]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70605w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 Our manifesto commits us to establishing "comprehensive, enforceable civil rights" for disabled people. We are consulting interested parties on the best way to achieve this and we shall develop proposals in the light of our discussions. The creation of a commission with enforcement powers will be central to those considerations.

Subject to Railtrack's agreement, the franchise operator may operate services other than those specified, if he desires to do so.

 Local authorities have the discretion to decide how much of their available resources to allocate to individual services, such as education. Staffing levels in individual schools are then a matter for the governing body. The Education (Schools) Bill which had its second reading on 2 June phases out the Assisted Places Scheme leaving the way open to use resources to cut class sizes for 5, 6 and 7 year olds to 30 or under. We will be consulting shortly on proposals.
