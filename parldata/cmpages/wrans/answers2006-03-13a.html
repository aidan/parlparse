 The bulk of the discussions have, quite properly, been with Post Office Ltd. and we have been talking to them about this since last summer. The first meeting on this was in fact instigated by the former chief executive of Post Office Ltd. (David Mills). The meetings have covered a number of issues, including the DWP pilots which have been running over the last few weeks. We also advised the National Federation and Postwatch before the pilots started.

</p>



<p><a name="qnpa_0">(2) what estimate he has made of the proportion of existing incapacity benefit claimants who will flow off benefit and into work following the introduction of the proposals outlined in the Green Paper A New Deal for Welfare: Empowering People to Work;  [51953]

<p><a name="st_5"><a name="60313w01.html_spnew5"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The Green Paper set out our proposed measures to significantly reduce the number of people claiming and receiving incapacity benefits. These 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>13 Mar 2006 : Column 1843W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
measures included improvements to workplace health, reform of the gateway, increased support for claimants and removing the perverse incentives in the system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60313w01.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_4">While it is difficult to model the precise impact of these measures at this early stage, the Green Paper set out our aspiration to reduce the number of claimants of incapacity benefits by one million over the course of a decade through the combined efforts of the Government, employers, local authorities and health professionals.

<p><a name="st_6"><a name="60313w01.html_spnew6"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 The current personal capability assessment focuses entirely on an individual&#039;s limits to functional capabilities, as a way of determining eligibility for benefit. It gives no regard to a person&#039;s capabilities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60313w01.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_5">In our Green Paper on Welfare Reform, we set out our plans for transforming the assessment into a much more constructive and proactive process, focusing not just on what an individual can&#039;t do but on what they can do as well. We will identify the barriers preventing an individual from returning to work and the types of support and intervention needed to overcome those barriers. We will also identify those people whose illness or disability limits them so severely that it would be unreasonable to expect to engage in work-related activity at that point in time. They will be entitled to a higher rate of benefit.

The provisions in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976 which banned media identification of sex offence defendants was repealed by the Criminal Justice Act 1988.

The last year of monitoring was 2000&#150;01 and QCA&#039;s records show that five secondary schools in the Peterborough local education authority area used the regulations for a total of 179 pupils. The total number of secondary schools in England that used the Key Stage 4 regulations in that academic year was 1,292, affecting 55,787 pupils.

 Information on the social background of students obtaining places on full-time undergraduate courses in the UK has been published by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) since 1994, and the figures for under 25-year-olds are shown in the following table.

Higher education leads to a range of benefits, not only higher earnings but reduced crime, better health, and wider social capital benefits.

We have reintroduced grants for those from low income households; we have ended up front fees; and we have

introduced the Office for Fair Access so that universities have agreements on outreach and funding help that they will offer poorer students. &#163;300 million is being offered in bursaries and other financial support. Alongside this, the Government and its partners support the Aimhigher programme, which enables partnerships of schools, colleges and universities to design and deliver a range of aspiration and attainment raising activities to enable young people from backgrounds currently under-represented in higher education to be able and willing to go on to HE. We are also determined to improve educational attainment so that more people are in a position to benefit from HE. Our proposals in the Schools White Paper, which is now the basis for The Education and Inspections Bill 2006, will help ensure that every young person has the opportunity to reach their potential, including, where appropriate, university education.

These include improvements in the provision of Emergency Towing Vessels, and the mandatory reporting system for tankers carrying heavy grades of oil into the newly designated Western European Particularly Sensitive Sea Area (PSSA). The Government also take account of wider developments in UK policy on the sustainable use of the marine environment, such as the growth in offshore renewable energy, the Government&#039;s commitment to introducing a Marine Bill, developments in thinking on marine spatial planning and advances in e-navigation technology. The introduction of any additional protective measures for MEHRAs has to be considered as part of these wider, inter-linked developments.

 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for International Development told the House on 1 March, the international community is united in its support for the Quartet statement of 30 January. Hamas needs to give up violence, recognise Israel and sign up to previous obligations on the peace process. Aid to the future government will be reviewed against those principles. While the current caretaker Government is in place, the international community is examining closely what steps could help to stabilise the financial situation, as recommended by the Quartet. On 27 February, the UK made &#163;5 million available to the World Bank to transfer to Abu Mazen&#039;s interim Government.

<a name="stpa_150">Prism brings major changes, it is not merely a new IT system. It establishes new processes and reinforces adherence to existing processes. This is a significant challenge, particularly for staff using Prism each day, including management officers, accountants and buyers. Their workload certainly increases during the first months of using the system. For many, this has been exacerbated by Prism&#039;s poor performance, particularly its speed. A concerted effort to improve this is beginning to pay dividends for a significant number of Posts. But many using satellite links continue to face slow performance. Despite this, our experience is that, once Posts get to grips with Prism, workloads start to return to normal. Posts with most Prism experience are beginning to see tangible benefits from the changes.
