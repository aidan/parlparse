To ensure the benefits of prompt payment to main contractors are felt through the supply chain and benefit smaller businesses, all Departments have included a clause in their contracts that requires main contractors to pay their suppliers within 30 days.</p>

               <b>Mr Prisk:</b>
 Businesses in the same sector and often of similar sizes are normally subject to the same baseline standards of regulation regardless of the risk they might pose. This is because most regulatory requirements are of general application, which means that they apply to their addressees equally. This is necessary to ensure consistency and a level-playing field across the regulatory landscape.</p>

               <a name="11061741000170"> However, while similar businesses may be required to meet the same levels of regulation, the enforcement of the regulation may, and should, be varied according to risk. The Regulators' Compliance Code (issued under the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006) gives statutory effect to these principles. The Code requires regulators to ensure that all aspects of their regulatory activity are informed by risk.</p>

To that end, we have commissioned an independent review of health and safety legislation, led by Professor Lofstedt. We plan to reform Britain's health and safety system and ensure we reduce unnecessary burdens on business while maintaining standards of protection.</p>

 We have made no such assessments. However, information on the capability of the rail supply chain and the enablers and barriers to the efficient operation of that supply chain was submitted to the Sir Roy McNulty review examining value-for-money in the railway industry. The McNulty report entitled “Realising the Potential of GB Rail” was published on 19 May and includes a range of recommendations to improve value for money in the rail industry including with regard to supply chain management. The Government are now considering how the recommendations will feed into wider proposals for reform of the rail industry before the end of the year.</p>

 Departments are responsible for ensuring that they and their sponsored sectors have robust contingency plans in place to respond to civil emergencies. The Civil Contingencies Secretariat works closely with them providing support and assistance as necessary. Where gaps are identified, resources are directed to address them on a risk assessed basis. I believe that these arrangements provide a sound basis for emergency preparedness and response within central Government. This has been demonstrated in effective central Government response to a number of recent civil emergencies.</p>

The median is the value below which 50 per cent of employees fall. It is ONS's preferred measure of average earnings as it is less affected by a relatively small number of very high earners and the skewed distribution of earnings. It therefore gives a better indication of typical earnings than the mean.</p>

 For each of the years between 2006-07 and 2010-11 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) provided grant in aid to the Gambling Commission to be used for gambling research, primarily the British Gambling Prevalence Surveys for 2007 and 2010, but did not fund education and treatment. In 2005-06, when the Gambling Commission took on the responsibilities of its predecessor, the Gaming Board for Great Britain, a small proportion of the Grant in aid received from DCMS was spent on gambling research but a detailed breakdown can be provided only at disproportionate cost. The following table sets out the Department's provision for gambling research and industry contributions to research, education and treatment.</p>

As a result of the consequent discussions, DEFRA commissioned the university to undertake some further work to enhance understanding of the origin and the significance of this new finding. Included within this additional work was the investigation of some cattle <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> isolates that the VLA had retained as an archive after a research project into mastitis (inflammation of the udder) in cattle. None of these isolates were identified as MRSA by the VLA using normal testing protocols, although a few showed some resistance to the antibiotics commonly used to identify MRSA. These isolates identified by VLA as having a degree of resistance underwent further examination during this additional research and some were shown to be similar to the strain identified by Cambridge.</p>

A sub-group specifically on MRSA will also continue to monitor all new developments relating to all types of MRSA and will advise on potential policy options accordingly. Further research projects will be commissioned on antimicrobial resistance. Their scope will continue to be prioritised, and this will be informed by the DARC group, which assesses risk to help target funding to where it is most needed.</p>

Issues raised have been: access to health and education services provided across Ethiopia with support from the UK and other donors; Ethiopia's plans for hydropower; commercial farming; democratisation; the role of NGOs; the humanitarian situation; and consultation on priorities for the Department for International Development's programme in Ethiopia.</p>

 A report on the Professional Judgement Project that ran in the Surrey and Sussex Probation Trust was circulated to chief executives and chairs of probation trusts on 12 April 2011. Although too early for data on final outcomes of community sentences, the report found that 98% of those who responded to a staff survey said the new permission to exercise professional judgment had helped them to do their work better and 96% said it had enabled them to match their time and resources more appropriately to the risks and needs of the offenders they were supervising. The learning from the project informed the development of the national standards for the management of offenders (2011) issued this year.

The survey interviewed victims and prosecution witnesses aged 18 and over, whose case resulted in a charge, between four and six months after the case had closed. Victims and witnesses in sensitive cases (such as sexual offences or domestic violence, crimes involving a fatality, or any crime where the defendant was a family member or a member of the witness's or victim's household) were not included on ethical grounds.</p>

 By virtue of section 326 of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (the 2003 Act), the responsible authority for each MAPPA area must keep the arrangements which it has established for the assessment and management of eligible offenders under review in consultation with persons appointed by the Secretary of State as lay advisers in relation to that authority. Lay advisers are members of the public.

Under the same guidance, lay advisers are not expected routinely to attend MAPPA meetings, which are operational in nature, and even where they do so, should not be involved in decision-making about risk assessments and risk management plans for individual offenders.</p>
