<P>
<a name="90701w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the cost of the climate change levy to his Department and <i>(b)</i> the savings from the reduction in national insurance contributions that will occur when it is introduced.  [88864]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The net impact of the climate change levy and the associated reduction in main rate of employers' National Insurance Contributions on the Department of Trade and Industry will depend on the rates of the climate change levy. The final rates of climate change levy will not be set until Finance Bill 2000.
<P>

<a name="90701w01.htm_para0">In addition, the Government are still considering a number of detailed issues on the tax treatment of different energy products which could have a significant impact in some instances. It is, therefore, not possible to give definitive figures about the impact of the climate change levy on this Department.

<P>

<a name="90701w01.htm_para6">The Commission introduced an open debate on the future direction of the single market. There was general agreement on the need to define strategic objectives against which the development of the single market could be monitored and on the priority areas for action (including public procurement, electronic commerce and mutual recognition). The Scoreboard was confirmed as a tool for monitoring progress; the latest version showed that the deficit in the transposition of directives was being reduced.
<P>

<a name="90701w01.htm_para7">The Commission reported on the progress of SLIM IV (Simpler Legislation in the Internal Market), the review of the SLIM initiative and the prospects for SLIM V. The Netherlands introduced a joint paper from the Netherlands, Denmark and the UK and there was agreement from other member states that there was a need for improvements to help realise the potential of SLIM.
<P>

<a name="90701w01.htm_para8">The Council reached political agreement on the Orphan Drugs Regulation (which provides incentives for the development of drugs for the treatment of rare diseases) and Customs 2000, and agreed Conclusions on Tourism and Employment. With the exception of a Spanish Gibraltar-related reservation on the designation of competent authorities, there was unanimous political agreement on the substance of the Takeovers Directive, which included the text that the Government had sought dealing with the issue of litigation. There was no agreement on the new chocolate directive, despite a qualified majority in favour of the Presidency's compromise, because of Commission objections to the proposed comitology provisions.
<P>

<a name="90701w01.htm_para9">The Commission introduced Communications on the Environment and the Internal Market and on Mutual Recognition. There was a brief debate on international exhaustion of trademark rights following a Commission presentation. The Council took note of progress reports on Standardisation; the Copyright and related rights in the Information Society Directive; the Electronic Commerce Directive; and the Commission's oral report on Counterfeiting and Piracy. The Council took note of a progress report on the reform of Customs Transit Systems and adopted a Resolution. The Commission announced the imminent publication of an amended proposal on Community Design.
<P>

<a name="90701w01.htm_para10">Ministers discussed the Artists' Resale Right Directive. The Council agreed to give more time to discussions in order to find a solution to the remaining difficulties some member states have with the proposed directive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 I am aware of the importance of technology to the aerospace industry and saw many examples of high-technology products on the stands of UK companies during my recent visit to the Paris Air Show. Under the Department's Civil Aircraft Research and Technology Demonstration (CARAD) Programme, DTI officials maintain a close dialogue with the industry in various fora about research into aeronautics technologies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what research his Department has commissioned on the condition of historic public buildings in urban parks.  [88902]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 Neither my Department nor the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions have commissioned any such research. English Heritage's buildings at risk register contains information on all the grade I and II* listed buildings known to them to be 'at risk' through neglect and decay or vulnerable to becoming so.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w01.htm_wqn6"><B> Ms Walley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has to <i>(a)</i> discuss the protection of non-listed historic public buildings in urban parks with local authorities and <i>(b)</i> publish guidance on the conservation of non-listed historic public buildings in urban parks.  [88903]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w01.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 Neither my Department, nor the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has any such plans at present. Unlisted buildings in urban parks are in some cases likely to be covered by conservation area controls, guidance on which is included in Planning Policy Guidance Note 15: Planning and the Historic Environment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w01.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Alan Howarth: </B> 
 The Royal Parks Agency (RPA) was established on 1 April 1993 as an Executive Agency of my Department with responsibility for managing and policing the Royal Parks in London and some other related areas.
<P>

<a name="90701w01.htm_para11">I have today announced the start of our review of the Agency, which was postponed during the completion of the Comprehensive Spending Review. This will include an evaluation of its performance since launch and a review of the options for the best management of its functions. We aim to complete the review by the end of November 1999. A copy of the announcement has been placed in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w01.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The current estimate for the start of Thameslink 2000 services is May 2006. There is nothing planned within the scope of the scheme which would prevent the introduction of the Crossrail project.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 London Underground Ltd. has incurred legal fees amounting to &#163;15,000 to date in defending proceedings commenced by Mr. Marlow and in pursuing a counterclaim against him.

<a name="90701w01.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Minister for Transport and I met the managing director of London Underground (LU) last week. He satisfied us that LU are operating additional services on the Hammersmith & City and Metropolitan Lines, along part of the route where Circle Line services usually run, and a normal District Line service along most of the rest of the Circle Line. All stations remain open. Additional buses are also running on routes 16, 23 and 52. Underground tickets and passes are valid on these buses. We have asked him to inform us immediately if this should change.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the potential for genetically modified terminator genes in plants to escape into the environment; and if he will make a statement.  [88638]<P>

<P>
<a name="90701w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 June 1999]:</i> Although 'terminator gene' technology has been patented in the United States of America, it has not been introduced into any crops. The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment is to set up a sub-group to advise on best practice in developing genetically modified plants. The sub group's work will include consideration of the environmental impact of 'terminator genes' and similar approaches. The sub group's findings will be published.

<P>
<P><I>1 Jul 1999 : Column: 237</I><P>
on new varieties of genetically modified crops and seeds pending the completion of the review of EU Directive 90/220; and if he will make a statement.  [88875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 June 1999]:</i> The UK Government did not support the call for suspension of releases pending the completion of the amendment to Directive 90-220 during the Luxembourg Environment Council. The UK and a number of other Member States were sceptical of the legal justification for such a moratorium and considered that rapid and effective revision of the current Directive should be the top priority in the negotiations.
<P>

<a name="90701w02.htm_para0">The common position agreed in Luxembourg strengthens the existing Directive in a wide range of areas such as risk assessment and monitoring. Moreover, the safeguard clause will continue to apply, allowing Member States to take immediate action to suspend a release should evidence of harm emerge.
<P>

<a name="90701w02.htm_para1">During the Environment Council, the Council Legal Service confirmed that a moratorium suspending application of the existing Directive would not be possible. This position was supported by the Commission. The Council Legal Service outlined some limited scope offered by Article 95 (5) of the Amsterdam Treaty which enabled Member States to derogate from harmonised legislation where specific environmental problems emerge. However, the UK took the view that agreement on strict new provisions for the amendment of Directive 90-220 should take priority over a moratorium of doubtful legality.

[89053]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 June 1999]:</i> The Government are determined to apply further necessary restrictions to the importation, marketing and use of white asbestos. I have received advice from the Health and Safety Commission about those new restrictions in the form of draft regulations. I will act on that advice as soon as the European Commission has ratified the vote of their technical committee to adapt to technical progress Council Directive 76/769/EEC. I am hopeful that this ratification will not be subject to any unnecessary delay. The UK continues to encourage the European Commission to act swiftly on this vitally important measure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 On 13 April the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions announced his decision not to cap any authorities. However, he decided to call in twelve authorities with the largest increases in budget requirement and council tax to put them on warning for next year.
<P>

<a name="90701w02.htm_para2">I have now met the representatives of these twelve authorities. The meetings have been constructive. We discussed why the authorities had made such large increases and I explained that when we look at the budgets for 2000-01 we will be able to take this year's increase into account. Most of the authorities have told us that they do not expect to make such large increases next year.
<P>

<a name="90701w02.htm_para3">However, it is not only these authorities that will need to consider next year's increase carefully. All authorities should remember that, under the new reserve powers, the Government will be able to look back at increases over two years.

To ask the hon. Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission, what assessment the Commission has received of the Portcullis House project; and if he will make a statement.  [89516]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w02.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 In February the House of Commons Commission appointed Messrs Northcroft, Chartered Quantity Surveyors and Construction Consultants, to undertake a mid-term review of the Portcullis House project, including an analysis of changes in the cost; to consider whether the current cost estimate and timetable are realistic and whether there is a case for modifying any aspects of the project to reduce costs and improve value for money; and to provide any comparisons with other comparable buildings.
<P>

<a name="90701w02.htm_para4">The report has now been received. Its key conclusion is that, when account is taken of the quality, the long lifespan of the building and other relevant factors, the building provides value for money for the House. Other main findings are that:
<P>

<a name="90701w02.htm_para5"><P>
<BR>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the team is totally committed to delivering the approved scheme.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90701w02.htm_para8">While the report acknowledges that the cost of the project is high, it records that account has to be taken of the particular reasons and the quality of the building.
<P>

<a name="90701w02.htm_para9">The report contains a number of detailed recommendations that Northcroft believe will help assure delivery within the programme and budget. These will now be considered and implemented as appropriate.
<P>

<a name="90701w02.htm_para10">The Executive Summary of the report is available in the Vote Office. The full text of the Report has been deposited in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90701w02.htm_para11">Good progress has continued to be made since the fieldwork for the report was undertaken in January and February, reinforcing the views of the consultants about the programme and budget. There is now every prospect of the work being completed three or four weeks in advance of the current programme and of the final cost being some &#163;15 million below budget. The project team will explore opportunities for further improvements while they continue to strive to achieve a high quality building.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 18 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>255</i>, relating to the publication of the Stability Pact for South East Europe, on which treaty article it is based; if it requires further European Union legislation for its operation; and what is the basis of the term pact being introduced into the affairs of the European Union and Community.  [88682]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The EU agreed a Common Position on 17 May, the legal basis of which is article 15 of the Treaty on European Union, setting out the general objectives for the Stability Pact initiative. The Stability Pact for South East Europe, approved by the participants' Foreign Ministers on 10 June, is not itself a legal instrument of the European Union, although the European Union will play the leading role within the initiative. In the light of this, there may be a requirement for a Joint Action to meet future operational costs. There is no generic basis for the use within the EU of the term pact.

 <i>[holding answer 29 June 1999]:</i> A fisheries patrol vessel, based on the island of Tristan Da Cunha, was provided to Tristan Da Cunha by the British Government in 1996. It is based on the island of Tristan Da Cunha and does not have the range to patrol Gough Island coastal waters. The only vessels that monitor fishing in the area around Gough Island are those of the Tristan lobster fishing concessionaire, Premier Fishing. All Premier Fishing vessels carry a Tristanian Government observer when fishing in the waters of the Tristan Da Cunha group. Each observer is also a designated conservation officer under the terms of the Tristan Da Cunha Conservation Ordinance 1976.
<P>

<a name="90701w03.htm_para1">Gough Island was declared a World Heritage Site in 1995. The area covered by this designation includes the island itself and the marine area out to three nautical miles. Gough Island has a strict Wildlife Management Plan in place. An Environmental Inspector is annually appointed and sent to the Island to ensure that the Plan is being adhered to, and to make recommendations for improvements to it.

(1) The second part of the table relates solely to successful claims cleared by the Pensions Appeals Tribunals. Due to the time taken to process appeals, they are not necessarily decided in the same year as that in which they are lodged. Figures of appeals lodged and decided in a particular year do not therefore necessarily relate to the same appeal.<P>

<P>

<i>Note:</i><P>

War Pensions appeals fall into 2 broad categories:<P>

Entitlement--Those where the issue is whether the claimed disablement or death is related to service in HM Forces.<P>

Assessment--Those where the issue is the degree of disablement which is due to service. The higher the degree of disablement, the higher the rate of war disablement pensions awarded. <P>

<P>
<P><I>1 Jul 1999 : Column: 247</I><P>
detailed work has been carried out to establish the level of administrative support required by the reformed TA. As it is our intention to make the TA more relevant, more usable and more fully integrated into the regular armed forces, we have concluded that the level of administrative support needs to be tailored to the readiness of the unit involved. Accordingly, the overall level of administrative support staff is being reduced broadly in line with the reduction in TA personnel and some units will receive an increased level of support. Altogether this will mean that there will be a net loss of some 600 civilian jobs nationally. MOD Trades Unions have been fully consulted about the implications for civilian staff and have raised a number of concerns, which are being addressed. My officials will now be working closely with the Trades Unions to ensure that the process of implementing the new TA structure is handled as sensitively as possible.

It falls to the Attorney-General to institute legal proceedings to protect a charity and to represent the charitable interest. The Attorney-General is a necessary party to any litigation in which the objects of a charity need to be separately represented, for example, where the interest of the Trustees do not coincide with the objects of the charity.

The new definition will be incorporated into the Notes for Guidance 1999-2000 to forces on collecting this data.
<P>

<a name="90701w06.htm_para5">The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 introduced new offences for racial crime which came into force on 30 September 1998. These correspond to the existing main offences which deal with violence against the person (except those which carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment), criminal damage and offences of harassment. They relate to cases in which there was either racial motivation or any aggravating evidence of racial hostility in connection with the offence and provide the courts with higher maximum penalties to reflect the racial aspect to the crime. These are separate criminal offences in law and will be identified as such at all stages of the criminal justice system.

 As expected, section 49 of the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 ('plea before venue') had led to a decrease in the number of persons committed to the Crown Court for trial. This decrease has been apparent both in those cases which are directed there by the magistrates, and in those where the defendant elects to be tried in the Crown Court. The proportion of cases reaching the Crown Court by way of election, which fell steadily from 53 per cent. to 28 per cent. in the 10 years 1987-97, remained at 28 per cent. in 1998, the first full year in which plea before venue was in operation.

<P>
<a name="90701w07.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 There will be no mandatory link between key escrow and being an approved provider of cryptography services under the proposed e-commerce legislation. Approved providers will be free to offer those cryptographic services required by their clients. These may, for good business reasons, include the storage of their clients' encryption keys. Encryption technologies are vital for instilling trust in e-commerce transactions and the Government do not propose to control their legitimate use. The same technologies, can, however, also be put to criminal use. In response to this threat, the Government intend to provide the law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies with new powers to require any person, upon service of a properly authorised written notice, to produce specified material in an intelligible form or to disclose relevant material (for example a decryption key) necessary to render it intelligible. The legislation will contain strong safeguards and the powers will only apply to material which is, or has been, lawfully obtained.

 Under the Kyoto Protocol the UK is committed to a legally binding target of a 12.5 per cent. reduction in greenhouse gas emissions below 1990 levels by 2008-12.

<P>

<a name="90701w07.htm_para8">During 1996 and 1997, the Government negotiated five voluntary agreements with the various industry sectors including the refrigeration industry, to limit both use and emissions of HFCs. Under current policies HFC emissions are expected to fall by a substantial amount. The latest projections show that HFCs will contribute only around 1 per cent. of total UK greenhouse gas emissions, calculated in terms of the global warming contribution, by 2010.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w08.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Financial tensions in Brazil have eased significantly, following the IMF-led international financial support package agreed last year. The conditions attached to the UK's contributions to this support package are those of the programme as a whole and the UK Government will continue to play an active role in monitoring Brazil's performance under the programme. Continued adherence under the IMF programme, together with an appropriate contribution from private sector creditors, underpins the BIS co-ordinated credit line, to which the UK has also contributed.

<a name="90701w08.htm_para2">The UK Government have played their part, most recently at the G7 Summit on 18 June, to ensure that future packages to which the UK contributes are as effective as possible. Commitments which were made at the Summit to help achieve this included promoting the involvement of the private sector in crisis resolution; ensuring that the poor and vulnerable are better protected from the burden of adjustment in times of crisis; and greater transparency in the way in which the International Financial Institutions operate.

 During the wide consultations which have been carried out to forge a consensus on necessary reforms to the international financial system, consideration has been given to a range of proposals for taxation of foreign currency transactions. Such proposals raise a number of practical difficulties which we have considered but do not believe could be overcome. Similarly, it would be extremely difficult to determine robust estimates of the revenue yield, which could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 Inland Revenue, Customs and Excise and HM Treasury's Euro Preparations Unit have worked to ensure that UK business and public authorities were ready for the introduction of the euro in 11 other European Union countries on 1 January 1999. There is a continuing need to provide UK business with the information that they need to help them remain competitive in this new European business environment. In line with the Government's stated position that the public sector will take a lead in planning, departments have also been considering the implications of possible UK entry to the European Single Currency. This work has been part of the normal business of departments and to date changeover work has not involved expenditure on extra staff, accommodation or the development of IT systems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w08.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The cost of euro preparations would depend on the detailed approach that the UK took to the changeover. Where computer systems are being upgraded, all departments will build in euro compatibility where that represents value for money. In the case of the DSS, the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise, the scale and complexity of their computer systems makes advance preparations critical. Prior to a referendum they may therefore need to spend up to some tens of millions of pounds, spread over a number of years to make their IT systems euro-compatible, so that we can maintain the flexibility for Britain to make the changeover as quickly and cost effectively as possible if that is what Government, Parliament and the people decide.
<P>

<a name="90701w08.htm_para3">Provisions were therefore included in the Finance Bill and the Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill which will provide specific statutory authority for this spending. Expenditure will be voted by Parliament in the normal way.

 As the former Economic Secretary my hon. Friend the Member for Airdrie and Shotts (Mrs. Liddell) announced on 27 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>23-24</i>, the Financial Services and Markets Bill, now before the House, will provide for the repeal of the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977. Subject to the approval of Parliament, this will end the statutory status of the Insurance Brokers Registration Council (IBRC). The Joint Committee on Financial Services and Markets' recent report on the draft Bill supported this approach.
<P>

<a name="90701w09.htm_para1">I am grateful to the current IBRC members for their work in continuing to serve on the Council in the interests of the insurance broking community during the present transitional period. To assist them in that task, I have today, under existing powers, nominated three new members to fill vacancies on the Council, to serve until the Council's statutory status ends:

<a name="90701w09.htm_para5">I am pleased that, since my right hon. Friend's announcement, the insurance industry, including general insurance intermediaries, has risen to the challenge she outlined. A broad-based range of support has developed for the General Insurance Standards Council (GISC), a new voluntary body to promote high standards of professional conduct among general insurance intermediaries.
<P>

<a name="90701w09.htm_para6">The GISC is committed to strengthening industry standards and developing general insurance intermediaries' services to the public in all parts of the market. It plans to complement the statutory responsibilities of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) while stripping away unnecessary regulatory requirements on general insurance intermediaries. The GISC has gathered support with impressive speed. If it can fulfil its promise, it will provide valuable services to both general insurance intermediaries and their customers.
<P>

<a name="90701w09.htm_para7">There may in future be a case for statutory regulation of general insurance intermediaries. If so, the Financial Services and Markets Bill contains a provision which would enable the Treasury to specify regulated activity, and to give regulatory responsibility to the FSA. For the moment, I have no plans to specify advice on general insurance as a regulated activity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w09.htm_spnew13"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 June 1999]:</i> The measures introduced in the last Budget reduce the incentive for drivers to use a company car for business mileage and to do excess business mileage simply to qualify for discounts on their tax charge. They are therefore likely to lead to a small reduction in company car mileage. The Inland Revenue also estimates that as a result of the comprehensive reforms to be introduced in 2002, between 100 and 300 million fewer business miles will be driven in company cars, a reduction of between 0.3 per cent.- 0.8 per cent.

 This Department has no powers to dictate to authorities with public procurement responsibilities. None the less, my right hon. Friend the Minister has written to a number of Government Departments to underline the guarantees that British pigmeat can offer. He drew attention to the good story which the industry has to tell in respect of its efforts on quality assured and welfare friendly production practices. The responses received indicate that quality assured and welfare friendly production practices play a full part in the tender specifications laid down by public procurement bodies.

<P>
<a name="90701w12.htm_spnew12"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Influenza viruses change and different strains predominate from year to year. Each season a new vaccine is produced from strains of virus closely related to those expected to be in circulation. The effectiveness of the vaccine will depend on how well the vaccine strains match the strains of influenza that actually circulate. Effective global surveillance co-ordinated by the World Health Organisation means that in most years there is a good match.
<P>

<a name="90701w12.htm_para6">All information on the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in preventing influenza and its complications is reviewed on a regular basis by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the expert advisory committee that advises the Government on immunisation matters.

 The Government have already taken action to improve the availability of National Health Service (NHS) dentistry through the Investing in Dentistry (IID) and Personal Dental Services (PDS) initiatives. The IID initiative, which ended in April, should give over 650,000 extra patients the opportunity of registering with an NHS dentist. The 15 PDS pilots which began in October 1998, and the 24 new proposals to be developed into pilots for this October, are designed to offer NHS patients a better, more accessible, reliable and higher quality dental service. The Government are now examining options on how best to use the resources available for further improving the availability of dentistry. A dental strategy will be published later this year.

 Whole cell pertussis vaccine, used in combined DTP vaccine, is used in the United Kingdom because it is the safest and most effective pertussis vaccine available for the UK childhood immunisation programme.
<P>

<a name="90701w14.htm_para0">Large vaccine trials in Sweden and Germany have shown that the pertussis whole cell vaccine that we use in the United Kingdom is amongst the most effective available. There is little difference in the level of local reactions and fever seen after use of the UK whole cell vaccine when compared to acellular pertussis vaccines given under the UK immunisation schedule. The protection given by the UK vaccine is as good as the best acellular vaccine tested and better than the rest. There is also some evidence that combining the acellular pertussis vaccine with Hib vaccine, which is given at the same time, may decrease the immune response to Hib which affects its suitability for routine use.

 <i>[holding answer 29 June 1999]:</i> Work to combat drug-resistant and multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is continuing. The United Kingdom has heightened its surveillance of drug and multidrug-resistant tuberculosis through a scheme co-ordinated by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) through the UK Mycobacterial Resistance Network. Work has also commenced on enhanced surveillance of tuberculosis cases which should improve monitoring. The appointment of Regional Epidemiologists should help towards a more co-ordinated approach. The activities of the PHLS are now co-ordinated through the new Tuberculosis Programme. The PHLS has developed and made available more rapid diagnostic and drug susceptibility tests for tuberculosis, which can be used where there is a presence of risk factors which might predispose towards multidrug-resistant tuberculosis. A report by the Interdepartmental Working Group on Tuberculosis, "UK guidance for prevention and control of the transmission of HIV-related and drug resistant, including multiple drug-resistant, tuberculosis", was published in September 1998.

<a name="90701w14.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Prodigy decision support system has undergone two research phases, during which it was tested in 183 general practices with around 750 doctors. The results of the research indicated that a large proportion of general practitioners were very interested in having such a tool available for their use. In light of this positive response, a first release version of Prodigy will be made available to any GP who wants it. There will be a third phase of the research project, which will look at the management of chronic disease.
<P>

<a name="90701w14.htm_para1">Prodigy is designed to offer good quality, clinically effective advice to GPs. When applying the Prodigy recommendations, doctors should use their discretion and clinical judgment, taking into account individual patient variations and needs. General practitioners remain free to prescribe whichever product they feel is the most appropriate for their patients.
<P>

<a name="90701w14.htm_para2">The recommended treatments in Prodigy have been chosen on the basis of clinical effectiveness, safety and appropriateness. Where more than one drug exists with similar clinical effect, or where the benefits of one drug over another are marginal, then cost is brought into consideration. The clinical advice contained in the current release of Prodigy is refined and validated with the assistance of a committee of representatives from the General Practitioners Committee, the Royal College of General Practitioners, the Royal College of Physicians and the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain. All were chosen for the personal expertise and qualities they were able to bring to the process. For the longer term, an equally robust process will be set up under the oversight of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). Full details of how NICE will take this forward will be published in due course. Prodigy guidance takes full account of existing national or well-recognised guidelines, where these are appropriate to general medical practice. In time, Prodigy will allow easy access to NICE guidance and a swift means of communicating emergency medical messages to GPs, plus information about new drugs, contra-indications and safety alerts.
<P>

<a name="90701w14.htm_para3">Patient groups, the pharmaceutical industry and other representative organisations have been consulted throughout the Prodigy project, both on the content of the clinical guidance and on patient information leaflets available as part of the Prodigy system. Each organisation is given the opportunity to comment on new Prodigy recommendations as they are developed and their views are taken into account at the time the recommendations are finalised. These groups will continue to be consulted as Prodigy is made more widely available to GPs over the coming months.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what skin products appear on the Prodigy prescribing system; and how they were selected.  [89103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w14.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 A list of the skin products which appear in, or are being considered for inclusion in, the Prodigy guidance on skin conditions, will be placed in the Library. The majority of these dermatology topics have not yet been released to general practitioners as they are undergoing final amendments (the status of each Prodigy guidance topic is indicated in the schedule).

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much was spent on training medical professionals in counselling and interpersonal and management skills in the last year for which figures are available.  [89092]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w14.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Although training in counselling, interpersonal and management skills is an important component of all stages of medical education, no data are held centrally on the resources devoted to these activities. Decisions on the allocation of resources between different components of training are professional considerations and are not prescribed centrally.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what training has been given to magistrates regarding the sentencing of young offenders under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.  [88929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90701w15.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 It is the responsibility of individual Magistrates Courts' Committees (MCCs) to provide training to the magistrates in their area. The Judicial Studies Board has provided training materials for those provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which are currently being piloted. These materials are being evaluated and will be issued to all MCCs in time for the piloted provisions being introduced nationally.
