The aim is to minimise the negative effect of projects that may divert funds, staff and effort to specific health issues at the expense of broader services. In response to such concerns GAVI has established a health systems funding window to support the infrastructure needed to deliver sustainable health systems and the Global Fund model is evolving with the recent contribution to the pooled health sector fund in Mozambique.</p>

 The Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) has housed the United Kingdom National Central Bureau (NCB) for Interpol since 1 April 2006. Previously the NCB was housed within the pre-cursor agency the National Criminal Intelligence Service (NCIS). The process undertaken in SOCA is the same as it was in NCIS.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="70301w0010.htm_para2"><a name="07030168000087">While the NCB is not responsible for the collection and recording of information on UK nationals who commit crime abroad, the unit will receive such information during the course of international law enforcement co-operation, which is its remit. The sources of information will vary, but may include information from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. An initial assessment of the quality of the information is made. If there is insufficient identification material, more details are requested. Research is carried out against available databases in order to identify if the individual is already known or of interest to UK law enforcement. Where sufficient details of identity and offence are received, the case officer will forward this to the National Identification Service. Any existing record will be updated, or a new criminal record will be created.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_411"><a name="70301w0010.htm_para3"><a name="07030168000088">Since many notifications will be contained within investigative casework, neither SOCA, nor NCIS before it, have statistics which would accurately reflect the number of conviction notifications received, or what percentage of these have been added to the Police National Computer.</p>

 There have not been any specific targets set for dealing with the relatively small number of considerations for revocations of deportation orders actioned by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND). Revocation of an order does not mean the subject may re-enter the UK. It only makes them eligible to apply for entry under the Immigration Rules. Consideration of these applications is not measured using average times but rather is included in the total for all non-asylum, non-charged postal applications. These are measured against the published service standards set for IND&#146; Managed Migration which are that 25 per cent. of all applications should be completed within 20 working days, and 30 per cent. completed within 70 working days. As of 31 January 2007, 43 per cent. of these applications are completed within 20 working days and 87 per cent. are completed within 70 working days. The above data is not provided under the National Statistics protocols. It has been derived from local management information and is therefore provisional and subject to change.</p>

 Service personnel are only used to provide cover during fire strikes as a last resort. There are accordingly no armed forces personnel on permanent standby or permanently trained to provide emergency fire cover. In the event of a strike, fire services are expected to explore all other available options drawing on professional firefighters. This has been borne out recently, as military assistance was not required during Fire Brigade Union industrial action in Hertfordshire and Merseyside last year.</p>

 Military patients can be treated in any NHS hospital, which is the most effective way of enabling them to benefit from the latest advances in medical treatment and the recent major investments in NHS facilities. On average, on any one day, the number of military in-patients in NHS hospitals throughout the UK will be barely enough to fill two wards.</p>

When a snapshot exercise was carried out on 10 October 2006, there were 33 service in-patients in the five NHS hospitals hosting Ministry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs) and 16 in-patients at the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine (RCDM) in Birmingham. A small number of individuals were also being treated at NHS hospitals who do not host one of our MDHUs. However, the number of personnel falling into this category are not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. It was estimated that there were around a further 15 to 25 service personnel as in-patients in NHS hospitals on 10 October 2006, in addition to those in the MDHU and RCDM hospitals.</p>

 Service personnel have always been entitled to secondary care and community services in the NHS since it was formed in 1948.

 It is important to be clear about the differences between avian influenza, seasonal influenza, and pandemic influenza. Avian influenza is a disease of birds which occasionally affects people. Seasonal influenza refers to the illness which occurs each winter due to human influenza viruses which are circulating in the population. Pandemic influenza occurs infrequently, when a new influenza virus emerges which is markedly different from those recently circulating in the human population, causes disease in people and spreads easily between people because they have little or no immunity to it. This could happen through an avian influenza virus, such as the H5N1 virus, mutating into a different strain with greater affinity for people.</p>

 Primary care trusts (PCTs) are expected to make all reasonable efforts to ensure that resources allocated for primary dental care services are spent on commissioning and/or providing dental services. This can be through general dental services contracts, personal dental services agreements or through PCT dental services. Strategic health authorities have also been asked to maintain, as a minimum, levels of investment in dental services across their area, if necessary by re-deploying resources between PCTs. It is for PCTs locally to decide what levels of dental services to seek to commission for a given level of expenditure and to decide how far services should be monitored through weighted courses of treatment (for example, units of dental activity) or through other measures.</p>

 The contracts agreed between primary care trusts (PCT) and providers of national health service dental services specify both an annual contract value and the overall level of services, measured in terms of weighted courses of treatment (or units of dental activity), that are to be carried out over the course of a year. These annual requirements are at least 5 per cent. below the equivalent service levels carried out under the former general dental services arrangements. Where it appears from a mid-year review or subsequently that a provider is unlikely to carry out the agreed annual service level, the PCT may propose a variation to the contract value to reflect the level of services likely to be provided. In the event of disagreement, any proposed variation may be referred to the NHS Litigation Authority.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment she has made of the consequences for public health of entry into the UK of a person carrying a virulent influenza strain that is transmissible between humans; and what action the Government are taking to help prevent such an eventuality.

 It is important to be clear about the differences between seasonal influenza and pandemic influenza. Seasonal influenza refers to the illness which occurs each winter due to human influenza viruses which are circulating in the population. Pandemic influenza occurs infrequently, when a new influenza virus emerges which is markedly different from those recently circulating in the human population; causes disease in people; and spreads easily between people because they have little or no immunity to it. This could happen through an avian influenza virus, such as the H5N1 virus, mutating into a different strain with greater affinity for people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_497"><a name="70301w0020.htm_para0"><a name="0703022000254">It is also important to remember that it is very difficult to prevent a pandemic and it could emerge anywhere in the world including the United Kingdom. The UK is working closely with World Health Organisation and other international partners to prepare for, and respond to, a potential pandemic, including by containment of an emerging pandemic virus. The WHO has a stockpile of antiviral drugs, to which the UK has contributed, which will be sent to where a pandemic develops. If deployed rapidly, these drugs may help to contain an emerging pandemic virus or slow its national and international spread.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_498"><a name="70301w0020.htm_para1"><a name="0703022000255">Should a pandemic develop, the UK would follow the procedures outlined in the UK Influenza Pandemic Contingency Plan, which was published in October 2005 and is available on our website at www.dh.gov.uk/pandemicflu.
