The salmon stocks in the rivers Test, Itchen and Hampshire Avon were all below their CLs in 2009, and are classified as being 'At Risk' or 'Probably at Risk'.

1. Based on 2009-10 YouGov data, sample size 13,172.<br>
2. The statistics in the table need to be interpreted with caution. Due to data limitations, we are unable to say how many individuals were refused credit completely in the last six months. For instance, a borrower may have refused a credit card, but was able to secure an overdraft facility. In addition, the values in the table cannot be summed, to produce statistics on the proportion of the population refused credit. This is because some borrowers may have been rejected for more than one credit product. Certain credit products have been excluded such as payday loans and home credit, which are unlikely to be offered by banks and building societies.<br>

 We have estimated an average annual benefit of between £0.5 million and £2.5 million. The monetised benefits reflect spending on films which would not have occurred without the treaty being in place. The range reflects a lower case scenario where one film is made every two years with £1 million UK spend, and the upper case involves five films with £1 million spend made every two years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_558"><a name="101201w0002.htm_para17"><a name="10120173000237">In addition, research indicates that film locations can get up to a 30% boost in bookings from fans visiting locations from their favourite film (e.g. the Harry Potter films have helped boost tourism in the Northumberland area by 16%). As well as clear tourism potential, there are cultural benefits to the UK of greater film diversity. Given that the film industry largely comprises Single Purpose Vehicles it is difficult to predict in advance how many businesses will make use of the treaty. We do not believe it will be significantly higher than projections, particularly in the first few years.</p>

 EU legislation agreed by successive Governments does not provide any scope for the introduction of new zero rates or the extension of existing zero rates. There is therefore no realistic prospect of securing agreement to the introduction of a new zero rate for repairs to historic church buildings. However, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport operates a scheme which makes grants equivalent to the VAT incurred in making repairs to listed buildings primarily used for worship. The Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme will continue until 2014-15 with a fixed annual budget of £12 million.</p>

There are currently provisions in place that impose legal requirements to identify, assess and make provision for these pre-school needs, for example through the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice and the Early Years Foundation Stage statutory framework. We want to strengthen the system so that all children are ready to engage in learning when they start formal schooling. The Tickell review is considering how young children's early learning should best be supported and the forthcoming Green Paper on Special Educational Needs and Disability will consider how we can achieve better educational outcomes and life chances for children and young people with special educational needs from the early years through to transition to adult life and employment.</p>

1. Factory Support Grant was a small scale aspect of Workstep intended to help improve specialist disability employment services by providing funding for supported businesses to, for example, buy new machinery or modernise the services they offer.<br>
2. Current year figures are based on actual spend, as shown in the departmental general ledger, and forecasts which are subject to change.<br>
3. For the purposes of this answer, grants are interpreted to be one-off payments to individuals or other entities to support the objectives of the Department. Payments which are on-going in nature, for example subsidies to local authorities for housing benefit administration, or grants in aid to non-departmental public bodies have not been included.<br>
4. Funding for the Factory Support Grant, the Future Jobs Fund, and the Deprived Areas Fund have either already ended or will end this financial year.<br>
5. The Department is now working through the financial implications of its spending review settlement and details are not available on future funding amounts for particular grants at present.<br>

 Assumptions and calculations on the estimated value of Work Programme contracts and indeed other contracts which will be let from the framework, were developed from information on the value of existing welfare to work programmes. These took into account the intention to radically simplify the array of existing employment programmes and deliver coherent, integrated support more capable of dealing with complex and overlapping barriers to work. Estimates were broad in order to provide transparency to the market and to ensure that the framework would be able to meet requirements to be the principal vehicle for sourcing all employment related support services for the full life of the framework, not just for DWP, but also for other eligible contracting authorities. Calculations also took into account the need to deliver greater value for money on future welfare to work contracts.</p>

 The Government are committed to addressing the heavy toll of deaths in the construction industry which was highlighted in Baroness Donaghy's report. We will therefore progress those of the Donaghy recommendations accepted by the previous Administration which we consider are supported by the available evidence. For example, consistent with recommendation eight of the Donaghy report, the Government have actively supported the new specification for "pre-qualification" criteria in the construction industry, introduced by the British Standards Institution in October and which has the potential to radically simplify the pre-qualification process for small firms tendering for construction work. Where, however, we lack firm evidence for particular recommendations-for example, that directors' health and safety duties need to be further strengthened-we do not propose to take further action at this time.</p>

 Statutory adoption pay enables adopters to take a period of leave from work when a new child joins the family. It is paid by employers to employees who satisfy qualifying conditions based on length of employment and a minimum level of earnings. Casual employees may receive statutory adoption pay if they can satisfy the qualifying conditions.</p>

A parent may also be entitled to income support if they are taking leave from their employment under the parental leave provisions.</p>

The consultation closed on 5 May 2010. There were two proposals; firstly an Employers' Liability Tracing Office, that would manage a database of EL policies. Secondly, an Employers' Liability Insurance Bureau which would be a compensation fund of last resort for those individuals who are unable to trace EL insurance records, ensuring they are able to receive compensation for injuries or diseases sustained during the course of their employment.

 The transition fund is a significant fund that will provide much needed and immediate support for charities, voluntary groups and social enterprises to help them take on an even bigger role in this country in the medium to long term. Our key aim is to make this support available quickly, so that organisations can make the necessary changes to make the transition to a tighter funding environment and take advantage of the opportunities presented by the Big Society.

 Basophobia, a fear of falling, is one of a large number of specific phobias that generally respond well to cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) although it is important that physical health issues that might make someone more likely to fall, such as low blood pressure, are checked out before psychological treatment is started. CBT is now increasingly available on the national health service as a result of the Improving Access to Psychological Therapies programme which began in 2008 and is about half-way through its nationwide roll-out. The Chancellor announced further funding in the spending review to complete this roll-out by 2014-15. These local psychological therapies services, which are delivered in primary care, are ideal for patients with specific phobias like basophobia because of the ease with which therapists can link with the patient's general practitioner.</p>

 The primary purpose of the programme is risk assessment and risk management rather than diagnosis. However, the modelling undertaken by the Department indicates that, at full roll out, as well as preventing over 4,000 people a year developing diabetes, the programme will detect a significant amount of hitherto undiagnosed disease.</p>

Most PCTs have been inviting people individually and informing them of their entitlement to an NHS health check by letter of invitation. As they become more experienced in managing demand for the risk assessment element of the check and confident about their capacity to deliver the risk management, PCTs are increasingly running awareness campaigns.</p>

Spending on social care will therefore be a decision for the relevant local authority, and it is not possible to provide a central estimate.</p>

The Government want to make it easier for people to make healthy choices, but will clearly need to consider both the benefits and the costs of any new policy.</p>
