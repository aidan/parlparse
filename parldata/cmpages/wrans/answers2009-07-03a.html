<i> [holding answer 24 June 2009]: </i>Rural households connected to broadband speeds of at least 2Mbps can expect to benefit from improved access to public and government services offered online. They will also benefit from the opportunity to access a wider range of goods and services than before, some of which may not be available in the high street, and at potentially lower prices. Further, connection to 2Mbps broadband will help to reduce the risk to rural households of social exclusion.</p>

DIUS's Departmental Annual Report was originally due to be published on 12 June. Following the Machinery of Government changes on 5 June, and in consultation with HM Treasury, the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills decided to delay publication so that minor redrafting could be undertaken to reflect those changes.</p>

 The assets management and sales strand of HM Treasury's Operational Efficiency Programme (OEP) was established to ensure more efficient and commercial operation of assets held in the public sector. The Queen Elizabeth II Conference Centre (QEIICC) was one of nine government assets listed for further work in the pre-Budget report 2008 last November. The OEP final report published on 21 April stated:</p>
<a name="90703w0007.htm_brev1"><a name="09070375003787"><ul><p class="tabletext">&#147;Following the statement in the 2008 Pre-Budget Report, further work on the QEIICC has been undertaken. Although, in theory, the QEIICC could be disposed of now, this would be potentially at a significant discount to its underlying value. A more measured approach is required. The conclusions are, therefore, as a first step, to undertake a site development study within three to six months advised by a firm of property professionals. It will explore the opportunity of redeveloping the existing site, in a way that is sympathetic to planning considerations and current business operations. This could entail retaining the existing conference business for the foreseeable future. Marketing and disposal could take place at various stages depending on market evolution and prevailing risk and reward considerations, but at the latest by mid 2012.&#148;</p>

 Since the formation of the large, single-cap badge The Royal Regiment of Scotland, the separate identities of its antecedent regiments have been preserved in a number of ways, not least by including them prominently in the battalion titles, for example; The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland, and The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland. Preservation is further illustrated by the retention of golden threads in uniforms and accoutrements such as the Black Watch red hackle and the Highlanders' blue hackle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_101"><a name="90703w0008.htm_para7"><a name="09070375001957">The identities of the regiment's battalions are very clear and easily understood by its officers and soldiers and the wider community in Scotland. The regiment places great importance in its heritage and uses its history to inspire and nurture its new recruits and current members; the regimental history taught to its soldiers is captured in a handbook which is given to all new recruits. The Army ensures that regimental traditions, heritage, cultures and local connections continue through the excellent relations between its retired soldiers, the serving community, and the outstanding support from the local communities associated with their antecedent regiments.</p>

 We continue to work with other governments to identify ways to encourage companies involved in the trade of minerals from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) to follow appropriate practices, and to promote the lawful trade of natural resources. Since the Answer of 12 March 2009 to which the hon.

 In recent months, the UN peacekeeping mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) has enhanced its ability to protect civilians in the Kivus by reorganising its resources to a more mobile posture and through the creation of joint civilian and military protection teams. However, given the difficult terrain and mobility of rebel groups, MONUC is unlikely to be able to prevent all isolated attacks on civilians. But the additional troops that will arrive in coming months will further increase MONUC's capacity to implement its mandate.</p>

 HMRC has upgraded the National Insurance computer system as part of its continuing process of improvements to its customer service. The new PAYE service will introduce one single record for an individual's PAYE pay and tax details irrespective of the number of PAYE sources of income they have. This will result in more accurate tax codes and also enable HMRC to deal with the vast majority of customer enquiries at one point of contact.</p>

In particular it has not had any impact on claims for the state pension, which is administered by the Department of Work and Pensions.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 1 July 2009]:</i> HM Treasury works closely with the Cabinet Office on coordinating and monitoring delivery of key initiatives. The Government have recently set out its approach to improving public services in publications such as Excellence and Fairness: Achieving World Class Public Services; Working Together: Public Services on your side and Building Britain's Future.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_179"><a name="90703w0018.htm_para1"><a name="09070375003725">The approaches outlined support the Public Service Agreements which set out the Government's top priorities for improving public services and other outcomes. At the Comprehensive Spending Review 2007, the Government set out 30 cross-departmental PSAs covering areas such as better health and wellbeing, safer communities and educational standards. Progress on PSAs is reported to Parliament in the Departmental Annual Reports and the Autumn Performance Report. The Prime Minister's Delivery Unit within the Treasury works closely with other government departments to support improvements to public services through the delivery of cross-departmental PSAs.</p>

Cases in Payment are Caseload Totals. These show the number of people in receipt of an allowance, and exclude people with entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital. Latest available data are presented here. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>
Caseload Numbers are based on a 5 per cent. sample rated in line with the DWP Information Directorate: Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) total caseload, and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>
Estimated caseloads for 2008-09 are the average of caseloads at August and November 2008. Expenditure estimated using 5 per cent. data is adjusted by the ratio of total expenditure estimated on 5 per cent. data to outturn total expenditure. Estimated costs are subject to revision when February 2009 caseloads are available.<br>
From October 2008 the way in which a disabling condition is recorded on the live system changed. Disabling conditions are now recorded as primary and secondary, (previously recorded as disability care and mobility codes). For existing cases a mapping exercise was carried out which assigned disability care code to primary disabling condition and disability mobility code to secondary condition. IFD have updated the methodology used to derive main disabling condition to reflect this change in the live system.<br>
A diagnosed medical condition does not mean that someone is automatically entitled to disability living allowance. Entitlement is dependent on an assessment of how much help someone needs with personal care and/or mobility because of their disability. These statistics are only collected for administrative purposes<br>
