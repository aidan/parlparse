Last year the UK Government launched the international finance facility for immunisation, and announced plans for advanced market commitments to prompt the development of new medicines and vaccines for diseases affecting developing countries, including for paediatric formulations.

 The Hertfordshire coroner wrote to my officials on 8 November 2005 questioning the adequacy of his powers to conduct inquests which would effectively investigate the fatalities arising from the Potters Bar rail crash.

The Learning and Skills Act 2000 places a statutory duty on the LSC to promote equality of opportunity between persons of different racial groups, men and women, and between disabled and non-disabled.

 By 2010 we expect all schools to offer access to a core offer of extended services, with half of all primaries and a third of all secondaries doing so by 2008. The core offer includes 8 am-6 pm wraparound child care; a varied menu of study support activities such as sport and arts clubs; swift and easy referral to specialist health and social care services such as speech therapy; parenting support; and wider community use of school facilities. How this develops in each community will vary depending on the needs of that community. Some will have greater need for more child care, others will be able to rely on working with existing providers. A survey of 4,000 schools has shown that many are already delivering parts of this offer, with the vast majority already providing some activities or care before or after school. There has been enthusiasm from local authorities and schools to engage with the extended schools support programme, with over 5,000 schools joining this year.

 We are committed to safeguarding a wide range of adult learning opportunities in every area, including provision for learners over 50, and we will ensure that adult learning provision in Surrey Heath is provided through the funding from the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) to further education colleges, local authorities and other providers.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_49">Adult and Community Learning (now called Personal and Community Development Learning) is an important source of provision for older people. We are safeguarding funding for this provision for future years.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_50">For other forms of provision, the LSC has agreed clear funding priorities with the Government as public resources are necessarily finite. Our highest priorities are to support increased participation and achievement of 16&#150;18 year olds and to support adults without skills for life and full level 2 qualifications which are important for basic levels of employability. Many older people come within these latter priority categories and around a quarter of enrolments in LSC funded provision in Surrey are by people over the age of 50.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_51">Surrey County Council, our Adult and Community Learning provider in the county, has developed provision for older people in two communities with high levels of multiple deprivation, one of which is in Surrey Heath. Building on earlier work by the Pre-Retirement Association, the purpose of these was to develop a transferable and innovative curriculum of recreational learning to encourage older people to regard learning and skills acquisition as a positive and natural accompaniment to growing older. Amongst other things, this led to the formation of an &#039;older and bolder club1 for health activities and recreation. The University of the Third Age has a presence in Surrey Heath to encourage lifelong learning for older people not in employment and relevant courses are also delivered by the WEA (with funding from the LSC.)</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">To help shape future provision, the Surrey Lifelong Learning Partnership has run focus groups on our behalf, involving older learners, to identify provision of particular interest. Analysis of needs against provision on a geographic basis means that we can now identify where there is relatively high and low participation in learning for over 50s to provide a basis for review of future provision.</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Feb 2006 : Column 504W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_53">Our future provision in Surrey will also be influenced by our South East Region&#039;s annual statement of planning priorities in which we have a commitment to &quot;pilot curriculum opportunities for older workers to change their occupations or extend their careers&quot;. To this end, we are developing a project, with European funding support, to identify different ways of delivering learning to older people. This will include targeted information, advice and guidance and the development of courses specifically to meet the needs of older people seeking to extend their careers.</p>

<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_54">Looking further forward, demographic changes&#151;with fewer young people entering the labour market and an expectation of longer working life&#151;mean that, nationally, we will need to provide a broader programme of support for older people to keep their skills up to date.

 Acquisition of non-Ministry of Defence (MOD) land always carries additional costs (legal, professional fees etc) as well as requiring an outlay of capital. There might also be disposal costs to be taken into account if the acquisition led to existing MOD land becoming surplus. It is for this reason that before considering such an acquisition to meet a new requirement, we always first look at the suitability of land and property already owned by the Department. This is consistent with the wider Government policy on asset management. We also need to ensure that our estate is no larger than is required for defence purposes and that it is efficiently used. If a privately-owned site were to offer specific advantages (for instance in terms of location, features or potential value for money) then an exception might be made, but this would be considered on a case by case basis.

Consequently, the MOD has agreed with the company that the separate defence manufacturing approvals process will be removed from 1 April 2008, by which date the MOD will be in a position to open its research programme to full competition, potentially providing greater opportunities for the rest of industry to bid for work and increasing the options available to MOD customers. This change will not affect the level of protection available to customers who will exercise their rights through the wider provisions contained elsewhere in the compliance regime.

 In October, in the run-up to the 6th Ministerial meeting in Hong Kong, the EU made an offer on improved market access for agricultural products. Others, such as the US, did so too. An agreed feature of the market access negotiations is that all countries will be permitted to protect sensitive products, by applying less than the agreed reduction rates to the tariffs on these products. The EU suggested that up to 8 per cent. of a country&#039;s tariff lines on agricultural products should be deemed sensitive products. The US suggested 1 per cent., so there is a considerable divide here that, because the matter was not discussed or decided at Hong Kong, still needs bridging.

 No. the docking of dogs&#039; tails is allowed but only if performed by a vet.

The tail docking of cattle is prohibited except in an emergency by a vet.

 Based on the assumption that this question relates to UK rural development programmes which will be developed in light of the new Rural Development Regulation (EC Regulation No. 1698 of 2005) and come into force from 1 January 2007, the overall budget for rural development in Europe has been set at &#8364;69.75 billion for the period 2007&#150;13.

<a name="stpa_109">The agreement on the EU budget deal allows member states, including the UK, to begin the necessary preparatory work for the next round of rural development programmes to run from 2007. The allocation of EU rural development funds to member states has yet to be determined and will be subject to proposals currently being devised by the European Commission. The figure of &#8364;69.75 billion is similar to current rural development expenditure, although the focus of this expenditure in the new financial perspective will be upon the new member states.

Importantly, the agreed budget deal included a provision allowing member states, at their discretion, to transfer up to 20 per cent. of pillar 1 funds and make them available for expenditure on rural development measures. Decisions on the overall level of transfer needed will depend on the UK&#039;s share of EU funding for rural development, and on the overall size and content of the new rural development programmes to operate from 1 January 2007. In England, we hope to launch a public consultation on the next rural development programme in February 2006.

 Historically because the Race Relations Act 1976 did not apply to Northern Ireland it was understood that the provisions of the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000 did not apply. The Northern Ireland Office (NIO) and Executive have a parallel and similarly stringent mechanism through Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1993 which has race as an equality category. However the Department has agreed with the Commission for Racial Equality that the Northern Ireland Office will operate on the principle that section 71(1) of the Race Relations Act and amendment Order applies to all of the Northern Ireland Office functions both in Northern Ireland and Great Britain. It was further agreed that the Department&#039; s equality related statutory duties will be reviewed as part of a wider review of the NIO&#039;s equality scheme under section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998. The Commission for Racial Equality will review compliance when the reviewed equality scheme is completed.

 The Company Law Reform Bill is part of a wider programme of Government and market-led reform to support enterprise, encourage investment and promote long-term performance in order to ensure that Britain remains one of the best places in the world to set up and run a business.

<p>
<a name="60201w19.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_133">A key part of the Bill is the statutory statement of directors&#039; duties. This will provide greater clarity on what is expected of directors. It will also recognise in statute that business prosperity and responsible business behaviour are two sides of the same coin: directors are required to promote the success of the company in the collective best interests of shareholders, having regard to wider factors such as the interests of employees, the community and the environment. Re-stating this requirement will help directors to understand that they need to look beyond the short-term financial bottom line, but company law is not the right vehicle for addressing specific social, environmental or community issues.

 The Department has extensive contact with Ofgem, Energywatch and gas and electricity suppliers about a range of aspects of domestic gas and electricity supply, including erroneous transfers. DTI, Ofgem and Energywatch have been closely involved in the suppliers&#039; Customer Transfer Programme, which began in June 2003. This is a very substantial project that is designed to improve all aspects of the switching process, including reducing erroneous transfers. Such transfers have already fallen significantly. In 2005 there were around 110 complaints per month about erroneous transfers of gas supply. In the same period, gas transfers were running at an average of 300,000 per month. This compares with 150 complaints per month in 2004, and 290 per month in 2003. I expect complaints about erroneous transfers to decline still further once the Customer Transfer Programme is completed in March 2006.

 The Government have decided to widen their current consultation on company narrative reporting requirements. This will ensure that all points of view and relevant up-to-date evidence are taken into account while the current Company Law Reform Bill is going through Parliament.

<p>
<a name="60201w20.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_135">The Government took the decision in November 2005 to repeal the mandatory requirement on quoted companies to prepare an Operating and Financial Review (OFR) as contained in the OFR regulations so that they are required to prepare a Business Review instead. This decision was made in the light of the Government&#039;s strong commitment to sustainable development, strategic forward-looking narrative reporting and its policy of not imposing unnecessary burdens on UK companies, and taking into account the large body of evidence from previous consultations on narrative reporting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60201w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_136">Chapter 6 of Part 15 of the Company Law Reform Bill contains provisions relating to narrative reporting by companies. The Government are now inviting comments on any considerations which Ministers should take into account in deciding whether, and if so how, to frame amendments to these or other provisions of the Company Law Reform Bill to ensure effective forward looking narrative reporting by quoted companies, including, where appropriate, on social, community, employee and environmental matters. The consultation is therefore extended to invite views from all stakeholders on the full range of options for reporting, including matters previously contained within Schedule 7ZA of the Companies Act 1985 and within the Accounts Modernisation Directive (2003/51/EC), and any other matters relevant to narrative reporting.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60201w20.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_137">The Government will also consider in light of responses to this consultation whether existing business reporting requirements should be amended by regulations under secondary legislation as an interim measure before the new Bill comes into force. For the avoidance of doubt, however, no such changes would apply to financial reporting periods which had commenced before any new regulations had been passed. This is to ensure that companies have certainty as to their current legal reporting obligations and have adequate time to prepare for any changes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60201w20.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_138">The closing date for responses to this consultation is 24 March 2006.

 The &#163;350 million was based on analysis which estimated the overall costs, in 2002&#150;03 prices, at &#163;250 million of moving from existing provision. An additional &#163;100 million was added to allow for the reimbursement of authorities already offering free off-peak local bus travel (e.g. London, Merseytravel and Centro (the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive), inflation, and to act as a contingency for the uncertainty of the additional take-up.

<br>

<sup>(12)</sup> Additional pay costs were incurred during 2004&#150;05 because of the recruitment of a full team of office support staff.<br>

<sup>(13)</sup> Figures are for the operation of the Office for Contracted Prisons only: they do not include the costs of contracts or of controllers teams based in individual prisons.<br>

Note:<br>

Data cannot be provided for earlier years as the Office for Contracted Prisons was not created until April 2003. Before this date, the management of contracted prisons was the responsibility of individual Prison Service area managers: costs for the contracted prisons were included within individual Prison Service area budgets.<br>

 When probation trusts are established, most staff will transfer from probation boards to the new trusts on the same terms and conditions of employment.

Staff who do not wish to transfer will be free to terminate their contract of employment. The employment status of chief officers will change in the transition from boards to trusts: they will cease to be statutory office holders appointed by the Secretary of State and will instead be appointed and employed by the trust itself. If a chief is not appointed to the trust, he or she will be compensated accordingly.

<p><a name="st_241"><a name="60201w28.html_spnew8"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The National Offender Management Service has a target to reduce re-offending by 5 per cent. by 2008 and by 10 per cent. by the end of the decade. The restructuring proposals are part of a broader programme of change, including the introduction of end-to-end offender management and improvements in IT systems, which will help to contribute to the achievement of that target. The consultation paper does not seek to quantify the extent to which the restructuring proposals alone will reduce re-offending. But experience elsewhere suggests that the introduction of competition in the delivery of services helps to drive up performance. Examples from the custodial sector are given in the partial regulatory impact assessment which was published alongside the consultation paper.

 The indicative cost savings contained in the partial Regulatory Impact Statement assumed cost savings within the range of 3 per cent. to 8.5 per cent. through contesting certain activities of the national probation service. This range was based on the experience of the savings delivered through the market and performance testing programme within the Prison Service. The savings profile assumed a 10 year programme of contestability with no more that 12 per cent. by value of probation business being contested in any one year. The projected cash savings were discounted using a standard 25 year discounted cash flow analysis.

Notes:<br>

1. The figures are sourced from the Family Resources Survey.<br>

2. The latest estimates of the number of entitled non-recipients, range. unclaimed, and take-up relate to 2002&#150;03, and can be found in the DWP report entitled &quot;Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up in 2002&#150;2003&quot;. Copies of the publication are available in the Library.<br>

3. Estimates for 2003&#150;04 will be published in early 2006.<br>

4. Estimates are presented as ranges within which it can be assumed the true number lies. These ranges account for possible biases inherent in estimates from data that is less than perfect.<br>

5. Comparing estimates over time is not straightforward. Our estimates allow for biases, which can change from year to year; but we cannot be sure of the extent or effects of changes. Therefore, any analysis of changes over time should be made with caution.<br>
