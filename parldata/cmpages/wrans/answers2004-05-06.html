 The Food Standards Agency (FSA) review of the Over-30-Month rule was completed in July 2003 and recommended that it would be acceptable on public health grounds to replace the rule with BSE testing of cattle in two stages. Cattle born after August 1996 could be allowed into the food chain, after being tested for BSE, with the possibility of complete replacement of the rule from July 2005. Health Ministers are still considering the FSA advice, but it has already been decided that, for practical reasons, cattle born before August 1996 will be permanently excluded from the food chain. We are now unlikely to see any changes to the OTMS before January 2005, due to the legislative process that must take place once a decision has been reached by Ministers.

 Government are committed to the key principles for setting the total level of allowances to UK installations as set out in the draft National Allocation Plan (NAP) in January. The key principle of the UK allocation methodology is that the total level of allowances for the first phase will be less than the projected emissions of the UK installations covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. This reduction will be set on the basis that these installations would deliver a further 5.5&nbsp;million tonnes CO <sub>2</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; savings by 2010.

<p><a name="40506w02.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The energy projections used for calculating carbon dioxide emissions are driven by a number of key assumptions, which relate to economic growth, fossil fuel prices and population and industrial output. These assumptions incorporate the projected savings from the UK Climate Change Programme.

<p><a name="40506w02.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The UK Climate Change Programme, published in November 2000, seeks to reduce emissions from all sectors of the economy. The Programme was intended to be flexible and cost effective and did not set targets for individual sectors.

<a name="40506w02.html_para10">
UK carbon dioxide emissions were around 165&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon (MtC) in 1990. Reducing emissions by 20&nbsp;per cent. will correspond to a reduction of around 33 MtC by 2010.

<p>
<a name="40506w02.html_para11">
Policies in the Climate Change Programme to reduce emissions from transport include the EU voluntary agreements on carbon dioxide emissions from cars, backed up by changes to company car taxation and vehicle excise duty; the 10 year plan for transport and; sustainable distribution in Scotland and Wales. At the time the Programme was published, it was estimated that these policies could reduce transport emissions by a total of 5.7 MtC below the projected business as usual emissions for 2010 which would have reduced the projected increase in emissions from transport to around 2.5&nbsp;per cent. above 1990 levels by 2010.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w02.html_para12">
The Government are committed to reviewing the Climate Change Programme later this year, including the measures introduced to reduce transport emissions. The implications of the rolled forward strategy for transport, which the Government expects to publish in the summer after the conclusion of the spending review, will also feed into this review. The Department for Transport is currently consulting stakeholders on the UK&#039;s targets for the use of transport biofuels under the Biofuels Directive. Achieving 5&nbsp;per cent. use of biofuels today would save around &#163;1&nbsp;million tonnes of carbon per annum&#151;around three per cent. of overall road transport carbon dioxide emissions. To date indications are that the transport sector is not currently on course to deliver the level of carbon savings estimated in the UK Climate Change Programme.

<p><a name="40506w04.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The soil and climatic conditions in the countries that have banned ammonium nitrate (AN) fertilisers&#151;China, Colombia, Algeria and the Philippines&#151;are very different from those experienced in the UK. One of the principal alternative fertilisers used in these countries is urea. Urea-based fertilisers give rise to greater ammonia emissions than AN. A switch to urea could, therefore, put at risk the UK&#039;s ability to meet internationally-agreed ammonia reduction targets. Crops cannot use urea directly. It must first be converted to ammonium and to nitrate nitrogen in the soil before being taken up by plants. As a result, urea can, in cold conditions, be slower acting than AN. The loss of ammonia from urea can also reduce crop yields, thus adding to the cost of crop production. As mentioned in my previous answer, we have an ongoing dialogue with industry to compare how well other nitrogen fertilisers perform in our soil and climatic conditions and their potential environmental impacts.

<p><a name="40506w04.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The recently published Foresight Report on flood and coastal defence will provide guidance for policy development in relation to managing increasing flood risk in the longer term, including the impact of climate change. I held briefing for hon. Members on the 22&nbsp;April for this purpose. I will also be meeting the All Party Parliamentary Flood Prevention Group on 26&nbsp;May.

<p>
<a name="40506w04.html_para11">
Since the 1980s the Department has provided guidance to operating authorities to make allowance for climate change in the planning and appraisal of new and replacement flood and coastal defence works. This guidance has been regularly reviewed in the light of the latest research findings and supplementary guidance was most recently issued in 2003. The aim is to take a suitably precautionary approach whilst not diverting funds unnecessarily from the solution of problems that affect people today. The approach and guidance will be further reviewed for the new Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management which is expected to be completed by early next year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what evaluation she has made of experiments to use oceans to absorb more carbon dioxide by spraying them with iron filings and the impact this will have on global warming.  [169239]</p>








<p><a name="40506w05.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Experimental studies of iron fertilisation have so far been carried out on a relatively small scale, and computer models are needed to estimate the consequences of large scale fertilisation. Modelling studies of iron fertilisation are currently performed as part of Defra&#039;s Climate Prediction Programme at the Hadley Centre.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w05.html_para1">
Iron fertilisation encourages extra growth of phytoplankton, which increases the uptake of carbon dioxide from the water and subsequently the atmosphere. Preliminary studies have indicated that even wide spread and continuous iron fertilisation would reduce levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide by only a small fraction, making it unlikely that there would be a significant impact on global warming. In addition, the consequences of such fertilisation on marine ecosystems could be severe.

<p><a name="40506w05.html_spnew6"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The Government regularly reviews progress with the Voluntary Initiative on pesticides and reports its broad conclusions in the Budget and Pre-Budget Report. In Budget 2004 the Government confirmed the view that the Initiative will achieve the most effective way of reducing the environmental impacts of pesticide use provided it is fully implemented. However, to cover the potential case that the Initiative might fail to deliver the required environmental benefits within a reasonable time scale, the Government continues to keep the options for a tax or economic instrument under review. This remains the Government&#039;s position.

 Flood defence works funded by the taxpayer are supported on the basis of a full analysis of economic, environmental and social considerations and a full appraisal of benefits and costs. Doing nothing, maintaining the current line of defence and managed realignment are among the strategic options that Defra&#039;s guidance indicates should be considered before establishing a preferred flood management policy for any particular length of defence.

The Environment Agency (EA), with Defra&#039;s backing, is now promoting a comprehensive series of Essex estuary strategies that will provide a better understanding of how future flood risk can be reduced in the face of pressures such as sea level rise. The

strategies are being developed over a number of years. The Roach and Crouch Estuary Flood Management Strategy should be launched later this summer, while Blackwater and Colne Estuary Flood Management Strategy is due to go to public consultation later this year. A strategic study on the Stour and Orwell tidal estuaries has just been started.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w06.html_para3">
Where there is insufficient justification for the continued maintenance of an uneconomic sea wall, the EA will pursue a process to withdraw from publicly funded maintenance, as soon as possible. To ensure that the EA act in a reasonable way, they must pay due regard to my Department&#039;s policy guidance, and the Human Rights Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w06.html_para4">
The EA estimates that the overall cost of maintaining sea walls in the area covered by the Essex Local Flood Defence Committee in 2004&#150;05 is &#163;1.266&nbsp;million. Approximately 24&nbsp;per cent. of this is for maintenance works in the Maldon and East Chelmsford constituency.

The EA&#039;s assessment of the state of repair of the sea walls in Maldon and East Chelmsford is limited to the Dengie Peninsula from Bradwell to Burnham. Data for the estuary sea walls has not yet been collected. However, visual inspections of these walls are undertaken on a regular basis and areas requiring repair are included in the annual maintenance programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w06.html_para6">
The EA will, over the coming years, be categorising its defences into the four categories to which the hon. Member refers in line with the Shoreline Management Plan, and the Estuary Strategies when these are complete. Although the primary responsibility for the maintenance of both sea defences and land drainage watercourses rests with the riparian landowner, the EA has permissive powers to maintain sea defences and has taken responsibility for the majority of them. Local authorities have similar permissive powers and maintain sea defences as part of their coast protection activities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w06.html_para7">
To maintain sea walls landowners need the formal consent of the EA, in accordance with the Environment Agency Land Drainage and Sea Defence Byelaws, made under Schedule 25 (5) of the Water Resources Act 1991. Local authority consent may also be required depending on the nature and extent of the maintenance work to be carried out. Other consents such as assent from English Nature under the Wildlife and Countryside Act may also be necessary. Individuals should contact the EA in the first instance to establish what consents might be needed. Consent or permission from the owner of the sea wall will be required, where the person wishing to carry out maintenance is not already the owner of the specific sea wall to be maintained.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w06.html_para8">
Where there is no legal requirement to provide flood defence there is similarly no provision for compensation to offset the disadvantage suffered by any landowners that may be flooded as a result of a change in flood management practices. However, if a landowner were refused consent to maintain their own defence on the grounds that allowing them to protect their land would be contrary to the public interest, for example for nature conservation reasons, a case for compensation might arise. There is no general provision for compensation to landowners in cases where an operating authority stops

The last of 4 public consultations on the ELV Directive closed on 30&nbsp;March. The Consultation Document set out the Government&#039;s proposals for a system, drawn up after extensive discussions with the industry sectors involved, to meet the &quot;free take-back&quot; and recycling requirements of the Directive. 65 responses to the consultation were received. These are now being assessed with a view to finalising the Regulations before presentation to Parliament.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which water companies have been found to have been providing water not fit for human consumption in each year since 1997; and what action was taken against them.  [168876]</p>








<p><a name="40506w07.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 It is an offence under section 70 of the Water Industry Act 1991 for a water company to supply water unfit for human consumption, subject to a due diligence defence. The meaning of water &quot;unfit for human consumption&quot; is not defined in the Act and is a matter for the courts to decide on a case-by-case basis. It is usually taken to mean that the water has caused ill health or is rejected for drinking by consumers on the grounds of taste, smell or appearance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w07.html_para4">
All incidents affecting drinking water quality are investigated by the Drinking Water Inspectorate and proceedings are instituted as appropriate. Since 1997 10&nbsp;companies have been prosecuted for supplying water unfit for human consumption in respect of 29 separate incidents, with six further incidents taken into consideration. Eight companies have also been cautioned in respect of 16 incidents.

<p><a name="40506w07.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Water companies in England and Wales have a duty to supply wholesome water. The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2000, or in Wales the Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 2001 set out the numbers and types of samples that water companies must take to fulfil this duty. One of the roles of the Drinking Water Inspectorate is to ensure that water companies carry out the requisite checks. During 2002 more than 2,973,500 regulatory tests were carried out, of which 99.87&nbsp;per cent. demonstrated compliance with the relevant water quality standards. The Drinking Water Inspectorate investigates all incidents affecting water quality which includes an assessment of additional samples taken to determine water quality.

 The junction at Sadlers Farm between the A13 and the A130 (neither of which is a trunk road at that point) is in the form of a ring roundabout.

It is up to Essex county council to submit, through the Local Transport Plan process, details of a new design which has been appraised in accordance with Government guidelines and which will deal with forecast levels of traffic.

 Both the British Transport Police (BTP) and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) continue to be involved in the investigation. On 18&nbsp;March 2004 the lead role in the joint investigation transferred from the BTP to the HSE because of HSE&#039;s expertise in the areas in which the investigation is now concentrating. However because the investigation has not yet concluded, the prosecuting authorities have not yet come to a decision on prosecutions.

<p><a name="40506w09.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Darling: </b> 
 No major rail projects have been cancelled or re-scoped since the publication of the Strategic Rail Authority&#039;s Strategic Plan 2003 because they are without a sound business case. Some changes have been made to the West Coast Route Modernisation Scheme and to the scheme to upgrade the power supplies in the south-east.

<p><a name="40506w12.html_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 I am aware of the problems being experienced by those in the voluntary and community sector, as a result of the volatility in the insurance market since 11&nbsp;September 2001. It is deeply worrying that small groups of volunteers who are making a real contribution to their communities are being faced with such difficulty.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w12.html_para0">
The Active Community Unit in my Department set up the &quot;Insurance Cover Working Group (ICWG)&quot; to look into the situation and advise on practical solutions. A study was undertaken into the current position regarding the provision of insurance for the voluntary and community sector, including public indemnity liability, which made suggestions as to possible solutions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w12.html_para1">
A response to these possible solutions will be made in May following close working with other Government Departments, as a number of initiatives are already being taken forward by the Government to understand better and tackle the difficulties being experienced. In that context, the Government welcomes the current study being undertaken by the Better Regulation Task Force on litigation and compensation. This work will contribute to the analysis of pressures in this area, as other studies have already, for example; The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) undertook a review of the operation of Employers&#039; Liability Compulsory Insurance (ELCI), and published a first stage report on 3&nbsp;June 2003, and the second stage and final report on 4&nbsp;December 2003. Following that 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 May 2004 : Column 1692W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
initiative the DWP is at present holding a review of the requirement for Employers&#039; Liability Compulsory Insurance for Limited Companies that employ only their owner. Also, the Office of Fair Trading conducted a fact-finding study into the UK Liability Insurance reporting in June 2003, and the Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA), is working to ensure that legal costs are proportionate and that meritorious claims are resolved quickly and at minimum cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w12.html_para2">
I am very much aware that the increasing costs for the provision of liability insurance have impacted on the ability of voluntary and community groups to deliver services and community events. Therefore the outcomes of the work across Government will have important implications for the Voluntary and Community Section (VCS) as practical solutions are being sought in partnership with the voluntary and community sector, the insurance industry, local authorities and government departments.

 The introduction of identity cards will make it much easier and simpler for people to prove their identity when they wish to do so.

The draft Bill does allow for Regulations to be made for identity checks, including production of a card, to access public services. Regulations for each service would need to be approved by Parliament. Before regulations are laid, the Government must explain why its existing powers in relation to a particular service are not sufficient (Clause 17(4)) and steps must be taken to ensure that members of the public are informed and consulted about the proposal. Clause 17(5) requires there to be consultation with interested parties if there is an equivalent requirement in other legislation to consult these interested parties.

Until it became compulsory to register, the ID card could not be the only way of proving identity to access social security benefits or free public services.

 I have arranged for a copy of a table entitled &#039;Africa&#151;Operational Projects/Programmes to combat HIV/AIDS&#039; to be placed in the Library of the House. This identifies all those programmes or projects currently funded by the Department for International Development, which have a policy objective of &quot;combating HIV/AIDS &quot;. The total commitment is more than &#163;1 billion. This figure includes expenditure already incurred against these ongoing activities as well as some future planned spending.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what plans he has to increase expenditure levels for projects in Africa to combat the spread of AIDS over the next three years.  [170597]</p>








<p><a name="40506w15.html_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 In December 2003, the UK Government&#039;s Call for Action on HIV/AIDS announced that DFID will make HIV/AIDS a priority for the additional funds that the UK will be devoting to Africa by 2006. Many of those African countries worst affected by HIV/AIDS are among the DFID&#039;s bilateral country partners, (over 80&nbsp;per cent. of AIDS&#039; deaths occur in DFID&#039;s 16 African partner countries). The new UK Strategy on HIV/AIDS, to be published this summer, will cover the level of the UK&#039;s future resource commitments for HIV/AIDS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w15.html_para3">
Several DFID African bilateral country programmes have recently stepped up expenditure in support of programmes to help combat HIV/AIDS; for example: a &#163;25&nbsp;million project for strengthening Nigeria&#039;s capacity to respond effectively to HIV/AIDS, and in Tanzania, DFID is working with the Tanzanian Government to set 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>6 May 2004 : Column 1706W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
up an HIV/AIDS Fund of around &#163;15&nbsp;million per year over the next three years. In Malawi a programme is being designed that focuses on actions to help address the impact of HIV/AIDS on human resources in health and other sectors.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w15.html_para4">
However, scaling-up the HIV/AIDS response will not only require additional expenditure for HIV/AIDS-specific programmes. The socio-economic impact of HIV/AIDS and the vulnerability of the poor people in developing countries to HIV/AIDS mean that DFID&#039;s overall development effort around support for country owned Poverty Reduction Strategies remain of central importance. DFID&#039;s continuing work in the area of capacity building, education, public and financial sector reform and strengthening of civil society will all contribute to combating HIV/AIDS.

<a name="40506w15.html_para5">
DFID will make HIV/AIDS and Africa a centrepiece of the UK&#039;s Presidencies of the G8 and the EU in 2005. This creates an opportunity to work with the international community to increase the global HIV/AIDS response in Africa. If DFID is to succeed with our efforts we shall need to focus on four challenges that are seen as key to unlocking faster progress: Stronger political direction, better funding, better donor co-ordination and better HIV/AIDS programmes.

<p><a name="40506w16.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID was closely involved in the preparations for the Second World Assembly on Ageing, held in Madrid in 2002. For example DFID supported the UN secretariat for the Assembly and also provided funding for the African Union&#039;s leadership and for the non-governmental organisation HelpAge International (HAI) to participate in the policy development process. DFID&#039;s support helped to ensure that poverty reduction and other development issues were fully reflected in the International Plan of Action, so that it provides a good basis for further action by the international community.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w16.html_para0">
The eradication of poverty is a fundamental aim of the International Plan of Action. DFID&#039;s aim is also the elimination of poverty in poorer countries. Older people are often among the poorest. The problems faced by many older people are therefore included in the policy

analyses currently being carried out by DFID on chronic poverty and on social exclusion. DFID is also funding research at the Centre for Chronic Poverty and Development Policy at Manchester, in partnership with HelpAge International, into elderly people living in poverty. Other recently completed research projects looked at the migration of older people from South Asia and at non-contributory pensions and poverty prevention.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w16.html_para1">
The Action Plan advocates the active participation of older people in society and development. DFID&#039;s approach recognises the human rights of poor people, including older people and seeks to ensure that they are consulted on policies and decisions that affect them. DFID encourages their participation in research and in the development of policies that affect them. This increases understanding of how they perceive their rights and of the obstacles they face in obtaining their entitlements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w16.html_para2">
DFID has had a strategic Programme Partnership Agreement with HelpAge International (HAI) since 2002. The purpose is to influence the development of policies and practices that promote rights and opportunities for older people and to maximise their contribution to society. DFID has provided funding of &#163;2.46&nbsp;million under this Agreement over the financial years 2002&#150;03 to 2004&#150;05. Funding for future years has still to be negotiated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w16.html_para3">
HAI&#039;s work includes support for setting up effective groups of older citizens in developing countries. This includes strengthening them to monitor how their governments carry out their commitments to reduce the poverty of older people, including the Madrid International Plan of Action on Ageing. This project also encourages dialogue between governments, civil society and older people to ensure that effective policies and programmes are developed to reduce poverty among older people. A major objective of HAI is to raise awareness of the impact of HIV/AIDS on older people. They also support work to inform older people of their rights&#151;for example a programme in South Africa to train older people to give affordable legal advice at village level on issues such as widowhood and inheritance.

In India for example, the UK Government are providing funds to the Indian Government to help children from four of the poorest states attend and complete a full cycle of basic schooling. In Kenya, the Government recently stopped school fees at primary school.

<i>[holding answer 4&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> HMS Trafalgar would not have returned to sea if she had not been seaworthy. Our nuclear submarines have been operating for over 40 years and have a safety record that is second to none. Before any submarine goes to sea, particularly as with HMS Trafalgar, after a period of maintenance and defect repair, it undergoes a rigorous series of safety checks and a number of authorities are involved in that process.

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">a leak into the submarine, resulting from faulty equipment not related to recent maintenance, during pressurisation of the Freon domestic refrigerant gas system; and concerns related to faults to the paint finish of the escape hatch docking seat which had been inspected and judged to be minor and insufficient to prevent successful docking of a rescue submersible if that extremely unlikely event should prove necessary.</p>

<p>
<a name="40506w17.html_para2">
Following these individual expressions of concern, made through the appropriate channels, and the levels of stress shown by 11 of these individuals, the Commanding Officer quite properly decided to remove these sailors from the submarine for medical assessment. In doing so, he acted in the best interests of those individuals and the Service. The twelfth member of the crew who discussed his concerns with the Commanding Officer elected to remain on board and sailed with Trafalgar.

 Radiation exposure is kept as low as reasonably practicable and within the dose limits recommended by the International Commission on Radiation Protection (ICRP) and specified in the United Kingdom legislation.

Those workers most exposed to ionising radiation, known as classified persons, have their exposure assessed using radiation dosimeters issued by an Approved Dosimetry Service and entered into their radiation dose record. The Ministry of Defence contributes its data on classified persons to the National Registry of Radiation Workers (NRRW) managed by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). The NRRW data are used in epidemiological studies. In an analysis of the data, published in July 1999, the NRPB concluded that overall death rates among radiation workers are below those in the general population. The analysis contained 124,743 workers, of which about one third were Ministry of Defence radiation workers or former radiation workers.

<p><a name="40506w19.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 I am totally committed to a robust approach to tackling fraud and error and abuse of the social security system wherever it occurs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w19.html_para3">
The Social Security Agency is unable to measure the amount of fraud across all benefits on an annual basis. However, a programme of Benefit Reviews is carried out on a regular basis across all of the major Social Security benefits. During the 2003&#150;04 year the following levels were estimated:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Income support, 1.6&nbsp;per cent. (&#163;7.625&nbsp;million) of benefit expenditure;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<ul>

<p class "tabletext">Housing benefit, 2.2&nbsp;per cent. (&#163;6.967&nbsp;million) of benefit expenditure.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w19.html_para4">
During 2002&#150;03, a Benefit Review was carried out in Incapacity Benefit. A total of 591 cases were examined of which only 2 (0.3&nbsp;per cent.) were found to be fraudulent. Based on this small number of fraudulent cases, it is anticipated that this equates to &#163;0.94&nbsp;million of benefit expenditure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w19.html_para5">
The Social Security Agency has a comprehensive and rigorous strategy for combating fraud designed to ensure that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">claims entering the system are legitimate;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">once in the system claims are maintained properly; and</p>

</p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w19.html_para6">
In the period from April 2003 to March 2004, 7,761 cases of suspected fraud were investigated. Of these cases, 3,944 (51&nbsp;per cent.) resulted in withdrawal of claims or changes in the rate of benefit paid and 345 were referred for prosecution. In the same period there were 101 cases where administrative penalties were imposed and 54 cases where cautions were issued.

 I am taking forward a number of measures to address the pay gap nationally.

Full copies of the statement and the explanatory note are available at: http://www.dti.gov.uk/nuclearcleanup/wn.htm
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w22.html_para1">
The Review was a joint process between HMG, the company and their respective advisers. Mike Parker, the CEO at BNFL, led the BNFL team and was advised by N. M. Rothschild and Freshfields; the Government side was led by the DTI, and advised by HSBC, Deloitte and Touche and Herbert Smith.

The joint review of BNFL was necessary to determine the future structure and broad strategic direction of the company before the NDA came into being.

 The Department has discussed, and will continue to discuss as appropriate, disconnections issues with Ofgem. With DTIs encouragement, Ofgem has been in discussion with gas and electricity suppliers about the arrangements governing disconnections, particularly for vulnerable customers. Last month, Ofgem issued an industry consultation paper that set out proposed revisions to, and clarification of, those arrangements.

<p><a name="40506w22.html_spnew7"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 We saw evidence this winter that the Government&#039;s market-based approach to delivering secure energy supplies is working well. Generators brought mothballed plant back into service in response to rising electricity prices, and signals from NGT that they would like greater capacity going into the winter. The plant margin for winter 2003&#150;04 rose from a projected level of 16.5&nbsp;per cent. in July to 21.6&nbsp;per cent. (January 2004 updated to National Grid Seven Year Statement), and electricity supply was sufficient to meet demand throughout the winter. The gas market also worked effectively, and there was sufficient supply to meet market demand throughout the winter.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w22.html_para3">
In June, Ofgem are due to publish their next report into the performance of the electricity and gas industries in delivering security, covering the winter period.

<p><a name="40506w22.html_spnew8"><b> Nigel Griffiths: </b> 
 The DTI is aware of the economic importance of a domestic source of fluorspar and the value of the industry to the economies of the north-west, Derbyshire and the south-west.

I fully appreciate that this will be disappointing to some but continuing the second delivery with its high costs makes no sense.

This is a huge undertaking for the company. Single delivery has now been introduced in 1,100 out of 1,450 delivery offices. The process takes six to eight weeks to bed in, as postmen and women get used to new and longer delivery routes. I understand that for the most part the change has gone reasonably smoothly and is now working well. There have been some problems and Royal Mail has apologised for the fall in service. I have Allan Leighton&#039;s personal assurance that the problems customers are experiencing in certain areas while the single delivery is being introduced are being vigorously tackled and solutions being found.

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The working tax credit where working parents can receive help with up to 70&nbsp;per cent. of the costs of child care, subject to limits of &#163;200 a week, or &#163;135 a week for one child.

<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Childcare Grant pays full time HE students with dependent children up to 85&nbsp;per cent. of actual child care costs up to the same limits as for the WTC;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The national health service provided over &#163;70&nbsp;million since April 2001 for child care for NHS staff, with a significant amount of that being capital costs for building nurseries or direct subsidies to parents to help with child care costs.</p>

 The only publicly funded institution providing higher education in Stalybridge and Hyde is Tameside college. The amounts of public funding spent in the years in which figures are available are shown in the following table. Expenditure was by the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and by the Student Loans Company (SLC). The latter relates only to spending on tuition fees, student loans (cash cost) and the dependants grant. Data prior to 1999&#150;2000 are not available. The figures for student support do not include spending on other additional grants, namely, disabled students allowance, care leavers grant and travel grant. These were paid through local education authorities, up to 2003&#150;04, and the figures are not held centrally.

Like other areas, since 1997 Cambridgeshire has benefited from the initiatives that the Government has put in place to recruit and retain teachers and to increase the number of staff supporting them in schools.

Over the same period, the number of full-time equivalent school support staff in the area has grown by 1,080 from 2,470 to 3,550 in 2003.

Data prior to 1999/2000 are not available. The figures do not include any spending on other additional grants, namely Disabled Students Allowances, Care Leavers Grant and Travel Grant. These were paid through local education authorities, up to 2003/04, and figures are not held centrally.

In addition, as part of the London Challenge, there is a specific scheme in London to retain school teachers who have the potential to be future leaders of the education service in London. This was developed in the light of evidence that, although London is very attractive to young school teachers, many leave London when they want to settle down and start a family. This is just the moment when they are beginning to take on crucial middle leadership roles in schools. The London Challenge Key Teacher Homebuy Scheme therefore offers school teachers in London equity loans of up to &#163;100,000 to enable them to afford family homes.

<p><a name="40506w34.html_spnew0"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 This is an important and valuable report. We have every intention of remaining one of the most popular destinations for overseas students. That is why we launched the Prime Minister&#039;s Initiative in 1999 to recruit an additional 50,000 international higher education students by 2005. UK Higher Education institutions have already exceeded that target by recruiting an additional 64,635 international students. We remain confident that overseas students will continue to choose to come here to take advantage of the high quality higher education which is on offer.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills (1) what assessment has been made of the need for children with severe speech difficulties to have access to specialist speech and language support within mainstream schools;  [169942]

</p>



<p>(2) what guidelines exist for the minimum level of specialist speech and language teaching support to be provided by each local education authority.  [169943]</p>








<p><a name="40506w35.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Speech and language needs and the necessary the collaboration between education and health to meet those needs were considered in a research report published in November 2000, &quot;Provision for children with speech and language needs in England and Wales: facilitating communication between education and heath services&quot; (Department for Education and Employment Research Report RR239). This was published alongside the report of the Working Group on Speech and Language Therapy Services to Children with Special Educational Needs (England).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w35.html_para0">
Local education authorities, maintained schools, early years settings and others have to have regard to the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice published in November 2001. This gives practical advice on carrying out their statutory duties to identify, assess and make suitable provision for children with SEN. The Code includes a section on speech and language therapy support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w35.html_para1">
No guidance has been issued in relation to the minimum level of specialist speech and language teaching support, since provision should reflect the assessed needs of individual children, some of whom may have severe or complex needs or multiple disabilities. The DfES and Department of Health have however established an Action Forum to improve provision for children with speech, language and communication needs in mainstream schools or other settings. This group brings together key interests with a view to identifying and promoting good practice.

<p><a name="40506w35.html_spnew2"><b> Alan Johnson  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 21&nbsp;April 2004]:</i> Information on the additional income from fees in different scenarios is contained in the Regulatory Impact Assessment published on 8&nbsp;January alongside the HE Bill. Because of the nature of a variable scheme, the additional net income from fees will vary not only according to the number of students an institution recruits, but also depending on decisions the higher education institutions themselves take on the level of fee and the cost of any measures, such as bursaries for students from lower income backgrounds, that they put in place to safeguard access. Figures for extra fee income cannot therefore be estimated precisely. Copies of the Regulatory Impact Assessment were placed in the Library of the House; it is also available on the Department for Education and Skills website.

<p><a name="40506w36.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 Although difficulties persist in some individual schools and areas, the overall teacher supply position is continuing to improve. Recruitment to courses of initial teacher training in England fell for eight years in a row from 1992/93, but has risen for four successive years since the introduction of training bursaries and Golden Hellos in September 2000. This is having an impact on the numbers of teachers in schools. National Statistics published by my Department on 29&nbsp;April showed that there were 427,800 full-time equivalent regular teachers working in maintained schools in England in January 2004. That is 28,600 more than in 1997 and more than at any time since 1981. The teacher vacancy rate is now 0.7&nbsp;per cent., down from 0.9&nbsp;per cent. the previous year. There were 2,670 full-time teacher vacancies in January 2004, compared to 3,410 in January 2003.

From the start of the 2004&#150;05 academic year, higher education institutions will be eligible for funding from the HE funding councils in respect of students from the accession countries, on the same basis as other EU students and home students.

Schedule 17 of the Bill amends state pensions legislation. These amendments would extend those state pension benefits that are equally available to husbands and wives to civil partners when the Bill comes into force.

The Civil Partnership Bill contains a pensions enabling power (Clause 187) which would allow my Department to amend the contracting out rules in relation to survivor pensions. The intention is to use this power to require:

<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The Jobcentre Plus Provider Liaison Group&#039;s membership includes representatives from several of our largest work-based private sector providers, together with providers in the voluntary and community sector, smaller private providers and Further Education establishments. In addition, membership includes the Association of Learning Providers (ALP), a trade body for the work-based sector who represent approximately 30&nbsp;per cent. of Jobcentre Plus providers. The Group is supported by a small secretariat from Jobcentre Plus. Full membership of the Group is set out in Annex 1.</p>

</p>
<ul>

<p class "tabletext">The purpose of the Group is to provide a forum in which providers are consulted on changes to policy and operational processes. In practice this gives them the opportunity to comment upon policies from their perspective as organisations that deliver these policies. The Group enables Jobcentre Plus to obtain the views of providers from a wide background and should help ensure that our business can be delivered more effectively and efficiently.</p>

Notes:<br>

1.&nbsp;Figures are for Great Britain in 2004&#150;05 price terms, rounded to the nearest &#163;100&nbsp;million. It is assumed the change comes into effect from April 2005 and basic state pension is up-rated in line with earnings thereafter. It is assumed that part (a) would not apply to those overseas, and so for consistency, part (b) also does not include any changes to the state pensions of those who are overseas.<br>

2.&nbsp;Gross costs are estimated by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department and are consistent with Budget 2004 assumptions and use 2002-based population projections.<br>

3.&nbsp;For part (a) it is assumed that for those over 80 the basic state pension has been increased to the guarantee credit rate, any additional pension is then added to the full basic state pension.<br>

4.&nbsp;In addition, no allowances are made for couples, and individuals aged over 80 have been assumed to receive basic state pension at the single rate of the guarantee credit, including those previously receiving no basic state pension through their own contributions.<br>

5.&nbsp;For part (b) for those over 80, the maximum rate of category A basic state pension is raised to the level of the guarantee credit and those receiving less than the maximum category A basic state pension and other categories of basic state pension will receive an increased pension according to the rules of the current system.<br>

6.&nbsp;Income related benefit offsets are calculated using the DWP policy simulation model and April 2004 benefit rates. It is assumed that the savings credit is left unchanged from the existing system and the current rules apply. Consistent with previous answers it is assumed that the offset for the first year will remain constant for subsequent years.<br>

7.&nbsp;Additional income tax revenue is estimated by the Inland Revenue using 2004 tax rates. The income tax estimates for 2004&#150;05 to 2006&#150;07 are based on the 2001&#150;02 Survey of Personal Incomes and are projected in line with March 2004 Budget assumptions. For illustrative purposes, it is assumed income tax revenue will be a fixed percentage of the gross cost for this option in 2007&#150;08 and 2008&#150;09.<br>

<p><a name="40506w44.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Services to identify, treat and offer preventative advice are available on the National Health Service. The Government&#039;s response to osteoporosis has been to include it in the falls standard of the national service framework for older people. The standard requires local health services to establish appropriate interventions and advice to prevent osteoporotic fractures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40506w44.html_para0">
To support this requirement, the Department has asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to develop clinical guidance on osteoporosis and undertake a technology appraisal on new treatments.

<p><a name="40506w44.html_spnew1"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is due to publish its appraisal of technologies for the secondary prevention of osteoporotic fractures in postmenopausal women in October 2004. A clinical guideline on the assessment of fracture risk and the prevention of osteoporotic fractures in individuals at high risk is expected to be published in June 2005. A further appraisal of technologies for the primary prevention of osteoporotic fragility fractures in postmenopausal women is being informed by work being carried out by the World Health Organisation and the NICE guideline development group, and is also expected to be published in 2005. Copies of the draft guidance and information on their progress can be found on the NICE website at www.nice.org.uk.

The Royal College of Physicians guidelines on osteoporosis recommended to health authorities that they should put arrangements in place so that those at particularly high risk of osteoporosis have the opportunity to receive appropriate investigation, prophylaxis, such as hormone replacement therapy or calcium and vitamin D or calcium and bisphosphonates, and advice, for example, about smoking and physical activity.

<p><a name="40506w44.html_spnew8"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 Radiation-induced lung cancers have been reported in uranium and hard rock miners for a long time. However, the aetiological role of radon was not recognised until 1951, when it was discovered that the lung hazard was due to radiation dose from the decay products of radon. Since the 1980s, the National Radiological Protection Board has kept the risk to health from radon gas under review. The main risk is still lung cancer, although it has been suggested that radon may also cause other types of cancer. On theoretical grounds, some such radon-induced cancers would be expected, but these would be far fewer than the lung cancers and have not been detected in well-designed epidemiological studies.
