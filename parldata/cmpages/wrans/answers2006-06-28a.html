the programme, WRAP is working with 13 major retailers to reduce the

waste minimisation. It is also working with local authorities to
establish greater participation in home composting through its targeted

states which landfilled over 80 per cent. of their municipal waste in
1995 to postpone the targets by up to four years. The Government have
informed the European Commission of its intention to make use of this
four-year derogation, which means the target years for the UK are 2010,
2013 and 2020.</p><p><a name="06062875000070">The UK
target for 2010 is to reduce biodegradable municipal waste landfilled
to no more than 75 per cent. of that produced in 1995. For England,
this equates to 11.2 million tones in 2010. It is estimated that in
2003-04, around 14.7 million tonnes was disposed of in this way, with a
provisional estimate of a further reduction to around 13.9 million
tonnes in 2004-05(i.e. 124 per cent. of the 2010
target).</p><p><a name="06062875000071">In
preparation to the first 2010 target year, the UK have already taken
steps to reduce the amount of waste being sent to landfill. The
Landfill Allowance Trading Scheme (LATS), was launched in April 2005,
and is one of the Government&#146;s key measures to encourage
progressive reductions in the amount of biodegradable municipal waste
that disposal authorities are able to send to landfill
sites.</p><p><a name="06062875000072">Should any
waste disposal authority have landfilled more waste than it holds
allowances for, it can use the sixth month reconciliation period (from
March to the end of September), to trade, borrow or bank allowances to
manage their liabilities. Any waste disposal authority which has
landfilled biodegradable municipal waste in excess of the allowances it
holds at the end of the reconciliation period will be liable to a
financial penalty of &#163;150 per tonne (according to section 9(2)
of the Waste and Emissions Trading
Act).</p><p><a name="06062875000073">The LATS
regulations also provide for supplementary penalties (in addition to
any penalties for exceeding allowances) that are proportional
to(a) any fines imposed on the UK in respect of obligations
under the Landfill Directive and (b) the amount by which an authority
exceeds its allowance in a Landfill Directive target year, or
subsequent scheme years following Landfill Directive target
years.</p><p><a name="06062875000074">Due to the
nature of a tradable allowances scheme,it is not possible to
accurately assess now whether any waste disposal authority is likely to
landfill biodegradable municipal waste in excess to that which it holds
allowances for until the Environment Agency has completed the
reconciliation process for the LATS scheme year 2005-06, expected by
the end of
September.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06062875000013">Marine

charging is one of a number of tools that could be used to encourage
waste minimisation and recycling of household waste. Local authorities
already have powers to run incentive schemes or require householders to
separate their waste for recycling. Recent research shows that at least
half of English local authorities have run, or are running, some form
of incentive scheme and some, such as Barnet, require householders to
separate their
recycling.</p><p><a name="06062875000106">Many
countries, including some in the European Union, have introduced
successful household waste charging schemes, achieving reductions in
waste arisings and increases in the separation of waste for recycling.
(Evidence from studies of this international experience shows a small
increase in fly-tipping incidents when schemes are introduced, but this
quickly tails off where schemes are well designed and effective
enforcement action is taken.)</p><br><notus-date day="28" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>28 Jun 2006 : Column 395W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06062875000019">Rural Enterprise

military offensive against the Karen people has swelled the number of
civilians hiding in conflict areas by at least 15,000. DFID&#146;s
approach to providing emergency assistance to these IDPs has been to
use our comparative advantage (the fact that we have a small presence
inside the country and a strong network of relationships with ethnic
minority and other groups) to reach the IDPs using local community
groups inside Burma. This is a complementary approach to the use of
relief teams operating cross-border from Thailand, and it enables
access to IDPs who would not be reached by any other means, and through
a mechanism which is much less-well supported by other donors. The
development of civil society within the country is also a fundamental
step in a successful transition to democracy.</p><p><a name="06062877000007">The number of IDPs that we can
reach from inside the country is limited. Access is difficult, and the
small local groups with whom we are working do not currently have the
capacity to deliver greater volumes of emergency relief, although we
are working to strengthen their ability to do more. Those delivering
assistance to IDPs cross border from Thailand face similar challenges.
Therefore we recognise the importance of maintaining co-ordination with
all donors (both those delivering assistance cross border, and those
working inside the country) to ensure that together we manage to reach
as many IDPs as
possible.</p><p><a name="06062877000008">DFID also

Investigations Branch (SIB) have a minimal interface with the general
public in comparison to their civilian counterparts. As a result,
complaints by third parties unconnected to the armed forces about the

therefore consider it appropriate for the RMP (SIB) to be brought under
the oversight of the Independent Police Complaints
Commission.</p><p><a name="06062878000043">However, a
comprehensive redress of complaints system exists for all service
personnel, including service police personnel, who wish to complain or
express a grievance about any matter related to their service.
Improvements were proposed under the Armed Forces Bill which included a
redress panel system where panels would include an external,
independent member for certain types of complaints, and an external
reviewer focussing on process, delay, fairness, and the effectiveness
of the procedure, and providing recommendations for improvements where
necessary. Further to the Deepcut Review, we plan to extend the role of
the external reviewer, renamed as the Service Complaints Commissioner,
who would have statutory powers to receive a complaint or allegation
from a service person, family or other third party, to place it in the
hands of the chain of command and to be notified

should be special arrangements in such cases. The findings of the

Long-run projections of the number and proportion of pensioners
eligible to means tested benefits under the White Paper proposals are
not available. 2. Projections of the number and proportion of
pensioners eligible to pension credit are sensitive to modelling
assumptions and to projected changes in the distribution of pensioner
incomes.<br>3. The
estimates of proportions shown here are the mid-points of projections
taken from two separate micro-simulation models. Modelling of the
reform proposals does not include any increase in private saving from
the introduction of personal accounts, which would further reduce the
numbers eligible for pension
credit.<br>4. Projections
of the number of pensioners eligible to pension credit are derived from
the projected proportions eligible and projections of the number of
pensioner households in Great
Britain.<br>5. These
projections assume: continued earnings uprating of the standard
guarantee credit; earnings uprating of the savings credit threshold
from 2008 to 2014; earnings uprating of the basic state pension from
2012; price uprating of the maximum savings credit from 2015; measures
to improve coverage of the basic state pension described in the White
Paper.<br>6. Estimates
cover all those aged above women's state pension age in the private
household population of Great
Britain.<br>7. Estimates
account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020.
They also account for the proposed further increases in state pension
age described in the White Paper. The estimates assume that the minimum
age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women's
state pension age.<br>8.
Estimates are calibrated to the mid-points of the 2004-05 National
Statistics range estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which
adjust 2004-05 family resources survey data to take account of possible
biases in reporting. Although the estimates here are not presented as
ranges, they are subject to a margin of
uncertainty.<br>9.
Estimates of the number of pensioner households eligible are rounded to
the nearest
50,000.<br></td></tr></table><br>

educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LA maintained
pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery,
primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual
Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under five
pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only
included from 1999-2000 onwards. Also included are other LA maintained
pupils which includes all pupils attending schools not maintained by
the authority for whom the authority is paying full tuition fees, or
educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under
arrangements made by the authority drawn from the Form 8b submitted to
the DfES. Also included as other LA maintained pupils are all pupils
attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained
mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. All pupil
numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year
basis.<br><sup>(4)</sup>
Figures prior to 1999-2000 exclude any expenditure on service, strategy
and regulation. For Bristol LA this would add roughly &#163;9 to the
1996-97 unit

UK, nor has it made an assessment of the role Edison is playing, to
help local authorities meet their duties in regard to special
educational needs (SEN). Local authorities have duties to identify,
assess and arrange suitable provision for children with SEN and to keep
their arrangements for special educational provision under review.
Local authorities can buy in consultancy advice to help them with their
special needs duties, as can schools, including special schools. The
Department does not record how much local authorities have spent
commissioning Edison nor what, if any, of this has been spent on SEN
consultancy. Through programmed annual performance assessments and
periodic joint area reviews of children's services, Ofsted and other
inspectorates inspect how local authorities meet their duties,
including any arrangements they make with private or voluntary sector
organisations.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06062910000052">Specialist

Schools for the Future funding allocations do not include money for new
swimming pools, we do allow existing pools to be refurbished within the
programme. It is for each local authority to decide how to make the
best use of its overall Building Schools for the Future funding
allocation across the schools in a particular project and the scope of
works at each school. A decision could be taken locally to put some of
the available funding towards a swimming pool instead of the second of
the two PE spaces allowed for in our guidelines, but only if the
resulting provision satisfies the school&#146;s PE curriculum as well
or better than the standard
provision.</p><p><a name="06062910003919">There is

by the National Foundation for Education Research (NFER) conducted
during 2005 and published by the Department in January 2006 indicated
that 92 per cent. of all teachers teaching science were science
specialists with 44 per cent. holding a biology specialism, 25 per
cent. holding a chemistry specialism, 19 per cent. a physics specialism
and 5 per cent. a specialism in another science. An estimated 2 per
cent. of teachers teaching science did not hold a post A-level
qualification in science. In addition, the research estimated that 76
per cent. of teachers teaching maths were maths specialists. An
estimated 14 per cent. held no post A-level qualification in maths. For
both maths and science, the research suggested that specialists deliver
a greater proportion of the curriculum time than their relative size
within the workforce would suggest. For example, although only 10 per
cent. of teachers teaching science at Key Stage 4 hold a degree

The disclosure service operates as a contract between the Criminal
Records Bureau and Capita Business Services based upon a public private
partnership agreement. Under this agreement, Capita are required to
perform contractually specified Services and to develop, deliver and
maintain the technical infrastructure of the disclosure service. This
is to enable the Home Office to discharge its responsibilities under
part V of the Police Act 1997 and other supporting legislation
including the Protection of Children Act, 1999, to make available to
approved organisations information regarding the criminal or related
background of
individuals.</p><p><a name="06062910004639">Other
services carried out by the Criminal Records Bureau that are not
undertaken by Capita are carried out by civil servants and include the
sensitive matching of an applicant&#146;s personal details to records
held on the Police National Computer (PNC) and other lists held by the
Department of Health and the Department for Education and
Skills.</p><p><a name="06062910004640">A contract
schedule sets out the service levels for Capita to meet. A further
schedule sets out the service credits that apply should Capita fail to
meet the agreed service levels. There is provision within this contract
for liquidated damages to be charged in the event of late delivery to
agreed changes in the
service.</p><p><a name="06062910004641">In each year

cases are clearly regrettable, but represent a very small proportion of

searching and matching techniques and arrangements approved by police
forces. As with the police, when making their decision they must bear
in mind that the source of much of the information recorded on the
police national computer (PNC) database is provided by the individual
concerned at the time of his or her arrest. CRB have to consider that
the individual may deliberately choose to give or, in the heat of the
moment, may be confused and give incomplete or incorrect information.
The CRB is 
<br><notus-date day="28" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>28 Jun 2006 : Column 507W</b><br>acutely aware of the human consequences of making an incorrect matching
decision and does not do so
lightly.</p><p><a name="06062910004692">There may
also be occasions when a person&#146;s identity has been stolen or
their personal details used when someone else is in contact with the
police. It is for these reasons that the CRB must err on the side of
caution when an individual has the same or very similar personal
details to those of someone who has a criminal record. This is because
it is better to be safe than run the risk of letting an inappropriate
person through.</p><p><a name="06062910004693">When a
disclosure is disputed the only safe way to resolve the situation is by
asking the applicant to have his or her fingerprints taken at a local
police station to help either confirm or overturn the original matching
decision. There have been instances where the fingerprinting procedure
has confirmed that an individual who has challenged the accuracy or the
validity of the conviction information has been subsequently proved to
be the owner of that conviction
record.</p><p><a name="06062910004694">The CRB will
always apologise if the original matching decision is later found to be
incorrect. In the event of a dispute the CRB notifies the prospective
employer who would be aware of the CRB&#146;s code of practice that
asks them not to take any precipitative action and defer any employment
decision until the dispute is resolved. When a disclosure is disputed
the CRB will inform all parties that this is the case, including the
employer. Where the information contained in the disclosure is found
not to relate to the applicant, a fresh disclosure will be issued
free-of-charge to both the applicant and the registered
body.90 per cent. of disputes are resolved within 21
days.</p><p><a name="06062910004695">A public
consultation exercise was conducted in October 2003 about making
greater use of fingerprinting at an earlier stage in the application
process and to aid the matching and decision-making procedures. The
overwhelming response was not in favour of such a measure.</p><p><a name="06062910004696">It is worth noting that under
the previous police checking arrangements, individuals were not able to
see the criminal records information disclosed about them. The
information would have been passed only to the prospective employer and
not to the job applicant and the prospective employer would have had no
obligation to pass on the contents of the information to the
individual.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06062910000066">Criminal
