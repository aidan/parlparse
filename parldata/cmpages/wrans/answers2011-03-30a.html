 Cattle vaccination is a potential long-term option for helping to control bovine TB and could have benefits in reducing the risk of infection and onward transmission of disease. However, a vaccine cannot guarantee that all cattle will be fully protected against TB and is therefore unlikely ever to be suitable for use as a sole eradication strategy. In addition, evidence suggests that without addressing the problem in the badger population, it will not be possible to eradicate TB in cattle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_429"><a name="110330w0001.htm_para7"><a name="11033085000238">DEFRA has invested around Â£18 million into the development of a cattle vaccine and associated diagnostic tools. There are still significant technical and regulatory challenges to overcome before a cattle vaccine would be available for widespread use. This includes the need to change EU legislation. We therefore anticipate that a cattle TB vaccine could not be used in the field before 2015 at the earliest.</p>

 The Waste and Resources Action programme has recently published a report, produced jointly with the World Wildlife Fund, entitled "'The Water and Carbon Footprint of Household Food and Drink Waste in the UK". This report finds that the water footprint of avoidable food waste in the UK is 6,200 million cubic metres per year, representing nearly 6% of the UK's water requirements. In per capita terms, this is 243 litres per person per day, approximately one and a half times the daily average household water use in the UK.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_434"><a name="110330w0001.htm_para12"><a name="11033085000279">A quarter of this water footprint represents water used to grow and process food here in the UK, i.e. water from the UK's rivers, lakes and aquifers. The report includes case studies that illustrate the water footprint of three food products (wheat, tomatoes and beef) and two countries from which the UK imports food (Spain and Brazil). By preventing food waste from arising, these water-impacts can be avoided.</p>

We will continue to pay 50% of ESOL course fees for other people who are settled here. We will no longer fund ESOL courses delivered in the workplace.

 The Department for International Development (DFID) does not work specifically on tackling tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS in maternal care in Rwanda. DFID provides sector budget support to the health sector as a whole, to support the Government of Rwanda delivering results across the sector. The performance of the health sector is regularly reviewed jointly by the Government of Rwanda and donors. These reviews enable dialogue around best practice and agreement on how to disseminate lessons to the wider international health community. The Government of Rwanda themselves are very proactive in disseminating their best practice to other developing country governments and partners and have, for example, recently done so with respect to results-based health financing and community health insurance. The World Health Organisation and the Global Fund for HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria also play a leading role, supported by the UK, in sharing best practice on tackling tuberculosis and HIV in maternal care.</p>

The PA has made considerable progress in this regard, meaning a more effective government, an improved security situation, and the PA meeting its core commitments under the Quartet Roadmap.

 Feed-in tariff (FITs) levels were originally set to provide a target 5-8% return on investment across all technologies. Solar photovoltaic (PV) tariffs were set at the lower end of this range to reflect the ease of deployment; for example, solar PV installations up to 50kW do not require planning permission and are unlikely to require complex grid connections. In the fast-track review DECC is proposing revised tariffs in the light of emerging evidence that PV capital costs have fallen significantly since the start of the scheme and that large-scale projects are coming forward more quickly than originally expected. The aim is to target incentives towards smaller community and domestic installations, while keeping overall costs within the available budget.</p>

<i> [holding answer 28 March 2011]:</i> HMS Ark Royal and the Harrier aircraft were withdrawn from service at the end of 2010 as a consequence of decisions taken during the Strategic Defence and Security Review. While there are no plans to retain these capabilities in operational service, the costs of doing so would have been broadly comparable to the savings we expect to achieve from withdrawing them. We estimate the savings from withdrawing Ark Royal to be Â£10 million in 2011-12, Â£25 million in 2012-13, Â£35 million in 2013-14 and Â£35 million in 2014-15.

 The pupil premium for 2011-12 will be allocated to local authorities and schools with pupils that are known to be eligible for free school meals (FSM) as recorded on the January 2011 School Census, Pupil Referral Unit Census and Alternative Provision Census. Each pupil known to be eligible for free school meals will attract Â£430 of funding which will go to the school or academy via the local authority or YPLA if the pupil is in a mainstream setting or will be managed by the responsible local authority if the pupil is in a non-mainstream setting.</p>

In the Nuneaton constituency in January 2010 there were 2,031 pupils known to be eligible, which would give rise to a pupil premium of Â£873,330. In addition to this there were 17 pupils known to be eligible for the service child premium, paid at a lower rate of Â£200 per pupil, which would give rise to a further Â£3,400. However, these are estimates only and are not necessarily indicative of how the pupil premium will be distributed.
