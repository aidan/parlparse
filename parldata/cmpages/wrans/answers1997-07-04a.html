 The information requested is not readily available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, the tables show in less detail the number of offenders aged 10 to under 18 sentenced to immediate custody for all offences by sex, type of court, type of offence group and length of sentence in England and Wales from 1992 to 1995. Copies of these tables have been placed in the Library.

 The placement of juveniles in local authority secure accommodation on remand by a court is a matter for individual local authorities. The Department of Health collate statistics on such placements. They are published annually and are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="70704w01.html_para1">Statistics on the placement of juveniles in local authority secure accommodation following sentence by a court are not recorded centrally on the basis of sex or category of offence and this information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="70704w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Dewar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 1997]:</i> We have looked carefully at the full range of options for making the toll regime for the Skye Bridge fairer. In doing so we have had to take account of the fact that we inherited the contractual commitments which the previous Government had entered into with Skye Bridge Limited. Those commitments guarantee Skye Bridge Limited a specific financial return on the bridge. Therefore any action by the Government in relation to toll levels which leads to a reduction in the revenues which would flow to the company renders the Government liable to compensate the company for that reduction in revenue.
<P>

<a name="70704w02.html_para0">This makes affordability a key issue. Simply buying out the contract is estimated to cost around &#163;30 million. We cannot justify that in the face of the many pressing needs for future expenditure within my public expenditure programme. Spending on education and health, for example, has a higher priority in deciding how to deploy any public expenditure which we can free up by reordering priorities or improving the efficiency of programmes.
<P>

<a name="70704w02.html_para1">The idea of removing tolls completely through 100 per cent. shadow tolls is no less expensive than buying out the contract. Nor in public expenditure terms does it have the effect of spreading the cost over a number of years, as people have tended to assume. The full cost of the project would be a public expenditure charge immediately because of the absence of the transfer of risk to the private sector, which is what justifies the phased public expenditure cost for DBFO roads contracts entered into before construction has begun.
<P>

<a name="70704w02.html_para2">We looked at the option of partial shadow tolling. However, we concluded that this was not the fairest means of alleviating the impact of tolls. We consider that the impact of the tolls is most severe on local people and others who use the bridge most frequently. We can halve the car and motorcycle tolls for frequent users for almost the same cost as would be involved in reducing tolls across the board by only 10 per cent., through partial shadow tolling.
<P>

<a name="70704w02.html_para3">We believe that halving the discounted tolls for cars and motorcycles paid by frequent users would be a very significant benefit. Frequent users make 40 per cent. of all car crossings at present and most of them will be inhabitants of Skye or the surrounding area. This change will produce a toll of &#163;1.25 compared to the current discounted ticket cost of &#163;2.51 and the current cost to casual users of &#163;4.40 in the low season and &#163;5.40 in the high season. At the suggestion of Highland Council, I propose that the number of crossings necessary for car and motorcycle owners to qualify for the discounted toll should be increased from 10 to 20.
<P>

<a name="70704w02.html_para4">Highland Council put to me the case for some reduction in tolls for commercial vehicles. I looked very carefully at several options which they put to me and concluded that, since over 70 per cent. of commercial vehicles take advantage of discounted tolls at present, I should focus any reduction on these tolls as I have done for car users. A reduction of 25 per cent. in discounted tolls for large heavy goods vehicles will reduce the cost of each crossing by &#163;6.32, from &#163;25.27 to &#163;18.95, which should produce very substantial cumulative benefits to the businesses

concerned. I hope this will benefit the local economy either through the effect on consumer prices or by helping companies retain or increase employment.
<P>

<a name="70704w02.html_para5">Highland Council also made a case for a reduction in the toll for service buses, and I have decided to reduce the discounted toll for these by 25 per cent. from &#163;15.27 to &#163;11.45. This should enable bus operators to reduce fares and will, I hope, encourage the use of public transport.
<P>

<a name="70704w02.html_para6">I wish to assist the health of the local economy. The changes in tolls which I propose to make are likely to cost me a very substantial amount of money over the life of the contract. That will be matched by savings to bridge users, who will be free to spend that money in other ways. Since the benefits will be concentrated on local people, as a result of the approach which I have chosen, the extra spending power is more likely to flow to the local economy.
<P>

<a name="70704w02.html_para7">My officials are now in discussion with Skye Bridge Ltd. to agree the precise details and the arrangements to ensure that the effect of these changes on the Company's revenue is neutral. The timing of these changes will depend partly on the need to promote a variation to the Toll Order, which will have to be approved by Parliament, and on the need to complete the discussions with the Company. They will, however, be implemented as early as practicable.

This requires NDPBs to consider whether they need to adopt rules comparable to those that apply to Crown servants in the light of their functions and of any potential for conflict of interest which might give rise to public concern. My Department has reminded those NDPBs for which it is responsible of this requirement, and asked them to consider whether appropriate clauses might also be inserted into the contract of employees in especially sensitive positions.

<P>
<a name="70704w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The reduction in farmers' income from compensation resulting from the reduction in the compensation rate for cull cows slaughtered under the Over-Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) will depend on the number of animals coming forward for slaughter at the end of their productive lives and the weight of such

 My colleagues and I have had several meetings with representatives of the farming industry since 1 May.

<P>
<a name="70704w04.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will make a statement about the future of the Royal Observatories. [7314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) has decided to concentrate the work it funds at the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO), which is based at Cambridge, and the Royal Observatory Edinburgh (ROE) in a new UK Astronomy Technology Centre (UKATC) at Edinburgh. This new name will better reflect the fact that the Royal Observatories are now really observatories in name only. Their main function is to provide technological support for the telescopes operated by PPARC on behalf of British astronomers.
<P>

<a name="70704w04.html_para0">A substantial amount of money will be freed up as a result of this decision amounting to &#163;2.4 million per annum over the next four years and at least &#163;4 million per annum thereafter. This sum, which is equivalent to approximately 20 per cent. of the budget for astronomy grants, will be re-invested in basic science. It will fund grants to astronomers doing exciting new science in our universities. In addition, I am confident the new UKATC will benefit greatly from the increased efficiency and better co-operation between scientists which will result from combining the RGO and ROE programmes.
<P>

<a name="70704w04.html_para1">This decision will allow PPARC to reorganise the Royal Observatories in the way which best meets their scientific requirements. I believe that, as the responsible Research Council, they should have the freedom to manage their research facilities efficiently and effectively. PPARC will develop this in consultation with the unions and other interested parties. Under the previous 



<P>
<P><I>4 Jul 1997 : Column: 298</I><P>
administration, PPARC was bound to implement the conclusions of the 1995 Prior Options Review of the Royal Observatories that the management of the United Kingdom telescopes and the delivery of the instrumentation programme currently provided by the Royal Observatories should be subject to competitive tendering. PPARC have reviewed the situation in the light of developments since then and have advised me to release them from this obligation. I have decided to follow this advice in line with our long-standing opposition to dogmatic privatisation.
<P>

<a name="70704w04.html_para2">The concentration at Edinburgh will take place over some years. The RGO is an historic institution with a great tradition that has already survived two changes of location. I am asking PPARC to explore every possible avenue for keeping the institution alive. Nevertheless, this decision will lead to some job losses. Therefore I have asked PPARC to make every effort to help anyone who loses their job to find alternative employment.
<P>

<a name="70704w04.html_para3">I have laid a copy of the report on which PPARC's advice was based and a copy of my letter to the Chairman of PPARC in the Library of the House.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what proportion of the payments covered by the contract between BNFL and British Energy announced on 4 June relates to <i>(a)</i> spent fuel charges and <i>(b)</i> fuel fabrication charges. [6406]<P>
<P>
<P>

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what proportion of the spent fuel covered by the contract between BNFL and British Energy announced on 4 July will be <i>(a)</i> stored, <i>(b)</i> wet stored and <i>(c)</i> reprocessed. [6405]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Details of the contracts between BNFL and British Energy, which was announced on 4 June, are commercially confidential. I understand, however, that initially an estimated 800 tonnes will be reprocessed. How the remaining spent fuel will be dealt with is a matter for the companies involved although it will include a mixture of reprocessing and storage.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w05.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Taylor: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade what plans BNFL has notified to her Department relating to the use of plutonium not produced at Sellafield in the proposed Sellafield MOX plant. [6404]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Sellafield MOX plant is designed to produce Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel for BNFL's customers from the recycled plutonium and uranium separated during reprocessing. In the main, it is envisaged that the Sellafield MOX Plant will utilise plutonium arising from reprocessing of spent fuels at THORP which belong to overseas customers. The Sellafield MOX plant has the capability to blend uranium and plutonium which has been separated at other reprocessing plants. I understand, however, that there are no current plans to utilise this capability.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what is the estimated annual cost of storing <i>(a) </i>a cubic metre of vitrified high-level waste and <i>(b)</i> a container of vitrified high-level waste in the vitrified product store at BNFL's Sellafield site. [6412]

<a name="70704w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Once spent fuel has been reprocessed and the reusable uranium and plutonium extracted the small proportion of high level waste can be vitrified. The cost and subsequent charge to customers for storing vitrified waste is a commercial matter between BNFL and its customers.

<P>
<a name="70704w05.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Taylor: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Details of the funding currently held by BNFL to meet its nuclear liabilities are published in the company's Annual Report and Accounts. The last available figures from the 1995-96 report are given as &#163;1.12 billion. The difference between this and the discounted figure of &#163;1.58 billion, given in the report, will be provided over remaining plant lives. Full details are provided in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w05.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Taylor: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if BNFL makes cash payments into a segregated fund for the purpose of meeting its share of the nuclear liabilities arising at its sites. [6410]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 BNFL, which is a publically owned company, does not make payments into a segregated fund for its nuclear liabilities. The company is, however, required to ensure that the resources called for will be available. Investment and management of these funds is carried out by BNFL in accordance with Treasury guidelines. Details of, and information relating to, provisions for total liabilities for which BNFL is liable are published in the Company's Annual Report and Accounts, copies of which are available in the Library of the House.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w05.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Taylor: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if he will make a statement on the funding arrangements established by BNFL to enable it to meet its share of the nuclear liabilities arising at its sites. [6409]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 BNFL is required to make full and adequate provision for its liabilities. The Company undertakes an annual review of its waste management and decommissioning liabilities and then ensures that, in the light of this, it makes proper provision for the resources estimated. BNFL's published accounts for 1995-96 indicate the BNFL's share of the costs of nuclear liabilities was &#163;2.6 billion (undiscounted) or &#163;1.6 billion (discounted), of which &#163;1.1 billion has been provided for to date in the Company's accounts.
<P>

<a name="70704w05.html_para0">The provisions are expressed at current price levels and are based on the latest technical assessments of the processes and methods likely to be used in the future.

<a name="70704w05.html_para2">Theft of mail is a criminal offence which Royal Mail takes very seriously. For security reasons, it would not be appropriate to disclose the active measures which Royal Mail undertakes, and continually reviews, in order to prevent the theft of mail.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w05.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 My Department's computer records do not show the particular asbestos-related disease or diseases that claimants have allegedly contracted, or whether a civilian or former civilian member of staff claiming compensation was ever in the Armed Forces, or if employed in support of the Armed Forces, with which Service. The claimants' employment status at the time the claim was submitted and at the time settled is not readily available. Information on employment history and status could only be provided in respect of the more recent claimants and then only at disproportionate cost. Documentation on claims from civilian and former civilian employees is routinely destroyed three years after the claims has been settled.
<P>

<a name="70704w05.html_para4">Computer based information in respect of the number of claims received from civilian or former civilian staff only goes back to 1 April 1985. In the period 1 April 1985 to 30 April 1997, my Department received 2,286 claims for compensation for asbestos-related disease alleged to have been caused by asbestos exposure while the claimants were employed as MOD civilians. Of these claims, 1,797 have resulted in the payment of compensation. On 30 April 1997, 303 claims were outstanding.

 The Strategic Defence Review will examine how the Army should be structured to meet our nation's interests and commitments, taking full account of the recognized strengths of the Regimental System. It would, however, be premature to speculate whether the review will alter any aspect of the system.

 This is an operational matter for London Transport Buses. I understand that 21 per cent. of bus services in London are now covered by automatic vehicle location (AVL) systems, almost all of which can be linked to the Countdown electronic passenger information system at bus stops. By the end of 1999 almost all of London's buses should have AVL. In addition, 65 per cent. of buses already carry separate transponders to operate systems to provide priority at some 300 traffic signals, principally in outer London.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w06.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 We encourage local highway authorities, in conjunction with bus operators, to look for ways of giving priority to buses in traffic. This is an important way in which buses can be made a more attractive choice of travel. The use of transponders to give priority to buses at traffic signals is one means of doing this.

 Negotiations between London Underground and the Powerlink consortium are still taking place. London Underground are optimistic that a deal will be concluded. If it goes ahead, the "Power" PFI project will include a substantial upgrade of the Northern Line's power system by the contractor, as well as improvements to meet the rest of the network's power needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how much money was received by the Government in 1986 from the National Bus Company Pension Fund; and what estimate he has made of the current value of such a sum appropriately invested. [6808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w06.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 A total of &#163;121.8 million was paid to the Department of Transport in 1990 (not 1986) on the winding up of the two National Bus Company pension funds. An estimate of what that sum might now be worth had it been available for investment would depend entirely on the assumptions used.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w06.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My Department's advice on traffic generation is contained in Volume 12 of the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges, Section 2, Part 2, Guidance on Induced Traffic. This was revised in February 1997, following experience with the advice issued in December 1994 which implemented

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what are the projected increases of emissions of <i>(a)</i> carbon monoxide, <i>(b)</i> nitrogen oxide and <i>(c)</i> PM10 particles consequent on the proposed widening of the M25 between junctions 12 to 15; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70704w06.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 July 1997]:</i> Taking 1991 as the base year and 2010 as the forecast year, morning peak hour carbon monoxide emissions from vehicles on the M25 are predicted to decrease by approximately 72 per cent. with the widening scheme compared to 70 per cent. without the scheme. Emissions of oxides of nitrogen are predicted to decrease by approximately 84 per cent. compared to 72 per cent. without the scheme. PM10 concentrations are predicted to decrease by 38 per cent. compared to 51 per cent. without the scheme.

<a name="70704w06.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Clearly, the risk of injury to passengers in an accident is minimised if they are seated and wearing seatbelts. In the light of this we will be looking at whether the current rules for standing passengers in buses on motorways need further consideration.

This found no evidence that children receiving conductive education progressed better than comparable children at maintained special schools.
