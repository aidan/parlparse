<a name="70522w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 An early-day motion regarding the murder of Stephen Lawrence was tabled on 20 May. We have also received a recent letter about the case from the London borough of Greenwich and are aware of the widespread concern, particularly within the black community, resulting from this case. We are currently considering how those concerns can best be addressed, and will make an announcement soon.

<a name="70522w01.html_para0">Information for 1994 and 1995 is published in "Prison Statistics, England and Wales"--tables 3.9, 4.6 and 5.6 of the 1994 (Cm 3087) and 1995 (Cm 3355) editions. Copies are available in the Library.

 Yes. We are committed to introducing a new drug testing and treatment order, and will bring forward legislative proposals accordingly.

<a name="70522w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 It is difficult to quantify the proportion of offenders addicted to drugs or dependent on them. The Home Office has a research programme designed to shed further light on the links between drugs and crime. It includes a study of drug use by samples of people arrested by the police in various cities. Preliminary results from this study point to a higher level of drug taking by arrestees than expected. However, the study is still incomplete; the University of Cambridge will be delivering a report to the Home Office in October, which is likely to be published around the end of the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The readily available information is for persons found guilty at all courts or cautioned for indictable offences and is contained in table 5.26 of Criminal Statistics, England and Wales 1995.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Decisions concerning the protection provided for Mr. Rushdie are for the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis. Mr. Rushdie continues to receive protection at a level commensurate with the threat and which has successfully ensured his safety over a number of years.

<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to introduce legislation to extend police powers of arrest over hit-and-run drivers; and what other measures he plans to take in respect of hit-and-run drivers. [718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government intend to make failure to stop after a road accident involving personal injury an arrestable offence. Primary legislation will be brought forward at the earliest opportunity. No other measures are planned.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many cases of successful arrests of hit-and-run drivers have been recorded in each of the last 12 months. [719]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The information requested is not collected centrally. Information on arrests is not held centrally at the level of detail needed to isolate particular offences. Nor can hit-and-run drivers be identified in the statistics of motoring offence prosecutions, as they will form only part of those offences classified as failing to stop or report an accident (i.e. where personal injury is caused).

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will allow the two male members of the Onibiyo family to return from Nigeria and Guyana and be granted permanent United Kingdom residency. [716]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is open to Mr. Abdul Onibiyo to apply at any time for entry clearance to return to the United Kingdom. Mr. Onibiyo's son, Ademola, will not qualify for entry clearance while he remains the subject of a valid and extant deportation order but it is open to him to apply to have the order revoked. Entry clearance will be granted only to applicants who meet the requirements of the Immigration Rules. It would not be appropriate to treat the Onibiyos exceptionally.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In our manifesto, we said that we would reform the current system to remove the arbitrary, ineffective and unfair results that can follow from the primary purpose rule. We shall make an announcement about this soon.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on refugees and asylum seekers from the Congo and neighbouring states. [1053]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 As my right hon. Friend explained in his reply to the hon. Member for Nuneaton (Mr. Olner) on 16 May, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>3</i>, he has made a declaration under the Social Security (Persons from Abroad) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1996 that Zaire (now known as the Democratic Republic of Congo) has undergone an upheaval such that we would not seek to enforce the return of refused asylum seekers to that country for the time being.
<P>

<a name="70522w01.html_para2">The declaration of upheaval relates to the fundamental changes which have occurred in Zaire and does not extend to neighbouring countries. We will of course continue to monitor the situation in the region generally.

<a name="70522w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will give the police powers to remove or clamp motor vehicles not displaying a valid road tax disc. [1022]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Powers contained in the Vehicle Excise Duty (Immobilisation, Removal and Disposal of Vehicles) Regulations 1997 enable the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions to authorise agents of the Department of Transport to clamp and impound vehicles evading vehicle excise duty. I understand that a three-month pilot scheme was successfully conducted by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency last year and that consideration is currently being given on the way forward. There are no plans to give the police powers to remove or clamp untaxed vehicles.

 The information requested is given in the following tables, table 1 relating to the non-prisons Home Office and table 2 relating to the Prison Service. To avoid the possibility of identifying individuals because of low numbers in particular grades, the figures are given by grade level (i.e. main grades plus equivalent specialist grades) and grade levels are amalgamated where necessary.

<P>
<a name="70522w01.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I am undertaking a review of the current position. Although measures used in the past have been relatively successful in attracting ethnic minority recruits, I remain concerned about the under-representation of employees from the ethnic minorities, particularly in higher grades.
<P>

<a name="70522w01.html_para4">The measures used up to now include targeting job advertisements where they are most likely to reach prospective ethnic minority applicants, and raising the Department's profile with prospective ethnic minority applicants, for example, by participating in the Windsor Fellowship programme and the National Mentoring Consortium.
<P>

<a name="70522w01.html_para5">As part of the Department's commitment to securing equality of opportunity for all staff, the procedures in the non-prisons Home Office for dealing with complaints of harassment and discrimination are being reviewed. The Prison Service will shortly begin a programme of racial harassment awareness training for all staff.

Although the latter elements of your Question are outwith my area of responsibility, I have been asked to provide a consolidated response.

<BR>
I should explain that the functions of the Royal Artillery Manning and Records Office, the Footguards and Infantry Manning and Records Office, and the associated Army Regimental Pay Offices, currently located within Imphal Barracks, York, will transfer to the Army Personnel Centre (APC) in Glasgow on 16 June 1997.
<BR>
These offices currently occupy approximately 44514 ft <sup>2</sup>  (4137m <sup>2</sup> ) of Building 107, Imphal Barracks, York. As the Manning and Records, and Regimental Pay Offices are lodger units on the site, when this part of the building is vacated due to the transfer of the functions to the APC, HQ Land Command as the Top Level Budget Holder responsible for maintaining and managing the barracks, will be the prime executive authority who will endorse any decision on the future occupants of the office space made available. HQ Land Command act as the focal point for the submission of any departmental restructuring and relocation initiatives, entering into formal correspondence and consultation with interested parties through the normal chains of command.
<BR>
Although any plans for the future use of the accommodation are outwith my area of responsibility, I am informed that a site reshuffle of local branches is intended and that the office space will be reallocated to other MOD users, including Headquarters 15 (North East) Brigade, and elements of Headquarters 2 Division which, by January 1998, will together occupy the majority of the vacated accommodation. I understand that no firm decision has yet been taken regarding the remainder of the vacated office space.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
ONS produce two measures of unemployment. The first, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS), is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed people who are: a) without a paid job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained.
<BR>
The other measure of unemployment; the monthly claimant count, is based on the administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployment-related benefits (i.e. Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support or National Insurance credits) at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed on as unemployed and available to do any suitable work. Essentially, all people who attend an Employment Service office to sign are counted, irrespective of whether they are actually receiving benefit.
<BR>
The latest ILO figures relate to winter 1996/97 (December to February). These show that in Great Britain, the seasonally adjusted number of unemployed people was 2,111,000 or 7.5 per cent of the workforce. In April 1997, seasonally adjusted claimant unemployment in the United Kingdom was 1,651,400 or 5.9 per cent of the workforce.
<BR>
Although the methods of calculation and the levels of those two series differ, they indicate broadly consistent rates of underlying change in unemployment.

 The Government sees a fundamental role for local education authorities in a partnership to raise standards. The forthcoming White Paper will set out the Government's proposals for LEA Development Plans which will specify how each LEA will provide local leadership focused on raising standards in all its schools. The role will include: providing the data schools need to set challenging but realistic improvement targets; monitoring performance; working with schools before they develop serious weaknesses; taking decisive action where necessary; and promoting good practice by providing effective advisory and other professional support services.

<P>

<a name="70522w06.html_para1">For the autumn and spring terms, local education authorities will be invited to submit an interim Early Years Development Plan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The changes made by the previous Government were necessary because of the escalating cost of teachers' premature retirement, to which the Public Accounts Committee drew attention. Employers will still be able to grant premature retirement to teachers under 60.

 In announcing on 16 May a comprehensive review of options for implementing the Government's election manifesto pledge to grant the Post Office greater commercial freedom, I also announced that, at my request, the Post Office had agreed to suspend its programme of converting Crown post offices to agency status--except where irreversible commitments already exist--until we are in a position to make informed decisions. The proposal to convert the Crown post office in Southport has been suspended.

 I represented the UK at the meeting of the EU Research Council on 14-15 May 1997 at which the European Commission's proposals for the Fifth Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP5) were the chief item for discussion. I underlined the need for FP5 to be strongly focused on Europe's economic and social challenges and deliver real

results. The whole programme must be focused on well defined objectives, be tightly managed and involve the users of research.
<P>

<a name="70522w07.html_para3">Following an exchange of views, a worthwhile measure of agreement was reached on a number of key issues relating to the shape and structure of FP5. All Member States subscribed to these except Spain, which withheld agreement because it was unable to secure acceptance that financial commitments on FP5 should be delayed. Conclusions adopted by the Presidency reflect the areas of agreement on FP5, which include the need to improve the coherence of the proposed thematic programme structure while still limiting programme numbers to a range of broadly 4-6; the need for additional 'key actions' (targeted R&D directed at specific social and economic goals) within a limit of broadly 25; commitment to keeping to the timetable for the introduction of FP5; and agreement to procedures for taking forward work on the scientific and technological content of FP5, and tackling the management questions. I consider this a very useful outcome that will give an impetus to further preparatory work before the next Council in November.

<a name="70522w07.html_para4">I also addressed research ministers from the EU's Central and East European Associates in the context of the "Structured Dialogue" preparing for the enlargement of the European Union.

 We have made a firm commitment not to permit the sale of arms to regimes that might use them for internal repression or international aggression. To give effect to that commitment, we have initiated an urgent review of the detailed criteria used in considering licence applications for the export of conventional arms. We support a strong UK defence industry but must ensure that exports are properly regulated. We are aware of concerns that some defence equipment exported from the UK in the past has been used for internal repression. The review will ensure that the risk of such misuse is fully taken into account, alongside all other relevant factors, in the assessment of all licence applications for the export of conventional arms. The new criteria will be made available to the House when the Review is complete. In the meantime, I have instructed my officials to consult Ministers whenever there are export licence applications which may raise concerns about human rights or international stability.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will make a statement on the current levels of remuneration for legal aid for <i>(a)</i> barristers and <i>(b)</i> solicitors. [1056]<P>

<P>
<a name="70522w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I am satisfied that remuneration rates for legal aid work for both solicitors and barristers are currently set at a level which attracts a sufficient number of competent practitioners to undertake the work, whilst at the same time ensuring that the cost to public funds is not unreasonable. The present levels were considered earlier this year as part of the annual discussions with the profession on remuneration rates. No changes were made.

Candidates are under no obligation to answer such questions. However, from information currently held I can say that two are Asian; 15 are White; one is listed as "other"; and the ethnic origins of the remaining eight are unknown. No information on the ethnic origins of lay members is collected.

The Public Record Office has no specific proposals to increase the number of its ethnic minority employees. It is however an equal opportunities employer and its recruitment practice follows the guidelines on fair and open competition from the Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code (2nd edition 1996). Currently 17% of its employees are from ethnic minorities.

HM Land Registry's <i>Programme for action to achieve equality of opportunity for people of ethnic minority origin</i> sets out specific commitments in respect of recruitment, retention, training and development of ethnic minority employees, including monitoring the impact of commitments.
<BR>
Training on equal opportunities is mandatory for all staff on entry to a management grade and additional training is provided before staff are involved in recruitment procedures. "Equal Opportunities" statements are included in all our recruitment literature and advertisements.

Information on appointments to advisory NDPBs and other bodies is available from sponsoring departments and is often set out in departmental publications, such as departmental annual reports, copies of which are available in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We have estimated that the reduction in VAT on domestic fuel to 5 per cent. will result in an increase in carbon dioxide emissions of about 0.9 million tonnes per year (equivalent to about a quarter of a million tonnes of carbon) by 2010. This represents about 0.15 per cent. of current carbon dioxide emissions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Extensive research on the effects of clean coal plants is available from ETSU (formerly the Energy Technology Support Unit) and the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas Research and Development Programme. The impacts that clean coal technology would have on carbon dioxide emissions would depend on the number of plants built and which other options for electricity generation they displace.

 The Government will lead the fight against global warming at the Kyoto Conference on climate change this December, through our target of a 20 per cent. reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2010. We will review the United Kingdom's Climate Change Programme in that light looking for improvements in areas such as domestic and industrial energy efficiency, an integrated transport strategy to tackle the projected growth in emissions from road transport, and a large increase in the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources and combined heat and power schemes.

 Local authorities report information on the rent loss on their vacant dwellings in their Housing Subsidy Claim returns.

<BR>
The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has asked me to reply to your Questions about:
<BR>
the current waiting time for appeal cases to be heard;
<BR>
the number and grades of planning inspectors;
<BR>
the current backlog of appeals being dealt with by the Planning Inspectorate on 5 May.
<BR>
During April the average waiting time for dates offered to the parties for planning appeals to be heard at both a public inquiry and a hearing was 26 weeks from the start of the appeal.
<BR>
On 1 May 1997 the Planning Inspectorate had 379 Planning Inspectors. Of the 224 salaried Inspectors there were 42 Principal Housing and Planning Inspectors, 149 Senior Housing and Planning Inspectors and 33 Housing and Planning Inspectors. The remaining inspectors were fee paid.
<BR>
The planning appeal system is governed by procedure rules. These rules prescribe the time allowed for the parties to the appeal to compete the various stages of the process. As a consequence there will always be appeals in the process awaiting determination. On 5 May there were 6,879 planning appeals being dealt with by the Inspectorate in England.

The Government does not wish to stop this work. It wishes to ensure, however, that those preparing proposals are given the clearest possible guidance on the Government's policies and priorities. It will therefore issue shortly supplementary guidance, the key elements of which will be:
(a) a requirement that proposals contribute to the Government's Manifesto commitment to carry out a concerted attack against the multiple causes of social and economic decline, and fit with its new policies, including those relating to employment, crime and housing;
(b) a greater emphasis on tackling the needs of communities in the most deprived areas;




<P>
<P><I>22 May 1997 : Column: 153</I><P>

(c) a requirement that proposals should take account of existing strategies for promoting economic development and tackling deprivation, such as economic development strategies prepared by local authorities, and fit with the Government's policy on regional governance.
<P>

<a name="70522w13.html_para1">In addition, the Government considers that there should be a more collaborative approach between those preparing proposals, their partners and Government Offices for the Regions in order to arrive at a shared understanding of regeneration needs and priorities, and to stimulate fresh thinking. To facilitate this sort of exchange, the Government has decided that the deadline for submission of initial proposals be shifted from 27 June 1997 to 26 September 1997. It nonetheless expects those working up proposals to be in touch with the appropriate Government Office for the Region well before this revised deadline.

 During the 1997 Public Expenditure Survey, provision for the Estate Action programme nationally was reduced by &#163;10 million in 1997-98, and &#163;20 million in each of the next two years. As a result, planned expenditure on a number of Estate Action schemes, including the Garth Refurbishment Programme in Hull, was reprofiled in consultation with the local authorities concerned. However, the total amount of Estate Action grant to be given to this and other committed Estate Action schemes remains unchanged.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he will determine whether Somerset county council can exceed its expenditure cap for 1997-98. [1144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 I am announcing the capping principles for all authorities, including Somerset, today.
<P>

<a name="70522w13.html_para2">The vast majority of authorities have set budgets and council taxes within the limits set by my predecessor; in only three cases (out of 436 authorities) am I proposing cap limits which would require authorities to reduce their budget requirements.
<P>

<a name="70522w13.html_para3">These authorities are Oxfordshire County Council, Somerset County Council and Warwickshire County Council. I have proposed caps for them which I consider, on the basis of all the information available so far, to be reasonable and achievable in all the circumstances of the authorities concerned. If the authorities accept my proposed caps they will be able to issue new lower bills without delay.
<P>

<a name="70522w13.html_para4">The capping principles for 1997-98 are set out in the Limitation of Council Tax and Precepts 1997-98 (4 February 1997) subject to a general proviso that no authority is to be designated if its budget requirement is &#163;50,000 or less above the limit implied by these principles. I have placed copies of this document in the Library of the House. The main points are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) <i>Inner London boroughs, Metropolitan Districts and Unitary authorities and the Isles of Scilly</i> were able to increase their budget requirements by 1 per cent. or the increase in their education, PSS and fire SSAs whichever is the greater;
<P>
<BR>
(ii) <i>County Councils, outer London Boroughs and the City of London</i> were able to increase their budget requirements by 2 per cent. or the increase in their education, PSS and fire SSAs, whichever is the greater;
<P>
<BR>
(iii) <i>Shire districts</i> were able to increase their budgets by 0. 5 per cent.;
<P>
<BR>
(iv) <i>Fire and Civil Defence Authorities</i> were able to increase their budget requirements by 3.0 per cent.;
<P>
<BR>
(v) <i>Police Authorities</i> were able to increase their budgets by 3.2 per cent.

<P>
<BR>

<BR>
Authorities budgeting more than <i>12. 5 per cent. above SSA</i> were subject to a cash freeze.
<BR>
In accordance with sections 54 and 56 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, I have decided to designate the authorities listed below. The amount given after each authority is the amount which I am proposing should be the maximum amount calculated by each authority as its budget requirement for 1997-98:
<BR>
Oxfordshire County Council: &#163;339.530 million
<BR>
Somerset County Council: &#163;284.746 million
<BR>
Warwickshire County Council: &#163;292.335 million

<a name="70522w13.html_para5">This decision demonstrates that we are taking our commitments on spending very seriously. The authorities now have 28 days, starting today, in which to inform us whether or not they accept their proposed cap. If they accept, the caps will be confirmed by notice and the authorities can set revised lower budgets. The budgets we are proposing imply reductions of &#163;6 million for Oxfordshire, &#163;3.339 million for Somerset and &#163;2 million for Warwickshire. Band D council tax bills well be reduced by around &#163;28 (Oxfordshire) &#163;20 (Somerset) and &#163;11 (Warwickshire.) If an authority challenges, it must propose an alternative amount together with its reasons for doing so and will have the opportunity to meet us to explain its case. Once we have considered all the available information we shall propose final caps which will be included in an Order, a draft of which is debated by the House of Commons. If the draft Order is approved, final caps are set by notice and revised budgets and council tax levels must then be set by the authorities concerned.

<a name="70522w14.html_para0">Comparable figures for the amounts of set-aside capital receipts held by local authorities are not available. Individual authorities may not have retained all their set-aside receipts in the form of cash and investments, but instead used the cash to repay debt or in lieu of further borrowing.

<a name="70522w14.html_para1">We will be consulting the Local Government Association and local authorities on the Government's Capital Receipts initiative. No decision about the basis on which resources are to be distributed to individual authorities will be made until that consultation process is complete.

<P>
<a name="70522w14.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Under its contracts with train operators Railtrack is penalised for delays to services caused by faults in the infrastructure and signalling and thereby encouraged to invest in necessary maintenance. This is one of the areas we are considering as part of our review of regulation of the rail industry.

<a name="70522w14.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 The Secretary of State has no powers to force Railtrack to commit funds. The Rail Regulator, in setting the level of charges payable by train operators, has assumed that Railtrack will spend &#163;3.5 billion at 1995/96 prices on network renewal in the six years to 2001. Railtrack does not have a contractual obligation to spend this amount on maintenance but a failure to spend at the levels assumed by the Regulator would be taken into account when he reviews access charges in 2001.
<P>

<a name="70522w14.html_para2">The Rail Regulator has today called for greater public accountability from Railtrack and announced that he will be seeking agreement to an amendment to Railtrack's licence to ensure delivery of its investment plans. This exposes the weakness in the present system. We will be conducting a thorough review of rail regulation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w15.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Redundancy payments made by West Coast Trains Limited since it was franchised are a matter for the operator. Costs of redundancies to the Exchequer are not identified separately, but may have been a factor in the bids by tenderers for the franchise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w15.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Secretary of State has no powers to force Railtrack to direct its spending to any particular area. Railtrack's annual Network Management Statement gives a guide to the company's own priorities. Responsibility for enforcement of safety duties rests with the Health and Safety Executive who can issue improvement notices requiring works to be carried out by a certain date.

<a name="70522w15.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what proposals he has to make it possible to claim a refund on a fare incorrectly levied at a station other than that at which the ticket was purchased. [747]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w15.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Normally, unused tickets will be eligible for refund and the claim can be submitted at any station. All franchised train operating companies (TOCs) are obliged to participate in the Ticketing and Settlement Agreement (TSA) which deals with the retailing of fares and other products by passenger operators. The TSA obliges all operators to accept claims whether or not they issued the ticket, and arrangements are then made if necessary to forward applications to the relevant train operator who will settle the claim. I understand that train operators are proposing to streamline this process so that TOCs have the option to settle a claim at any station, regardless of where the original purchase was made.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the efficacy of the regulation of the performance of South West Trains; if the regulatory regime is operating according to the undertakings given upon the privatisation of South West Trains; and if he will make a statement. [842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w15.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Although South West Trains' performance has now been restored to an acceptable standard, it is the Government's view that their passengers received unacceptable service for some months earlier this year, and such problems must not recur. We believe that the tools presently available to regulators are inadequate and have already begun to seek ways of strengthening them in the interests of passengers. We have asked the Franchising Director to review his existing enforcement powers, and we will consider how these should be strengthened or how we might otherwise tighten the regulation of franchise agreements.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate his Department has made of the effect that reducing the benzene content of petrol would have on benzene emissions. [1000]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w15.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The evidence which has emerged as a result of the Auto Oil programme suggests that, very broadly the amount of benzene and the amount of aromatics in petrol contribute about equally to the benzene in vehicle exhaust gases, although the results can vary between vehicle types and operation. A third small source is from the partial combustion of other hydrocarbons. As a guide, therefore, a halving of the benzene content in petrol (typical UK average 2-3 per cent.) would result in approximately a one quarter reduction in exhaust gas benzene. The effect of fitting catalytic convertors to cars is much greater, however, benzene emissions being reduced by 85 per cent. compared with non-catalyst cars.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70522w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 <i>(a)</i> MAFF has put considerable resources into the development of a test to detect BSE in live cattle, but so far no test suitable for use in the field has been developed. At present BSE can be suspected in the live animal only on the basis of observations of the clinical signs exhibited: confirmation of the clinical opinion is dependent on laboratory examination of brain tissue after death. Additional resources are being invested into the development of a BSE diagnostic test. To stimulate research in this area MAFF recently launched an Open Competition for independent scientists to develop alternative novel approaches. MAFF is also working in collaboration with French, Dutch and American researchers in the development of tests. Although lines of investigation using urine, blood and cerebrospinal fluid show some promise on clinically affected animals, they are unlikely to be of value in the immediate future in diagnosing sub-clinically infected cattle.
<P>

<a name="70522w16.html_para0"><i>(b)</i> Currently the identification of BSE in cattle is undertaken by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) by histopathological examination of post-mortem samples of brain tissue. Research is under way to find a test which could be applied commercially. Any post-mortem test has to take into account the pathogenesis of the disease, which determines where infectivity will be present at any point in time after infection. There also needs to be a plentiful supply of disease specific monoclonal antibody that has

2. There should be a halt to the culling of badgers--the effect should be monitored.
<BR>
3. There should be improved compensation for farmers and a focusing of resources on alternative approaches to controlling the disease.
<BR>
4. Research into the transmission of the disease should be undertaken and recommendations on farming practice should be promoted.
<BR>
5. Research into a vaccine should be continued to provide a long-term solution.

 Before measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination was introduced into the United Kingdom's immunisation programme in 1988, there was extensive long-term experience of its use in many other industrialised countries. The United States had been using MMR vaccine routinely since the early 1970s and around 100 million doses have been administered. Prior to the introduction of MMR in the UK a study involving 10,000 children was conducted to look at the safety of the vaccine. By the time of the UK introduction of a two-dose programme in 1996, there was extensive experience of two-dose programmes in many other countries. A two-dose programme of MMR in place in Finland since 1982 has led to the elimination of these diseases from that country. The vaccine was reported to have an excellent safety record. All the relevant data were considered by the independent expert advisory group, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises the UK Secretaries of State for health on vaccination matters, before it made its recommendations for the introduction of MMR and subsequently the introduction of the second dose of MMR.

<a name="70522w19.html_para1">The Department of Health and other international authorities are not aware of any scientific evidence supporting a link between MMR vaccine and autism. We have received no representations from abroad on this matter, although we are aware that the Danish authorities have looked at the possibility of a link in the past, but found no evidence to support it. Similarly, the Institute of Medicine in the US reviewed more than 7,000 abstracts and read over 2,000 books and articles on adverse reactions to vaccines and found no work which suggested a link between MMR vaccine and autism. We are not aware of any regulatory action taken by other countries on this issue.
<P>

<a name="70522w19.html_para2">A study conducted in Gothenburg, Sweden, looked at the incidence of autism over a ten-year period during which MMR vaccine was introduced into the childhood immunisation programme. The incidence of autism was unaffected by the introduction of MMR vaccine.
<P>

<a name="70522w19.html_para3">All reported adverse reactions to vaccines are carefully monitored both by the Committee on Safety of Medicines and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation which advise the UK health departments. No vaccine is issued in the United Kingdom unless it passes the highest standards for quality, and parents should have confidence that the vaccines that are provided are both safe and efficacious. MMR immunisation remains the safest way for parents to protect their children against these diseases.

 The effectiveness of, and side effects arising from, the 1994 measles/rubella (MR) school-based immunisation campaign have been carefully reviewed. Copies of "One Year On", a review of the MR campaign published in November 1995, are available in the Library.

rare. The number of notified cases of measles fell from between 10,000 and 20,000 per year between 1990 and 1994 to 7,768 in 1995 and 5,878 in 1996. Notified cases have been tested to confirm whether they are true cases of measles using a salivary testing technique developed by the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS). In 1996, 3,274 of the 5,878 notified cases were tested and measles was confirmed in 63 (1.9 per cent.) of those tested. The number of confirmed notifications of measles in 1996 was the lowest recorded. (PHLS "Communicable Disease Report" (Vol. 7, No. 6, 7 February 1997)). There are good grounds to believe that a sizeable proportion of the few confirmed cases arise from importations. As a consequence of the MR campaign, indigenous measles is now close to elimination.
<P>

<a name="70522w19.html_para5">Suspected adverse reactions to the MR vaccine were reported by doctors to the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) under the voluntary 'yellow card' reporting system. Doctors were reminded on three separate occasions by the Chief Medical Officer to report all suspected adverse reactions to MR vaccine. The Committee on the Safety of Medicines carefully reviewed all the reports received and reports of serious adverse reactions following the MR campaign were very rare (0.007 per cent. of all those immunised). Full information on suspected adverse reactions reported as a consequence of the campaign were published in the MCA's "Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance" (Vol. 21, November 1995), copies of which are available in the Library.

<a name="70522w19.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The United Kingdom health departments are advised on all matters concerning immunisation by the independent expert advisory committee, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). The JCVI has already studied the putative association between Crohn's disease and measles on three recent occasions and members of the Committee have met the researchers who have suggested such an association. The Committee was of the view that work suggesting such an association was not convincing and increasing evidence was becoming available that there was not an association between exposure to measles virus or MMR vaccine and Crohn's disease. The World Health Organisation also has seen the published research and rejects the theory that there is a link.

 Since the 2 May the Minister of State and officials at the Department of Health have met all the principal financiers involved in the two most advanced whole-hospital private finance initiative schemes (those at the Dartford and Gravesham National Health Service Trust and the Norfolk and Norwich Health Care NHS Trust). All these financiers have reaffirmed their commitment to the principles of the private finance initiative and the projects at these two trusts. They also fully support the NHS (Private Finance) Bill, which aims to ensure that NHS trusts have the statutory power to enter into PFI contracts, and the urgent review of the PFI process in the health sector we have announced. This review will seek to identify how the current gridlock can be eliminated and to ensure that much needed schemes are completed quickly. During the review Ministers will listen to the views of all those closely involved with the PFI--from both the public and the private sectors.

 The operation of the voluntary agreement on tobacco advertising and promotion is monitored by the Committee for Monitoring Agreements on Tobacco Advertising and Sponsorship, which is composed of equal numbers of representatives of the Government Departments and the tobacco industry under an independent Chairman.
<P>

<a name="70522w20.html_para0">In 1995-96 the Committee commissioned independent consultants to investigate how three aspects of the agreement were being adhered to, namely an analysis of progress towards the industry's undertaking to remove all permanent shopfront advertising material by 31 December 1996, an audit of compliance with the undertaking to place no poster advertising within a 200 metre radius of schools and other places of education for people under 18, and a survey of compliance with the provisions of the Cigarette Sampling Code. In all cases, a high level of compliance was found.

<a name="70522w20.html_para1">The Committee also arranges for the investigation of complaints submitted by the public.

 In 1996-97, health authorities in England were allocated a total of &#163;185.7 million for treatment and care services for people with HIV and AIDS. These funds are not ring-fenced and it is up to health authorities, taking account of local needs assessment and priorities, to determine their total expenditure. Health authorities were also given ring-fenced funds of &#163;51.3 million for local HIV prevention work including testing services, infection control and health education. In addition, the Department spent &#163;4.2 million in 1996-97 on public health initiatives, education campaigns and helpline services for HIV and AIDS. An estimated further &#163;13.7 million was spent in 1996-97 in the UK on HIV and AIDS research. This figure includes expenditure by the Medical Research Council, the Department of Health and other Government Departments. Relatively little HIV and AIDS research is funded from sources such as charities.
