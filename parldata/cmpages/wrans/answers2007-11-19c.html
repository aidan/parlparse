 No formal assessment is made because it is not possible for routine accident reports to record such information. However information on contributory factors to road accidents is now collected by police forces and reported annually. The use of legal or illegal drugs by drivers was, in the view of the reporting officer, considered a contributory factor in some 2 per cent. of fatal accidents in 2006.</p>

The main UK element of the study estimated the prevalence of drugs in drivers in the study area which were at, or above, the confirmatory test cut-off concentrations proposed by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. The result varied from 4.10 per cent. of drivers for ecstasy or similar drugs alone, to 0.02 per cent. for opiates alone (not including codeine). Ecstasy alone and cannabis alone (3.14 per cent.) were, by far, the drugs with the highest prevalence.</p>

 Tackling fly-tipping and wider waste crime is a priority for the Government. The Government's Waste Strategy for England, published in May 2007, sets out a blueprint for increased recycling and reuse of waste, diverting waste from landfill and for preventing it in the first place. The strategy makes it clear that initiatives to boost waste prevention and recycling should be supported by fly-tipping strategies aimed at tackling the illegal dumping of waste.</p>

In addition, specific medical training for Field Hospital personnel deployed to either Iraq or Afghanistan is conducted. This includes a pre-hospital exercise for the Reserve forces deployed, and six days of medical training. This covers both directed medical training and collective hospital training in a Field Hospital simulator. Each collective hospital exercise is validated and a report produced.

 Since April 2006, the independent Judicial Appointments Commission has had the responsibility for appointments and has set out the qualities and abilities it believes are necessary for judicial office. These are: intellectual capacity, personal qualities, the ability to understand and treat fairly, authority and communication skills and efficiency. The Commission determines its own selection processes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_170"><a name="71119w0012.htm_para8"><a name="07111937001000">Prior to the transfer of responsibility, the process for selection for appointments varied for different appointments and evolved over time. However, immediately prior to the creation of the Commission, the following general steps formed the outline for all selection exercises for appointments below the High Court: application, consultation, sift and interviews and/or assessment centres. For the final High Court exercise before 2006 the process was the same except that candidates were not interviewed but considered on the papers by the selection panel. For all exercises, applicants were assessed against published criteria for the appointment in question. In addition to the minimum criteria set out in law for appointment to each level of post, applicants have to demonstrate that they have the qualities and abilities needed to successfully take on judicial office, including relevant knowledge and experience, independence, professionalism, judgment and people skills. Information about candidates&#146; political views is neither sought nor taken into account in the selection process.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_171"><a name="71119w0012.htm_para9"><a name="07111937001001">The following tables set out the numbers of applicants for (save for the Court of Appeal), and appointments to, salaried judicial posts (not including magistrates) in the Courts system for the five-year period 2002-03 to 2006-07, plus appointments to the fee-paid position of Recorder. It is not possible to identify separately appointments to the Crown court and county court as judges on the Circuit Bench and Recorders are deployed to either. District Judges only sit in the county court.</p>

 Crown court sittings are mainly undertaken by Circuit Judges and Recorders. The normal mandatory retirement age for Circuit Judges is set at 70 under the Judicial Pensions and Retirement Act 1993, subject to the power of extension year-on-year to an age limit of 75 under ss.26(5) and (6) of the Act and to transitional provisions under which a judge already serving on the implementation of the Act  (31 March 1995) retains his pre-existing retirement age. It is currently the policy that Recorders cease to serve at the end of the financial year in which they reach the age of 65. I have received representations from individual Recorders requesting to sit past the age of 65, and the current policy has been confirmed in each case.</p>

 A comprehensive drug treatment framework is in place in prisons to address the varying needs of low, moderate and severe drug mis-users and which encourages prisoners to stay off illegal drugs. The number of offenders recorded as drug free or having a drug addiction on release is not recorded. Research evidence however reports that post-release misuse is not as high as pre-prison usage. Research also shows that prison is one of the key influences in getting people off drugs. Overall, prison contributes to a significant reduction in drug misuse for the majority of prisoners.</p>

However, each of the agreements listed below requires the consent of both states involved, as well as that of the prisoner concerned.

 The decision to impose a fine on a juvenile or the parents is a matter for the court, in exercise of its judicial discretion. Under section 137 of the Powers of Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000, where a child aged 10 to 15 is dealt with by way of a financial penalty, the court has a duty to order that the fine, compensation or costs awarded be paid by the parent or guardian, unless they cannot be found or it would be unreasonable to do so. In the case of a young person aged 16 or more the court has discretion to make such an order as opposed to a duty.</p>

Our &#163;40 million contribution in 2007 to the pioneering Common Humanitarian Fund has provided 340,000 households with non-food items, assisted approximately 75,000 organised returnees, 105,000 internally displaced persons (IDPs) and refugees and assisted future organised returns for over 500,000 IDPs. In Southern Sudan it has enabled nine million children to be vaccinated against Polio, one million against measles and resulted in a 19 per cent. drop in food aid requirements. The UK also has a &#163;12 million p.a. bilateral programme with non-governmental organisations in Darfur which provides water, sanitation and health care to over four million people, of which 2.2 million are internally displaced in camps.</p>

 The gender pay gap is complex and arises from many factors such as differences in men and women's labour market experience (e.g. as a result of women taking time out to look after children), skills and education, occupational segregation, lack of quality part-time work (especially for women returning from maternity leave), historical culture, gender stereotyping and discrimination.</p>

The Commission looked at the range of published research and other evidence on this issue, and produced a report in February 2006 containing 40 recommendations to tackle the gender pay gap. The Government accepted, or partially accepted, all but one of the recommendations aimed at Government and we are making good progress in implementing them.</p>

 Only a small proportion of the work of the Government Equalities Office focuses specifically on discrimination against men, because in tackling those inequalities that persist in society, women are still affected more than men as can be seen in areas such as the pay gap and levels of domestic and sexual violence, which I have highlighted as priority areas for action.</p>

But understanding more about the inequalities and discrimination facing men is important to achieving gender equality and for that reason, Ministers for Women are hosting a round table in December on this subject, to raise awareness of, and gain a better understanding of the specific challenges and barriers facing men. The event will inform thinking on ways that both sexes, working together, can improve the balance of work and family life to, and to better understand attitudes towards sexual exploitation and violence.</p>

 Since its introduction the value of the winter fuel payment has increased substantially. When it was introduced&#151;for the winter of 1997-98&#151;every household with someone over state pension age who was receiving certain qualifying benefits got a payment of &#163;20 to help with their winter fuel costs. Now, households including someone age 60 to 79 are entitled to a payment of &#163;200. With households including someone aged 80 or over entitled to &#163;300. This represents a significant contribution to the costs of winter fuel for older people, and should re-assure them that they can afford to keep warm through the winter months.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 November 2007]:</i> National Statistics published on the HMRC website show that around 23,000 claims have been made for R&amp;D tax credits in the first five years of the scheme. These claims have been made by a total of just under 12,000 companies, reflecting the fact that companies can make numerous claims.</p>

 Under the HM Treasury Efficiency Note of December 2006 the Statistics Commission agreed to budget within "flat cash" grant funding through to 2007-08.

This relocation saved &#163;487,000 on accommodation costs over the period 2005-06 to 2007-08 in cash terms, and new contractual arrangements saved a further &#163;30,000, which was redistributed to staffing and research.</p>

 The registration scheme for Traditional Herbal Medicines was introduced in 2005 and the industry was fully consulted on how the scheme would work. The Department appreciates that for many companies moving from what was, for the main part, an unregulated environment into one where systematic standards need to be met does present significant challenges.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="71119w0033.htm_para0"><a name="07112030000411">The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has therefore sought to minimise the impact as far as possible by, for example, making full use of the permitted transitional period, until 2011, for products that were legally on the market in April 2004. This allows companies time to prepare to meet the new requirements. In addition, the MHRA continues to have extensive discussions with the industry&#146;s herbal forum about the practical arrangements for implementing the directive, and has taken a wide range of practical measures to contain regulatory impact.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_335"><a name="71119w0033.htm_para1"><a name="07112030000412">The MHRA is a trading fund and is fully funded by fees for its medicines regulatory work. It monitors costs against fees charged and reviews its fee levels annually. Fees are set, in accordance with Treasury guidelines, with a view to achieving cost recovery for each activity for which it sets a charge.</p>

<notus-date day="19" month="11" year="2007" textMonth="Nov"></notus-date><b>19 Nov 2007 : Column 607W</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_336"><a name="71119w0033.htm_para2"><a name="07112030000413">The agency published a consultation document (MIX 344) on 17 October proposing changes to the fees it charges in relation to the regulation of human medicines, including traditional herbal medicines, to take effect from 1 April 2008. Full details of all fees in relation to traditional herbal medicines are included in this letter. The MHRA also has provisions for easements of payment of certain capital fees by smaller companies. The consultation letter and details of provisions for smaller companies are available on its website:</p>
<a name="71119w0033.htm_brev0"><a name="07112030001362"><ul><p class="tabletext">www.mhra.gov.uk.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_337"><a name="71119w0033.htm_para3"><a name="07112030000414">The consultation letter includes a draft impact assessment relating to the whole package of fees changes proposed in the letter. The letter also specifically invites smaller companies to respond to the MHRA with details of the effects the proposals will have on their company. The consultation runs until 9 January 2008. The MHRA would particularly welcome responses from traditional herbal medicines companies to complete the impact assessment more fully.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="71119w0033.htm_para4"><a name="07112030000415">Individual fees for the herbal medicines registration scheme, for applications and inspections, were subject to full consultation before they were set in 2005. The fees were based on an estimate of the amount of time it would take to undertake each of the activities and the costs of the relevant staff that would be required to undertake those activities. Applications that are more complex take longer to assess and can require staff with more experience to undertake the work. These costs are reflected in the fee charged. The proposed fee of &#163;7,480 for processing applications for registration of complex herbal products containing two or more ingredients not previously assessed by the agency reflects the additional work that would be necessary when assessing ingredients for the first time. The MHRA, however, anticipates that only a minority of applications will fall into this category.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_339"><a name="71119w0033.htm_para5"><a name="07112030000416">In setting its fees each year, the agency targets specific changes to fees according to the outcome of a rigorous costing model. The costing model is informed by anticipated unavoidable costs for the agency for the coming year as well as by performance and specific costs in each area of the agency&#146;s work. The fees for inspections for traditional herbal products are proposed to be increased by 9.7 per cent. for 2008-09 in line with the outcome from the costing exercise undertaken this year. Other fees in other areas of the agency&#146;s work are proposed to change by different amounts all with the intention of recovering full costs for those areas of work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="71119w0033.htm_para6"><a name="07112030000417">Inspections of herbal manufacturers are expected to take place when the application for the manufacturing licence is made and thereafter at least every three years. Based on experience with the scheme so far, the MHRA estimates that 10 inspections of this type might take place in 2008-09. MHRA is currently consulting on proposals for a risk-based inspection strategy which is intended to reduce the regulatory burden of inspections for compliant companies.</p>

 1. Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality.<br>
 PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data. The SHA's used to define &#145;Greater London&#146; were:<br>

 3. Assessing growth through time<br>
 HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
 4. Finished admission episodes<br>
 A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

1. The total contract value represents the estimated nominal value at the time of signing, calculated in accordance with an estimate of the inflation index as specified in each contract.<br>
2. The contracted activity is indicative only and can vary significantly from actual activity through substitution of higher or lower value procedures across the contract term.<br>
3. Utilisation represents the percentage value of the contract which has been utilised from contract commencement to the end of September 2007-08.<br>
4. Utilisation percentage may change following contract reconciliation which occurs at the end of each contract quarter and year.<br>
5. All information provided has been based on the most up to date information at the time of submission.<br>
6. The specialties are referenced to HRG chapter. &#147;General Surgery&#148; includes HRG chapters E, G, J, K, P, Q and S. HRG information is available at www.ic.nhs.uk/casemix<br>
7. This information is expected to be updated on a quarterly basis.<br>
8. The Department works with sponsors and providers to ensure optimum utilisation of the contracts. This includes changing the case mix to respond to local need and working with providers and primary care trusts to recover previous under-utilised activity where possible.<br>
In addition to the work we are doing across all ISTCs to improve utilisation we are also taking the following action:<br>
Bodmin NHS Treatment Centre<br>
The strategic health authority (SHA) and the Department of Health (DH) are working closely to ensure Royal Cornwall Trust transfer waiting list patients to the ISTC to achieve an 18 week wait.<br>
DH is agreeing a contract change to allow the ISTC to treat patients needing diagnostic endoscopies to achieve a two week wait in cancer referrals.<br>
The provider (Capio) is targeting GPs with a marketing campaign to improve direct referrals.<br>

 Hospital Episode Statistics (HES)<br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) can only provide counts for &#147;time waited&#148; for all finished admissions within a given period. It is important to note that HES &#147;time waited&#148; figures are different to published waiting list statistics which count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. This elapsed time does not include any wait for referral to a hospital consultant. The data provided is only for elective admissions into hospital for the selected operation from a waiting list or booked elective admissions. The attached results excludes planned elective admissions and unlike published waiting list statistics are not adjusted for self-deferrals (e.g. if a patient deferred an operation as they were on holiday) or periods of medical/social suspension (please see footnotes for definitions of elective admissions from a waiting list, elective booked admissions and planned elective admissions). Note that finished admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

<i> Data Quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Department liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Elective admissions</i><br>
An admission is elective if the patient has been waiting for treatment. There are three types of elective admissions. The above time waited data excludes planned elective admissions:<br>
<i> Elective admissions from a waiting list</i><br>
Most elective admissions are from a waiting list, where the patient has been waiting for a hospital resource e.g. in this case a knee operation or hysterectomy.<br>
<i> Elective booked admissions</i><br>
An increasing number of elective admissions are booked, where the patient was given a date at the time the decision to admit was made, determined mainly on the grounds of resource availability.<br>
<i> Planned elective admissions</i><br>
A smaller group waits for clinical reasons, where the consultant has advised that the patient should return at an appropriate point when the body has had time for nature to take its course. For example, a patient whose broken leg was mended by means of a steel pin would return to hospital a few weeks later to have a pin removed. Or a cancer sufferer is invited for radiotherapy treatment in a sequence of measured doses, with necessary gaps between sessions for recovery and stabilisation.<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Main Operation</i><br>
The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg. time waited, but the figures for &#147;all operations count of episodes&#148; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>
<i> Time Waited</i><br>
Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time some shortcomings remain.<br>
 2. Assessing growth through time<br>
 HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
 3. FCE<br>
 An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
 4. Specialty<br>
 Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as Acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information. Trusts may change the way they manage speciality codes through time. Speciality code 420&#151;For the period 2001/02 no data was received from the trust for this speciality. This has been investigated with the trust but no conclusive cause has been found.<br>
 5. Ungrossed Data<br>
 Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
 6. Low Numbers<br>
 Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with an &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional smallest number have been suppressed in order to protect.<br>

 Under their funding agreements, academies are entitled to two types of start-up grant. Both are payable in the first year of operation, but may continue at a lower rate in subsequent years depending on the speed at which the academy concerned builds up towards its full capacity.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_365"><a name="71119w0037.htm_para7"><a name="07112057000058">The first type of start-up grant is for books, materials, software and educational equipment. It is calculated on a formulaic basis for all academies and the amount payable depends mainly on pupil numbers, although the rates used vary slightly according to whether there is a predecessor school, and whether the academy has a sixth form. The first academic year's allocation is paid in three monthly instalments, from September to November. Subsequent years&#146; grants, if payable at all, are always at a significantly lower level.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="71119w0037.htm_para8"><a name="07112057000059">The second type of grant has two elements. One is intended to compensate for the diseconomies of scale incurred on senior and middle management costs while an academy is still significantly below capacity. It is payable until the academy is 90 per cent. full. Up to the academic year 2007/08 it has been paid following assessment of bids, but from 2008/09 will be paid on a formulaic basis derived from the size of the academy. The other element is normally payable only in the first year and relates to transitional costs such as senior staff training and other costs arising from conversion. Academies bid for most of these although, again, for certain items a formulaic approach will be used from 2008/09.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 15 November 2007]:</i><i> </i>We want all schools to become Sustainable Schools by 2020. The Sustainable Schools Framework and self evaluation tool have been designed, following wide consultation, to help senior managers, teachers and pupils adopt a whole school approach so that schools&#146; commitment to sustainability is demonstrated by the way the buildings and grounds are managed, its relationships with the local community and through the curriculum. To become sustainable, schools need to develop their own expertise, drawing on external support where they identify it is needed.</p>

 Pupil performance and well-being go hand in hand, and doing well in education is the most effective route for young people out of poverty and disaffection. We introduced the Every Child Matters agenda to give every child the best start in life so they realise their potential because this is crucial to every child's life chances and to society's well-being. Educational attainment is at the very heart of Every Child Matters. It is a key priority which goes hand in hand with a child's well-being.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="71119w0038.htm_para2"><a name="07112057000245">We know that there are benefits to the individual, the country and society from the attainment of qualifications. Individuals who achieve a level 2 qualification, equivalent to five or more GCSEs at A*-C, earn on average around &#163;100,000 more over their lifetime than those who leave learning with qualifications below level 2. In addition to higher wages, better qualified individuals enjoy improved employment prospects, are more likely to get promoted and undertake further learning in the future. There are also wider benefits such as better health and improved social skills. Higher skill levels lead to increased productivity for businesses and those who achieve qualifications are less likely to experience teenage pregnancy, be involved in crime or behave antisocially. That is why, by 2010-11, we expect 82 per cent. of 19 year-olds to achieve a level 2 qualification.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_374"><a name="71119w0038.htm_para3"><a name="07112057000246">We know too that approximately 75 per cent. of young people who have had a positive experience at school, and have achieved level 2 by the age of 16, go on to attain level 3 qualifications. And, of those young people who obtain 5 A*-C GCSEs in year 11, approximately 52 per cent. go on to degree level study. We want more young people to gain higher level skills and have the opportunity to progress to higher education if they want to. To help deliver this ambition we have set a target of 54 per cent. of 19 year-olds to achieve a level 3 qualification by 2010-11 in CSR07.</p>

 Where parents fulfil the qualifying criteria, local authorities or school governing bodies have a duty to provide free school meals to children who are registered pupils at schools.

1. Price Base: Real terms at 2006-07 prices, based on GDP deflators as at 26 September 2007.<br>
2. Figures reflect relevant sub-blocks of education formula spending (EFS) settlements and include the pensions transfer to EFS and the Learning and Skills Council.<br>
3. Total funding also includes all revenue grants in DfES departmental expenditure limits relevant to pupils aged three to 19 and exclude education maintenance allowances (EMAs) and grants not allocated at LEA level.<br>
4. The pupil numbers used to convert &#163; million figures to &#163; per pupil are those underlying the EFS settlement calculations.<br>
5. Isles of Scilly have been excluded due to small numbers.<br>
6. Where underlying values are equal, authorities are given the same rank value.<br>

 The Prime Minister referred to Interim Executive Boards (IEBs) in his speech on 31 October. These were introduced in the Education Act 2002. A local authority (LA) can apply to the Secretary of State for permission, temporarily to replace the governing body of a school which has been placed in the Ofsted categories of special measures or significant improvement; or which has not responded satisfactorily to a formal local authority warning notice under section 60 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006.

 The Prime Minister&#146;s announcement on 4 September referred to the establishment of federations between high-performing schools and those in need of educational improvement. This initiative does not involve the takeover of any school, but will retain the separate identities of the schools concerned, while facilitating closer partnership working and the exchange of expertise and experience. Discussions are currently taking place to confirm the schools which will take part in the initiative and we expect to make an announcement in the new year.</p>

The independent school can become the lead sponsor, taking on full responsibility for setting up and running a new academy or it may choose to become a co-sponsor, providing significant support through transfer of educational expertise, but looking to other sponsors to lead on other aspects of the school&#146;s development. Following a recent policy change, successful independent schools are not required to provide a cash endowment when sponsoring an academy. For successful independent day schools that want to serve their whole local community and broaden their pupil intake, there is the opportunity to become academies&#151;maintaining the benefits of their autonomy, ethos and leadership, but ceasing to charge fees.</p>

 The Specialist Schools Programme is a universal offer open to all maintained secondary schools in England which meet the required standard. Over 86 per cent. of schools are now specialist and many are based in and around areas of social deprivation. The Department&#146;s CVA research uses detailed data about individual pupils taking into account factors like gender, ethnicity and deprivation and maps pupils&#146; prior attainment at primary school on to their eventual results at GCSE level. This allows us to calculate that, on average, individual pupils (regardless of their social background) make good progress at specialist schools. Specialist status is linked to higher results at GCSE whether this is on the 5+A*-C measure, VA or CVA, which is why we continue to invest some &#163;422 million a year in specialist school funding.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="71119w0041.htm_para1"><a name="07112057001172">Specialist schools benefit from external sponsors, links with their community and an achievement ethos. They are focused on whole-school improvement through their specialism, backed up by challenging targets and partnerships with other schools.

 The minimum qualifications for those entering teacher training were reviewed in 2006 and were reflected in revisions to the Secretary of State's Requirements for Initial Teacher Training which have operated since September 2007 and can be found at http://www.tda.gov.uk/partners/ittstandards.aspx?keywords=requirements+for+itt.

Information that is held centrally at qualification levels of people beginning undergraduate and postgraduate initial teacher training are given at Annexes A and B. No data is held centrally on the GCSE subjects and grades of entrants for the same reason, but all must have reached the required minimum of grade C or equivalent to be accepted.</p>

 The estimate that around one per cent of 16 to 18 year-olds are long-term not in education, employment or training comes from the Youth Cohort Study. This study first contacts young people in the spring after they have finished compulsory education and collects information on their activities. Follow up studies are conducted at annual intervals, typically for a further three years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_410"><a name="71119w0043.htm_para2"><a name="07112057002102">The estimate of one per cent. comes from the proportion of young people who report being not in education, employment or training at each of the first three surveys, at academic age 16, 17 and 18. Because the Youth Cohort Study only measures activity at snapshots in time, it is possible that some of the one per cent. may be involved in some education, employment or training in the times in between surveys. The estimate of one per cent. is consistent for the cohort that took GCSEs in 2001 and the cohort that took GCSEs in 2003.</p>
