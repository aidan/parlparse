<P>
<a name="80116w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 December 1997]:</i> The impact on retirement income of capping ISAs at &#163;50,000 will depend on the way in which people decide to invest the balance of their investments and their other sources of income.

 Legislation exists to enable public service schemes to forfeit the pension rights of public servants who are convicted of serious offences committed in connection with their employment, or for treason or offences under the Official Secrets Act. Schemes may also

have rules or regulations, or rely upon DSS regulations, to use pension rights to recover moneys owed to the employer.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80116w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The table shows what progress has been made in the period up to the end of December 1997 by the 41 firms I have been monitoring. Since November, most of these firms have made continuing progress, and between them the firms concerned have now resolved over half of the cases identified for review.
<P>

<a name="80116w01.html_para1">For 29 of these firms, the Personal Investment Authority (PIA) set a deadline of 31 December for 90 per cent. of the most urgent cases to be resolved. It made clear that failure to take all reasonable steps to meet the deadline would be grounds for disciplinary action. The PIA announced today that the initial indications are that while most the firms concerned had indeed made their best endeavours to meet this first deadline, five appear to have failed to do so. It also announced its intention to make further investigations to see what further action is warranted.
<P>

<a name="80116w01.html_para2">The first deadline has now passed and most of the large firms appear to have met it. Those who have not must face the consequences. The PIA is considering what the consequences should be. The 41 firms still have a huge task ahead of them: none of them have yet resolved all their priority cases. For most firms, including the many that are not included in the table, a deadline of 31 December 1998 has been set for completion of this task--for some firms it is as early as 30 April 1998. There will be no let up--from the Government or from the regulators--until it has been achieved, and I will continue to monitor progress month by month.




<P>
<P><I>16 Jan 1998 : Column: 319</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80116w01.html_para3">These deadlines must be met fairly and effectively. The regulators will be monitoring firms' case processing to see that there is no cutting of corners at investors'

expense. Failure to conduct the reviews properly is as serious an omission as failure to process cases quickly.

In addition, the Lottery Sports Fund School Community Sports Initiative is designed to help schools find matching funding, including private sector investment, having already supported 24 projects with awards totalling over &#163;10 million.

(1)Drop-out covers all those leaving degree courses because of exam failure, ill health, personal and other reasons. It includes those switching to a lower level course but it excludes students transferring between degree courses or subjects. The rate for each academic year reflects the progression of students through the whole length of the course. The rate is a weighted sum of the separate university and former polytechnic figures based upon graduate numbers. It therefore excludes first degree students in other UK HE institutions. The calculation for the polytechnic drop-out rate is necessarily approximate because of significant limitations in the underlying data. In practice it has been necessary to estimate drop-out in 1991-92 to 1994-95 from the change in two successive years for a sample of around half of the 29 English former polytechnics.<P>

(2)A range is given because the introduction of a new data source has made it difficult to measure drop-out accurately.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland in what respect the implementation of the best value regime is intended to lead to more responsibility being devolved to local authorities in Northern Ireland. [22777]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80116w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The question of greater responsibilities for local authorities will be a matter for consideration as part of the current political talks process. The introduction of a Best Value regime for District Council services in Northern Ireland will encourage greater local accountability by giving District Councils greater flexibility in determining how best to achieve increased efficiency and improve quality of service. To ensure that local government is involved in developing Best Value proposals, a Consultation Paper was published on 10 December 1997 with a closing date of 5 February 1998. A copy of the Paper has been placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80116w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The Government are currently in the process of consulting all interested parties on their proposals for a Best Value regime for District Council services in Northern Ireland. It will be a matter for each District Council to decide how to respond to the challenge of Best Value, and so it is not possible to estimate future costs at present.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80116w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 While district councils in Northern Ireland continue to explore new options for waste management, none has undertaken a detailed study of the development of waste incineration plants, nor has the Department of the Environment for Northern Ireland established any co-ordinating facility to encourage and assist such developments. The Government are currently formulating proposals for a Northern Ireland Waste Management Strategy which will address the issue of how incineration should contribute to the overall management of waste. The Department is considering applications from two companies--NIGEN Ltd. and Belfast Waste Services Ltd.--for planning permission to develop municipal waste incinerators in the Belfast harbour area.

 Measures are already in place to deal with the problem of unsolicited faxes.

Customers who have a fax machine in their residential premises may register for inclusion in a database against which companies selling via fax "clean" their mailing lists. In addition, under the Telecommunications Act 1984, UK companies using fax marketing are subject to a class licence which contains measures aimed at limiting the nuisance which can be caused by unsolicited faxes. Anyone sending unsolicited faxes must cease doing so to any particular person on receipt of a written request from them, or face possible enforcement action, including the removal of their right to operate a telecoms system, by Oftel.

 The Department has established a Year 2000 Programme led by the Information Technology Services Agency (ITSA) to co-ordinate the extensive activity across the Department. The Departmental Board, chaired by the Permanent Secretary, is receiving regular reports on progress. An ITSA Director (a senior civil servant) leads the work, reporting to the ITSA Chief Executive who chairs the Project Steering Group. There is a Programme Manager (Unified Grade 6) and a core team of five staff (two SEOs, one HEO and two EOs).

<a name="80116w07.html_para1">As part of this programme, there are, in addition, a network of Year 2000 teams across all areas of the Department working towards compliance. For some staff Year 2000 is a specific responsibility; for many others it is a priority activity within their normal work area.

 Combating violence against women is a key priority for the Ministers for Women and we are working closely with colleagues across Government, with women's organisations and through the Cabinet sub-Committee on Women's Issues, to reduce the level of violence against women. We are working with the Home Office, which has lead responsibility for developing policies to tackle domestic violence, in promoting strategies which combine prevention of violence with support for those who have already been subjected to violence.
<P>

<a name="80116w08.html_para0">The Government's commitment is demonstrated by a wide range of initiatives already underway. The Home Office has set up an inter-departmental review to identify measures to protect vulnerable or intimidated witnesses and to assist them to give evidence in court. The Lord Chancellor's Department's implementation of Part IV of the Family Law Act 1996 affords further protection for women and children, by providing civil remedies to victims of domestic violence. The Department of Health plays a vital role in encouraging inter-agency forums to improve local service co-ordination to influence public attitudes and offer support and relevant information for those who experience domestic violence.

 Iraq continues to obstruct the work of the United Nations Special Commission whose purpose is to ensure that Iraq cannot again threaten its neighbours with weapons of mass destruction. The United Nations Security Council has repeatedly made clear that Iraq must co-operate fully and unreservedly with UNSCOM and comply with relevant Security Council Resolutions. The United Kingdom is working with other members of the Security Council to secure Iraq's co-operation through diplomatic means. But, if these efforts fail, we may need to consider other measures, including the use of force. As a contingency, HMS INVINCIBLE, accompanied by the Royal Fleet Auxiliary FORT VICTORIA, will therefore sail to the Gulf to join other UK forces and those of our allies already operating in the region.

 Of the ten major water and sewerage companies, two have suspended the use of ribbed thin wall plastic piping and a third has placed a temporary restriction on its use. The remaining seven companies allow a range of pipe materials for sewerage installations. Choice of pipe material depends on a number of factors including relevant site conditions.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate his Department has made of the growth of the urban fox population in the United Kingdom over the last 30 years. [22820]
<P>

<P>
<a name="80116w10.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Reliable data are not available before 1980. Since 1980, detailed population surveys were undertaken in nine English towns and form the results of these surveys the predicted urban fox population in 1994 was estimated at 33,000, made up of 30,000 for England, 2,900 for Scotland and 100 for Wales.
<P>

<a name="80116w10.html_para1">A study in 1987 showed that urban foxes tend to be self-regulating, and it also indicated that they have little effect on rural populations, with low net emigration. Recently, the decline in reported sightings suggests that the number of urban foxes has fallen in some cities.

<a name="80116w10.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the public health risks which arise from urban fox populations. [22822]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80116w10.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 There are very few health risks resulting from urban fox populations, and there is very little cause for concern.
<P>

<a name="80116w10.html_para2">Foxes in theory could transmit certain infections, such as toxocariasis, hydatid disease or pasteurellosis to man. However, from the limited data available, it is evident that foxes have not been implicated in any cases of these diseases among humans.

On this basis it is estimated that an HGV driver could be stopped between 4 or 5 time over a 5-year period by the Inspectorate.

 The institutions required for delivering an integrated transport policy are being considered carefully and we shall be setting out our policies in the White Paper due to be published later this year. The specific proposals for restructuring transport in London under a Greater London Authority (GLA) will take this work into account. They will be set out in the GLA White Paper which we intend to publish in March.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what is his policy on the creation of a fast track procedure for certain types of civil cases; and what plans he has to modify the burden of proof which is carried by the plaintiff. [22359]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80116w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor's Department issued a working paper on judicial case management in July 1997, which included proposals for a fast track procedure. A further paper was published at the end of November proposing a limit of &#163;15,000 for fast track cases. It is planned to implement the fast track in April 1999 as part of the Lord Chancellor's Civil Justice Reforms. There are no current plans to change the existing requirements of the burden of proof as they relate to the plaintiff in a civil legal action.

<P>
<a name="80116w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I am very aware of the concerns expressed about the implications of the fast track fixed costs proposals. In considering the future of a fixed costs scheme, a balance needs to be achieved between the desirable aims of making litigation more certain and affordable, with the need to allow parties to litigate on equal terms. Any system introduced will take account of these factors.

Given that such a major inspection has been conducted relatively recently, there are no current plans to mount a further review in the near future.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80116w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 There is at present no evidence to suggest that screening all women aged 30 to 40 would be effective in reducing mortality from breast cancer, and the Government have no current plans to introduce screening for this age group. However, we are currently funding research into the effectiveness of screening women aged 40 to 50. Any decision to introduce screening for this age group will need to be based on the outcome of this research.
<P>

<a name="80116w13.html_para0">The National Health Service Breast Screening Programme was set up in 1988 and invites all women aged between 50 and 64 for screening every three years, with screening for older women available three yearly on request. The Government are funding research into changes which might improve the quality of the service to women, including reducing the screening interval, taking two mammographic views of the breast at all screening rounds, and routinely inviting women aged 65 to 69 for screening.

 Her Majesty's Customs and Excise issued a News Release on 13 August 1997 regarding the Government's intention to bring forward legislation to clarify the law on the Value Added Tax treatment of drugs and medical appliances. They copied this to the National Health Service Executive on the same day. HM Customs and Excise subsequently, during September, notified the NHS of the Government's intention.

 The sale of Stretton Hall Hospital in Leicestershire is being managed by the Trent Regional Office of the National Health Service Executive. Outline planning consent has been obtained involving 100 new dwellings, and a sale has been agreed subject to obtaining detailed planning consent. The purchaser will have to comply with all planning legislation affecting the development.
<P>

<a name="80116w13.html_para1">Health authorities lost Crown immunity in 1991. On the abolition of regional health authorities in 1996, some property, which has since been managed by the NHS Executive, regained Crown immunity. This currently applies to Stretton Hall Hospital, pending its sale. However, it is not the Department's policy to take advantage of this situation. NHS Estates, an agency of the Department of Health, with English Heritage have produced guidance which is expected to be followed by all regional offices of the NHS Executive in respect of the care and disposal of historic buildings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health when he wrote to suppliers to the NHS reminding them of the necessity for all equipment to be millennium compliant; and if he will place a copy of the letter in the Library and list the names of suppliers he has sent it to and the date it was sent. [23645]

 The Medical Devices Agency wrote in 1996, and again in 1997, to the main United Kingdom trade associations concerned with medical devices. This has been followed up with a letter to many individual manufacturers. The National Health Service Supplies Authority are in the process of writing to approximately 4,000 supplier organisations with whom the NHS has a national contract. The letter will be sent by 31 January 1998.

<a name="80116w13.html_para3">The NHS Executive wrote in October 1997 to 30 leading suppliers of Information Systems to the acute and community trusts and the main suppliers of general practitioner systems. Copies of letters and addressees will be placed in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many officials, and at what grade, are working on millennium compliance issues. [23641]

<P>
<a name="80116w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The Department of Health, including its agencies, currently employs a total of 44 full time equivalent members of staff of various grades on Year 2000 related work. The Year 2000 programme within the Department of Health is co-ordinated by the head of the Applications Development and Support branch, who reports to the senior Departmental information technology steering committee.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what resources are being made available to the NHS's Adverse Incident Centre to deal with any failures to systems through millennium compliance failures. [23638]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80116w13.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Medical Devices Agency expects the majority of medical devices to be millennium compliant already. Therefore the number of adverse incidents involving millennium compliance failures is likely to be low. As the number of reports involving millennium compliance failures is expected to be a small fraction of the total number of adverse incident reports, we see no need to allocate extra resources to the Adverse Incident Centre to deal specifically with millennium compliance failures.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many new medical schools he anticipates will be required to implement the recommendations of the Medical Workforce Standing Advisory Committee. [23174]

<a name="80116w13.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 One of the main recommendations in the Third Report of the Medical Workforce Standing Advisory Committee (MWSAC) is a 20 per cent. increase in the annual intake to United Kingdom medical schools. This recommendation has very significant implications, and needs careful examination. The Government will announce their decisions on all of MWSAC's recommendations in a few months' time, in the light of the Government's Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR).

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what is his Department's policy towards the recommendations of the Medical Workforce Standing Advisory Committee. [23175]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80116w13.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The Medical Workforce Standing Advisory Committee's (MWSAC) main recommendations are for the annual intake to United Kingdom medical schools to increase by 1,000, a 20 per cent. increase over the target of 4,970 for the year 2000, together with a range of measures to improve the recruitment and retention of doctors.
<P>

<a name="80116w13.html_para4">A number of MWSAC's recommendations chime with the Government's own thinking and should be welcomed. But the recommendation on increased medical school intake has very significant implications, and will need careful examination.

<a name="80116w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 On 1 January we announced a further &#163;10 million to continue the Government's drive to improve access to National Health Service dentistry and tackle oral health inequalities through our Investing in Dentistry initiative. This focuses help on those areas of the country where these problems are most acute, by providing grants to enable dentists to expand existing practices and set up new ones.
