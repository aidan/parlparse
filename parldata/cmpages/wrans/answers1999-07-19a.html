The new contract will run from 1 September for a period of three years, although it is extendable for a further two years. Enhancements to the existing services provided have been insisted upon; for example, Eurostar tickets will be available on-site from this autumn, following the installation of a ticket machine. In addition, American Express travel consultants will, wherever

 The millennium bug was discussed at the G8 Summit in Cologne. It was noted that there had been real progress since the 1998 Birmingham Summit in tackling the millennium bug, but that some countries still had a lot of preparation to do. This was reflected in the strong language of the Communique. G8 countries agreed to maintain vigorous programmes of action and urged all other Governments to do the same. The Communique also highlighted the importance of contingency planning to cope with potential system failures. The G8 will maintain close co-operation among members and with others. A special G8 Conference on contingency planning will take place in the autumn.

<P>

<a name="90719w02.htm_para8">The Vehicle Inspectorate employs testers to carry out statutory annual tests on heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), passenger service vehicles (PSVs) and some light goods vehicles (LGVs). This is a demand-led activity. Vehicle examiners (VEs) carry out enforcement inspections on all types of vehicles to check their mechanical condition and traffic examiners (TEs) check compliance with traffic regulations including weighing and tachograph charts. The Inspectorate's performance measures have, during the period covered, increasingly encouraged examiners to target those vehicles which are considered most likely to be committing offences. This has increased the effectiveness of the checks in terms of road safety and environmental protection.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the effect the A6 bus lane at Loughborough has had on journey times for <i>(a)</i> buses and <i>(b)</i> other road traffic in its first three months.  [90502]<P>

 I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency to write to my hon. Friend.

<a name="90719w03.htm_para0"><i>Letter from Lawrie Haynes to Mr. Andrew Reed, dated 19 July 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, Glenda Jackson, has asked me to reply to your recent question about the effect the A6 bus lane in Loughborough has had on journey times for buses and other road traffic in its first three months of operation.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The bus lane between Quorn and Loughborough opened on 1st March. It operates during peak hours between 7.30 and 9.30am and 3.30 and 6.00pm on Mondays to Saturdays. Before and after surveys have been undertaken to measure queue lengths, traffic flows and delays. A full analysis of the changes is still awaited from our managing agent for the A6, but general trends can already be identified.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Bus journey time reliability has increased by 50% on most journeys in the morning peak and the journey time between Quorn and Loughborough has been reduced by up to 7 minutes on a 15 minutes minimum journey.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The effects on journey times for other traffic are less clear and data is still being assessed but initial indications are that overall journey times have not increased. In addition, there appears to have been an improvement in general traffic flow into Loughborough during the morning peak; a 20% increase in vehicle throughout has been achieved between 8am and 9am. It is considered that this is due to the more ordered nature of the queue towards the A6/Shelthorpe Road traffic signals.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A full report on the A6 Quorn to Loughborough bus lane is being prepared and will be available shortly and I will ensure that you receive a copy. In the meantime, if you wish to discuss any aspect further, the Highways Agency's Route Manager for this A6 scheme is Peter Adams. He can be contacted at our office at Broadway, Broad Street, Birmingham, B15 1BL, or by telephone on 0121 678 8215.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="90719w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 In September 1998 the central core of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions commissioned diversity consultants Pearn Kandola to conduct an independent evaluation of the Performance Management and Appraisal System. This work involved an analysis of performance and promotion markings of grades below the Senior Civil Service by gender; ethnic origin; disability, and part-time/full-time status. A copy of the report is available in the Library.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>During 1997, the Highways Agency audited its previous appraisal system to ensure that it was fair regardless of gender, ethnicity and disability. In 1998 the Institute of Employment Studies were commissioned to produce a report as a result of the review on the introduction of the new appraisal system. Analysis included distribution of performance markings by gender and ethnicity. In the same year, the pay and reward team conducted an audit of performance pay and bonuses which included data on gender, ethnicity and disability.

 Our proposals for new rewarding roles for councillors and for addressing some of the potential disincentives to serve on councils, as set out in our White Paper: "Modern Local Government--In Touch with the People" (Cm 4014), will we believe encourage more people to stand for election to their local authorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w04.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My Department does not estimate the number of new homes to be built. Estimates of housing requirements are derived in Regional Planning Guidance following public examination.
<P>

<a name="90719w04.htm_para0">The Government's target is to provide 60 per cent. of new homes on previously developed land or by conversion of existing buildings. They have asked Regional Planning Bodies and local planning authorities to set their own recycling targets consistent with delivery of the national target. To assist in this process, my Department has established the first phase of the National Land Use Database to provide a comprehensive assessment of previously developed vacant and derelict land, and other developed land that may be available for recycling.

 Over 600 responses have been received to the consultation draft of Planning Policy Guidance note 3 on Housing, which are now being analysed. I expect to issue the final version after the recess. In the meantime, the draft PPG3 can be cited as a material consideration in determining planning applications although it will have full effect only when the final version has been published.

 Post Bus services are principally an operational matter for the Post Office. We recognise, however, that such services can provide important transport links for people in rural areas, and the Countryside Agency provides grants from the Rural Transport Development Fund towards the costs of starting up new Post Bus services in rural areas of England.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w04.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Our estimate of the additional costs of introducing in England our proposed minimum standard for concessionary bus fares for pensioners is approximately &#163;25 million a year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the half-fare concessions scheme for pensioners will apply to forms of local passenger transport other than buses.  [91410]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w04.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Our proposal for a national minimum half-fare scheme for pensioners applies only to bus travel. It will remain open to local authorities to provide concessionary travel on other forms of local transport if they judge it right to do so in the light of their local policies and circumstances.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w04.htm_spnew10"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Ensuring that they have sufficient drivers to provide their services is primarily a matter for individual bus companies. We recognise however that there have been driver recruitment and retention difficulties in some areas and are discussing the issues involved with the industry and the relevant agencies.
<P>

<a name="90719w04.htm_para2">As stated in our policy document "From Workhorse to Thoroughbred: A Better Role for Bus Travel", we recognise the importance of driving standards and training. We intend to improve driving standards by

<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w05.htm_spnew0"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Quality Contracts for buses require primary legislation. As we said in our consultation document "From Workhorse to Thoroughbred--A Better Role for Bus Travel", we expect to give a very limited number of approvals initially to allow the Quality Contract approach to be tested. The broad criteria were set out in that document.

<P>

<a name="90719w06.htm_para1"><P>

<a name="90719w06.htm_para2">Any serious faults in electrical wiring that occurred during aircraft operations would normally be detected because they are accompanied by system faults and warnings. In such cases, investigations will be made specifically directed at the relevant wiring. Individual electrical circuits are protected by automatic current limiting devices designed to isolate the associated circuit in the event of a current overload.

 The Commissioners do not invest in companies whose main business is the manufacture of armaments. The Commissioners' main investments in defence-related companies are presently in GEC and GKN. In addition, some of the companies in which the Commissioners hold shares may have small defence-related interests, ranging from electrical and electronic systems to engineering components, but these companies would not be described as military and certainly cannot be classified as armaments.

Now that the funding for the Faith Zone at the Dome is secure, I hope my hon.

I understand from the Churches' Millennium Office that they are very encouraged by the level of activity in churches up and down the country.

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 1999]:</i> The Department conducts or commissions market or opinion research only when it is justified by the specific needs of a particular policy or programme and when this is the most economical, efficient and effective way to achieve the purpose. Consulting and involving the public helps inform both policy formulation and the delivery of better quality public services. Responsive public services are an important part of the Modernising Government initiative.

 Up to and including 12 July 1999 I had received one representation on the draft Freedom of Information Bill from an organisation concerned with health and safety. This was from the Health and Safety Commission and Health and Safety Executive (dated 7 July) and was a contribution to the public consultation exercise.

<a name="90719w08.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Garnier: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what research he has commissioned into the respective <i>(a)</i> rates of conviction, <i>(b)</i> levels of sentencing upon conviction following a plea of not guilty between (i) stipendiary and (ii) lay magistrates and <i>(c)</i> the levels of sentencing upon conviction following a plea of not guilty of (i) judges in the Crown Court, (ii) stipendiary and (iii) lay magistrates; and if he will publish it.  [91397]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w08.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Research is being commissioned jointly by the Home Office and the Lord Chancellor's Department to assess the relative costs, effectiveness and other benefits/disadvantages of stipendiary and lay magistrates. This will look, inter alia, at conviction rates and sentencing patterns, although it is unlikely that it will seek to distinguish between sentencing in contested and guilty plea cases. Some information about differences between sentencing by lay and stipendiary magistrates is to be found in "Sentencing Practice: an examination of decisions in magistrates courts and the Crown Court in the mid-1990's" by Flood-Page and Mackie (1998, Home Office Research Study No. 180), a copy of which is in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90719w08.htm_para2">Statistical data are available on the type of sentence, including length of custody, received by defendants in the Crown Court for various offence groups by type of plea. These are to be found in Table 7E of "Criminal Statistics, England and Wales 1997" (Home Office, 1998) a copy of which is in the Library. Data by plea are not yet available from magistrates courts.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w08.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Garnier: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for the last five years for which figures are available, how many defendants have elected trial by <i>(a)</i> jury and <i>(b)</i> magistrates; and what proportion of defendants charged with either way offences <i>(a)</i> and <i>(b)</i> represent.  [91395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w08.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The table shows, in respect of proceedings handled by the Crown Prosecution Service, the number of defendants charged with either way offences who elected trial by jury. These figures are also expressed as a percentage of all either way cases dealt with at the Crown Court.
<P>

<a name="90719w08.htm_para3">The table also shows the number of defendants charged with either way offences who consented to summary trial, and whose case proceeded to a contested hearing in magistrates courts. However, the Crown Prosecution Service maintains no separate record of either way proceedings dealt with in magistrates' courts by way of a guilty plea.

 We plan to bring the remaining provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 into force throughout the United Kingdom on 2 October 2000.

<a name="90719w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Since 1 May 1997, two non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), sponsored by my Department, have been disbanded--the Advisory Committee on Service Candidates (disbanded on 31 July 1998) and the Crime Prevention Agency Board (disbanded on 12 January 1999). During the next 12 months, I expect that the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board and the Metropolitan Police Committee will be disbanded.
<P>

<a name="90719w09.htm_para0">No Home Office NDPB has had its functions transferred either to another NDPB or a democratically elected body, and none has continued to perform a similar function under a different name.
<P>

<a name="90719w09.htm_para1">Details of all NDPBs in existence on 1 May 1997, sponsored by my Department, are listed in "Public Bodies 1997". Since that date, we have established as NDPBs the Police Information Technology Organisation, the Race Relations Forum, the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales, the Office of the Surveillance Commissioners and the Sentencing Advisory Panel.
<P>

<a name="90719w09.htm_para2">Although the Government are committed to keeping the number of NDPBs to a minimum and to ensuring that those which remain are open, accountable and effective, some of the new NDPBs established since 1 May are essential in helping the Government deliver their Manifesto commitments.
<P>

<a name="90719w09.htm_para3">My Department is currently responsible for 36 NDPBs, plus 134 Boards of Visitors to Penal Establishments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w09.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Government have accepted the recommendations of the joint Prison Service and NHS Executive Working Group on the future of prison health care, in particular that health care provision should be jointly planned and organised with the NHS according to formal health needs assessments. This means that complementary or alternative treatments, as is the case of other treatments, will only be made available on the recommendation of a prison doctor after he or she has taken account of an individual prisoner's health needs, and the demands upon available resources for other health services. Complementary and alternative treatments will not be given priority.
<P>

<a name="90719w09.htm_para4">In keeping with the Prison Service's duty of care, and the need to ensure that treatments being made available are safe, effective, appropriate to the custodial context and conducive to the orderly running of prisons, treatments other than acupuncture, osteopathy, chiropractic, yoga and meditation will only be made available in circumstances where a good case can be shown, following the approval of the Prison Service's director of health care.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A Court case in 1997 between the National Trust and a shellfish collector operating in Strangford Lough resulted in a judgment that this activity was a common law right and as such was not subject to control through the Trust's byelaws. Those engaged in shellfish collecting are currently seeking to have large areas at the north end of the Lough classified for the purpose of harvesting wild shellfish. This decision rests with the Eastern Group Environmental Health Committee as it relates solely to public health. At least one area has recently been classified and it is understood that harvesting of cockles with the aid of a tractor-mounted dredger will commence shortly.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>EHS has recently commissioned a literature review to determine the likely effects of mechanised cockle harvesting within Strangford Lough. This has revealed that the impact of tractor dredging on intertidal flora and fauna may depend on a number of factors, such as the time of year and the nature of the sediments. It is clear, however, that it can potentially be extremely damaging to beds of <i>Zostera</i> which are an important source of food for overwintering waterfowl within Strangford Lough.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Despite the designation of the intertidal area of the Lough as an Area of Special Scientific Interest (ASSI) and Special Protection Area (SPA), EHS cannot currently prevent the mechanical harvesting of shellfish from taking place. This is because those engaged in shellfish collecting are not lawful owners or occupiers of the foreshore but are operating under a common law right. EHS could introduce byelaws under the Habitats Regulations but this would be a lengthy process involving public consultation and would almost certainly be challenged by those intent on collecting shellfish.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Department of Agriculture also has no powers at present to regulate the gathering of shellfish from the intertidal zone in Strangford Lough. In view of recent developments, however, the Department is proposing to introduce new primary legislation as quickly as possible to enable it to regulate fisheries in the intertidal zone around the entire Northern Ireland coastline.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I trust that you will appreciate from the above that the two Departments are aware of the potential seriousness of unregulated shellfish harvesting in Strangford Lough. Neither Department, however, may be able to prevent it taking place in the short term.</FONT></UL>

 The General Dental Council has proposed that it is empowered to test and identify dentists who demonstrate a consistently poor standard of performance (but are not suspected of serious professional misconduct). We have welcomed these proposals and intend to use Section 60 of the Health Act 1999 to make the necessary amendments to the Dentists Act 1984.

 We have full confidence in the General Dental Council's handling of serious professional misconduct cases, but it has let us know that hearing these cases is making heavy demands of the six lay members on the Council.

 From 1 April everyone aged 60 and over has been eligible for free National Health Service sight tests. If this group were also made eligible for spectacle vouchers, regardless of income, the additional cost would be about &#163;100 million per annum. Hospital optical treatment is provided free of charge to all NHS patients. The annual cost of extending free dental treatment to all state pensioners is estimated at a minimum of about &#163;100 million assuming no increase in the volume of dental services provided to this age group.

 Of the non-Departmental public bodies (NDPBs) in existence on 1 May 1997: <i>(a)</i> the Advisory Committee on Design Quality in the National Health Service was abolished on 20 July 1998, the Royal Commission on Long Term Care was abolished on 1 May 1999, and the Standing Committee on Postgraduate Medical Education was abolished on 1 April 1999; <i>(b)</i> The Advisory Committee on Genetic Testing, the Human Genetics Advisory Commission and the Clinical Standards Advisory Group will be disbanded in the next 12 months. The Central Council on Education and Training for Social Work (an executive NDPB) will be abolished by 31 March 2001; <i>(c)</i> None has had their functions transferred (i) to another non-departmental public body or (ii) to a democratically elected body; and <i>(d)</i> none has been re-named.
<P>

<a name="90719w12.htm_para1">Since 1 May 1997 the following NDPBs have been established: the Royal Commission on Long Term Care of the Elderly (now abolished); and the Genetics and Insurance Committee. The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, which was a departmental committee, has been reclassified as an advisory NDPB. The Nurses', Midwives and other NHS Professions' Review Body, Doctors and Dentists Review Panel and the Pharmacists' Review Panel were inherited by the Department from the Office of Manpower and Economics during the period.

<a name="90719w12.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 This recent study claims to show that office staff who use visual display units (VDUs) experience various adverse health reactions which can be relieved by a device fitted to the VDU screen.
<P>

<a name="90719w12.htm_para3">The Government obtain advice from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) on risks to health from exposure to electromagnetic fields. NRPB's Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation evaluated in detail the health effects of working with VDUs and published a report in 1994 "Health Effects Related to the Use of Visual Display Units" (Documents of the NRPB Volume 5, No2--copies of which are available in the Library). The Advisory Group concluded that exposure to radiation resulting from the use of VDUs causes no significant health effects. In responding to this recent study NRPB have commented that since the publication of their 1994 report, no research published in peer reviewed journals has led to a change to this conclusion.

<a name="90719w12.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Tredinnick: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if, in its assessment of radiation, the National Radiological Protection Board takes account of non-thermal effects; and if he will make a statement. [91919]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w12.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 I have been advised by the National Radiological Protection Board that there is a consensus among national and international expert bodies that standards for protection of people from electromagnetic fields (EMF) should be based upon sound scientific evidence of established effects on human health. This is also the view of NRPB. For low frequencies, standards are set to prevent effects on the central nervous system and to avoid shocks. For higher frequencies they are set to prevent damage due to heating of body tissues. Concerns about other, so-called athermal effects arising from exposure to EMFs have also been raised. These include suggestions of subtle effects on cells that could affect cancer development or of influences on electrically excitable tissue that could influence the function of the brain and nervous tissue.
<P>

<a name="90719w12.htm_para4">While mindful, therefore, that some scientific data challenge the conventional assumptions upon which protection standards are based, NRPB has concluded that biological interactions resulting from such effects are neither well defined nor understood. Additionally, there is no convincing biological evidence that electromagnetic fields could cause cancer or other athermal effects. The basis for its recommendations is therefore established biological effects.

 Research into potential effects of microwaves, such as those emitted by mobile phones, is being undertaken on a worldwide basis. The Department is contributing to these international initiatives and is also supporting its own research. A programme of research and exposure assessment is being carried out at the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB). The NRPB has recently been asked to set up a working group to assess the current state of research into the use of mobile phones. The Chairman, Sir William Stewart has been appointed and the membership and terms of references will be announced shortly.

 Twenty eight per cent. of the Infantry, 47 per cent. of the RAC and 67 per cent. of the Royal Engineers are currently engaged in, or working up for, unaccompanied tours. In view of the current level of commitment of the Royal Engineers, I have decided that our plans to create a fifth engineer logistic squadron following the Strategic Defence Review, should be brought forward two years from 2002 to 2000. This enhancement to the Royal Engineers will be achieved by establishing a second Queen's Gurkha Engineer Squadron to be based at Invicta Barracks, Maidstone. The nucleus of the new squadron will be formed immediately and the squadron will be available for operational tasking towards the end of next year.

 The Security situation in Kosovo continues to improve as KFOR becomes larger and increasingly well established. While incidents such as looting and murder are still occurring, Serb and KLA compliance with their respective undertakings has been satisfactory so far. Around 700,000 refugees have returned and are vigorously rebuilding their lives. This is due in no small part to the efforts of KFOR troops who continue to do an excellent job.

<a name="90719w14.htm_para2">The Ministry of Defence is aware of the suggestion that exposure to depleted uranium (DU) is a cause of ill-health among some veterans of the 1990-91 Gulf conflict. Any Gulf veteran who is concerned that their health has been adversely affected by service during that conflict is entitled to seek a referral to the Ministry of Defence's Gulf Veterans' Medical Assessment Programme (MAP) for a full medical assessment. During assessment, the patient receives a set of standard tests. If the examining physician considers it clinically appropriate for a patient to receive tests to detect DU, these would be arranged. Between one and five people so far examined by MAP physicians, have exhibited symptoms that, in the judgment of the examining physicians, have indicated a clinical requirement for testing to detect DU, and have been tested.

 The purpose of Project Aquatrine is to allow the MOD to substantially reduce its direct involvement in the provision of water and sewerage services, which, while important is not regarded as a core activity. The underlying principle driving Project Aquatrine is the maintenance of current and future services with improved value for money. It is considered that the most effective and efficient way to deliver and support these services across our sites throughout Great Britain would be to adopt an innovative situation based on a Public Private Partnership. This approach would enable us to access external capital and commercial expertise and better manage our continuing environmental responsibilities.

<P>
<a name="90719w15.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 In line with Government policy, the Ministry of Defence is committed to keeping the number of Non-Departmental Public Bodies (NDPBs) to a minimum and to ensuring that those which remain are open, accountable and effective. MOD had 17 NDPBs on 1 May 1997. None has been disbanded, and there are no current plans for any to be disbanded in the next 12 months. The Royal College of Defence Studies Advisory Board was declassified as an NDPB in October 1998, but not disbanded. The Nuclear Weapons Safety Committee and the Nuclear Powered Warship Safety Committee merged to form the Defence Nuclear Safety Committee in November 1998. No other body has had its functions transferred or has been renamed in this period. In August 1998, the Animal Welfare Advisory Committee (a body already in existence) was classified as an advisory NDPB. In addition to the above changes, MOD has taken over as lead department for the Armed Forces Pay Review Body which was formerly listed under HM Treasury.

<a name="90719w17.htm_para5">For the financial year 1999-2000, we expect the cost of replacing vehicles to be &#163;1,795,000; of the vehicles to be replaced, 166 will be diesel fuelled and four will be petrol fuelled. For subsequent years, the decision on how much the Department plans to spend each year on vehicle replacements and, what means of fuel the replacement cars will have, will be made in light of the best environmental advice available and in accordance with our Green Transport Plan.

 <i>[pursuant to the reply, 14 July 1999, c. 265]:</i> The Government have no wish to see good food go to waste and have consistently opposed the system of paying compensation for produce withdrawn from the market, arguing that it distorts the market and encourages surpluses. The reform of the EU fruit and vegetable regime in 1996 was a step in the right direction, providing for reductions in withdrawal prices and volumes withdrawn over the first six years of the reform. The reform also encouraged greater use of free distribution to charities and other non-profit making institutions. A considerable amount of produce withdrawn in the UK has been distributed to such bodies in the past year. In

 The 57 Local Education Authorities receiving funding for three-year-olds for the autumn 1999 and spring 2000 terms have indicated that they can secure around 48,000 new free places for three year olds. From April 2000, further funding will be distributed across all Local Education Authorities. We are committed to ensuring that 66 per cent. of three year-olds have a free nursery place by 2002.

 Parents mainly exercise their right to parental choice when expressing a preference as to the school they would like for their child's education. The Government have ensured that local education authorities have a statutory duty to have regard to the principle that pupils should be educated in accordance with the wishes of their parents as far as possible.

<a name="90719w18.htm_para0">The Code of Practice on School Admissions confirms the need for: parents to be given sufficient information for informed choice; clear and objective admission arrangements; simple admission procedures with the minimum of bureaucracy; and an effective statutory right of appeal.
<P>

<a name="90719w18.htm_para1">The Greenwich judgment of 1989 has given many parents greater opportunity for choice as to their child's school. The funding we are providing to LEAs to meet our infant class size pledge for 5, 6 and 7 year olds will mean that more parents will achieve their first choice of school and will also result in 12,000 extra places at popular schools. And we have ensured, in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, that appeal panels will be visibly independent of those who took the original decision not to admit a child, giving parents greater confidence to pursue appeals.

 The average cost of an assisted place in the current academic year 1998-99 is &#163;4,145. Since the fees charged for the great majority of assisted place holders aged between 11 and 18 are similar across the age range, and almost 95 per cent. of assisted pupils are in that range, the average cost of a place to age 13 is estimated to be of a similar order to that for the scheme as a whole.

To ask the Minister for the Cabinet Office if he will list the non-departmental public bodies in existence on 1 May 1997 that <i>(a)</i> have been disbanded, indicating when they were disbanded, <i>(b)</i> will be disbanded in the next 12 months, <i>(c)</i> have had their functions transferred to (i) another non-departmental public body and (ii) a democratically elected body, <i>(d)</i> have been renamed but continue to perform a similar role and <i>(e)</i> have been unchanged; if he will indicate in <i>(c)</i>(ii) the relevant successor body; what new non-departmental public bodies have been established since 1 May 1997; and how many non-departmental public bodies his Department currently is responsible for.

<a name="90719w18.htm_spnew13"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 Since 1 May 1997, Cabinet Office Ministers have abolished three NDPBs: the Citizen's Charter Panel of Advisers; the Deregulation Task Force; and the People's Panel Advisory Group. No Cabinet Office NDPB is due to be abolished over the next twelve months and none has had its functions transferred or has been renamed. A list of all NDPBs currently sponsored by the Cabinet Office is published on the Internet (www.cabinet-office.gov.uk/quango).
<P>

<a name="90719w18.htm_para3">The Cabinet Office has set up three new NDPBs since 1 May 1997: the Better Regulation Task Force; the People's Panel Advisory Group; and the Security Vetting Appeals Panel. The People's Panel Advisory Group was only in existence for a short time and was abolished on 1 July 1999.
<P>

<a name="90719w18.htm_para4">The Cabinet Office currently sponsors ten NDPBs, although the Minister for the Cabinet Office is also responsible for a COI-Sponsored NDPB and for seventeen NDPBs sponsored by the Duchy of Lancaster Office. The Government are committed to keeping the number of NDPBs to a minimum and to ensuring that those that remain are open, accountable and effective.

 The administration of the Child Support Agency is a matter for the Chief Executive, Mrs. Faith Boardman. She will write to my hon. Friend.
<P>

<a name="90719w19.htm_para0"><i>Letter from Mrs. Faith Boardman to Mrs. Claire Curtis-Thomas, dated 19 July 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Social Security about the Child Support Agency Centre at Birkenhead.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The annex to this letter contains 2 tables. Table 1 is arranged to readily allow month on month comparisons of the number of complaints received from May 1997. Table 2 shows the general classification of complaint and for your information I have included the percentages for the last complete financial year.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Birkenhead Child Support Agency Centre (CSAC) has introduced a number of initiatives to improve customer service and reduce complaints which I have listed below. Many of these have been implemented nationally and others are local improvements.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Extending the opening hours of Client Helpline--now open 8.00am-8.30pm Mon-Fri and 9.00am-5.00pm Saturday.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Decision-Making and Appeals (DMA)--a more direct and responsive service to address client concerns. Simplifies the procedures for clients to report changes to the Agency. The emphasis of the new scheme is to enable parents to have direct telephone contact to discuss their case, wherever possible with the person who has actually been dealing with it.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Direct Telephone Numbers--staff are giving out their direct telephone numbers to customers. This ensures that clients can contact their case officer when needed to discuss their case and to resolve queries. Personal explanation of the decisions made in customer's cases should resolve the problems and queries of most parents.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Positive Customer Contact--the Agency is using the telephone as the primary means of contacting customers. This enables staff to gather information more quickly and to explain to clients the reason why information is needed. Customers are being contacted before a final calculation is made to ensure that the maintenance assessment is based on correct and up to date information. Customers are being contacted earlier by telephone at all stages of the process. This will reduce delays and aid in compliance. Staff in Birkenhead have received appropriate training.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Process Management Checks--team leaders have been given the freedom to target areas of work. In practice this means that cases are checked much earlier in the process to improve accuracy.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Face to Face--customers have always had the opportunity to speak to a member of the Agency's staff at their local child support office. However, in the past customers faced difficulties in arranging this. The Agency has committed approximately 600 staff (Wales and North West Business Unit has approximately 106) to face to face contact with its customers. This initiative is currently being rolled out nationally. Interviews can either be conducted at the local child support office or the customer's home.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Contacts with local stakeholders such as CAB--Birkenhead CSAC has dedicated customer service telephone numbers for CAB, New Deal for Lone Parent Advisors and MP's. CAB, New Deal Advisors and MP's have been invited into the CSAC. CSA staff have visited CAB and New Deal Advisors in order to forge closer links.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Meetings with customers--forums have been held with MP's and Customers--two in Lancashire, one in Wales. Open meetings have been arranged where customers could raise 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>19 Jul 1999 : Column: 442</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>issues and ask general questions. Customers were also given the opportunity to speak to individual CSA staff who took away their queries and responded to them.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Forces Focal Point--set up to meet the specified needs of Forces Personnel. A member of staff acts as liaison between the Business Unit and the various armed forces. A dedicated telephone number is available to forces welfare offices, the Police and Prison Service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Closer working with Benefits Agency--BA staff are completing CSA forms on the initial visit. They are also advising customers on CSA procedures in order to promote understanding and to simplify the information-gathering process.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Customer Service Workshops--staff are attending a one day seminar in improving customer service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Customer Service Focus Group--staff meet to discuss customer service improvement initiatives. This group has conducted a Root Cause Analysis of customer complaints and has been tasked with devising and implementing solutions to the common complaints in order to reduce numbers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For the future Birkenhead and the rest of the Agency will continue to build on improvements already made.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Customer Service workshops are continuing and further meetings are being arranged with clients and MP's.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Staff will be attending BA stakeholder liaison meetings to foster good relations between CSA staff and stakeholder groups.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Staff will be given customer focused performance indicators which will encourage practices which meet the needs of our customers.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>A programme of visits, talks and surgeries is planned by the Forces Focal Point for police welfare staff, prison officers and armed forces personnel.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>All computer generated notifications will provide the direct telephone number of an officer dealing with a client's case.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On 1 July the Secretary of State announced the publication of the White paper which sets out the plans for Child Support reform. In the long-term, with a simplified scheme, benefits from DMA, focus on customer service and a new computer system, the number of complaints about CSA should reduce significantly.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w20.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will estimate the amount of money which would need to be credited to a stakeholder pension in a given year for a new entrant to the labour market to buy on retirement a pension equivalent to the value of the credit to the state second pension which would be given to someone with caring responsibilities during that year. [91136]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90719w20.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 A carer who received a full year of credits for the State Second Pension in 2002 (the first year in which credits for the State Second Pension are likely to be available) would accrue rights to a pension of about &#163;1 per week in today's prices, which rises in line with average earnings over the working life. This real rise in the value of the pension over the working life means that the cash value of the future pension accrued in 2002 will rise to approximately &#163;2 per week in 1999 prices by the time of retirement (2051).
<P>

<a name="90719w20.htm_para0">The amount a 16-year-old female entrant to the labour market in the same year would need to contribute to a stakeholder pension scheme to accrue the same pension in 2051 is &#163;402 in 2002 (or about &#163;8 per week) and about &#163;6 per week net of tax relief at the basicrate.
<P>

<a name="90719w20.htm_para1">Depending on earnings, part of this contribution could be made up of the National Insurance rebate if she was contracted-out of the State Second Pension.
<P>

<a name="90719w20.htm_para2">The precise amounts required in a stakeholder pension to match the value of State Second Pension credits vary depending on the year in which the contribution is made and on the gender of the contributor.

As mentioned in the previous reply, in the 10 months up to 31 March 1999 the Benefits Agency target of processing 65% of its claims within 20 days was met in all but one of the months. Since April, the target has been 95% processed in 60 days and for April and May the percentages achieved were 94.9 and 94.7 respectively.
<BR>
Information on the average time taken to process claims is taken across all the claims processed including those processed over 60 days. All claims are recorded on the Pensions Computer System and in respect of those not processed after 60 days, the system notifies the local Benefits Agency office management on a monthly basis to allow progress on the claims to be monitored. Management is also informed of the longest case outstanding but the cost in establishing

 The Koln Summit made clear that the link between debt relief and poverty reduction should be strengthened.
<P>

<a name="90719w21.htm_para0">The UK has put forward its own proposals for strengthening that link. Among other things, the UK has suggested that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>i. Debt relief should be structured both to provide resources for anti-poverty programmes, and to revive business confidence. This requires a balance between debt stock reduction and debt service reduction in the early years. To achieve this:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The World Bank and IMF should put forward a menu of options for achieving the required net present value reduction in their debt, taking into account the overall time profile of a country's debt service and creditor procedures;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>This menu should include an option which reduces multilateral debt service by 50-75 per cent. in early years, and another with as much stock reduction as possible;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The indebted country should then be able to negotiate around these options.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>ii. Debt relief should provide an opportunity to invigorate the entire government anti-poverty programme. It should not be seen as funding a separate, add-on operation. This anti-poverty programme should be informed by the World Bank and UN's work on social principles, and by the thinking around the Comprehensive Development Framework. It should incorporate a medium-term expenditure framework for the whole budget. Macro policy--and hence ESAF--should be an integral part. It should be as widely owned as possible. Hence, the anti-poverty plan needs to be built on existing processes in-country, rather than on an international blueprint. Although final agreement on IFI support for the programmes should continue to rest with countries and Bank/Fund Boards, other main players should have the opportunity to feed their comments in directly on final drafts before they go to the Boards.</FONT></UL>

<a name="90719w21.htm_para2">The Insurance Companies Act 1982 provides for the authorisation and prudential supervision of companies carrying out insurance business in the United Kingdom. All UK authorised insurance companies are required to maintain a margin of solvency. If it appears that an authorised insurance firm has failed to maintain the required margin, it may be required to implement a plan or scheme for restoring a sound financial position. In the last five years, these requirements have been exercised as follows:
