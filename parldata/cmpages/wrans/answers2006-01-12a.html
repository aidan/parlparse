 To ask the Solicitor-General what further steps he plans to take to protect small businesses from fraudulent schemes.  [41085]</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60112w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The Government are taking considerable steps to assist small company fraud. Fraud is an issue for SME&#039;s as more of them do business through the Internet. A new one-stop-shop website for up-to-date information about online safety has recently been launched.

 To ask the Solicitor-General what the Crown Prosecution Service&#039;s policy is on prosecuting men who use prostitutes who have been trafficked from other countries.  [41088]</p>




<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60112w01.html_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The Law Officers regard tackling human trafficking, for both sexual and non-sexual exploitation, as a priority. I am a member of the ministerial group on human trafficking and am working jointly with Home Office Ministers to tackle human trafficking including for prostitution, by co-chairing a Joint Ministerial NGO Stakeholder /Consultative Group on Human Trafficking on the issue. This will seek to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of criminal justice policy and will be informed by the public consultation document on proposals for a UK action plan, launched last week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60112w01.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_1">In cases involving allegations of a sexual offence, assuming the evidential test is satisfied, prosecution policy makes it clear that the public interest will strongly favour a prosecution. This applies equally to cases where the victim has been trafficked for the purposes of sexual exploitation.

<p><a name="st_2"><a name="60112w01.html_spmin2"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The need for effective judicial trial management of complex trials, especially large fraud trials, was recognised in the Lord Chief Justice&#039;s Protocol for the Control and Management of Heavy Fraud and Other Complex Criminal Cases and Practice Direction issued on 14 March 2005. I welcome the Criminal Procedure Rules 2005 but they will not be sufficient of themselves to resolve all the issues of trial management in the most serious cases which is why we are seeking non jury trials in a few cases each year.

 None. It is primarily for the relevant Government Departments, in consultation as necessary with Treasury Solicitors and other Government Departments, to decide what arrangements they make to handle compensation claims whether brought on behalf of the injured party by a claims handling company, a solicitor or any other intermediary. The Government are introducing legislation in the Compensation Bill (HL) introduced on 2 November 2005 that will enable the statutory regulation of claims handling companies.

<sup>(3)</sup> The cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for the years 1995 to 2000, and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) for 2001 onwards. The codes used are listed as follows:<br>

Malignant neoplasm of prostate&#151;ICD-9 185; ICD-10 C61;<br>

Malignant neoplasm of breast&#151;ICD-9 174&#150;175; ICD-10 C50;<br>

Malignant neoplasm of colon and rectum&#151;ICD-9 153/154; ICD-10 C18-C21;<br>

Malignant neoplasm of trachea, bronchus and lung&#151;ICD-9 162; ICD-10 C33-C34;<br>

Other cancer sites&#151;ICD-9 140&#150;208 excluding the above codes; ICD-10 C00-C97 excluding the above codes.<br>

<sup>(4)</sup> Figures are based on deaths occurring in each calendar year.<br>

<sup>(5)</sup> Figures include deaths in males as well as females.<br>

<sup>(6)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that data for cancer are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The data should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from cancer by site is described in an article published in August 2004 <sup>(7)</sup> .<br>

<sup>(9)</sup> As cancer survival varies with age at diagnosis, the relative rates for all ages (15&#150;99) have been age-standardised to control for changes in the age profile of cancer patients over time, thus making them comparable with previously published figures.<br>

<sup>(10)</sup> Aged 15&#150;99 years.<br>

<sup>(11)</sup> Cancers registered in 1991&#150;94 and 1995&#150;2001 are, respectively, defined by codes in the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD9) and Tenth Revision ICD10). Therefore, prostate cancer is defined by codes 185 or C61, breast cancer by codes 174 or C50, colorectal (bowel) cancer by codes 153&#150;154 or C18-C21 and lung cancer by codes 162 or C33-C34.<br>

<sup>(12)</sup> Age-standardised to the European standard population.<br>

<sup>(13)</sup> The cause of death was defined using the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for the years 1995 to 2000, and the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) for 2001 onwards. The codes used are listed as follows:<br>

Malignant neoplasms&#151;ICD-9 140&#150;208; ICD-10 C00 C97.<br>

<sup>(14)</sup> Data exclude deaths at age under 28 days.<br>

<sup>(15)</sup> Figures are based on deaths occurring in each calendar year.<br>





<sup>(16)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that data for cancer are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The figures presented in this table for the years 1993 to 2000 have been adjusted using comparability ratios to be comparable with ICD-10.<br>

The effect of the change in classification in 2001 on deaths from all cancer and cancer by site is described in an article published in August 2004.*<br>

 The Government are committed to helping families with children through the financial support system. Its approach is based on the dual principles of providing financial support for all families with children, recognising the extra costs and responsibilities associated with bringing up a child; and offering more help to those who need it most, when they need it most. In the Child Poverty Review (2004), the Government also set out its long-term aspiration to improve the financial support available to large families.

 The Government&#039;s system of financial support for families with children is built on the principle of progressive universalism, delivering help for all families and more help for those who need it most. Universal child benefit forms the foundation of this system, recognising the extra costs and responsibilities associated with bringing up a child. The Government believe it is right that society should recognise the importance of family life by providing financial support for every family with a dependent child, and will not tax child benefit. Child benefit is complemented by child tax credit, which delivers greatest support to those who need it most, including families on lower incomes, those with children under one, and parents of disabled children.

For example not everyone who is usually resident is entitled to vote (foreign citizens from outside of the EU and Commonwealth, prisoners, etc. are not eligible), some people do not register to vote and people who have more than one address may register in more than one place. Further there is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. These factors may have a different impact from place to place.</p>

The patient registers also exclude individuals who are ineligible to be registered with a GP, such as persons employed in the armed forces, prisoners that are sentenced for a term of two years or more and certain patients in long stay medical hospitals.

A study commissioned by the Department last year established that 75 per cent. of the average weight of ELVs is made up of ferrous and non-ferrous metals, and this proportion may be deemed to have been automatically reused or recycled, under the terms of Commission Decision 2005/293/EC, to reflect usual commercial practice. A further 10 per cent. of the weight of ELVs needs therefore to be recovered during 2006. Fluids, including fuel, and tyres, plastics and glass are likely to contribute.

 The Government recognise that small businesses can sometimes face particular difficulties in managing and administering maternity leave and statutory maternity pay (SMP). Additional financial support is available for smaller employers. All employers are able to claim back 92 per cent. of the SMP they pay to their employees but smaller employers&#151;those whose annual national insurance liability is &#163;45,000 or less&#151;are able to claim back 100 per cent. of the SMP they pay out plus an additional 4.5 per cent.

Rising house prices can create difficulties for first-time buyers and while Northern Ireland does not have a general affordability problem there are hot spot areas where affordability problems may occur. Recent Government initiatives such as the increase in the threshold at which stamp duty is paid from &#163;60,000 to &#163;120,000 coupled with the recent increase in the level of funding available to the Co-ownership scheme and the changes to the eligibility rules, will play an increasing role in helping those on lower incomes to become home owners.

I have been asked to reply as this issue falls within my responsibility as Chief Executive of Roads Service.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_69">The preparation of the Sub-Regional Transport Plan has been supported by some 29 local transport studies of towns and cities across Northern Ireland, including those for Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Newcastle. These studies have been undertaken by independent consultants, working to a standard brief prepared by Roads Service, and their management has included interdepartmental liaison and participation of Translink. The consultants have worked closely with Roads Service Divisional staff and have taken full account of their local knowledge of the issues developed over the years through regular consultation with the Councils and contact with the general public.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_70">As you will also be aware, the Draft Ards and Down Area Plan 2015 was published in December 2002. Consultation on the Area Plan, which includes Downpatrick, Ballynahinch and Newcastle, involved the production of an Issues Paper in December 2000 and a series of public meetings facilitated and reported by Community Technical Aid. The consultation included transportation matters.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_71">In preparing the Draft Sub-Regional Transport Plan, Roads Service had intended that an emerging blueprint, detailing the likely improvements in each local area, would have been available prior to Christmas. However, due to the draft NI Priorities and Budget 2006/08 and the Investment Strategy for Northern Ireland announcements in December, and their potential impact, it was decided to defer issuing the blueprints until the New Year. The Councils were advised accordingly.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_72">It is our intention to produce the Draft Sub-Regional Transport for formal consultation in March 2006, with the final Plan to be published in December 2006 and it is still Roads Service&#039;s intention to provide District Councils with sight of the blueprints for their respective towns, in advance of the formal consultation.</p>

 Due to the number of contacts, their diverse range, the varied nature of representations and the lengthy consultation period on this issue it is not practically possible to identify and list all written representations from all businesses, business organisations and non-governmental organisations. It is therefore also not possible to identify which of those representations stated that they were to remain confidential.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions for what reasons levels of carers allowance reduce when carers reach pensionable age.  [41720]</p>




<p><a name="st_173"><a name="60112w18.html_spnew1"><b> Mrs. McGuire: </b> 
 The payment of carers allowance is affected by the award of other social security benefits such as state pension, bereavement allowance and incapacity benefit, rather than simply reaching pension age. The reason why a carers allowance is not paid in full together with that other benefit is because they are both paid for income maintenance, and paying both benefits in full would duplicate provision for the same need. In 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Jan 2006 : Column 804W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
practice the personal contributory benefit is paid in full and the carers allowance is adjusted against it. Where carers allowance is overlapped in full, the person maintains an underlying entitlement to the benefit which, in turn, gives them access to the carer premium in the income-related benefits, such as income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit, and to the carers additional amount in pension credit.

Notes:<br>

1. All figures are in cash terms.<br>

2. In April 1980 the rate of Basic State Pension was &#163;23.30 (&#163;37.30 for a couple).<br>

3. There are no singles or couples rate as such, the basic state pension is an individual benefit; although the Category A rate is commonly referred to as the singles rate, and the combination of the Category A and Category B rate paid to married women is commonly referred to as the couples rate.<br>

4. Figures are based on the April 1980 rate of basic state pension uprated in line with growth in the seasonally unadjusted Average Earnings Index (including bonuses) to September in each year, They take account of the convention that rates of basic state pension are rounded to the nearest 5p.<br>

5. The actual level of the basic state pension was &#163;62.45 (&#163;99.80 for a couple) in 1997&#150;98. The proposed rate is &#163;84.25 (&#163;134.75 for a couple) in 2006&#150;07.<br>

<p><a name="st_186"><a name="60112w21.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 Most people who qualify for a winter fuel payment do not need to make a claim because they are paid automatically from DWP records. Some people aged 60 or over who are not in receipt of a benefit administered by DWP do need to claim. Many men aged 60&#150;64, for example, fall into this category and need to claim. It is, however, not possible to estimate how many eligible pensioners have not claimed.

<p><a name="st_196"><a name="60112w22.html_spnew1"><b> Beverley Hughes: </b> 
 This Government are the first to recognise the contribution and concerns of all carers formally and is supporting carers on a number of fronts through the work of several departments.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60112w22.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_141">The Carers and Disabled Children Act 2000 strengthens the rights of carers to an assessment of their own needs as carers and involves a new right to a carer&#039;s assessment. It gives local councils mandatory duties to support carers by providing services to carers directly and in the provision of breaks, and as well, supporting carers by providing direct payment for carers&#039; services. These direct payments can be made to families with disabled children and disabled young people aged 16 and 17 who have been assessed as needing services. Direct payments are cash payments made by the local authority to disabled young people or families, to enable them to purchase social care services that best meet their needs. The Health and Social Care Act 2001 made the offer of direct payments mandatory.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60112w22.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_142">The Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 builds on previous legislation and makes changes to the existing law around carers&#039; services. There is now a duty on councils to inform carers of their right to an assessment of their needs. When assessing carers councils must also take into account whether the carer works or wishes to work, undertakes or wishes to undertake education, training or leisure activities. The Act also facilitates co-operation between authorities in relation to the provision of services that are relevant to carers. DfES worked closely with DH on this legislation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60112w22.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_143">We are increasing funding for short breaks thorough yearly increases in the carer&#039;s grant. This is leading to increases in services for parents of disabled children. The carers grant is worth &#163;185 million in 2005&#150;06. Approximately 20 per cent. is spent on children&#039;s services, including services to disabled children and children and young people under 18 who are care-givers for other members of their family. In the last local government finance settlement, we confirmed our commitment to continue the carers grant until the end of the 2007&#150;08 financial year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60112w22.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_144">The DfES is also funding a national freephone helpline, run by Contact a Family (a national registered charity) to provide information for parents of disabled children on disability and to support them in contacting other families, developing local and national support groups and acting as a voice to raise awareness and campaign for families.

 Early intervention is an important part of early years policy and my Department continues to promote the early support programme for young disabled children and their families as an ongoing, central feature of our policy in England. As part of that approach, my Department asked Mencap and other stakeholders to undertake a feasibility study to assess the viability of a National Centre for Early Intervention. I welcome their report. However, because the funding implications of a national centre are significant, I have now requested a robust business appraisal of the cost benefits of such a centre and how it might be funded.

 A large amount of fraud can be prevented if people take simple precautions to protect themselves. Government therefore takes an active role in improving public awareness of fraud and how to avoid becoming a victim. These measures are targeted at all members of the community.

 By looking at organised crime utilising additional data sets to those traditionally used to examine &quot;criminal markets&quot; such as counterfeit, contraband, illicit goods and immigration crime, Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) came to the conclusion that the complexity, resilience and reach of organised crime was growing.

There may be occasions when local risk assessment, based on the prisoner&#039;s recent history of behaviour, requires that more than one three-officer team is necessary to meet the threat of violence posed by a prisoner.

<a name="stpa_179">Not everyone who acts as a protected witness needs to be admitted to a protected witness unit (PWU). Other methods can be used to protect such people, such as being located in a vulnerable prisoner or other secure unit. An allocation to a PWU is made after completion of a risk assessment and at the direction of the Prison Service in accordance with the Prison Act 1952. The prisoner has usually been an active participant in a serious crime and has elected to identify, provide information, or give evidence against others involved in serious crime, thus placing himself at risk. The Service does not openly disclose where PWU are located for security reasons and will write separately on this matter.

 General guidance on the cautioning of adult offenders is contained in the Cautioning of Adult Offenders circular 30/2005 issued by the Home Office.
