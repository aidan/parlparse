<i> [holding answer 11 September 2006]:</i> Decisions were made on administrative area restructuring after careful consideration by Her Majesty's Courts Service (HMCS) of the need to provide the most effective way to administer the courts and keep costs to a minimum. Local area directors were fully involved in these decisions. Decisions in relation to the restructuring of courts boards areas have yet to be taken.</p>

 Section 1 of the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act (DVCVA) 2004&#151;to make breach of a non-molestation order a criminal offence&#151;is costed at &#163;2.8 million per full year. Section 4 is costed at &#163;2.9 million per full year. However, if brought in together this limits costs to &#163;5 million per full year. These are annual continuing costs not just start-up costs.</p>

 The Oxfordshire coroner suggested the meeting on 11 August 2003 the week before it took place as he was going to be in London on that day on other business. The Lord Chancellor had already indicated to the coroner that he was minded to invoke his section 17A powers unless there was exceptional reason why he should not do so. The meeting on 11 August was to discuss how the coroner might resume the inquest to admit further evidence of the cause of death so that it might be accurately recorded by the registrar.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 September 2006]: </i>The Environment Agency (EA) is the principal operating authority for flood risk management in England and has a general supervisory duty over all matters relating to flood defence. The EA&#146;s River Derwent preliminary strategic review (PSR), which recommended the consideration of future works in South Derbyshire, including Alvaston, Derby and Little Chester, was completed in August 2004.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_55"><a name="60913w0003.htm_para6"><a name="0609185000428">A viability report identified a number of gaps in data and the need for improvements to the existing hydraulic model through Derby. The report reviewed the economic case in the PSR and suggested that a significant number of properties were at risk overall during a one in 100 year flood risk event. The report was completed in October 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_56"><a name="60913w0003.htm_para7"><a name="0609185000429">Due to the scale of flooding problems, a strategic analysis is appropriate for the business case. This strategy, which is due to be completed in autumn 2007, will examine the alternative options for sustainable flood risk management in Derby during the next 100 years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_57"><a name="60913w0003.htm_para8"><a name="0609185000430">The strategy has now been extended to consider the Derwent from Derby to the River Trent, including Ambaston. Data on this area are currently being collected and work undertaken to develop the hydraulic model to extend it down to the confluence. The strategy is at the pre-scoping data gathering stage. It is anticipated that the scoping report will be issued in November 2006. The strategy will provide a plan for the first five years of capital investment, including an assessment of the appropriate maintenance strategy for the existing defences. A strategic environmental assessment will also be produced. The scoping report will be reissued to cover the increased project scope and area. An extensive process of consultation is planned.</p>

Other measures include landfill allowance trading scheme, regulation and recycling targets for local authorities. As part of the annual Budget process, the Government assesses the impact of landfill tax alongside these initiatives against a range of social, economic and environmental factors, including assessing the volume of waste sent to landfill and the impact on business competitiveness.</p>

The financial benefits derived from the introduction of the Traffic Officer Service are not due to be assessed until 2008 when the service will have been fully operational across all regions for 12 months.

In hospitals, these efficiencies should include reductions in missed appointments and cancellations, meaning clinics can be run more efficiently.

 GovNet Expo is organised by GovNet Events, part of GovNet Communications, a commercial media, conference and publications company, which is not funded by Government. Attendance at this event is free to the public sector, so costs will be limited to travel and expenses. The Department however, does not monitor these costs for individual national health service organisations.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment she has made of the extent to which each spearhead area is on track to meet the 2010 health inequalities target; and if she will make a statement. [91036]</p>

 The 2010 health inequalities target is based on the performance of the spearhead areas as a whole. The extent to which each individual spearhead area is on track to narrow their local life expectancy gap with England by 10 per cent. by 2010 is shown in the following list. While the national trend is for a continuing widening in the life expectancy gap between spearhead areas and England, the table shows that some 19 per cent. of spearhead areas are on track for males and females with a further 41 per cent. on track for either males or females.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_110"><a name="60913w0008.htm_para0"><a name="06091810000514">Current activity to support achievement of the target includes improving our understanding of the key interventions to improve life expectancy in spearhead areas. Fast gains in life expectancy can be made by reducing the prevalence of smoking, effective control of blood pressure and cholesterol, and good care of people with long-term conditions such as diabetes. Improving performance management is also important and we have made health inequalities one of the Department's top six priorities for the national health service, and it will be a mandatory target within local area agreements.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_111"><a name="60913w0008.htm_para1"><a name="06091810000515">We are also looking to spread best practice across all spearhead areas, and provide support for those areas that need it.</p>

The figures include enrolments and staff at those English higher education institutions which offer medicine and dentistry courses. The Department does not calculate student staff ratios for individual higher education institutions or subjects. The available data do not allow us to identify, and exclude from the calculation, the amount of time staff spend teaching further education (as opposed to higher education) courses, and the number of students who are taught at other institutions under franchising arrangements. These factors have to be excluded from the calculation in order to produce an SSR purely for higher education provision in higher education institutions. We are therefore unable to produce individual HEI SSRs which are accurate and comparable across all institutions. An SSR for all HE institutions in England as a whole, which excludes time spent on FE teaching and students taught via franchising, is published annually by the Department. In 2004-05, the staff student ratio for English institutions as a whole (excluding the Open University) was 18.2.</p>

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given to his previous question on 16 June 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1532W. This explained that the Department had written to strategic health authority chief executives and performance managers on 16 February 2006, reminding them of the obligations upon primary care trusts when deciding the future of community hospitals, as outlined in the White Paper &#147;Our health, Our Care, Our Say: a new direction for community services&#148;.</p>

In many ways, this move is in line with what has been happening in mental health services since the national service framework was published in 1999. The White Paper mentions our plans for mental health services, which are featured prominently throughout. For example, we made a manifesto commitment to improve access to evidence-based psychological therapies, and reinforced this in the White Paper, which includes the following commitments:</p>

 The national health service will continue to need new midwives to replace those who retire or take career breaks. However, there is now a much closer match between the demand and supply of healthcare workers and there is more competition for posts. It is a joint responsibility between higher education institutions and local NHS organisations to see that midwifery and other healthcare graduates are supported to find employment. Vacancies for graduates continue to be posted on &#147;NHS Jobs&#148; and the &#147;NHS Careers&#148; information service can direct graduates to appropriate sources of information and advice. Graduates are encouraged to be flexible when applying for posts.</p>

 No specific assessment has been made of the health implications of factors affecting access to skimmed milk of women who have recently given birth. The Department recommends all adults and children over five years consume lower fat varieties of milk to reduce the intake of saturated fats in the diet. The welfare food scheme, to become the healthy start scheme later in 2006, provides pregnant women and women with young children on qualifying benefits with vouchers for whole, semi-skimmed or skimmed milk.</p>

There is a degree of flexibility, however, in how this is managed at a local level. SHAs can agree a recovery plan which phases the recovery of deficits over a number of years.

An invitation to submit outline proposals was sent to six pre-qualified organisations in November 2004. After a rigorous evaluation process of the responses, in July 2005 the Department sent three selected bidders an invitation to negotiate.

The Department is not responsible for either the membership of the group or its terms of reference. The Department is keen that the proposals developed are independent and the responsibility of the voluntary sector organisations involved. We await with interest the projects findings which should report in December 2006.</p>

 The majority of the Department&#146;s expenditure on these subjects is allocated from the Science Budget to the UK Research Councils. In turn, the UK Research Councils allocate the majority of their funds in a &#147;bottom-up&#148; mode responding to the demand of the science community and making funding decisions on quality rather than international geographic focus. It is therefore not possible to provide exact figures on spending which relates to collaboration with Korea. However, there is active collaboration, supported by the Research Councils, in wide range of areas&#151;including genome work, nano and bio-nanotechnology, sustainable development and energy technologies, ICT and mobile technologies and space science.</p>

 HM Revenue and Customs consider there to be a number of factors contributing to the decline in the number of reported breaches of strategic export controls since 2000. Firstly, at that time a large number of breaches related to trade sanctions on Angola and Iraq&#151;these sanctions no longer apply. Secondly, controls on the export of off-road vehicles to the former Yugoslavia were discontinued in 2002. HMRC also assess that there is increased exporter compliance. Since 2000 the DTI, supported by HMRC and other Government Departments, have been very active in running national and regional seminars to increase exporter awareness of the controls. Additionally, DTI and HMRC supported a series of regional seminars run by the Defence Manufacturers Association prior to the introduction of the new Orders under the Export Control Act 2002.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 September 2006]:</i> As I announced to the House on 10 July 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1133WS, 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines will replace 16 Air Assault Brigade as the Helmand taskforce this winter. The Brigade is the UK's only specialist mountain and cold weather brigade. It is fully trained and equipped for this role and has considerable personal and collective experience of winter and mountain operations.</p>

The key items are cold weather boots and socks, inner and outer winter gloves and a winter sleeping bag. Should the nature of the operations require additional specialist winter equipment in order to support particular operational requirements, these can be drawn on by the in-theatre HQ.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 September 2006]:</i> The loss of an RAF Nimrod MR2 in Afghanistan on 2 September, and the tragic loss of life of the 14 military personnel on board, is currently being investigated. The factors leading to the loss of the aircraft cannot be confirmed until the investigation is concluded, but all the indications are that it was not the result of hostile action. The incident serves to remind us of the risks that our military personnel are facing on behalf of us all, and the debt that we owe them.</p>

 The Royal Irish Regiment (Home Service) battalions, like their predecessors, the Ulster Defence Regiment, were raised specifically for operations in support of the police in Northern Ireland known as Operation Banner.</p>

With the police no longer needing routine military support, the three Home Service battalions will have successfully completed the tasks for which they were raised and will disband.</p>

 The established Line Serial Number for W Company 45 Commando Royal Marines is 78 personnel for their conventional role. But 45 Commando are not deploying to Afghanistan as a Battle Group: they have a number of individual roles for which they have been specifically reorganised. W Coy restructured in early July 2006 and now comprises 100 individuals. The majority of the Coy have been training for an operational deployment since Easter 2006; and all personnel undertake legally mandated pre-deployment training including the five members who joined the company two months before the deployment. They will conduct individual replacement training next week.</p>

This is the largest source of information on children&#146;s social service activity in England. It contains information from almost every council who provide children&#146;s social care.

This makes it very difficult to make a good assessment of how the poor are being impacted by inflation. Our rough estimation is that very poor Iraqis are probably impacted less by inflation in Iraq than are average or richer Iraqis. Richer Iraqis consume a lot of fuel&#151;the poor remain somewhat protected by the continued existence of the food rationing system. However, it is also likely that very poor Iraqis have seen less of the boost to incomes experienced by Iraqis as a whole.</p>

DWP has implemented this recommendation. Following the successful pilot at Balham office, new procedures for NINO allocation were introduced nationally at the end of March 2001. Specialist teams now carry out thorough and detailed interviews with applicants. Interviewing sites have access to sophisticated document examination tools. A secondary level of checks has been introduced in order fully to corroborate information provided by the applicant at the initial interview.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_275"><a name="60913w0025.htm_para9"><a name="0609193000068">The Home Office was involved in the development of these new procedures.

 The Government and their Olympic partners recognise the importance of ensuring a skilled workforce to deliver the Olympic park and venues on time and budget. The games represent a huge opportunity for local communities in east London and partners are developing a range of programmes to ensure that local people are well-placed to benefit from these opportunities. For example, the Olympic Delivery Authority's draft procurement policy includes a commitment to working with its contractors to provide a legacy of trained and motivated people needed for their business, in association with relevant sector skills councils. ConstructionSkills, the sector skills council for the construction industry, has established a special team&#151;Constructing London 2012&#151;to deliver locally available construction skills. In addition, the London Development Agency is working closely with the five Olympic boroughs to set up a job brokerage service which will be based in the Lower Lea Valley and will act as a link with contractors on skills requirements, training provision and pre-employment training.</p>

This was an assessment of what local authorities needed to fund education rather than what they spent. In 2006-07 funding for schools changed with the introduction of the dedicated schools grant (DSG) which is based largely on an authority's previous spending.  2. The DSG has a different coverage to EFS. EFS comprised a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the schools block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's local government finance settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. This means there is a break from 2006-07 onwards in the funding series and the two sets of figures are not comparable. A new funding series is currently being developed by the Department.  3.

 Higher education is the best investment most people will make, with a substantial graduate premium compared with what a similar individual would have earned if they just had A-levels. There is now more money available to students from the student finance system and, where this is in the form of student loans, the debt incurred is quite unlike commercial debt. Students repay student loans after they have left university or college and only in real terms the same amount that they originally borrowed. Graduates do not pay back until they are in work and earning more than &#163;15,000. Someone on the average graduate starting salary of &#163;18,000 could be paying only &#163;5.19 per week. If at any time their income drops below &#163;15,000 the repayments will stop until they are earning more again. We have also provided that, if after 25 years students starting in 2006/07 or later have still not paid back all their student loan, the Government will pay it off for them.</p>

 Schools may offer activities, both directly and through third-party providers from the private, voluntary and independent sectors, on their premises. They may also let their premises to outside bodies, such as sports clubs and community groups. The Department does not collect data on all such usage centrally; however, a baseline survey of extended services in a sample of maintained schools in 2005 found that 75 per cent. of primary schools and 97 per cent. of secondary schools permitted some outside use of their facilities. We are committed to ensuring that by 2010 all maintained schools in England become extended schools, providing access to a core offer of opportunities and services, including activities for pupils, family learning and adult learning available to the wider community. We are on track to achieve our target for 2,500 schools to provide this offer by the end of this month; and for half of all primary schools and third of secondary schools to do so by 2008. More than 10,000 schools are already working with their local authorities and with our partner organisation, TDA Development, to develop extended services.</p>

This resource was produced in close collaboration with specialist organisations in the voluntary sector and the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists. It explains how children normally develop communication, language and speech, how adults can help in this, the difficulties that can arise and how to seek help from professionals.</p>

 Guidance on carrying out statutory assessments of special educational needs are given in the Special Educational Needs Code of Practice (2001), to which all local education authorities and schools must have regard. The code recognises that there are no hard and fast categories of need for assessment purposes. It identifies four broad types of need: communication and interaction; cognition and learning; behaviour, emotional and social development; and sensory and/or physical needs, but it stresses that each child is unique and that children may have needs that fall into more than one area. The code makes clear that children's needs must be considered on an individual basis.</p>

 The new speed detection project, known as SPECS III, is still at an early stage. Before the system can be deployed operationally, it must obtain Home Office Type Approval. This process is managed through the Home Office Scientific Development Board, with the assistance of police forces that are willing to practically test the equipment. SPECS III is at the beginning of this process and along with the Metropolitan Police Service, the PSNI is providing the testing capability for the system. In Northern Ireland it is to be installed and tested on the A20 dual carriageway between Newtownards and Dundonald. If successful, it is anticipated that SPECS III will be rolled out across the province. Initial costs for the pilot scheme are to be met by the equipment supplier with no budget implications for the PSNI at this stage.</p>

 Crime statistics collated by the PSNI do not record a specific offence of &#145;vandalism&#146;. There are a number of offences categorized under criminal damage and these are shown in the following tables, and cover the years from 1998-99 to 2005-06. Due to a change in Home Office counting rules in April 1998, statistics prior to that date belong to a different statistical series and are not comparable.</p>

 By April 2007, all new asylum claims will be managed as part of the New Asylum Model (NAM). NAM is an integrated process and this therefore points to the need to be close both to reporting centres and to hearing centres. Analysis of the geographical locations of asylum claimants in the London area showed two large clusters of claimants in North Central London and in West London. This was a reasonable fit with the locations of IND reporting centres: at Communications House in Central London and at Eaton House in West London, near Heathrow; as well as with the Asylum and Immigration Tribunal hearing centres in London EC1 and at Feltham in Middlesex. It was accordingly decided that it would be most efficient to locate the Asylum Teams as close to the reporting centres as possible. We have now found and signed leases on buildings in both locations. The experience of the first NAM team which was set up in Croydon in June 2005 was that few of the claimants lived in the Croydon area and were having to travel a long way to report to their case owners and this validated the decision we made.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary updated the House in a written ministerial statement on 29 June 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> column 19WS, regarding the release of foreign national prisoners without deportation consideration. The director-general of the immigration and nationality directorate (IND) wrote on the same date to the chairman of the Home Affairs Select Committee on the number of cases where foreign national prisoners were released without proper deportation consideration. A copy of this letter is available in both Libraries. Previous updates have also been provided to the House on the number of cases where foreign national prisoners were released without proper deportation consideration. In particular I refer the hon.

Security Framework, accessible to all staff, on how rubdown searches must be conducted. In a standard level rubdown search the officer rubs down the upper and lower areas of the front and back of the body. Higher-level searches additionally include searching hair, feet and footwear. The power to search a passenger is contained in the Immigration Act 1971, Schedule 2 and in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004. However, this power is used sparingly and only in exceptional circumstances. An immigration officer, or a customs or police officer conducting the search under his direction, may invite any person to empty their pockets voluntarily as part of a search for documents. Detainee custody officers have a power under Schedule 11 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 to undertake a clothed body search of a detained person at an immigration removal centre or a short term holding facility, including a holding room at a port of entry.</p>

 John Lowe, the Director of Business in Prisons, wrote to Baroness Scotland in August 2005 requesting funding. The Minister suggested that he should speak with Neil Moore who was then the HM Prison Service National Voluntary Sector Co-ordinator, working in the National Offender Management Service Voluntary Sector Unit. A meeting was held between Neil Moore and Mr Lowe where Neil explained that there was no central funding available but that the organisation was eligible to submit a bid for the NOMS VSU grant round for 2006-07. The organisation did submit a bid for funding but the application was unsuccessful. The NOMS Voluntary Sector Unit received almost 700 applications for grants and, having identified Finance, Benefit and Debt as a Pathway which was under-resourced, had to reject applications that did not cover that area. There is a new grant round for 2007-08 with a closing date for applications of 15 September 2006 for which the organisation is eligible to apply.</p>

 The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has made significant investment in a number of projects, to enhance the quality, coverage and accessibility of its service and to deliver real changes and benefits to its customers. There are eight information technology projects being undertaken by the CRB, which have commenced since 2000. Of these, four are currently at the feasibility stage and costings and completion schedules have yet to be determined. These are: the I-PLX+ project, which aims to enhance the national police cross referencing database of local police force information (I-PLX), which is an important development in vetting and security checks, delivering significant improvements to the protection of the vulnerable; vetting and Barring Scheme: the CRB will continue to play a key role in the development of the new Vetting and Barring Scheme, introduced as a result of Bichard recommendation 19&#151;entry to the scheme will be via a CRB check&#151;and New Disclosure application form (DAF). The CRB has also been examining the feasibility of devising an upgraded Disclosure application form. A prototype of a new form has been produced, in consultation with a number of its customers and has been piloted with a cross section of Registered Bodies. As part of the feasibility studies, full costings will be prepared. The on-line application project aims to enable applicants to complete applications for Standard and Enhanced Disclosures via the e-channel. During 2005 the CRB developed a new Quality Assurance Framework (QAF). This is now being rolled out to all police forces and should be completed by January 2007, subject to forces&#146; readiness to complete staff training and implementation. The framework will standardise the forces&#146; approach to deciding what, if any, information is relevant to be released on a Disclosure. The framework also provides good practice guidelines for the wording of this information on the Disclosure, including consideration of the victim's age and mental capacity. With the introduction of the On-line Tracking Service, customers will be able to track the progress of a CRB check from receipt to issue, providing greater visibility of the process. The Registration Cancellation project aims to improve the CRB&#146;s assurance regime and enable greater support to its customers and Registered Bodies, whilst further eliminating risk.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_390"><a name="60913w0038.htm_para4"><a name="06091916000948">The CRB now has legislation, as a result of the recent Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, giving it access to a wider range of information that can be searched when carrying out a CRB check, for example that held by the British Transport Police, the Serious and Organised Crime Agency and the Royal Military Police. These are scheduled to come on stream during 2006-07.</p>

 I refer my hon. Friend to the written ministerial statement of 29 June 2006, <i> Official Report</i>, column 19WS, made by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary. In this statement he explained that the Director General of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) had written to the Home Affairs Committee on 29 June providing the most accurate data available at that time on the 1013 individuals who were released without deportation consideration. This information was collated centrally and quality assured by the Department and is the most accurate and robust data currently available to the Department.

 Where a deportation order is in force against any person, the Secretary of State may give directions for the person&#146;s removal to either a country of which he is a national or citizen, or a country or territory to which there is reason to believe that he will be admitted. Immigration Act powers to detain are not time-limited. However, domestic and ECHR case law provides that detention must last for no longer than is reasonably necessary for the purpose for which it is authorised and must not be of excessive duration. In the case of a person being deported or removed from the UK detention would be lawful provided there was a realistic prospect of deportation or removal within a reasonable period of time. Where a detainee refuses to cooperate with the removal process detention may be prolonged and the risk of reoffending is a factor that may be taken into account in determining whether the duration of a person&#146;s detention is reasonable. This position has been supported by the Courts.</p>

 Information on the number of people awaiting deportation who have absconded or have been held in open conditions is not held centrally in the format requested and may only be obtained at a disproportionate cost. The Prison Service reviewed the criteria for the categorisation and allocation of foreign national prisoners to open conditions earlier this year. The review concluded that no changes to the security re-categorisation policy were required. However, governors were advised that before a foreign national prisoner was approved for open conditions the individual risk was to be assessed on the assumption that deportation will take place unless a decision not to deport had already been taken by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate.</p>

 While the national Reducing Reoffending Delivery Plan details the partnership work in England, similar principles and the broad approach to reducing reoffending are reflected in &#145;Joining Together in Wales: an Adult and Young People&#146;s Strategy to Reduce Reoffending<sup>(&#146;)</sup>. The strategy was launched jointly by the Welsh Assembly Government and Home Office Ministers earlier this year and reflects the roles and responsibilities of the Welsh Assembly Government and the National Offender Management Service. It identifies the issues and aims to be addressed in Wales, which formed the basis of a consultation to develop the actions. Following the consultation, work is now underway with the Welsh Assembly Government and other key partners to develop and agree a joint action plan to deliver the strategy in Wales. Responsibility for the development of the strategy in Wales rests with the Director of Offender Management Services in Wales. Through the role of commissioning services, the Director of Offender Management Services in Wales will be able to influence the allocation of resources to pursue national objectives and in the delivery of the joint action plan. Clearly, not all resources will be allocated directly through the National Offender Management Service and those within other partners&#146; responsibilities form part of the consideration being given to developing and resourcing the delivery of the joint action plan. In addition, to support this work, we are also developing our reducing re-offending alliances in Wales, with the corporate sector, civic society, faith groups and the voluntary sector. The aim is to bring in new skills and innovation enabling us to work effectively with ex-offenders in different ways.</p>
