The public consultation ran between 3 December 2007 and 10 March 2008 and sets out how we think we can improve these services to help more disabled people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_66"><a name="81210w0001.htm_para9"><a name="08121026000175">The consultation also set out proposals for a new programme to replace Workstep, Work Preparation and the Job Introduction Scheme, and proposals for an enhanced role for Disability Employment Advisers. The Welfare Reform Green Paper &#147;No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility&#148;, Cm 7363, said that we would implement these improvements to services. The Green Paper also said that we would double, by 2013/14, the budget for Access to Work. As a consequence of these changes, we will be able to help greater numbers of disabled people prepare for, take up and retain paid work.</p>

 The adoption of a yellow and red card approach to licensing reviews does not necessarily mean the physical issue of actual cards. The term is an illustrative one used to explain how enforcement and licensing officers can put irresponsible premises on notice that they face losing their licence if they do not improve. At first review (yellow card) tough conditions can be included on the premises licence. If, after another review, there has been no improvement or the licence conditions have been breached, the licence could be suspended or revoked (red card). We are working with licensing authorities to explore how they might use such an approach to take swift and firm action against problem premises.</p>

 In response to Sir Michael Pitt&#146;s interim report, the Government agreed the need to introduce a systematic, co-ordinated, cross-sector campaign to reduce the disruption caused by natural hazards to critical infrastructure and essential services. The Government will now establish a &#145;Natural Hazards Team&#146; charged with co-ordinating efforts to identify and counter the risks to national infrastructure from natural hazards. In the short term, the systematic programme will co-ordinate the early assessment of the vulnerability and risk of flooding in the most critical elements of national infrastructure.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_93"><a name="81210w0005.htm_para5"><a name="08121026000669">The Department of Energy and Climate Change instigated reviews of the resilience of the electricity, gas and oil sectors to flood risks in 2007 and 2008. In the case of electricity, work is well advanced to identify and develop additional resilience measures on a site specific basis. The oil and gas industries demonstrated a high level of confidence in the inherent resilience of their infrastructure. However, both industries are reviewing the remaining risks to identify precautionary measures. In the telecommunications industry, the distributed network largely provides the necessary service resilience. In the water sector, Ofwat has issued guidance for water companies on flood risk assessment and identification of priority investments in preparation for the 2009 price review.</p>

 The aim of LSA is to support and improve retention by compensating those personnel experiencing separation over and above that compensated for by the X factor. The Armed Forces' Pay Review Body (AFPRB) conducted a review of the X factor as part of their 2007-08 programme, and the Government accepted the AFPRB's recommendation to increase the X factor from 13 per cent. to 14 per cent. with effect from April 2008. Importantly, since X factor is merged into basic salary, its benefit is not only in a significant increase in monthly salary, but also in pension growth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_118"><a name="81210w0007.htm_para1"><a name="08121026000973">Given this X factor provision for lower levels of separation, LSA has a qualifying period of 10 days&#146; involuntary separation before entitlement is triggered, at which point the allowance is paid with effect from the first day of separation. There is an exception for seagoing units, where LSA is awarded from the first day of departing base port, and also for &#145;on the road&#146; posts in which individuals experience high frequency of separation of periods of at least four days&#146; duration. Moreover, noting the close relationship between X factor and longer separation allowance, LSA is reviewed periodically by the AFPRB.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_119"><a name="81210w0007.htm_para2"><a name="08121026000974">The allowance is paid according to 14 different tiers, currently ranging from &#163;6.38 to &#163;26.94 (taxable) per day&#151;as recommended by the AFPRB.

 The existing Joint Policy Statement governing the South Atlantic Airbridge dates from 1992 and is based on the previous service provided by Royal Air Force TriStar aircraft. The introduction of a civilian charter service clearly required a revision to this statement, and this is being currently discussed between the MOD and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. It would be premature to comment on any of the detail of this revised statement until these discussions have been completed.</p>

However, Ordnance Survey&#146;s total direct revenue from the local government sector (including fire and police services, national park authorities and other sector bodies) in England, Scotland and Wales for the year ended 31 March 2008, was &#163;21.26 million. This represented 18 per cent. of Ordnance Survey&#146;s total turnover. A significant proportion of local government income came from the local authority Mapping Services Agreement (MSA), a collective purchasing agreement competitively tendered by Local Government Information House Ltd.

 The Government have produced a cross-Government National Domestic Violence Delivery Plan which provides a strategic framework to address domestic violence. We have taken a range of action to reduce levels of domestic violence including establishing 104 Specialist Domestic Violence Courts (SDVCs) and plan to reach 128 by 2011. We have provided over &#163;6 million this financial year to support the roll-out of Independent Domestic Violence Advisors and Multi-Agency Risk Assessment Conferences across England and Wales linked to these SDVCs. IDVAs provide invaluable support to victims of domestic violence. Evidence shows that incidents of victimisation decrease and victims are less likely to withdraw from cases.</p>

Further, the success rate on prosecuting domestic violence continues to improve. In December 2003 only 46 per cent. of domestic violence prosecutions resulted in conviction.

In 2008, the national GP Patient survey showed that patients from a black and minority ethnic group had seen the biggest improvement in their experience of accessing GPs with whom they are registered. Nevertheless, more needs, and can be, done to improve access for such patients. We are continuing to work with strategic health authorities to collate and share the best practice that exists within the national health service in order to support implementation of Professor Mayur Lakhani&#146;s recommendations.

 Funding to support sexual health services is not allocated separately to primary care trusts (PCTs) but is contained within the mainstream revenue allocations made to PCTs. It is the responsibility of PCTs to commission the health services they need to meet the health requirements of the local populations they serve. Genital warts can be diagnosed and treated in a variety of settings but currently data are only collected from genito-urinary medicine clinics, so it is therefore not possible to accurately forecast how much PCTs spent on the treatment and prevention of genital warts.</p>

 The National Assessment Agency (NAA) has in place arrangements for marking to be reviewed where a school believes that it is inaccurate to the extent that a pupil has received an incorrect national curriculum level. The NAA is currently managing the final phase of the reviews process and expects that all results will be issued to schools in the coming weeks. The great majority of schools have already received results for their review applications. Once the final phase of review marking is complete, NAA will be able to provide data on the volume of reviews for the 2008 national curriculum test cycle.</p>
