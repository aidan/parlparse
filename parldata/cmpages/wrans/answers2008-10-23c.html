<i> [holding answer 20 October 2008]:</i> The MOD&#146;s limited bilateral programme with China has been developing on a gradual basis since the then Prime Minister visited China in October 1998. The terms of the programme are: to maintain consistency with HMG policy and international restrictions; to limit the scope of activity; to ensure in-country control through oversight by the UK Defence Attach&#233;, and; to conduct regular policy review. Activities include senior leadership engagement, high-level command and staff training, junior leadership training, low-level military training, exercises (observing), disaster management training, peace support operations training, benefits to the wider military and civil communities and sport. The total amount of funding allocated in support of the programme for financial year 2008-09 is &#163;464.5,000, of which &#163;177,000 comes from the Conflict Prevention Pool. Our complete UK/China bi-lateral programme for FY 2008-09 is subject to continuing discussion, but is expected to comprise a series of high level visits, an annual programming meeting, short term training teams and courses (including English language training) related to Peace Support Operations, a small number of places for Chinese students in defence education establishments, and limited short term exchanges of service personnel.</p>

The provisions of the TCPA 1990 require that the service of an enforcement notice shall not take place less than 28 days before the date on which it is to take effect. But the guidance indicates that it may be prudent to allow a margin of several days above this minimum period so as to ensure that all interested parties receive the notice not less than 28 days before the effective date. The compliance period should be as short as can reasonably be allowed and it should not normally exceed one year. But it will be for the LPA to decide on how long it should be depending on the complexity of the case.</p>

 The Home Office has not allocated any direct funding to tackle antisocial behaviour in Jarrow which falls within South Tyneside local authority. Home Office funding allocated to the North East including South Tyneside can be found in the following table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="81023w0009.htm_para4"><a name="08102335001172">The antisocial behaviour co-ordinator funding has been renewed for the period 2008-11, and the Home Office contribution to ABG in England amounts to some &#163;61 million, with &#163;3 million available for Wales in each year (the same in cash terms as in 2007-08).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="81023w0009.htm_para5"><a name="08102335001173">The antisocial behaviour co-ordinator funding forms part of the unringfenced Area Based Grant (ABG) in England. The position in Wales is slightly different, whereby the funding for Community Safety Partnerships has been consolidated into the Crime Reduction and Anti-Social Behaviour National Resource Grant. In both England and Wales, it is for local partnerships to agree how the grants received should be allocated against locally determined priorities, including antisocial behaviour.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="81023w0009.htm_para6"><a name="08102335001174">There are many funding streams that impact on antisocial behaviour. A more detailed account can be found in the report by the National Audit Office &#147;Tackling Anti-Social Behaviour&#148; (HC99 2006-07, December 2006). Other Home Office led activities also act to tackle antisocial behaviour, for example the introduction of community support officers, but a monetary value cannot be assigned to that contribution. Similarly, other Government Departments fund services that directly bear upon antisocial behaviour. For example the Crown Prosecution Service provides a network of specialist antisocial behaviour prosecutors, and Her Majesty's Court Service provides specialist antisocial behaviour response courts. There are many other programmes and services that contribute, sometimes indirectly, to tackling antisocial behaviour, including diversionary activities for young people, action against enviro-crime such as fly-tipping, neighbourhood wardens, as well as neighbourhood policing and neighbourhood management. A more detailed account can be found in the report of, and evidence to, the Home Affairs Select Committee's report on antisocial behaviour (Fifth Report, Session 2004-05, HC80).</p>

 The process for adding information to the National DNA Database (NDNAD) has a number of elements, the costs of which fall to different parties. The process initially involves police taking a sample of a person&#146;s cells (usually by means of a swab of the inside of the cheek), following which the sample is sent to a forensic supplier who processes it to produce a profile. This is a numerical sequence representing a small part of the person&#146;s DNA. The profile is then added to the NDNAD, which operates to match profiles taken from individuals with those found at crime scenes.</p>

The Regulations govern the way in which Government contracts are advertised and awarded. For contracts over a threshold value it is a requirement for them to be advertised in the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU), which imposes strict timescales that cannot be shortened. To enable the Department to appoint a supplier in the shortest possible time, COI have a number of framework agreements (agency rosters) in place. Frameworks are themselves advertised in the OJEU, therefore contracts awarded under the terms and conditions of the framework do not need to be re-advertised or apply the strict timescales&#151;as long as timescales are reasonable to allow the suppliers time to provide an adequate response. The majority of the Department's spend with external suppliers is via these frameworks.</p>

1. In 2006 ambulance staff were collected under new, more detailed, occupation codes. As a result qualified totals and support to ambulance staff totals are not directly comparable with previous years.<br>
2. Data qualify: Work force statistics are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) In England. The NHS Information Centre for hearth and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data. Processing methods and procedures are continually being updated to improve data quality. Where this happens any impact on figures already published will be assessed but unless this is significant at national level they will not be changed. Where there is impact only at detailed or local level this will be footnoted in relevant analyses.<br>

 In the past 12 months we have helped to secure unprecedented UN Security Council action on Burma in the form of two strongly-worded presidential statements demanding: the release of political prisoners; the start of credible talks between the regime, opposition and ethnic groups; and full co-operation with the UN. We continue to work with EU partners to keep Burma on the UN Security Council agenda. A UN Security Council Resolution in the short term is not feasible as some members, including permanent members, will block action on this front.

 The Registrar of the International Criminal Court (ICC) draws up a budget for each calendar year for approval by States Parties to the Rome Statute of the ICC. The budget is prepared on the basis of assumptions about the level of activity for the following year. The overall budget for 2008 of &#8364;90.4 million was drawn up on the expectation that at least one trial would take place; and that the Office of the Prosecutor would continue to pursue investigations in four situations (relating to the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Central African Republic, Uganda and Sudan/Darfur). Following the arrest and surrender of two further individuals to the ICC, the Registrar sought permission, in accordance with the ICC Financial Regulations and Rules, to use the court&#146;s contingency fund to meet the unforecast costs relating to a second trial in 2008. This was approved but, as the first trial has now been delayed, the costs for that second trial are likely to be met within the existing 2008 budget.</p>

 In its latest report of 3 October 2007, the UN Panel of Experts (which was established by UN Security Council Resolution 1591 to monitor the arms embargo on Darfur) assessed that violations of the arms embargo continued, both by the Government of Sudan and non-State armed groups, during the period of the report (29 September 2006 to 29 August 2007). The Panel reported that heavy weapons (artillery pieces), small arms, ammunition and other military equipment were entering Darfur from other countries. The Panel further reported that the Government of Sudan had not submitted the necessary requests of approval to the UN to enable the movement of weapons, ammunition or other military equipment into Darfur, thereby knowingly violating the provisions of the Resolution.</p>

 We are not currently proposing a no-fly zone for Darfur.

The numbers of cases for the strategic health authorities (SHAs) have been grouped together at the top of the table because the total cases for each SHA are not always the same as the total cases for the primary care organisations (PCOs) reporting to the SHA.

The extension of the Special Liquidity Scheme will provide short-term liquidity. The recapitalisation through shares (both ordinary and preference) as well as Permanent Interest Bearing Shares (PIBS), will strengthen institutions&#146; resources, allowing them to restructure their finances while maintaining their support for the real economy. The credit guarantee scheme will ensure that the banking system has the necessary funds in the medium term.

 The background to the decision by HM Revenue and Customs to revise its guidance on seafarer&#146;s earnings deduction (SED) is a decision by the Special Commissioners, an independent appellate body, in the case of Torr and Others <i> v.</i> CIR (SpC679).

<p><a name="stpa_343"><a name="81023w0017.htm_para2"><a name="08102344000125">Broadly speaking, an offshore installation is a vessel that is engaged in exploiting mineral resources and is not mobile while doing so.

 The Government make available some &#163;350 million each year through the widening participation premium in the institutional funding distributed by the Higher Education Funding Council.

 The new case management system will ensure that evidence is limited to relevant issues, that witnesses at hearings are restricted to those strictly necessary to the case and are fairly balanced between parties and that adjournments largely avoided. This new process will enable the tribunal to provide more help to unrepresented parents to ensure they provide, and also obtain from the local education authority, the right information at the appropriate stages of the process.

 Case management may result in some additional upfront cost in some individual cases: whether in the form of paperwork to provide better information or a preliminary hearing, in complex cases, to identify the issues and tell the parties what they need to provide. But the case management system is designed, in the interests of the child, to ensure speedier resolution, shorter final hearings and the avoidance of adjournments by identifying the issues at an early stage and getting the right information to the tribunal at the right time.

 Key stage 2 results are a robust and consistent source of information for parents at a crucial transition point for their child as they move on to secondary school. The tests provide a view of the progress of every child, allowing teachers to best meet the needs of each child. The tests are also important in providing a suitable level of accountability for the public to hold national and local government and governing bodies to account on the performance of schools. It is appropriate that tests used for such purposes should be externally marked.</p>
