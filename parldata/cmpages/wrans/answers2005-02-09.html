<p>(2) when she plans to publish the fourth Independent Scientific Group report on Bovine TB.  [213125]</p>




<p><a name="50209w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 1 February 2005]:</i> The fourth report of the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB is being finalised. Publication is expected in early February.
</p>





<p><a name="50209w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research her Department has conducted on whether species of wildlife other than the badger are a significant reservoir for bovine tuberculosis.  [214114]</p>




<p><a name="50209w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Defra-funded research carried out by the Central Science Laboratory, on the risk to cattle from wildlife species other than badgers in areas of high herd breakdown risk, was published on 9 July 2004. Researchers isolated <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (the prime causative agent for TB in cattle) in a number of mammalian species, some for first time e.g. muntjac deer. Infection was also found in foxes, stoats, polecats, common shrews, yellow-necked mice, wood mice, field voles, grey squirrels, roe deer, red deer and fallow deer. While isolations from deer are a concern, it is not clear what, if any, contribution any of the species examined in the study make to the problem of TB in cattle.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w01.html_para0">
Further research into the role of wild deer in the perpetuation of TB in cattle is planned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w01.html_para1">
Defra has also funded a study of bovine tuberculosis in small mammals at Oxford University.
</p>





<p><a name="50209w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of whether the availability of rapid assay methods for bovine tuberculosis would assist in the detection of infection in badgers.  [214118]</p>




<p><a name="50209w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 A rapid assay method for detection of bovine tuberculosis (TB) infection in badgers is not likely to be available for field use in the short-term.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w01.html_para2">
The current TB diagnostic test for badgers, the indirect ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) test, is not sufficiently sensitive to provide reliable estimates of TB prevalence in badgers. The sensitivity of the test is 40.7 per cent. and the specificity is 94.3 per cent. when used as a single test.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1496W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w01.html_para3">
Defra is funding research into the development of immunological assays for the detection of <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i>M. bovis</i>) infection in badgers at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency. The project aims to provide Defra with both improved and new diagnostic tools for the identification of <i>M. bovis</i> in badgers. Research is due to end in March 2005.
</p>





<p><a name="50209w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of tuberculosis outbreaks in cattle over the past five years has been attributed by her officials to badger-to-cattle transmission; and what the percentage was in the previous 10 years.  [214119]</p>




<p><a name="50209w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 It is not possible at present to give a valid estimate. Research designed to inform the Government on the relative importance of cattle and badgers as vectors of the disease is continuing.
</p>





<p><a name="50209w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what assessment she has made of the likely effects of the loss of tuberculosis-free status in the UK on <i>(a)</i> intra-community trade, <i>(b)</i> trade with Russia and <i>(c)</i> trade with the rest of the world in all UK cattle products, including milk and dairy products;  [214128]
</p>



<p>(2) whether the change in the number of tuberculosis outbreaks continues at the rate experienced over the last five years; and whether she expects the tuberculosis-free status of the national herd to be lost.  [214129]</p>




<p><a name="50209w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The increasing rate in the number of tuberculosis (TB) breakdowns (an average increase of 18 per cent. per annum over the period 1986&#150;2003) will not affect the status of the national herd, because Great Britain, as a whole, does not qualify for officially TB free status according to the criteria set by the EC and the Organisation Internationale des Epizooties. However, individual herds not subjected to TB movement restrictions can be considered Officially TB Free (OTB) for the purposes of international trade in cattle products, including milk and dairy products.
</p>





<p><a name="50209w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the results of the four counties study on bovine tuberculosis in Ireland are consistent with results recorded from the study at East Offaly.  [214138]</p>




<p><a name="50209w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 In the East Offaly study the evidence of cattle infection was measured by reactor animals per 1,000 tests, whereas the main method in the Four Area Study was the odds of new herd restrictions. There was a marked decline over time in the badger removal areas compared to the reference areas in both studies. By the nature of both studies, however, it is difficult to ascribe this reduction definitely to badger removal.
</p>





<p><a name="50209w01.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what <i>(a)</i> meetings and <i>(b)</i> communications her Department has had with officials of the Irish Agriculture Ministry concerning the four counties study on bovine tuberculosis in Ireland.  [214160]</p>




<p><a name="50209w01.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Defra officials met with officials from the Department of Agriculture and Food, and scientists at University College Dublin, in October last year. This 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1497W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w01.html_para4">
I met with Irish officials on 25 January to discuss the trial results. The Chief Veterinary Officer and officials were also in attendance.
</p>





<p><a name="50209w01.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Paterson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department has made of whether it is possible for farmers to apply biosecurity measures to their cattle herds which are sufficiently stringent to prevent any cattle-to-badger contact.  [214165]</p>




<p><a name="50209w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Complete biosecurity is seldom possible where wildlife is concerned, but farmers are advised to minimise contact between their cattle and wildlife.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w02.html_para4">
<i>(a)</i> In the North West region support for the development of farmers&#039; markets is being taken forward by the North West Fantastic Food Partnership. This partnership is made up of a group of organisations from across the region whose role is to assist food producers to develop their business and market their products. The partnership is pursuing a five-year project (from November 2002 to March 2007) covering a range of activities including support for farmers&#039; markets. Funding for these activities (totalling some &#163;5.3 million) comes from the North West Regional Development Agency, Defra&#039;s Rural Enterprise Scheme and from the Merseyside Objective One programme. Specific initiatives relating to farmers&#039; markets include the improvement of existing farmers&#039; markets, the creation of new markets and the promotion of the markets to consumers.

<i>(b)</i> More generally, the Government welcome the establishment of farmers&#039; markets.

<a name="50209w02.html_para6">
Defra officials met representatives from the National Farmers&#039; Retail and Markets Association (FARMA) last July to explore how Defra could work with FARMA on the common goals of reconnecting farmers to their markets and helping them to add value. The meeting included a discussion on FARMA&#039;s priorities and how these might be supported under various grant schemes&#151;in particular the Rural Enterprise Scheme (RES) and the Agriculture Development Scheme (ADS). Farmers&#039; markets at both a regional and national level, have received funding under those schemes in the past. The meeting also covered how FARMA could raise its profile with the regional development agencies (RDAs). As a result, representatives from FARMA gave a presentation to Defra&#039;s Regional Food Cross-Cutting Group, which includes representatives from the RDAs, the Countryside Agency and the Food Standards Agency, in September 2004.

<p><a name="50209w02.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 31 January 2005]:</i> The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM) is the independent advisory committee set up by UK Government and the devolved Administrations under the Managing Radioactive Waste Safely programme to provide recommendations on the best option, or combination of options, for the long-term management of the UK&#039;s higher activity radioactive waste. CoRWM has been asked to deliver its recommendations by July 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w02.html_para12">
Nirex is a company originally set up by the UK nuclear industry in 1982 to provide radioactive waste disposal services to the industry and others. Current work includes: scientific, engineering and social science research into options for dealing with radioactive waste in the long-term; specifications and standards for the treatment and packaging of radioactive waste; and compiling the UK Radioactive Waste Inventory in conjunction with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w02.html_para13">
CoRWM and Nirex are separate and distinct bodies. Nirex will contribute to the CoRWM review as part of its work. Nirex is to be made independent of the nuclear industry and under greater Government control, through a Defra/DTI holding company, from 1 April 2005 for the period of CoRWM&#039;s work, following which these arrangements will be reviewed and a decision made on the future.

<i>[holding answer 7 February 2005]:</i> We do not hold data on the information requested. We hold data on the average cost to the applicant authority of obtaining an antisocial behaviour order (ASBO). The Campbell Review, published in 2002, provides the latest data on the cost of obtaining an ASBO. It quoted an average cost of &#163;4,800 for an ASBO but this figure was based on a small sample of orders in the early period of their introduction and was skewed by one abnormally complicated and unrepresentative expensive application. Practitioners advise that applications usually cost much less than this and that costs decrease with experience of using the orders. New research, due to be published shortly, shows that costs have reduced significantly since the Campbell Review.

<p><a name="50209w09.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 In sentencing Taulant Merdany and Elidon Bregu to terms of imprisonment, the judge recommended that they should be deported at the end of their sentences. The Secretary of State will consider whether deportation remains appropriate on completion of those sentences. When deciding whether or not to deport a person on their release from prison, the nature and seriousness of the offence will be among the factors taken into account.

<p>
<a name="50209w09.html_para6">
A deportation order will not normally be revoked earlier than three years after its enforcement. However the length of time that a deportation order should remain in force after removal will depend on the individual case. For those convicted of serious offences this may be 10 years or more.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what initiatives the Government are proposing to urge schools to collaborate on tackling disruption by pupils.  [214603]</p>




<p><a name="50209w11.html_spnew0"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 On 1 February my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State wrote to Chief Education Officers announcing that she expected that by September 2007 all secondary schools would be part of a local group of schools working together to manage pupil behaviour. To support this approach she asked that each local authority should hold discussions with its school funding forum about the adequacy of local out-of-class and out-of-school provision for persistently disruptive pupils. Officials in the Department for Education and Skills will be monitoring local authorities on these developments.
</p>





<p><a name="50209w11.html_wqn1"><b> Keith Vaz: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what role parents of disruptive children are expected to play in individual plans for behaviour support.  [214604]</p>




<p><a name="50209w11.html_spnew1"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 Supportive parents are vitally important in achieving and maintaining good behaviour in schools. We want parents to be prepared to support the behaviour policy in their child&#039;s school, and to take responsibility for their child&#039;s behaviour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w11.html_para0">
A Pastoral Support Programme is an option schools may use to help pupils to improve their behaviour. Parents of disruptive pupils are involved in the setting up and operation of individual Pastoral Support Programmes for those pupils. The teacher responsible for arranging the programme will discuss with the parents and an LEA representative the causes of concern and what is required of the pupil to put the situation right. Parents should be informed regularly about their child&#039;s progress. In some cases, a managed move to another school may be appropriate and parental agreement would be required for this.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w11.html_para1">
When a pupil is reintegrated back into school following a fixed period exclusion, the parents will normally be invited to a reintegration meeting; this provides an opportunity to discuss how best the pupil can return to school and any behavioural problems can be addressed. Where a pupil has been permanently excluded, LEAs should involve parents at an early stage in making arrangements for continuing the child&#039;s education and in discussions about alternative school places. LEAs may, through a parenting contract, offer additional help to parents in this situation such as a resource room or parenting skills training.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w11.html_para2">
For some parents, managing their children&#039;s behaviour is not easy and there is help available to help parents do this more effectively. We are encouraging schools and local authorities to engage more with parents, especially at an early stage, in guiding them towards these sources of help when their children persistently misbehave in school, using the parenting contracts that we have introduced as a framework for such agreements. Where parents are unwilling to engage then it is right that we take action to ensure that they do&#151;through parenting orders administered by the courts.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State wrote to Chief Education Officers on 1 February announcing that she expected all secondary schools to be part of a group of schools managing pupil behaviour by September 2007. By that date she expects such groups to have agreed admission protocols in place for previously excluded pupils. She also asked that local authorities should hold discussions with their school funding forums about the adequacy of provision for persistently disruptive pupils, including those who have been excluded from school. This will entail a discussion of how much funding should be retained by the LEA and how much should be devolved to schools. Devolution of funds for behaviour support and out-of-school provision to groups of secondary schools should help improve the quality of alternative provision. Officials in the Department will be monitoring progress on these new arrangements.

<sup>(6)</sup> The combined LEA and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in LEA maintained establishments and pupils educated by the LEA other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LEA expend tire except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA).<br>

<sup>(7)</sup> 1997&#150;96 financial data are taken from (pre local government reorganisation) Cheshire LEA&#039;s Revenue Outturn spending return submitted to the ODPM. 2003&#150;04 financial data are taken from Warrington LEA&#039;s Section 52 Outturn Statement (Table A) submitted to the Department for Education and Skills. 2003&#150;04 is as reported by the LEA and is subject to change<br>

<sup>(8)</sup> Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the LEA and being educated in private settings, pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and other LEA maintained pupils. The pupil data for pupils attending maintained nursery, primary, secondary and special schools are taken from the DfES Annual Schools Census. Private voluntary and independent (PVI) under 5 pupil numbers are taken from the Early Years census but are only included in the 2003&#150;04 pupil count. Other LEA maintained pupils includes al pupils attending schools not maintained by the Authority for whom the Authority is paying full tuition fees, or educated otherwise than in schools and pupil referral units under arrangements made by the Authority drawn from the Form 8b submitted to the DfES. Also inducted as other LEA maintained pupils are all pupils attending pupil referral units who are not registered at a maintained mainstream school drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(9)</sup> Local government reorganisation (LGR) took place on the 1 April 1998 where pre-LGR Cheshire LEA was split into Cheshire LEA Halton LEA and Warrington LEA. As a result, the 1997&#150;98 data is for pre-LGR Cheshire LEA and the 2003&#150;04 data is for Warrington LEA These two sets of figures are not comparable as Halton and Cheshire LEAs have higher unit cost 



than Warrington LEA which has the effect of inflating the 1997&#150;98 unit cost. In 1998&#150;99 (the first year a breakdown is available) the unit cost was &#163;2,700 in Cheshire, &#163;2,730 in Halton and &#163;2,310 in Warrington.<br>

<sup>(10)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;96 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 as reported by the LEA at 7 February 2005. <br>

<sup>(21)</sup> Financial data used to determine budget is taken to the nearest pound.<br>

<sup>(22)</sup> Due to changes in data items recorded on Section 52, school level balance data is now reported as the combination of any unspent allocations (including unspent Standards Fund grants) and the cumulative balance of income less expenditure from revenue funding sources during the financial year and any balances carried forward from previous years. Previously unspent allocations were excluded from the calculation of school balances but from 2003&#150;04 onwards we are not able to split these out and as a result these figures for 1999&#150;2000 to 2002&#150;03 may differ from figures released previously by the department.<br>

<sup>(23)</sup> School level data has only been collected by the DfES since the inception of Section 52 in 1999&#150;2000.<br>

<sup>(24)</sup> Figures for 1999&#150;2000 to 2002&#150;03 are for LEA maintained primary, secondary and special schools. 2003&#150;04 figures also include those LEA maintained nursery schools with delegated budgets.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup> 2003&#150;04 data is still undergoing data cleaning and is therefore subject to charges by the LEA which may after the results for that period.<br>

Figures for spending on smaller circulation in-house publications since 1997 are not centrally held and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w15.html_para4">
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) has two principal all staff in-house magazines: &quot;News&Views&quot; and &quot;Connect&quot;. They each have a circulation of 16,000. There are also magazines produced for Consular and FCO Services staff which have a circulation of over 1,000 and where budgets are held centrally. These figures are included in the totals. There are other in-house magazines at Posts and in Directorates, but these figures could not be produced without incurring disproportionate cost as budgets are not held centrally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w15.html_para5">
The rise in spending between 2000 and 2001 is due to &quot;News&Views&quot; magazine ceasing to be produced solely in-house and being contracted out to a professional corporate communications agency, and to the introduction of a quarterly policy-focused publication for managers: &quot;Connect&quot;. Figures for 2003&#150;04 include the contracting out of the editorial function on &quot;News&Views&quot;. This has now been brought back in-house and the two magazines are being combined so costs for 2004&#150;05 will fall.

 Benefit recipients may, at their request, have benefits paid into a Credit Union account. This is a change of approach by the Department, which until recently advised benefit recipients against payment of benefits direct into any Credit Union. The change reflects discussion with the Association of British Credit Unions that in some situations such payments will now meet the needs of benefit recipients.

The agreement covers all Credit Unions in England, Scotland and Wales reflecting that all such unions are regulated by the Financial Services Authority and can hold money on behalf of others.

As part of this new regime claimants of the rehabilitation support allowance will be required to participate in work-focused interviews and take steps to prepare for a return to work. Fulfilling both these requirements would mean claimants receiving a level of benefit payment higher than the current long-term rate of contributory incapacity benefit. People on the disability and sickness allowance would also receive a level of benefit payment higher than the current long-term rate but this will not be dependent on them taking steps to prepare for a return to work.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has had no such discussions since the June 2003 pay and modernisation agreement was signed, other than to discuss the UK-wide approach to any use of the powers contained in sections 32 and 33 of the Fire and Rescue Services Act 2004.

<p><a name="50209w21.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Raynsford: </b> 
 The current Area Cost Adjustment has been in place since 2003&#150;04. While it is generally recognised to be an improvement on the previous arrangements for reflecting additional costs to local government arising from wage differentials, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is aware of the concerns about its impact expressed by some authorities. We will therefore be ready to discuss with local government the case for a review of the ACA alongside other priorities for the forthcoming formulae review.

Note:<br>

The figures for 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05 differ from those for the earlier years in that they are budget, rather than outturn, figures, and because they also include: (a) non-domestic rates collection costs in excess of the allowance made against contributions to the pool; (b) the costs of collection of domestic and non-domestic rates due for the period up to 31 March 1990; and (c) the costs of collection of community charges. Outturn figures for 2002&#150;03 indicate however, that council tax collection costs accounted for almost 97 per cent. of the combined total nationally.<br>

 The Treasury&#039;s estimate that about &#8364;185 million, or 0.2 per cent. of the EC budget in 2003, was spent fraudulently, is derived from previous assessments by the European Anti-Fraud Office (OLAF) of the likely percentage of fraud within irregularities reported by member states. In response to pressure from the UK and other member states, OLAF&#039;s Intelligence Directorate is now beginning to work on a more accurate analysis of how much of the irregularities reported is actual fraud. We welcome and encourage this work, as we believe it is unacceptable that OLAF cannot publish an accurate figure for the amount of fraud against the Community budget. We also need this figure to assess the impact and effectiveness of anti-fraud measures taken to date, and to consider what additional measures should be considered.

Figures are cumulative. This table shows marginal deduction rates for working households in receipt of income related benefits or tax credits, where at least one person works 16 hours or more a week and where higher earnings would lead to reduced benefits or tax credits. They include the marginal effects of income tax and national insurance contributions, and the withdrawal of housing benefit and council tax benefit.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w27.html_para8">
This analysis does not take into account the way in which the new tax credits will respond to rises in income. The new tax credits only respond to rises in income in the current year of more than &#163;2,500, disregarding the first &#163;2,500 of any risk. This means that recipients will not see their tax credits reduced as soon as their income rises, so reducing the effective marginal deduction in any one year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w27.html_para9">
As a result of the Government&#039;s reforms, almost half a million fewer low-income households now face marginal deduction rates in excess of 70 per cent. than did so in April 1998. The increase in the number of households facing marginal deduction rates of between 40 and 70 per cent. is primarily due to the introduction of tax credits, and more recently the extension of support to workers aged 25 or over without children.

<p><a name="50209w28.html_spnew11"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 The Housing Executive&#039;s policy is generally to retain ownership of its Purpose Built Commercial Property Portfolio with the exception of those shop units or centres where it makes good economic sense to sell.

In considering the sale of any of its purpose-built commercial properties the Housing Executive must be satisfied that:

 There are 90 clinical psychologists in Northern Ireland working in the national health service and trained in cognitive behavioural therapy. Also it is one of the therapeutic approaches used by other disciplines such as psychiatric nurses. However, cognitive behavioural therapy is effective and used for a wide range of mental health problems and therefore it would be difficult to quantify how many are providing therapy specifically for depression and anxiety.

<p><a name="50209w29.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
 The Department for Constitutional Affairs is the Government Department responsible for upholding justice, rights and democracy. The Department&#039;s aim is to provide for effective and accessible justice for all, to ensure the rights and responsibilities of the citizen, and to modernise the law and constitution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w29.html_para2">
Currently, the Department has six strategic objectives, which cover the delivery of justice, civil and administrative law, protecting the vulnerable, modernising the constitution, increasing consumer choice and working in partnership with the independent judiciary. The Department also has seven Public Service Agreement targets to help deliver its strategic objectives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w29.html_para3">
Examples of the activity in 2004 to deliver these objectives include work with partners to make sure criminal trials are more efficient with the numbers of ineffective Crown Court trials falling from 24 per cent. in 2002&#150;03 to 16 per cent. in September 2004. The rate has reduced from 31 per cent. to 25 per cent. for the same period in the magistrates&#039; courts. The Department has also been involved in work to help people resolve their 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1605W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
disputes in the most effective way, including pilots to test the effectiveness of court-based mediation. During 2004 there was a reduction from almost 49 per cent. to 41 per cent. in those cases that had eventually to be resolved by a hearing. Another area where pilots were used successfully was for all postal voting in four regions of England at the combined European and local elections in June 2004. Voter turnout doubled in the pilot regions compared with 1999.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w29.html_para4">
The range of the Department&#039;s policies and actions is wide and the statistical information relating to all of that activity is not collected on a constituency basis. Consequently, the information requested in the question cannot be provided in the form requested except at a disproportionate cost.

<a name="50209w29.html_para5">
An example of the information available on those sites is data on persistent young offenders. The average number of days from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders sentenced between August and October 2004 was 59 days in the Lancashire criminal justice area, which covers the constituency of Burnley.

The downward trend in sitting hours in the county court since 2001 reflects the increased use of judicial case management. Greater access to alternative dispute resolution continues to have an effect on the number of cases that reach a settlement, which in turn has impacted on the level of court sitting hours.

 what the reasons were for the decision not to make negotiation compulsory in disputes between divorced or separated parents.  [210230]</p>




<p><a name="50209w30.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Leslie: </b> 
<i> [pursuant to the reply, 27 January 2005, Official Report, c.459W]:</i> The Government published &#039;Parental Separation: Children&#039;s Needs and Parents&#039; Responsibilities, Next Steps&#039; on 18 January, which sets out plans to implement a range of measures to help separating parents in dispute about future parenting arrangements, reach agreement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w30.html_para3">
The Government&#039;s plans include improvements in the information available to parents and greater use of methods such as the Collaborative Law Model, Mediation, In-Court Conciliation and the Family Resolutions Pilot Project. The Government intends strongly to promote these methods as better ways to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>9 Feb 2005 : Column 1608W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
reach agreement than through contested court hearings. All publicly funded clients will have to show that they have considered mediation. Lawyers undertaking collaborative law work in the proposed pilot will be publicly funded, if their clients are eligible. Those same lawyers would not be funded by legal aid for any subsequent litigation if an out of court settlement is not reached under the Collaborative Law Scheme and the case proceeded to court. New lawyers would need to be instructed for the court proceedings and they would be funded separately, subject to their clients&#039; eligibility. In addition, the Government, Senior Judiciary and Rules Committee plan to review court rules and practice directions so that the strongest possible encouragement is given to parties to participate in forms of dispute resolution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50209w30.html_para4">
We do not plan to make these schemes compulsory in every case, as an essential part of the process is that people come to them voluntarily and are therefore willing to participate. Further, in some cases, including those where domestic violence has been an issue, it would not always be appropriate to impose mediation on separating parents.

<p><a name="50209w32.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Hutton </b> 
<i>[holding answer 24 January 2005]:</i> By the end of January 2005, waiting times for cataract operations had been reduced to a maximum of three months and most patients can now expect to be treated within six weeks. This is four years ahead of the NHS Plan target. This is a result of sustained investment and reform in national health service services, including extra capacity supplied by the independent sector, which has so far provided over 13,000 additional cataract operations.

Milk tokens are distributed to eligible households the week before expiry date of the previous four-weekly mail out. This ensures that claimants always receive the tokens before the first Monday of week one of the four-week cycle. Claimants who notify non-receipt of tokens are offered the option to have tokens re-issued or to be sent to a new address if they have recently moved.

Claimants can request information about milk tokens by phone, letter or e-mail and all the contact details are on the letter they receive with the milk tokens.

The helpline offers claimants a number of message options for milk token guidance. This has consistently provided the relevant guidance for 70 per cent. of callers since it was established in April 2003. The remaining 30 per cent. select the option to speak to a trained operator. The combination of automated message and

Since the TDU assumed responsibility for the distribution of milk tokens to income support and jobseekers allowance there has been a large rise in the volume of calls. To help manage this increase, the TDU has installed a new system and has increased the number of trained helpline staff.

The front-end out-of-hours message provides claimants with details of the date on which the TDU will receive the latest set of instructions from the Inland Revenue and Department of Work and Pensions, as well as the date on which they should expect to receive their next set of milk tokens. This message is changed every four weeks. The message about the previous token mail out is kept on the system for two weeks so that claimants who have not received tokens know that they should ask for their tokens to be reissued.

Although the helpline was originally designed for inbound calls only helpline staff have, since November 2004 when the TDU took over responsibility for distribution of tokens to income support and income based jobseeker allowance beneficiaries, been increasingly making outbound calls in order to contact local benefit offices on behalf of claimants to help resolve milk token entitlement queries.

The incorrect message on 22 January, giving guidance about tokens until 13 December, was due to a systems error and this has now been corrected. Daily checks are now made by the TDU to ensure that all messages provide the claimant with current information.
