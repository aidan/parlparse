 My Department is the sponsoring Department for UK relations with UNESCO. It pays the UK's share of UNESCO's assessed budget. The Government's top priority for UNESCO is the achievement of the millennium development goals for education. We co-ordinate closely and regularly with other UK Government Departments and with the parallel Departments in the devolved Administrations with an interest in UNESCO's work.

 The trade and poverty programme (TPP) aims to build capacity in sub-Saharan African countries and regional organisations for trade reforms which support poverty reduction. Detailed proposals for capacity building projects have been prepared in Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Botswana and the East African community. The project design process has itself been contributing in these countries to better co-ordination between trade policy and poverty reduction and to building the national understanding and ownership of the projects which is vital for their success. Full implementation of these projects is expected to start in July 2002. DFID is also working on possible TPP projects with Lesotho, Mozambique, Zambia and the Southern African trade network and plans to make visits to assess interest in Nigeria in June and with the West African Economic and Monetary Union shortly after.

others. But negotiations on the outcomes document were difficult. The outcomes document is good on HIV/AIDS, gender equality and education. But we were not able to secure optimal language on reproductive health and child rights in the face of strong American opposition. The language on reproductive health and child rights is acceptable and the best that could be agreed by all UN member states, but is not as strong as we would ideally have liked.

<P>
<a name="20516w02.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID has been supporting the development of National Strategies for sustainable development (NSSDs) initially through working with colleagues at the OECD/DAC to produce policy guidance on this topic. This work has been taken up by the United Nations who have now developed their own policy guidance. This will be a priority issue at the World Summit on sustainable development later this year.
<P>

<a name="20516w02.html_para1">One conclusion of work so far is that developing strategies is more of a process than preparing a document that sits on a shelf. Moreover, the label does not matter. If a national strategy adheres to an agreed set of principles or characteristics of strategic processes for sustainability, then that strategy in effect becomes a NSSD. In this way, poverty reduction strategies that exhibit these characteristics (such as the integration of environmental, economic and social considerations) can be considered NSSDs.
<P>

<a name="20516w02.html_para2">As a consequence, it is not easy to quantify how many NSSDs are in place because they are identified by characteristics not labels.

This funding is intended to help schools to achieve the objectives agreed with their local education authority and set out in their Information and Communication Technology (ICT) development plan. We would expect these plans to address measures for connecting to the internet, so that schools can access the wealth of cultural, scientific and intellectual material to be found on the internet. The percentage of schools with internet connection was published in the Statistics of Education&#151;Survey of Information and Communications Technology in Schools 2001; 97 per cent. of schools are connected to the internet.

 In November 2001 the Government launched a consultation on the future role of learning partnerships.

The Government believe learning partnerships have a key role in promoting provider collaboration to deliver better lifelong learning in local areas, and in working with a wide range of partners to maximise the contribution of learning to local regeneration. The Government also wish to see better links between learning partnerships and the Learning and Skills Council. From April 2003 funding for learning partnerships, currently channelled through Government Offices, will be directed through the Learning and Skills Council. I have placed a copy of my letter to chairs in the Libraries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made of the effect of the current allocation process for lottery funds on the accumulation of unspent funds; and if she will make a statement.  [56141]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The National Lottery has raised approximately &#163;12.65 billion for good causes since its launch in November 1994, around &#163;9.1 billion of which has been spent by the National Lottery distributing bodies. This leaves a balance of about &#163;3.55 billion which distributors have not yet drawn down from the National Lottery Distribution Fund, although at the end of March 2002 distributors' total commitments stood at over &#163;4.12 billion, some &#163;570 million more than the balance held in the fund.




<P>
<P><I>16 May 2002 : Column 764W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20516w04.html_para1">Government accounting rules, and the financial directions issued to the distributing bodies by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, prevent distributors from drawing down money from the Distribution Fund before it is needed to cover expenditure incurred by grant recipients. We will, however, examine how the financial directions might be modified to allow distributors a greater flexibility in managing the funds allocated to them, to enable more funds to be committed and to allow funds which are already committed to be transferred more quickly to grant recipients.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what factors underlay the decision to reject the recommendation of the Rothschild Commission on Gambling that a charitable foundation would be the most appropriate and effective system for allocating Lottery money; and if she will make a statement.  [56142]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Following publication of a White Paper on the National Lottery in 1992 and the consultation which followed it was concluded that establishing the Lottery as a charity would blur the lines of accountability, and that under charity law many of the good causes beneficiaries which were not charities would not be eligible for funding.
<P>

<a name="20516w04.html_para2">Given the substantial sums of money involved&#151;far in excess of those estimated by the Rothschild Commission&#151;separate distributing bodies for each of the good causes were considered more appropriate, using existing bodies where possible so as not to duplicate expertise or run counter to existing strategies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make it her policy to ensure that all young people aged seven to 21 years have the opportunity to participate in arts and sports through Government or Lottery funded programmes; and if she will make a statement.  [56143]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 One of the Department's four strategic priorities is to enhance access to a fuller cultural and sporting life for children and young people. To meet this aim DCMS is working closely with DfES and Lottery distributors to deliver a number of key initiatives, including: a sporting entitlement to ensure that all children have access to two hours a week of high quality school sport and physical education; the school sports co-ordinator programme, specialist sports colleges and the New Opportunities Fund Sport and PE in School Programme to improve sports provision in schools; Creative Partnerships, a new initiative linking schools with cultural organisations which is being established in 16 deprived areas across England; Space for Sport and Arts which will improve facilities in primary schools in deprived areas; and the music entitlement which will give all primary school pupils the opportunity to learn a musical instrument.

<a name="20516w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B>

 Sport England has conducted a strategic review of all its national centres to ensure that they, and the resources required to run them, are utilised to the best effect. Sport England will shortly be meeting the London borough of Bromley, which owns the freehold of the Crystal Palace centre, to discuss a number of issues including the future development of the centre. I understand that no firm decisions have yet been taken in respect of the centre's future.

 I can confirm that neither Ministers nor officials have taken part in any bilateral meetings with their Italian counterparts during the last six months.
<P>

<a name="20516w04.html_para3">However, DCMS Ministers and officials regularly meet their counterparts from European Union member states, including Italy, at a wide range of EU meetings. These include formal and informal meetings of the Council of Ministers, working groups, committees and meetings on specific issues such as sport, tourism, cultural and audiovisual policy. We also meet in other forums, such as the Council of Europe, the World Anti-Doping Agency and UNESCO.

<P>
<P><I>16 May 2002 : Column 766W</I><P>
Afghanistan. Initially we plan to call out five consultant anaesthetists and two consultant orthopaedic surgeons to report in mid-June and four consultant general surgeons to report in mid-July. Each individual will be mobilised for a period of no more than three months, which allows a little over two months deployment in an operational theatre with the balance comprising pre-deployment training and post-tour leave. We expect to have to continue using similar, or possibly slightly higher, numbers until next spring. The requirement will be reviewed regularly to ensure that the numbers called out are the minimum required to support operations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what value he estimates attaches to the Throckmorton airfield within QinetiQ's property portfolio <i>(a)</i> as currently developed, <i>(b)</i> with an asylum accommodation centre on the airfield and <i>(c)</i> with planning permission for a science park.

<P>
<a name="20516w06.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 5 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 856W. Given that the site now belongs to QinetiQ plc, the value of the site, now and in the future, forms part of the company's commercial planning process. I am therefore withholding the information requested under Exemption 13 of the code of practice on access to Government information which relates to the maintenance of commercial confidences.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w06.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) if he will make a statement on the ownership of land at Throckmorton airfield; and what plans his Department has for the disposal of this land <i>(a)</i> to the Home Office or its agencies and <i>(b)</i> through the privatisation of Qinetiq;  [31735]
<P>
<UL>(2) what account was taken of the land and property at Throckmorton used by QinetiQ in the preparation for the privatisation of the agency; and if he will make a statement;  [31736]
<P>
(3) what impact the construction of the proposed asylum accommodation centre at Throckmorton would have on <i>(a)</i> the activities of QinetiQ and <i>(b)</i> the other defence-related activities at the airfield.  [31726]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w06.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 17 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 142W. Most of the Throckmorton site, formerly known as the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) Pershore, is now owned by QinetiQ. The remainder of the site, used last year to deal with some of the consequences of the foot and mouth outbreak, is in the final stages of being transferred to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
<P>

<a name="20516w06.html_para0">As part of the PPP process, all activities carried out by DERA were reviewed, and those which did not need to be retained within Government were transferred to QinetiQ on 1 July 2001, including those carried out at Pershore. Legally enforceable safeguards are in place to ensure that QinetiQ continue to provide key strategic facilities and services required by the Ministry of Defence. Against this background the company is free to explore other business opportunities.
<P>

<a name="20516w06.html_para1">The future provision of an accommodation centre for asylum seekers is the responsibility of the Home Office, and although QinetiQ's site at Pershore has been identified as a potential site, a final decision has yet to be made. Subject to consultation, with QinetiQ as landowner, the local planning authorities, and the local community, the final decision with regard to siting one of these centres at Pershore rests with the Home Secretary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Although we currently assess there is no significant ballistic missile threat to the United Kingdom from Libya, Libya continues to have an active programme for the development of long-range ballistic missiles. We believe that Libya is also pursuing programmes for the development of weapons of mass destruction.

<P>
<a name="20516w06.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 HMS Monmouth is currently undergoing a planned refit at Rosyth dockyard, involving necessary equipment refurbishment and enhancements to her operational and support systems. This will include enhanced aviation capability, to accommodate the Merlin helicopter, and installation of a new command support system and anti-air warfare training system. Other enhancements will also be made to her communications, administration and waste disposal systems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the planned refits are for <i>(a)</i> HMS Invincible, <i>(b)</i> HMS Illustrious and <i>(c)</i> HMS Ark Royal before the end of their service lives.  [56701]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 HMS Ark Royal completed her last planned refit in November 2001. The last planned refit for HMS Invincible commenced in September 2001 and is expected to complete and return to service in the first half of 2003. That for HMS Illustrious will commence this autumn and is expected to complete in autumn 2004. The vessels will, however, continue to undergo routine maintenance and shorter docking periods for the remainder of their service lives.

<P>
<P>

 On current plans HMS Sheffield has no further scheduled refits though she is programmed to undertake a docking period in early 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the compatibility of the pay and conditions of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment and other regiments in the British Army, excluding the Gurkhas; and if he will make a statement.  [56896]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Royal Gibraltar Regiment is a force raised in Gibraltar for service in Gibraltar. Its officers hold a Governor's Commission rather than a Queen's Commission. The Regiment has close links with the British Army, and occasionally officers and soldiers are attached for a period of time to British Army units.
<P>

<a name="20516w06.html_para2">Members of the permanent cadre of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment and the Volunteer Reserve receive the same rates of pay as their counterparts in the Regular Army and the Territorial Army, with the exception that they receive lower rates of X factor, ie 5 per cent. and 2.5 per cent. respectively, instead of 13 per cent. and 5 per cent. (the X factor is the additional element added to basic pay to reflect the differences between conditions of service in the Army and United Kingdom civilian life). The lower levels of X factor for the Regiment reflects the reduced liability for service of its members. Members of the Royal Gibraltar Regiment may also be eligible for United Kingdom service allowances provided they meet the relevant criteria.

<P>
<a name="20516w06.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 This information is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Agency staff are generally used as an interim measure to fill posts which cannot be filled conventionally in the required time scale.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what guidance is given to serving officers on the submission of letters to newspapers for publication; if the letter from Flight Lieutenant D. Holland RAF and Lieutenant James Hamblin RN to <i>The Times</i>, published on 13 May was approved by commanding officers; and if he will make a statement.  [56882]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w06.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Inquiries have revealed that there are no officers with these names in the Royal Navy and Royal Air Force. The authorship of this letter is therefore unknown. We have informed <i>The Times</i> accordingly. Queen's Regulations provide guidance to service personnel on publication of views and the requirement to seek permission beforehand. Had the letter been authentic, these procedures would have needed to be followed.

<P>
<a name="20516w07.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 In our first term, our priority was to establish a platform of macro economic stability. That we have achieved. We now need to build upon this foundation to improve the productivity and competitiveness of our economy.
<P>

<a name="20516w07.html_para2">As part of this programme, I am publishing today a report setting out the Government's strategy for the manufacturing sector; a report by the Automotive Innovation and Growth Team; and a Value-Added Scoreboard. Copies of each publication are being placed in the Libraries of the House. I have also established a new Innovation and Growth Team, on the aerospace industry.
<P>

<a name="20516w07.html_para3">UK manufacturing matters. It creates a fifth of our national output, employs 4 million people and produces the majority of our exports. It supports well paid jobs in all regions. It can make a very substantial contribution to improvements in our economy's productivity.

around the world have all faced very difficult trading conditions, as a result of the global downturn in manufacturing.
<P>

<a name="20516w07.html_para5">Looking to the future, however, the potential of the sector is strong. The United Kingdom is part of the world's largest single market as well as being one of the world's most open trading nations. This brings extra competition, but also extra opportunity. Recent surveys of industrial confidence have been positive, and there is evidence of improved global conditions.
<P>

<a name="20516w07.html_para6"><i>Manufacturing strategy</i>
<P>

<a name="20516w07.html_para7">Many UK manufacturers are world leaders. We excel in sectors such as car manufacturing, aerospace, pharmaceuticals, the electronics industry and food production. But despite its many strengths, UK manufacturing also suffers from long-standing weaknesses&#151;lower levels of skill, investment, R and D and innovation&#151;that contribute to lower levels of productivity than in France, Germany and the US.
<P>

<a name="20516w07.html_para8">The document I am publishing sets out the Government's strategy for helping manufacturing companies fulfil their potential in the UK, moving up the value chain to high skilled, knowledge intensive operations. The strategy builds on the TUC/CBI work on productivity, the dialogue at the manufacturing summit I hosted last December, and a careful analysis of the evidence.
<P>

<a name="20516w07.html_para9">A first requirement is that Government must create a sound market-oriented, stable business environment. But this is not enough. We must also encourage companies to innovate, to invest, to improve skills and use best business practice. On this basis we identify seven manufacturing pillars for our strategy:

<a name="20516w07.html_para10">Within each pillar, there are objectives and actions for Government and industry to develop. The strategy is neither a hard and fast prescription, nor a formula for instant initiatives. Instead, we offer it as the basis for continuing to develop a robust partnership with management, employees and their unions&#151;a manufacturing partnership based on best practice that must be effective at the national, regional and sectoral level.

<a name="20516w07.html_para15">I am also publishing today the first ever company wealth creation league table&#151;the Value-Added Scoreboard, which measures value added, that is sales less the cost of bought-in materials, components and services. It provides a unique tool which enables all companies, including those not currently in the Scoreboard, easily to calculate their value added from their annual report and benchmark themselves against UK and European companies in their sector that are in the Scoreboard.
<P>

<a name="20516w07.html_para16">The Scoreboard, put together by the DTI Innovation Group, contains real success stories of British manufacturing and other sectors and will help companies to learn from the record of Britain's and Europe's most successful businesses. There are five UK companies in the top 15 wealth creators in Europe&#151;Shell, BP, HSBC, GlaxoSmithKline and BT&#151;and 24 in the top 100, all highly successful companies that create high value added for the UK economy.

<P>
<a name="20516w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Public Service Vehicles (Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers) Regulations 1990 are currently being amended to reflect the introduction of regulated buses and coaches under the Disability Discrimination Act.

 <i>[holding answer 14 May 2002]:</i> London Underground is responsible for the PPP contracts for the modernisation of the underground's infrastructure. Under these contracts, the performance of the private sector infrastructure companies will be measured in terms of the capacity, reliability and ambience of the travelling environment they deliver on the tube network. Payments will increase as performance improves.
<P>

<a name="20516w09.html_para2">There is no cap on the maximum annual penalty that can be levied under the tube modernisation contracts. Indeed, if performance deteriorates below set levels, the rate at which the contractor is penalised increases. Ultimately, poor performance could result in the contractor defaulting on the contract.

HOMEBUY, local authorities and registered social landlords in London offer to encourage tenants to relinquish a tenancy on move from an under-occupied property to more suitably sized accommodation.  [56602]<P>

<P>
<a name="20516w11.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 My Department published research and good practice guidance on underoccupation in social housing in April 2001 entitled "Managing under-occupation: A guide to good practice in social housing". The research identified and evaluated the initiatives being adopted by social landlords in England to assist under-occupiers to move to a smaller home when they want to. The research showed that social landlords in London and the south-east who are short of family sized homes are the most energetic in trying to reduce under-occupation.
<P>

<a name="20516w11.html_para5">Social landlords employ a range of positive incentives from helping with the move (removal arrangements and expenses) to some form of cash payment or improvements to the property (eg redecorating, kitchen or bathroom refit, improved heating, double glazing etc.). The research showed that a combination of positive inducements and the personal approach was the most effective for encouraging moves. Specialist staff who engage with tenants on a one to one basis, discussing their requirements in detail, explaining what help and properties are available can be particularly effective at facilitating moves.

 My Department published good practice guidance on managing under-occupation in social housing in April 2001 entitled "Managing under-occupation: A guide to good practice in social housing". The guidance was widely disseminated to LAs, RSLs and other key stakeholders such as the Housing Corporation. The guidance provides good practice for those social landlords who are looking to increase the supply of family sized relets by assisting under-occupiers to move to a smaller property when they want to.
<P>

<a name="20516w11.html_para7">The guidance recognised that under-occupation is not necessarily a bad thing and in areas of low demand under-occupation strategies can be counter-productive. The primary concern for authorities must always be to ask "are we making the very best use of our stock" which requires looking at the problem in the wider context of Government policies on social exclusion and on building mixed and sustainable communities.

 I refer the hon. Member to my letter of 21 March to all MPs which set out the background to the communities' vibrancy issue and made clear that the communities' vibrancy indicator is not a measure of parish council activities. This Government are breaking new ground in actively promoting the role and importance of parish councils and I hope the hon. Gentleman will endorse and support our initiatives.

 DEFRA has funded UNED-UK to carry out a stakeholder consultation exercise which has involved over 350 groups representing civil society. A business adviser has been seconded to DEFRA to liaise with the business community on WSSD. We are also working through the Development and Environment Group of BOND (British Overseas NGOs for Development) to exchange views with NGOs, and the Local Government International Bureau has been a member of the official UK delegation at the preparatory meetings.

 The responsibility for the control of wild mink rests with those people most likely to benefit from such control, the individual landowners and occupiers. Predation by mink has been a factor in the decline of our native water vole population. The Government's Biodioversity Action Plan for water vole encourages control of mink where they pose a threat to water vole populations.

 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, announced the publication of the Government Response to the draft Water Bill consultation on Thursday 2 May.
<P>

<a name="20516w15.html_para1">The Water Bill aims to ensure improved management of our water resources; place consumers at the heart of a more open and accountable regulatory process and increase the powers of courts and the Regulators to level appropriate financial penalties on water companies. In addition, the Bill will contain provisions for extending competition for users of large amounts of water.
<P>

<a name="20516w15.html_para2">The consultation response considered in detail more than 150 responses and following this, a number of amendments will be made to the draft Water Bill. The main changes are; firstly that Ofwat will be governed by a Regulatory Board rather than an individual Director General, along similar lines to other economic regulators. This is instead of the Advisory Panel proposed in the Draft Bill. Secondly, the Director General's duties to ensure that companies can secure "reasonable returns on their capital" will not be altered. And thirdly the Director General of Water Services will be given a sustainable development duty. While this will not alter the Director General's purpose or aims, it will oblige him to be

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> The Government's current timber procurement policy became a binding commitment for central Government Departments and their agencies with effect from 28 July 2000, following a written reply to a parliamentary question on that day by the Minister for the Environment, <i>Official Report</i>, column 947W. This followed the G8 summit earlier in July 2000, where in response to a UK led initiative members agreed to consider how public purchasing could help reduce illegal logging. Prior to the policy becoming a binding commitment it had been part of the model policy for greening government operations since 1997.

 The Common Fisheries Policy was substantially laid down in regulations adopted in 1983 which specified an interim review in 1992 and a further review in 2002.

 Our primary objective for the Common Fisheries Policy must be for a policy which is both economically and environmentally sustainable and one which involves stakeholders more closely in management decisions affecting them. Only in that way will the CFP attract support and credibility from fishermen and so ensure responsible stock management and give the promise of a viable future. I strongly agree with the Commission's conclusions in their Green Paper on the operation of the CFP that it is not meeting its objectives. The forthcoming review of the CFP will give the opportunity not only to put right what has gone wrong but also to consider how the CFP should develop over the coming years.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the prospects for the dairy industry.  [55147]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The current low price of milk has undoubtedly reduced the income of many dairy farmers to levels that appear unsustainable in the long term. However, this low price has largely been caused by factors that are temporary in nature, most notably, oversupply of raw milk in the UK and the weakness of EU and world markets for dairy products.
<P>

<a name="20516w16.html_para6">For the longer term, it is likely that the next round of WTO agriculture negotiations will further restrict the use of export subsidies and the increasing exposure of EU markets to world markets. In addition, enlargement of the EU is likely to lead to pressure on the Community budget, if the CAP is not reformed.
<P>

<a name="20516w16.html_para7">In order to produce a sustainable dairy industry that can compete successfully on the growing world market for dairy products, the industry must be given the opportunity to trade free of artificial constraints imposed by the WTO, as well as by the EU dairy regime. The EU price support system is focused on butter and skimmed milk powder, both in clear surplus, hampering the development of the most efficient farmers and represent significant financial burden to most farmers.
<P>

<a name="20516w16.html_para8">The Government therefore favour the orderly phasing out of milk quotas in combination with a reduction in EU support prices to world prices, and direct but degressive aid to help farmers adjust to the new regime. During the forthcoming review of the milk quota system, due to start in June, the UK will be pressing to achieve confirmation that quotas will not continue after they lapse on 31 March 2008. These changes are intended to provide longer-term direction within the framework of the dairy regime, which farmers need in order to plan their businesses effectively.

 We have considered the case for payment of optional agrimonetary compensation to the livestock sector.

<a name="20516w17.html_spnew1"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 May 2002]:</i> I have no plans at present to introduce such a scheme. We consulted on the early retirement provisions of the EU Rural Development Regulation when drawing up plans for implementation of the regulation, but in the light of responses to that consultation we decided that the limited funds available for implementation would be better directed towards other measures to assist the industry. This is because the type of early retirement scheme available under the regulation could not be targeted effectively towards those who should benefit, such as tenant farmers.
<P>

<a name="20516w17.html_para0">The general question of policy on helping farmers to leave the industry will, however, be considered further in the light of the feedback we receive on the issues we have asked stakeholders to consider following publication of the Policy Commission report.

In order to meet the aims of the Common Agricultural Policy, SCAR advises the Commission on co-ordination and promotion at Community level of agricultural research activities undertaken in the member states. SCAR met twice (19 June 2002, 11 March 2002) over the last 12 months for half-day meetings on both occasions. UK representation is normally the Head of Research Policy and International Division in DEFRA with supporting staff, and the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC). This cost of this work to the public purse of DEFRA is about &#163;8,500 per annum, including staff time and travelling expenses. SCAR has been examining in particular the development and implementation of the proposed new Framework Programme 6 for collaborative EU research, technology and development in those areas within its competence and interest. The papers of SCAR meetings are available on www.europa.eu.int/comm/agriculture.

 <i>[holding answer 19 April 2002]:</i> There are various grant schemes and spending programmes through which DEFRA, the Countryside Agency and English Nature provide funding to organisations in the voluntary and community sector.
<P>

<a name="20516w19.html_para1">DEFRA makes funding available to the voluntary and community sector through the Wildlife and Countryside Research Programme, the Environmental Action Fund and the Rural Stress Action Plan. Funding is also made available directly to the National Federation of Young Farmers Clubs, ENCAMS and National Energy Action.
<P>

<a name="20516w19.html_para2">The Countryside Agency has a variety of funding streams to which voluntary sector organisations and other groups are eligible to apply, flowing from its work on rural services (including community development and social exclusion), Rural Housing Enablers, market towns, its Vital Villages programme (including Community Services Grant and Rural Transport Partnership), the Wider Welcome scheme (including national trails maintenance and rights of way work), and the Walking Your Way To Health initiative.
<P>

 We have already made considerable support available to encourage conversion to organic farming and will continue to do so. We have budgeted expenditure of &#163;140 million over the lifetime of the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP), which should triple the area under organic management by 2006. And, through both the Rural Enterprise Scheme and the Processing and Marketing Grant, the ERDP provides opportunities for these sectors of the industry to improve their competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="20516w19.html_para4">The development of the organic sector will be carried forward by an organic action plan which is being drawn up with stakeholders. We hope to complete this work by July.

<a name="20516w19.html_para7">Several of the members of CERRIE are on record as having strongly held contradictory views about the radiation risks from internal emitters. The CERRIE meetings are intended to provide an opportunity for those differences of opinion to be debated, at length, in an environment that will encourage consensus to be reached, as far as that is possible. Holding the meetings in private will aid the uninhibited expression of views and the ability, where appropriate, for individuals to change their minds in the light of the evidence before them. However, in order to be transparent about their discussions, CERRIE are preparing their own website which will include, among other things, summary minutes of their meetings. CERRIE's final report to the Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) will also be published.

 Draft regulations have been laid in both Houses, together with a regulatory impact assessment and an analysis of the responses made to the draft regulations circulated in July 2001.

 While we have received no recent representations, we have recognised for some time that increased flood risk is one of the significant issues arising from climate change. Indeed the Government have issued guidance on expected sea level rise since the 1980's. Last year we published an assessment that showed that without present adaptation policies, such as formal defences, managed realignment, wetland creation etc., average annual flood damage from rivers could increase by some 60 per cent. and on the coast by around 400 per cent. This emphasised the need for an appropriate precautionary response.

 We do not collect information on the gender or ethnicity of people summoned to be, or sitting as, jurors. One of the main reasons for this is that jury summoning and selection is random at each stage, and it should therefore reflect the gender and ethnic breakdown of those who are registered to vote. This should also reflect regional variations, as catchment areas are based on the locality to the court.

<a name="20516w22.html_para0">The Children Act 1989 came into force on 14 October 1991. Under the Act, the use of wardship by local authorities is severely limited. Leave to make an application for any exercise of the court's inherent jurisdiction must be granted by the High Court. Applications by private individuals are not restricted, but the same results can generally be achieved by obtaining a prohibited steps or specific issue order under section 8 of the Act. Statistics have not been collected since 1991 because the number of wardship orders made has been negligible.

 The precise information requested is not collected, but the information in the table has been provided by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) using returns supplied by police forces of the number of officers undertaking particular classes of duty. The basis on which HMIC classify police service staff changed in the year 1999&#150;2000 so the figures for 31 March 2000 and 31 March 2001 are not directly comparable with those for earlier years.
<P>

<a name="20516w22.html_para12">The figures up to and including 31 March 1999 cover officers classified as undertaking patrol or traffic duties in roles that could only be filled by a police officer.

<a name="20516w22.html_para13">The figures for 2000 and 2001 cover operational officers classified as undertaking foot, car or beat patrol, traffic duties, working with police dogs and mounted officers. Operational officers are any, including covert staff, whose primary role is directly to deliver the overarching aims of the police service. Operational officers will not necessarily undertake duties in uniform but the vast majority undertaking patrol functions will do so.

Statistical Return from police forces, are given. The definition of domestic violence incidents used for the figures up to 1998&#150;99 was as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Any form of physical, sexual or emotional abuse which takes place within the context of a close relationship. In most cases, the relationship will be between partners, married, cohabiting or otherwise; or ex-partners.

Changes in numbers of domestic violence incidents recorded may be due to increased willingness on the part of victims to report these crimes, and to changes in force policy in how to handle and record such incidents. In particular, Lancashire changed their recording and reporting procedures in the 2000&#150;01 financial year, resulting in a higher figure for that year.

<a name="20516w23.html_para5">It should be noted that recorded violent crime is subject to changes in reporting and recording. The 2000&#150;01 figure for Lancashire may have been affected by new recording practices introduced by the force in April 2000. Also, for example, the 2001 British Crime Survey found that, over England and Wales as a whole, reporting to the police of common assault rose from 29 per cent. in 1999 to 39 per cent. in the year 2000.
<P>

<a name="20516w23.html_para6">The British Crime Survey has shown that, in England and Wales as a whole, the number of common assaults recorded in the survey decreased by 14 per cent. between the 1999 and 2000 calendar years, whereas common assaults recorded by the police increased by an estimated 9 per cent. Common assaults recorded by the police may therefore not necessarily be a reflection of the real level of this offence.

 Natural Justice, a registered charity, undertook a research project at Aylesbury young offender institution in 1996&#150;97 to monitor the effects of nutritional supplements on the behaviour of young offenders. The behaviour of the young offenders was measured before and after by looking at the number of minor and Governor reports. The results were independently reviewed by the Home Office's Research, Development and Statistics Directorate (RDSD) who concluded that the results demonstrated a positive effect of nutritional supplements on behaviour. However, the numbers involved were small which made drawing wider conclusions difficult.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what progress has been made by the <i>(a)</i> Ministerial Committee on Animal Rights Extremism and <i>(b)</i> police unit within the National Crime Squad on violent animal rights protests.  [57015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w24.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Ministerial Committee on animal rights extremism has taken a range of measures, including agreeing upon and implementing legislation to allow police to remove intimidatory protesters from outside homes, introducing procedures to prevent disclosure of the home addresses of directors of vulnerable companies, and carrying out a thorough review of the criminal justice system in relation to animal rights cases and identifying improvements where necessary.
<P>

<a name="20516w24.html_para1">The National Crime Squad has undertaken a number of operations which have resulted in the arrest of 70 individuals for a variety of offences relating to animal extremism, and has supported colleagues nationally in the co-ordination of both intelligence and operational activity.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced on 27 June last year the provision of &#163;15 million over three years from the Capital Modernisation Fund to assist small retailers in deprived areas to improve the security of their businesses. &#163;3 million was available in the 2001&#150;02 financial year, with a further &#163;6 million in both 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="20516w24.html_para2">This money, which is being spent on schemes identified by Regional Crime Reduction Directors, in conjunction with Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, is being used to help small retailers to improve security. This is being achieved by employing a variety of interventions, including enhancing the security of individual premises and improving the environment of shopping centres. Nearly 3,000 shops in 114 retail schemes in some of the most deprived areas in England and Wales benefited from first year funds. More shops will be assisted in the next two years.
<P>

<a name="20516w24.html_para3">The Home Office has also supported work undertaken to establish retail crime partnerships by funding a consultant post for the past two years. The consultant has worked closely with the British Retail Consortium to produce a definitive guide on how to establish and run a retail crime partnership and encouraged retailers and other stakeholders in main shopping centre areas to establish partnerships to tackle retail and related crime.
<P>

<a name="20516w24.html_para4">Funding totalling &#163;223,000 was also given to aid retail crime reduction initiatives under various programmes administered by regional crime reduction directors in the financial year ending 31 March 2002 and a further &#163;86,500 is expected to be disbursed through regional crime reduction directors specifically for retail crime reduction initiatives in the current financial year.
<P>

<a name="20516w24.html_para5">Other funding under the Crime Reduction Programme, such as the &#163;170 million for schemes for the installation of closed circuit television, particularly in town centres, will help to reduce shop theft as well as other types of crime. Other initiatives such as the street wardens schemes will also be of benefit to retailers in the areas where they operate.
<P>

<a name="20516w24.html_para6">The Home Office also makes advice available to retailers and crime reduction practitioners on the crime reduction website, including best practice guidance in the "Toolkit" on Business and Retail Crime give website address. Booklets which give crime reduction guidance to retailers have also recently been updated and give advice in a user-friendly postcard format leaflet entitled "Don't Discount Crime".

<P>
<a name="20516w24.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Spring: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the proposed EU arrest warrant will apply to extradition requests by military tribunals.  [54210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Our extradition law currently provides that we cannot extradite for offences which are purely military offences and have no equivalent under general criminal law. We intend to replicate that provision in the new law. However, we have always been prepared to extradite in cases where an individual has committed a military offence which has a counterpart under criminal law. It is therefore legally possible under present arrangements, although exceptionally rare, for an extradition partner to seek the return of an individual to appear before a military court.
<P>

<a name="20516w24.html_para7">Under the terms of Article 6 of the Framework Decision on the European Arrest Warrant, it is the responsibility of each member state to designate its issuing judicial authorities. In principle, it would therefore be possible for a European Arrest Warrant to be issued by a military tribunal, although such instances are likely to be rare.

 The information requested for different pensioner groups has been provided on the same basis. Figures have been provided where sample sizes and other factors dictate that they are sufficiently robust. In the case of the information requested for single pensioners, sample sizes for single men were too small to allow robust comparisons over short time periods to be carried out, whereas sample sizes for single women were larger as there are more of this group in the population.

 The information on reciprocal social security agreements with other countries is as follows.
<P>

<a name="20516w26.html_para4">The main purpose of such reciprocal agreements is to protect the social security position of workers moving between the two countries during their working lives. They prevent employees, their employers and the self-employed from having to pay social security contributions to both the home state and the state of employment at the same time and ensure that such workers' rights to certain benefits are maintained. They vary to some extent from country to country depending on the nature and scope of the other country's social security scheme. Generally, they cover contributory benefits in respect of the following contingencies: sickness, invalidity, unemployment, retirement, bereavement and industrial injuries. Workers who have contributed to both countries' schemes during their working lives can usually receive an old age pension from each country which reflects the proportionate amount or their insurance in, or contributions to, each country's scheme.

For those complaints where there was evidence of maladministration which warranted full investigation, the table sets out how many complaints were upheld as being fully or partially justified. The parliamentary ombudsman's annual reports for the period 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01 inclusive are available in the Library and can be viewed on the parliamentary ombudsman's website at www.ombudsman.org.uk/publications.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many newly qualified pensioners have lost part of their state retirement pension in each of the past five years on account of failure to apply within three months of the qualifying date for first payment; what the total was in <i>(a)</i> unpaid pension entitlement and <i>(b)</i> discretionary payment of restored pension in cases where administration failure has occurred; and if he will make a statement.  [56590]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Because pensioners can elect to defer payments of their pensions for up to five years in order to earn increments which increase the amount payable, information on the number of people who fail to make a claim for state retirement pension within the statutory period is not available.
<P>

<a name="20516w27.html_para0">In a very small number of cases administrative failure causes the late payment of entitlements. Where this is the case extra statutory payments of state retirement pension are paid. Details of payment in the last five years are set out in the table.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans he has to reduce non-attendance at personal capability assessment examinations for incapacity benefit.  [57614]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 When people claim incapacity benefits they are normally required to undergo a Personal Capability Assessment carried out by SchlumbergerSema Medical Services on behalf of the DWP. Currently, around 25 per cent. of customers nationally do not attend their appointment, which are arranged by correspondence.
<P>

<a name="20516w27.html_para1">A telephone appointment booking service has been piloted in Derby and Stoke (from October 2001) and in Liverpool (Bootle and Mann Island), Acton and Euston (from February 2002). This has proved very successful in reducing non-attendance, reducing waiting time for customers at medical centres and allowing customers to discuss the PCA process with staff prior to their appointment. As well as providing a better customer service, the new process has improved administration and made better use of doctors' time. We therefore intend to adopt the process nationally by the end of June 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions when he will publish the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of Derby city council.  [57615]<P>

<P>
<a name="20516w27.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's report on Derby city council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20516w27.html_para2">The report finds that there are inconsistencies in the way that Derby city council administers benefit. On the one hand, the council gives a high priority to promoting and paying benefit and is commended for these activities. However, local authorities also have a duty to safeguard their activities against fraud, irregularity and corrupt practices. At Derby, BFI finds that the council has neglected counter fraud activity, detecting error and recovering overpaid benefit.
<P>

<a name="20516w27.html_para3">The BFI commends the council for its work on benefits take-up and social policies which support the high level of importance that elected members give to promoting and paying benefit and to providing a high quality customer

service. However, the BFI is extremely concerned that this has been prioritised to the detriment of other responsibilities. Inspectors found the council has created an environment where benefits, overpayments and counter fraud sections have been hindered from focusing on reducing fraud and error.
<P>

<a name="20516w27.html_para4">Management checking was abandoned in August 1999 due to IT problems and as a result there is no assurance on the security on access to benefits.
<P>

<a name="20516w27.html_para5">The report finds that the council has carried out counter fraud activities simply to achieve Weekly Benefits Savings targets, with little commitment to reducing, deterring or eradicating fraud and error. The fraud team has been managed on a part-time basis since September 2000 and little effort has been made to prosecute fraudsters.
<P>

<a name="20516w27.html_para6">The report makes a great number of recommendations to the council to help to raise the standard of both benefits administration and counter fraud work.

The Department's agencies are Medicines Control Agency, Medical Devices Agency, NHS Pensions Agency, NHS Estates, NHS Purchasing and Supplies Agency. They are not always recorded separately and therefore a split between them cannot be shown.<P>

All figures are for employment tribunal cases and not "the courts".<P>

The costs given relate to settlement costs and counsels' fees.<P>

Cases concluded in our favour are cases that have been dismissed, withdrawn, struck out or settled. The Department chooses to settle in some cases to ensure cost effectiveness. It is not normally for a large sum of money.<P>

The part time pension cases concern issues of equal pay and sex discrimination and they are on-going (commenced in 1995).<P>

The approaches to data collection will be tested to ensure that it is robust before publishing the results. It is likely that in due course, data on clinical performance will be published in line with that on national health service hospitals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20516w29.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Over the last 18 months we have spent &#163;100 million on modernising national health service dentistry. &#163;10 million of this was for the dental care development fund and the dentistry action plan fund to support local plans to improve access. This money enables health authorities to assist dentists seeking to set up new practices and to expand and modernise existing ones. Furthermore, the &#163;35 million modernisation fund provided grants for dentists to improve facilities.
<P>

<a name="20516w29.html_para5">Additionally, the commitment payment scheme, introduced from April 1999, provides incentive payments to dentists, depending on how much NHS work they undertake. From April 2002, the scheme was extended to include dentists who have five years or more service in the NHS. Officials continue to work with the profession to see how the scheme might be strengthened in the future. The Department is also undertaking work with the profession and other stakeholders through the modernising project "Options for Change", to test out new methods of providing NHS dentistry.

 Very few dentists leave the general dental service (GDS) totally to practice privately. However, dentists in the GDS can vary their level of commitment to the GDS, for example by increasing the amount of their private work.
<P>

<a name="20516w29.html_para6">The number of dentists leaving the GDS is shown in the table for the years 1998&#150;99 to 2000&#150;01 for England together with the percentages of the number of dentists at the beginning of the year.

<a name="20516w29.html_para7">The number of leavers covers all reasons for leaving the GDS including retirement from dental work and dentists taking career breaks. These figures are inflated by the transfer of some dentists from the GDS to some personal dental service pilots.

 In relation to countering fraud in the national health service, section 39 of the Health Act 1999 introduced a new specific criminal offence for evasion of NHS charges. The offence attracts a fine, on conviction of up to &#163;2,500. This is the first time that legislation has been introduced to create a criminal offence for people who fail to pay any amount in respect of NHS charges or receive a payment or benefit towards the cost of NHS charges or services to which they are not entitled.

 This is a matter for the Food Standards Agency (FSA). The FSA is aware of consumers' concerns about the possible effects of colours and other additives in food on some children. The FSA spends about &#163;800,000 a year looking at the general area of food intolerance. This includes a project on food additives and child behaviour that has been submitted for publication and is currently undergoing peer review. In July 2000, the Independent Expert Committee, the committee on toxicity which advises the FSA, published its review of the scientific evidence on adverse reactions to food. It concluded that most adverse reactions are to natural foods rather than synthetic additives. It noted that there has been weak but conflicting evidence for an association between particular food additives and a specific condition known as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children. The committee concluded that in general
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"some dietary changes, not necessarily the same for all children, could reduce problem behaviour in at least a few children with ADHD".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20516w31.html_para1">Independent experts agree that the link between food additives and adverse effects on behaviour is not conclusive and that a lot more research is required in this area.

 The independent expert group on mobile phones (the Stewart Group) was set up to investigate the public health implications of mobile phone technologies. Their report was published in May 2000 and included a recommendation to set up a substantial research programme. This programme, jointly funded by government and industry, was announced in December 2000 and was launched at a public meeting in February 2001. The research is being undertaken under the direction of an independent programme management committee under the chairmanship of Sir William Stewart. The selection and management of studies is solely in the hands of this committee with additional scientific advice from other experts in the relevant field.
<P>

<a name="20516w31.html_para2">There have been two invitations for research applications, in February and December 2001, and research is now under way in the first tranche of projects. Details of this research are given on the mobile telecommunications health research programme's (MTHR) website at www.mthr.org.uk Shortlisted proposals submitted to the second invitation are currently under consideration by the programme management committee.
<P>

<a name="20516w31.html_para3">The aim of the second call was to extend the range of research being carried out under the aegis of the MTHR programme and some of the proposals are of direct relevance to exposures to radio frequency (RF) radiation from mobile phone masts. However the emphasis of the research, both funded and submitted, has been on mobile phone handsets rather than masts because localised exposures of people using phones are in general appreciably higher than exposures to the whole body from masts. In practice many of the experimental studies on hand sets will also be valuable in providing evidence on any possible effects on people of exposures to RF radiation from masts.

 The Hillingdon Hospital Trust has recently submitted a strategic outline case for modernising the Mount Vernon site to the Directorate of Health and Social Care&#151;London for London and the case is currently under evaluation. The development would provide a new ambulatory diagnostic and treatment centre with strong community links. In planning the diagnostic and treatment centre, the trust aims to work with Hillingdon Primary Care Trust in order to determine what additional services could be provided on the site but as yet these have not been firmly established.
