 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have been receiving an increasing number of claims for repayment of VAT under the 8th and 13th EC VAT Directives which have not been supported by all the required documentation, including valid VAT invoices. HMRC have found that the previous controls for dealing with such claims are not sufficiently robust and are being abused. HMRC have therefore decided that they must tighten their procedures and have recently reminded businesses that claims must be supported by all the required documentation, and about what details a valid VAT invoice must contain. These rules apply equally to all businesses and are no different to the rules that apply domestically for businesses seeking to recover VAT incurred on their purchases.

<i>[holding answer 7 November 2005]:</i> Crowding on all London passenger services, including between Hastings-London Victoria and Brighton-London Victoria are measured against Passengers in Excess of Capacity Rules (PIXC) rules. This is against the number of seats on longer-distance services and against total capacity (seats plus, standing) for services where the first stop that passengers alight (or last stop where passengers board) is not more than 20 minutes from the terminal station. This allows for the scheduled stops within the 20 minute threshold at Clapham Junction and East Croydon in both directions.

<a name="51111w06.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_33">The latest available count data (2004) shows that all morning and evening peak Brighton to Victoria and Hastings to Victoria services are within their official passenger capacities, except for the 1632 Victoria to Brighton service. The Train Operating Company has allocated less carriages to the 1632 Victoria to Brighton train in order to provide longer trains to meet the greater passenger demand in the high peak period after 1700. However, an alternative service between Victoria and Brighton is scheduled shortly after this service at 1636, and this does provide spare capacity.

 The use of stone mastic asphalt materials (SMA) for road resurfacing was assessed by the Highways Agency in the 1990s. As a result of concern regarding the loss of surface texture required for high-speed skid resistance, its use was prohibited as a surfacing on trunk roads including motorways in England. Proprietary materials based on SMA, known as &#039;thin surfacings&#039;, have been developed to address the surface texture concern and these are now widely used on the trunk road and motorway network. The Department, on behalf of the UK Roads Board has commissioned best practice guidance for local authorities on how and where thin surfacings and SMA can be applied. The results of this research will be available early next year.

<p><a name="st_69"><a name="51111w08.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Plaskitt: </b> 
 Measurement of fraud and error in benefits is complex and expensive, therefore the Department concentrates on those benefits with the highest level of risk. We carry out continuous measurement of loss through fraud and error in jobseeker&#039;s allowance, income support, pension credit and housing benefit and we conduct reviews of other benefits. For example a national benefit review of disability living allowance was conducted in 2004 and the results published in July 2005 as &quot;Fraud, Error and other Incorrectness in disability living allowance&quot;, which is available in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51111w08.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_41">We are committed to continuing these reviews, and over the next few years we will be carrying out a series on other benefits which have a high level of expenditure and potential risk of loss. We envisage that this will enable us to publish a more accurate figure for loss through fraud and error.

 The percentage of looked-after children convicted or subject to a final warning or reprimand fell from 10.3 per cent. in 2001 to 9.3 per cent. in 2004. Our work to raise educational achievement and improve placement stability will contribute towards continued reductions in offending and improvements in other outcomes for looked after children. Funded by the Government, MACRO have recently published a good practice guide on reducing offending by looked after children, which reinforces the message that looked after children must be provided with constructive supervision and guidance to reduce the risk of offending, and that those who have offended must be offered appropriate services to minimise the likelihood of re-offending. This publication has been distributed to all Directors of Children&#039;s Services and all YOT managers. We intend to consult early in 2006 on further wide ranging proposals for transforming outcomes for looked-after children.

Once it has been agreed, the SENCO should have responsibility for the day-to-day operation of the policy and for co-ordinating provision for pupils with SEN, particularly through &quot;School Action&quot; and &quot;School Action Plus&quot;.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills pursuant to the answer of 7 November 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 132W, on trust schools, how many schools have <i>(a)</i> applied for, <i>(b)</i> received and <i>(c)</i> been refused permission to borrow against their assets in each year since 1997; and what the current total amount is of such borrowing, broken down by category of maintained school.

 We have not received any applications for permission to borrow. Guidance to schools sets out our policy that we think such borrowing will rarely represent value for money. This is because the cost of a commercial loan, which includes an element of profit and an allowance for risk, will always tend to be more expensive than the alternative of direct funding by Government. A small number of schools and local authorities have made inquiries, but we do not keep records of this.

Partnership working has allowed schools to target resources and strategies to raise attainment across whole communities. Strands such as Gifted and Talented, Learning Mentors, Learning Support Units, City Learning Centres, Aimhigher and Study Support have, among other things, pioneered personalised learning programmes; tackled barriers to learning; extended study opportunities for pupils, providing access to state of the art ICT; enabled ICT led innovation in the delivery of the curriculum; fostered new approaches to teaching and learning; kept at risk pupils in school and engaged in the curriculum; and enhanced continuing professional development for teachers.

 The Counter Fraud and Security Management Service (CFSMS) risk measurement methodology is applied to accurately measure losses to fraud in areas of national health service spending in order to identify the scale of the problem and take firm action to prevent this from occurring.

Continued measurements of losses to fraud will take place as weaknesses are identified and substantive budgets affected. This is and must be an ongoing process as spending areas and budget allocations will continue to change. As such, there can be no accurate overall estimate of the outstanding amount of fraud in the NHS, only a continuous effort to identify weaknesses as budgets and policies change and evolve.

Notes:<br>

1. A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data&#151;that is, the data is ungrossed. Hospital episode statistics, NHS Health and Social Care Information Centre.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Registration data include personal dental service counts of patients seen in the past 15 months as a proxy for registrations for some schemes. This is to give greater consistency with registrations data for the GDS, which has a 15 month re-registration period. Many PDS schemes use longer periods and some, such as dental access centres, do not require patients to register.<br>

2. Registration rates (the percentage of the population registered with a dentist) have been estimated by including registrations in the area of the dentist, that is according to the postcode of the dental surgery and not the patient&#039;s address. So the registration rates for some areas may be affected by some patients receiving dental treatment in a different area from the one in which they live. The figures were calculated using population estimates for the primary care trust areas for the nearest year for which data is available.<br>

<p><a name="st_113"><a name="51111w27.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Howells: </b> 
 The British high commissioner in Colombo, accredited to the Maldives, has raised our concerns on the trial of Mohamed Nasheed and current political events on several recent occasions. He did so on 26 September with President Gayoom of the Maldives and on 31 October with the Foreign Minister, Ahmed Shaheed.

<a name="stpa_120">The deputy high commissioner also raised these issues with Foreign Minister Ahmed Shaheed in August 2005, shortly after Mr. Nasheed&#039;s arrest, and on 27 October, following his first court appearance.

<a name="51111w27.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_121">The British high commission is active in co-ordinating EU action locally. It led an EU fact-finding mission to the Maldives in August that met Government Ministers, officials and detainees, including Mohamed Nasheed. An EU statement issued on 2 September, emphasising the responsibility of the Maldivian authorities to uphold the right of political parties to meet freely and to carry out peaceful political activities. It noted the seriousness of the charges against detainees, called for due process, and made clear that the credibility of such trials would be scrutinised closely. We will continue to underline to the Government of the Maldives its democracy and human rights obligations, both bilaterally and with our EU partners.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what representations he has made to the Government of Sudan on coordinated offensive operations undertaken by the Government of Sudan and the Janjaweed Arab militia in Darfur <i>(a)</i> on 18 September in Khartoum Djadeed, Sandego, Khasantongur, Tary, Martal and Djabain and <i>(b)</i> on 28 September, in Arusharo, Acho and Gozmena.

 On 18 and 28 September respectively, Arab Militias attacked the towns and surrounding areas of Khartoum Djadet and Aro Sharrow. We also received unconfirmed reports that the Government of Sudan&#039;s airforce acted in co-ordination with the militias during these attacks. The African Union is investigating these incidents and we await their report. Offensive military overflights by the Government of Sudan would constitute a breach of its obligations under the Abuja Security Protocol and, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1591, those responsible are liable to be targeted with a travel ban and assets freeze.

 The Government remain concerned about the human rights situation in Tibet. Issues of specific concern include interference by the Chinese/Tibetan authorities in the religious activities of the Tibetan people. The Government support some project work in Tibet and we monitor developments in the region closely.
