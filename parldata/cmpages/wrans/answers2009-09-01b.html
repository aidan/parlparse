 The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) was formed in May 2007. The number of press officers employed by the MoJ in 2007-08 (as at 31 March 2008) was 33. The number employed in 2008-09 (as at 31 March 2009) was 40. This includes a member of staff on maternity leave. The MoJ press office operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, dealing with all media relations for the department and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) from the international, national and regional media. The MoJ is one of the largest Departments in Government. It is right that the public know and understand the work of the MoJ and its agencies and how taxpayers' money is being spent. Communications, including the work of the press office, is an important element of this. The rise in the number of press officers is attributable to the need to increase the capability of the press office to deal with the expanded remit of the work undertaken by the MoJ, compared to its previous incarnations, and to fill vacancies.</p>

 The staffing levels of the British Forces Post Office are determined by the requirement to ensure that our personnel have access to appropriate postal facilities. Support to operations, exercises and to HM Ships can be provided only by British Forces Post Office staff. However, we have identified that savings may be realised if personnel based in countries with a well developed postal infrastructure utilise the indigenous postal service rather than relying on British Forces Post Office staff. To that end the Forces Post Offices servicing the UK elements of NATO HQs in SHAPE, Brussels, Brunssum, Stavanger, Karup, Rome, Milan, Lisbon, Valencia and Norfolk Virginia are due to close.</p>

<i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)</i><br>
1. A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. The figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the FCE Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
3. The ICD-10 codes used to identify Cardiovascular failure are as follows:<br>
I50.0 Congestive heart failure<br>
I50.1 Left ventricular failure<br>
I50.9 Heart failure, unspecified<br>
I11.0 Hypertensive heart disease with (congestive) heart failure<br>
I11.0 Hypertensive heart and renal disease with (congestive) heart failure<br>
I11.0 Hypertensive heart and renal disease with both (congestive) heart failure and renal failure<br>
P29.0 Neonatal cardiac failure<br>

4. HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

Additionally, public bodies have a specific duty to work with disabled people to develop, implement and publish a disability equality scheme outlining how the general duty will be met.</p>

1. School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>
2. 1999-2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DCSF (then DfES). 2002-03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. From 2002-03 school based expenditure is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001-02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made. This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999-2000 to 2001-02 and from the RO1 form previously.<br>
3. The calculation for 2002-03 onwards is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years.<br>
4. Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DCSF Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>
5. Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999-2000.<br>
6. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 and in cash terms.<br>

 The Department for Communities and Local Government investment in the Decent Homes programme will be provided through the housing revenue account (HRA) subsidy system in the form of local authorities&#146; supported capital expenditure (SCE), arms length management organisations&#146; supported borrowing allocations and major repairs allowance (MRA).

This includes a new role for local authorities in the delivery of housing, enabling them to build 3,000 additional council homes over the next two years, which is a four-fold expansion of the scheme announced at the Budget. 12 ALMOs that have not yet met the Audit Commission&#146;s two-star standard to be eligible for support are more likely to receive funding in 2011-12. We remain fully committed to complete the Decent Homes programme, and once completed, to seeing this standard maintained in the future. The reforms to the council housing finance system set out in the consultation document I published on 21 July will safeguard our commitment to future decent homes.</p>

As it became clear that a private sector deal was not going to offer best value for money, a full assessment of the IBC/MPC site was undertaken to determine ways to make temporary those proposed permanent elements not required in legacy.</p>

Some of this reduction is due to catering facilities, originally intended to be housed temporarily in office space during the games, now being provided in separate wholly temporary facilities. Other temporary elements of the project include both the other part of the car parking facilities and temporary retail facilities for media and broadcast personnel.</p>

 The Olympic Delivery Authority has directly awarded contracts to over 950 suppliers to date. The ODA was formed in April 2006, and began procurement from its inception to ensure that it was on programme. It was already working with a number of suppliers, 550 in all, by the time CompeteFor was launched in January 2008. Due to the scale and complexity of its procurements, the ODA has procured some of its contracts using established OGC frameworks to simplify the process, and a number are closed, for example, for security reasons.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="90901w0022.htm_para5"><a name="0909013001544">As of June 2009, 2,872 contract opportunities had been advertised on CompeteFor. These break down as follows:</p>
<a name="90901w0022.htm_brev1"><a name="0909013002244"><ul><p class="tabletext">The ODA, its contractors, and buyers in their supply chains have advertised 2,335 opportunities</p>

Contractors are encouraged to place as many as possible of their unallocated contract opportunities on CompeteFor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="90901w0022.htm_para7"><a name="0909013001546">It is estimated that for around 80 per cent. of these contracts, contractors will rely on their existing suppliers and sub-contractors leaving around 15,000, approximately 20 per cent., of opportunities to be placed on the system. The 20 per cent. figure is an estimate based on other large projects and the way in which contractors have decided to package and procure their sub-contracts. Given that the majority of these will be private procurements, we are unable to state precisely what proportion of these have been advertised on CompeteFor.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the longest time taken for  the completion of a Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) <i> (a)</i> standard and <i> (b)</i> enhanced disclosure check was in each year since the inception of the CRB. [283826]</p>

 The performance of the CRB remains good and in 2008-09 the CRB exceeded its targets  for issuing 90 per cent. of all standard checks within 10 days and issued 88 per cent of all Enhanced checks in 28 days. In 2008-09, the CRB witnessed an unprecedented increase in demand for its service which caused a dip below the 90 per cent. target for processing Enhanced checks in 28 days.</p>

This is aimed at maintaining a balanced output of applications on the system while also reducing the number of cases that have been in process for more than five days.

Their deliberations led to the issue on 30 May 2009 of a G8 Justice and Home Affairs Ministerial Statement &#147;The risk to children posed by Child Pornography offenders&#148;. Among the many conclusions and recommendations was: an acceptance of a relationship between viewing and contact offending, although more work was required to determine the exact nature of that relationship; a recognition that based on conviction evidence a significant proportion of &#147;image&#148; offenders had committed some form of contact offence; and the exchange of child abuse images and communication between child sexual offenders legitimises and normalises their beliefs and behaviours providing a social context which encourages the further exploitation of children.</p>

<i> [holding answer 16 July 2009]:</i> It is in our national interest that Afghanistan becomes a stable and secure state able to deal with violent extremism within its borders and to prevent the export of terrorism abroad. We are fully committed to supporting a legitimate and democratic Afghan Government as they seek to build a peaceful and resilient nation, shaped by the will of the Afghan people.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_323"><a name="90901w0029.htm_para6"><a name="0909013002193">I recognise that individual reactions to UK foreign policies, such as military involvement overseas can be a factor in radicalisation, and that violent extremists exploit this when recruiting others to their cause. But we also know that radicalisation occurs for a wide range of complex and personal reasons. The aim of the Government will continue to be to prevent radicalisation at home and abroad.</p>

 Each force sets their own priorities having made an assessment on the issues of most importance locally. As such forces where wildlife crime is an issue will be likely to provide greater resources for tackling it. However, the Home Office does not  collect data on the amount each force has spent policing wildlife crime.</p>
