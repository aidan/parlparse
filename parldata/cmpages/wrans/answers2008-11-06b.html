1. Agricultural waste is estimated from the Environment Agency's model of agricultural waste arisings.<br>
2. Mining and quarrying wastes are estimated from production and ratios of waste to product. Estimates may be revised in light of implementation of the Mining Waste Directive.<br>
3. Industrial and commercial wastes estimates are from the Environment Agency's National Waste Production Survey in 1998-99 and 2002-03. Data for later years are estimated from the 2002-03 survey data and updated business population figures. This provides an indicative estimate of waste arisings, but does not capture changes in waste management or resource use since the 2002-03 survey. Therefore, these estimates should be interpreted with some caution.<br>
4. Construction and demolition wastes estimates are from the survey into alternatives from primary aggregates, commissioned by Communities and Local Government in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2005. Figures for 2004 and 2006 includes estimates for non-aggregate wastes from this sector.<br>
5. Sewage waste estimates are provided by Water UK.<br>
6. Dredging wastes are from the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science.<br>
7. Household waste is from local authority returns to the municipal waste management survey.<br>

<i> Notes</i>:<br>
1. Recycling is defined as the reprocessing in a production process of the waste materials for the original purpose or for other purposes including organic recycling but excluding energy recovery. This includes composting and household recycling.<br>
2. Estimates for recycled wastes are based on that which is reported as being sent for recycling and will include exported wastes.<br>
3. Most of the generated waste from mining and quarrying activities are replaced into the resulting void which is currently classified as deposit into land. Estimates for mining wastes may change in light of implementation of the Mining Waste Directive.<br>
4. Sewage sludge is predominantly spread on land for agricultural purposes.<br>
5. Dredging wastes are disposed of at sea.<br>

 Data on shipments of notifiable wastes are collected by Government agencies in the UK to comply with the Basel Convention. However, these wastes represent a very small (1 per cent.) proportion of total waste movements, and the majority is non-notifiable, or &#147;green list&#148; waste. While it is not a requirement for the &#147;green list&#148; forms to be reported to the Environment Agency in England and Wales, movements of green list waste can be estimated from HM Revenue and Customs trade database. However, these data are indicative, since in many cases the categories under which trade data are reported do not differentiate between exported wastes and products. Estimates of non-notifiable waste movements from trade data have only been made for 2006.</p>

AFPS 75 was closed to new entrants on 6 April 2005 when AFPS 05 and RFPS were introduced.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_333"><a name="81106w0008.htm_para10"><a name="08110641001529">The introduction of RFPS means that all members receive preserved benefits for their reckonable service. If they have several periods of mobilised service for which they opt to be RFPS members, they will have a preserved award for each. These preserved benefits constitute a pension and a pension lump sum worth three times the pension. RFPS was not introduced to produce a saving: what it has introduced is equal treatment for all mobilised reserves who choose to join it.</p>

TRiM is a model of peer-group mentoring and support for use in the aftermath of traumatic events. It trains non-medical staff to spot those who might have been affected by traumatic events in order that their peers and leaders can provide them with appropriate support or, where it is required, to refer them for specialist help.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_338"><a name="81106w0009.htm_para4"><a name="08110641001536">Where further specialist help is required it is provided primarily through our 15 military Departments of Community Mental Health (DCMH) across the UK (plus satellite centres overseas), which provide out-patient mental health care. A wide range of psychiatric and psychological treatments are available, including medication, psychological therapies, and environmental adjustment where appropriate. The Defence Mental Health Services have extensive experience in psychological treatments for mental health problems in general and psychological injury in particular. In the relatively few cases where in-patient care is necessary, this is provided in dedicated psychiatric units under contract.</p>

 There is no set minimum supervisory ratio for each establishment on the training estate. All unit commanders are required to establish effective supervisory care regimes and to publish their supervisory arrangements in a supervisory care directive appropriate to the circumstances and conditions of the training being undertaken. The care requirement in all Phase 1 and 2 training establishments is determined on the basis of a unit commander's risk assessment which takes into account the particular factors at the unit such as the nature of the trainee population in terms of size, age and maturity and the location and type of the activity being undertaken. The care regime must establish appropriate levels of supervision and welfare cover not only during training but also out of hours, at weekends and during leave or stand-down periods.</p>

In some areas a requirement for additional staff was identified and appropriate funding approved.</p>

 The UK contributes 7.8 per cent. of the cost of MONUC (UN mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo) through its assessed payments to the UN&#146;s peacekeeping budget, and also contributes through the secondment of UK military staff.

In 2007-08 the UK contributed &#163;39,728,447 to MONUC, and funded six military secondees at a cost of &#163;1,077,271.

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="81106w0015.htm_para5"><a name="08110652000386">Wave 1 and Phase 2 of the ISTC programme are now almost concluded, with no further ISTC schemes being centrally planned.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_395"><a name="81106w0015.htm_para6"><a name="08110652000387">Independent sector provision will in future be procured locally rather than centrally. The three remaining Phase 2 schemes (London North, Hertfordshire and Essex) will be taken forward by the national health service to complete the review and negotiations with providers. The Department and HM Treasury are expected to conclude decisions by the end of November 2008.</p>

Couples are treated as a single unit in these benefits and if one member of a couple is in remunerative work of 16 hours or more, or has income which exceeds their entitlement, then they cannot receive the benefit. Only those couples who are not in remunerative work and who meet the other qualifying conditions of the benefit can receive Support for Mortgage Interest.

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

and encouraging community cohesion and civic values, as well as looking for the scope for capacity building. Framework for the Future has been underpinned by work funded through the Museums Libraries and Archives Council (MLA), including the training programme Leading Modern Public Libraries, and library service peer reviews.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_437"><a name="81106w0019.htm_para5"><a name="08110652000943">In the context of Framework, on 9 October 2008 the Secretary of State announced that the DCMS would undertake a Library Service Modernisation Review to define the Government's vision for a modern, world-class public library service and set out some of the necessary steps to achieve this vision. This review, which is expected to report in the spring of 2009, aims to support local authorities in delivering modernised, responsive and appealing library services for their communities, and to improve performance and increase usage. The private sector&#151;particularly publishers and booksellers&#151;are playing an important part in this project, and library services are increasingly working with private sector partners to improve their services.</p>

Part of this is offering the types of opportunities that are essential to the promotion of reading activities. These include learning opportunities and activities to attract new library users such as reading groups, writing groups, language classes and family learning activities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_439"><a name="81106w0019.htm_para7"><a name="08110652000945">Libraries have played a central role in the Department for Children, Schools and Families (DCSF) funded National Year of Reading, for which DCMS provided valuable policy support. This has promoted a broad range of themed events and activities, and as part of a membership drive signing up over one million new library members since April 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_440"><a name="81106w0019.htm_para8"><a name="08110652000946">There are also a significant number of programmes funded by Departments, sponsored organisations and third sector partners which promote the increased use of public libraries. DCMS (through the MLA) and other Government Departments have provided funding for the Summer Reading Challenge, Book Ahead, Fulfilling their Potential, Vital Link and Families Love Libraries. In addition DCMS has given policy support to programmes funded directly by other Departments (namely DCSF) including Bookstart, Boys into Books and Booked Up.</p>

 The new Department of Energy and Climate Change has already signalled strong commitment to meeting the following three long-term challenges facing our country:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_448"><a name="81106w0020.htm_para7"><a name="08110658000125">We have already announced our commitment to achieve an 80 per cent. cut in carbon emissions by 2050. We have also tabled amendments to the Energy Bill to introduce feed-in tariffs for small scale low carbon electricity generation up to 3MW and financial support for renewable heat at all scales.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"><a name="81106w0020.htm_para8"><a name="08110658000126">We want to enable people to move from being passive users to being active generators of energy. While the microgeneration definition in the 2006 Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act, particularly in respect of heat generation, was of a scale more appropriate to households, we also want to see more schools, hospitals, communities and businesses invest in projects that will generate low carbon electricity and heat for their own use. This will allow more citizens to engage actively in the fight against climate change and increase our energy security.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_450"><a name="81106w0020.htm_para9"><a name="08110658000127">In the first half of 2009 we will therefore launch our renewable energy strategy, and will bring forward our more detailed proposals on feed-in tariffs for small scale low carbon electricity and incentives for renewable heat. In the light of these decisions, we will be in a position to set out in detail the expected contribution of on-site generation alongside other kinds of electricity and heat generation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_451"><a name="81106w0020.htm_para10"><a name="08110658000128">Therefore at this stage, rather than designating targets within the narrower terms of the Climate Change and Sustainable Energy Act 2006, we intend to bring forward broader proposals in the context of the Renewable Energy Strategy.</p>

 The Food Standards Agency leads negotiations for the United Kingdom on the setting of maximum and minimum permitted levels and is responsible for developing the associated impact assessment. The Agency continues to gather information for, and develop the impact assessment in consultation with industry. An assessment of the likely impact will be made when the specific levels being proposed by the European Commission are available. These will be set out in Commission proposals, currently expected in January 2009, on which the Agency will consult fully. The Better Regulation Executive continues to work with the Agency to help them ensure the UK negotiating position is developed in line with better regulation principles.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>
<i> Key Coefficient of Variation (CV) (%) Statistical Robustness</i><br>

** 5 &lt; = CV &lt; 10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise<br>
*** 10 &lt; = CV &lt; 20 Estimates are considered acceptable<br>
**** CV ≥ 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>

The White Paper, &#147;Party finance and expenditure in the United Kingdom (CM7329)&#148;, published in June 2008, makes clear that the Government broadly support the principle of an all-encompassing spending limit, but that we believe there are a number of practical concerns that would need to be addressed before this could be introduced. Given that cross-party support for Sir Hayden Phillips&#146; fundamental package of reforms is not yet forthcoming, the Government have therefore proposed a return to the principle of triggering.</p>

Rather, the proposal will alter the time period over which such expenditure is regulated. The key effect of the clause is to remove the requirement that only expenditure used after the date of Dissolution of Parliament is regulated by the expenditure limit. As is currently the case, expenses used by or on behalf of the candidate on matters listed in part 1 of schedule 4A of the Representation of the People Act, which are for the purposes of the candidate&#146;s election will be regulated by the candidate spending limit. The point at which such expenses will count against the limit is the point at which expenses are used for the purposes of the candidate&#146;s election. As is currently the case, national party campaigning in a constituency or locality will not count against a candidate&#146;s expenditure limit.</p>

 The Government's intention to reintroduce triggering in relation to local candidate expenditure at parliamentary general elections was announced in the White Paper, &#147;Party finance and expenditure in the United Kingdom (CM7329)&#148;, published and debated by both Houses of Parliament on 16 June 2008. The Political Parties and Elections Bill containing the measure was introduced on 17 July 2008.

 The Department is determined to get overall absence down in all schools.

Absence has been lower than 1996-97 levels in all but two of the last 10 years.

All local authorities update their actions to improve attendance and reduce persistent absence on a termly basis with the National Strategies regional adviser and primary attendance now is a focus of those discussions. All local authorities also have a standards meeting in the autumn term where targets and priorities are discussed. Although these meetings are still taking place many local authorities have decided to have persistent absence as a priority with particular reference to primary schools. The National Strategies are running a pilot on improving attendance in primary schools with a number of local authorities in London. We will carefully consider the lessons learned from that pilot and the implications for our policy to target persistent absence.</p>

 Choice Advice is an independent service commissioned by local authorities to support the minority of parents who most need help to negotiate the secondary school admissions process. We would not expect Choice Advice to have a measurable impact on standards in education.
