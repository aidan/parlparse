 Our primary objective is to provide our armed forces with the equipment and support they need, at the right time, and at a cost that represents value for taxpayers' money.

 Every woodland and forest managed by the Forestry Commission has a set of 27 characteristics that are applied to it. Of these characteristics, 13 relate specifically to biodiversity interests, including whether the land has a protective designation such as site of special scientific interest or the presence of significant species such as red squirrels, European protected species (e.g. bats, dormice or great crested newt), birds of prey (e.g. ospreys and goshawks) or priority butterfly species.</p>

 Biomass heat and electricity could provide about 30% of the UK's 2020 target of 15% renewable energy (about 4.5%) of overall energy demand). Increased bioenergy deployment offers commercial opportunities for the UK's agriculture sector, which the Government are keen to see realised. Biomass resources include wood fuel from undermanaged woodlands; crop residues such as straw; waste resources such as manures, slurries, sewage sludge, waste wood and food waste; and purpose-grown perennial energy crops, such as short rotation coppice willow and woody grasses such as Miscanthus.</p>

This report showed that where imported biomass feedstocks were cultivated, processed and transported with due consideration for sustainability, significant GHG lifecycle savings compared to fossil fuel could be delivered.

 Based on our last published estimates in July 2010, we estimate renewables policies will add £105 (26%) to the average annual domestic electricity bill in 2020 and £246,000 (25%) to the average medium-sized annual non-domestic user's electricity bill in 2020 (compared with a bill in the same year in the absence of these policies, but including other energy and climate change policies). These estimates do not account for the potential offsetting impact from higher levels of renewables reducing wholesale electricity prices, which we estimate could be of the order of £6/MWh on average in the years to 2020.</p>

 Decisions made under the tender process for the award of legal aid contracts are a matter for the Legal Services Commission (LSC), which is responsible for administering the legal aid scheme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_401"><a name="101118w0002.htm_para38"><a name="10111865001479">In accordance with the Public Contract Regulations, when existing legal aid contracts were due to end in 2010, the LSC was required to run an open tender process for legal aid work. This meant using criteria that enabled both existing and new entrants to bid for their allocation of cases known as "New Matter Starts" (NMS). In all areas where the volume of NMS tendered for was greater than those available, as in the North West Area Greater Manchester Access Point, selection criteria were applied, and NMS were awarded according to the ranking of the bid.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="101118w0002.htm_para40"><a name="10111865001481">In the tender, Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit scored the same points as several other organisations, therefore NMS were allocated to them on a pro-rata basis. They were awarded 162 Asylum and 33 Immigration NMS when the new contracts commenced on 15 November.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="101118w0002.htm_para41"><a name="10111865001482">As the LSC does not have detailed knowledge of Greater Manchester Immigration Aid Unit's accounts and other sources of funding they receive, it is not in a position to comment on their budget.</p>
