<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department by what date councils which incurred costs in respect of Kosovan refugee reception centres <i>(a)</i> will receive details of the revised format for the submission of costs, <i>(b)</i> be expected to make their submissions and <i>(c)</i> receive reimbursements; if reimbursements to councils will include loss of interest; and if he will make a statement.  [98533]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Proposals for a Special Grant to reimburse English local authorities for additional expenditure incurred in connection with the acceptance of displaced persons from Kosovo under the United Nations High Commission for Refugees Humanitarian Evacuation Programme, were circulated to local authorities for consultation on 17 November.
<P>

<a name="91122w01.html_para0">The consultation period will end in December. The aim is that the Grant Report will be laid before Parliament around the turn of the year. On current plans, local authorities would submit claims to the Home Office by the end of February 2000 for relevant expenditure in the period to December 1999. Those claims will be paid in the current financial year. An audited claim for the full financial year will be submitted as soon as the authority is in a position to do so at the end of the financial year and any outstanding balance of grant will then be paid. The Special Grant will meet all relevant expenditure which the authority demonstrates was additional but it will not meet claims for loss of interest.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is his planned timetable for the revision of the Immigration Rules and the publication of revised rules following the passing of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999.  [98757]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 We intend to phase implementation of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 over the next 12 to 18 months, giving priority to the new asylum support arrangements and the civil penalty for carrying clandestine entrants. Amendments to the Immigration Rules will be published as necessary when specific provisions are implemented. A major consolidation of changes to the Rules is likely to be required at the end of the implementation process.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 No information on costs specifically relating to any assistance to asylum seekers for help with shopping is available to the Home Office.
<P>

<a name="91122w01.html_para1">Asylum seekers who claim asylum at their port of entry may be eligible for social security benefits. Those who do not claim at their port of entry may be supported by local authority social services departments. In addition, local authorities may provide various means to enable asylum seekers to obtain essential living needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions Her Majesty's Government have had with leading British diamond purchasers, with particular reference to De Beers, as to what controls they have put in place to ensure that they are not purchasing Angolan diamonds without a certificate of origin.  [99158]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 On 5 October, De Beers announced an embargo on the purchase of all diamonds from Angola by its buying offices world-wide. I applaud this decision and hope that others will follow their example to put pressure on UNITA and bring them to the negotiating table. We continue to hold regular discussions with De Beers, representatives of which I met recently.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the Government's position on the FCO Policy Document 148, 1986, in relation to NATO intervention in Kosovo.  [98534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 FCO Policy Document No.148 was a paper prepared by the FCO Policy Planning staff in July 1984 as a basis for discussion. It was not a statement of government policy.
<P>

<a name="91122w01.html_para2">As we have stated on many occasions, we are clear that the NATO action in Kosovo was justified in the light of overwhelming humanitarian need.

<a name="91122w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 It is for the Health and Safety Executive, as the sole regulator for railway safety, to ensure that Railtrack meets, and where necessary improves, its safety standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on his Department's policy on the use of road trains in town and city centres.  [98633]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Goods vehicle road trains, ie a lorry towing a trailer, meeting the technical requirements of the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986, as amended, and the Road Vehicles (Authorised Weight) Regulations 1998 are generally allowed to operate in the UK. However, they may be subject to local restrictions.
<P>

<a name="91122w01.html_para3">There are also in existence some small vehicles that carry passengers in trailers which cannot meet the definition of a public service vehicle and cannot be used as such. They are individually authorised, generally to operate on limited sightseeing routes.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures he has taken to ensure that the economic strategies of the regional development agencies are consistent with emerging regional planning guidance in each region. [98528]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Draft Planning Policy Guidance Note 11 on "Regional Planning" (PPG 11) and the statutory guidance to the RDAs on the formulation of their strategies set out the relationship between Regional Planning Guidance and the strategies.
<P>

<a name="91122w01.html_para4">Both draft PPG 11 and the statutory guidance to RDAs emphasise the complementary nature of the guidance and strategies and stress the need for the regional planning bodies and the RDAs to work closely together.
<P>

<a name="91122w01.html_para5">This is already happening. The RDAs and the planning bodies are talking to each other and mapping a way forward with the benefit, for example, of joint working parties. In some regions RDA board members are also members of the regional planning body.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 We have given each Regional Development Agency (RDA) a direction under section 8(2)(a) of the Regional Development Agencies Act 1998 requiring them to have regard to the views of their designated regional chamber in formulating and keeping under review the regional strategy that they are required to produce under the Act.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Regional Development Agencies received a wide range of comments on their draft Regional Strategies. They have taken account of 



<P>
<P><I>22 Nov 1999 : Column: 20W</I><P>
these in their own ways and have made their own publicity arrangements. The draft Strategies and the revised versions, which were presented to the Government on 26 October, are public documents.

<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Don Foster: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list the Regional Development Agencies which have published an appraisal of how their economic strategy will foster effective protection of the environment, as required by the statutory guidance to the Regional Development Agencies.

 Guidance on the formulation of the strategies was issued to the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) on 31 March 1999. This specifies that an appraisal of the contribution the strategy will make to sustainable development should be produced. The appraisal should cover social, economic and environmental sustainability.
<P>

<a name="91122w01.html_para6">All RDAs carried out a sustainable development appraisal of their draft strategies which informed the development of their final strategies. The following RDAs have already made these appraisals publicly available, and copies are available from the RDAs directly:

[98530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w01.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The RDAs have to operate within the standard framework which applies to all non-departmental public bodies. They are accountable to Ministers and, through them, Parliament.

<a name="91122w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Under my Department's Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme, the Building Research Establishment commissioned some limited studies in the early 1990s. The studies estimated that public sector landlords could expect to save of the order of &#163;300 and &#163;400 per dwelling per year as a result of applying comprehensive energy efficiency improvements to public sector housing. These savings resulted from reductions in management time dealing with rent arrears, lower management costs associated with handling fewer complaints, voids and vandalism, and lower maintenance costs. The studies are available as published Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme case studies (numbers 186, 187 and 189) and I will arrange for copies to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Solicitor-General how the Government proposes to respond to the recommendations contained in the Law Commission report, Consents to Prosecution (Law Com No. 255).  [99521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w02.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 We are grateful to the Law Commission for a very careful and thorough report. The proposals contained in the report are accepted in principle, subject to the following points. There is a clear need for rationalisation of the consent provisions which attach to certain criminal offences. In particular, the separation of investigation and prosecution effected by the establishment in 1986 of the Crown Prosecution Service reduces the need for consent provisions. The careful analysis of the consent regime, the justification for its existence and the way in which it has been applied to a wide variety of offences provides a useful basis for further work, which the Law Commission identifies.
<P>

<a name="91122w02.html_para2">The Government recognise that the current consent requirements are in need of reform and agree with the Law Commission's view that a consent provision must attach to a particular offence not to a particular defendant or class of defendants.
<P>

<a name="91122w02.html_para3">The Government share the Law Commission's view that further consideration will need to be given to the categories of case in which consent should be required. The categories set out in the report create a useful guide for analysing the offences which require consent, and 



<P>
<P><I>22 Nov 1999 : Column: 24W</I><P>
these will need to be applied flexibly. In particular, the Government wish to leave open the possibility of requiring consent provisions where reasons of public policy make this appropriate. The Law Commission recognises that the category which relates to controlling the prosecution of offences where the prosecution may violate a convention right may not be confined to Article 6 cases, and that further consideration will be required.

<a name="91122w03.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The Government have decided that, with effect from the date of this answer, the Law Officers should have a more formal role in respect of prosecutions by Government Departments and agencies that are not subject to their superintendence. In future, the Law officers will examine cases raising important matters of particular difficulty. They will have regular meetings with senior representatives in each Department or agency to discuss such cases, and prosecution issues more generally; and will receive regular written information on casework of particular concern.
<P>

<a name="91122w03.html_para0">The focus of the new arrangements will be on prosecution cases rather than the allocation of resources or determination of prosecution priorities, which must be a matter for each Department and agency. In cases in which the Law Officers do express a review, the final decision will remain with the responsible Minister or office-holder, but the Law Officers' views will be taken fully into account.
<P>

<a name="91122w03.html_para1">I should like to make plain that this initiative is prompted by a desire to strengthen the current arrangements, it is not a response to the handling of any particular case. The new arrangements are intended to enhance decision making within the prosecution process, and should lead to worthwhile improvements in the quality of such decision making. No legislative measures will be necessary to put the arrangements into effect.

 Regulations have been laid today giving effect to provisions in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 which will enable the All Work Test to play a more positive role in helping people claiming incapacity benefits to return to work.
<P>

<a name="91122w03.html_para8">The Social Security (Incapacity for Work) Miscellaneous Amendments Regulations 1999 allow additional positive information about what people can do in spite of their illness or disability to be collected through the medical assessment process. A new "Capability Report" will be prepared by the doctor who assesses the person for benefit purposes, and sent to Personal Advisers to help them give advice and support to sick and disabled people who want to work. The benefit decision-maker will not see the Capability Report and it will have no effect on people's benefit entitlement.
<P>

<a name="91122w03.html_para9">These provisions will come into force from 13 December, to allow the new "Capability Report" to be piloted in the 12 ONE areas.
<P>

<a name="91122w03.html_para10">In addition, the regulations rename the All Work Test the Personal Capability Assessment from 3 April 2000.
<P>

<a name="91122w03.html_para11">These regulations do not change the entitlement criteria for benefits paid on the grounds of incapacity. People will continue to be assessed against a set of functional medical criteria. However, many disabled people who would meet the criteria for benefit are in work; and many more want to work and could do so with the right help and advice. ONE is starting to give people that help and the new Capability Report will make a constructive contribution to this.

 The winter plan developed by the North Essex health economy has been assessed as low risk by Eastern Regional Office in all areas monitored.

Section 33 may be used where there is a voluntary scheme, such as the new Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme, to limit the prices charged by members of such a scheme. There are no proposals to set any maximum prices under this provision. The powers in section 34 may be used only in respect of those suppliers and manufacturers who elect not to become members of a voluntary scheme.
<P>

<a name="91122w04.html_para4">A formal consultation with the industry body as required by the Health Act has been completed with the Association of British Pharmaceutical Industry. In addition, we are also consulting the Association of Pharmaceutical Importers and the British Association of Pharmaceutical Wholesalers. We will be introducing secondary legislation to give effect to the powers contained in section 34 of the Health Act 1999. Such powers will ensure equity of treatment for those companies who choose to join the 1999 PPRS and those who do not.
<P>

<a name="91122w04.html_para5">So far all but two companies affected by the price reduction in the voluntary scheme have elected to join the 1999 PPRS. It remains open to those companies to change their elections and join the 1999 PPRS. Otherwise they will be subject to the provisions of the statutory price control measures which will be introduced.
<P>

<a name="91122w04.html_para6">Statutory powers to control NHS prices are not in place and it is not certain which, if any, companies will be subject to them. In the case of a company falling within such powers there will be additional consultation with the company. Therefore I am unable to list the drugs which would be affected by any statutory price control. If specific drugs do become subject to statutory price control then we will publish the details of those drugs at the earliest opportunity.

<P>

<a name="91122w05.html_para0">On 24 September we signed the Handling Agreement with the solicitors representing the miners, which sets out the procedures for settling 100,000+ expected respiratory disease claims.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Director General of Gas and Electricity Markets, who has recently proposed new price controls for the Public Electricity Suppliers, to come into force in April 2000, and with average price cuts of 10 per cent. The Director General is currently considering the price control for British Gas Trading, and will announce that soon. Prepayment meter customers should benefit, as do other customers, from general reductions in prices. In addition, the Director General has proposed that the prepayment meter surcharge, which reflects the additional amount these customers pay, should not exceed &#163;15 a year (at present it varies by company, and is up to &#163;27 a year). Second-tier electricity suppliers and competitors to British Gas Trading are not subject to price control, because they operate in a competitive market, in which the price-controlled incumbents set the benchmark price; and consumers are free to seek a new supplier if they wish.

 I am pleased to announce the publication, today, of more comprehensive targets for flood and coastal defence operating authorities and a further elaboration of the Environment Agency's supervisory duty. I am placing a copy in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="91122w06.html_para0">The targets are designed to assist in developing a seamless and integrated service of flood forecasting, warning and response as well as a more certain delivery of Government policy towards flood and coastal defence. They follow recommendations, which the Government accepted, in last year's Agriculture Committee report on flood and coastal defence and in the Independent Report on the Easter 1998 floods. The targets take effect from 1 April 2000, building on and developing the interim targets which we published in May.
<P>

<a name="91122w06.html_para1">These targets will, among other things, require flood and costal defence operating authorities to produce policy statements on their plans for achieving the Government's policy aims and objectives; flood and coastal defence assets to be recorded and inspected, and flood and erosion risk assessed, There are targets for the Environment Agency to develop its flood warning service, for emergency exercises to be held, and in relation to development control in areas at risk of flooding or erosion. Three are also targets for taking forward initiatives on Shoreline Management Plans, Water Level Management Plans and Coastal Habitat Management Plans, and for monitoring the impact of flood and coastal defence on habitats covered by Biodiverstiy Action Plans.
<P>

<a name="91122w06.html_para2">These targets, and elaboration of the Environment Agency's supervisory duty, have been developed in full co-operation with the Agency, the Association of

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will provide estimates for <i>(a)</i> Shropshire County Council, <i>(b)</i> Telford and Wrekin Council and <i>(c)</i> the Wrekin constituency in respect of the impact of additional Government funding since 1997-98 on the number of (i) additional teachers appointed, (ii) infant school class sizes reduced to 30 pupils or fewer, (iii) children who have benefited from smaller class sizes, (iv) schools which have benefited from new buildings or major repairs and (v) extra books for schools.

 The Government have pledged to reduce infant class sizes for all children aged 5, 6 and 7 to 30 or below by September 2001 at the latest. Recent figures show that the number of children in large infant classes has halved since September 1998 from 354,000 (22 per cent.) to 181,000 (11 per cent.) in September 1999 and that over 300,000 children have benefited since January 1998. A total of &#163;620 million has been made available to implement the pledge early in virtually all schools by September 2000.

Since 1997-98, Shropshire LEA has received &#163;691,733 for books for all maintained schools and Telford and Wrekin LEA has received &#163;245,217. A further allocation of &#163;128,725 for Shropshire LEA and &#163;63,223 for Telford and Wrekin LEA was made in 1998-99 to support the National Literacy Strategy in primary schools. In total, the allocation for books for schools to the two authorities was enough to buy around 225,780 books.<P>

It should be noted that Telford and Wrekin Council has been in existence as a unitary authority only since April 1998, and that the figures for Shropshire include sums allocated before that date. It is not possible to provide figures for the Wrekin constituency.<P>

<P>
<a name="91122w07.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Code of Practice on the identification and assessment of special educational needs points out that LEAs have a qualified duty to secure that children with special educational needs, including children with statements, are educated in mainstream schools. The Code emphasises that, if parents express a preference for a mainstream school, the LEA must comply with that preference so long as the placement is appropriate to the child's needs, while also being compatible with the interests of other children already in the school and with the efficient use of the LEA's resources. The Code also points out that parents may express a preference for a maintained special school, and that if they do so the LEA no longer has a duty to secure a mainstream education for the child.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w07.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Our SEN Programme of Action highlights the importance of improving provision for all children with special educational needs, including those with autistic spectrum disorders. To support the Programme we virtually doubled, to &#163;35 million, targeted support for SEN under the Standards Fund in 1999-2000 and I recently announced a further substantial increase to &#163;55 million for 2000-01. The Department is also funding Regional Collaboration Projects which are looking at provision for particular special needs, including autism.
<P>

<a name="91122w07.html_para0">We are committed to working with partners in the interests of children with autism. I hosted an Autism in Education Seminar on 21 September this year which brought together interested parties within and outside government to discuss future autism provision in the context of the Programme of Action. Following the seminar, we will be collecting examples of good practice and looking at ways of disseminating them. I was also pleased to speak at the launch of the National Autistic Society's current Autism 99 Internet conference, adding to the messages of support from my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State. The conference, which the Department has been helping to publicise, has a practical focus on meeting the needs of children and adults with autism and their families.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if it is his policy that the price differential between liquid petroleum gas and hydrocarbon oils should not be widened to the disadvantage of liquid petroleum gas as a result of the climate change levy.  [98585]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w07.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The price of competing fuels is a commercial matter in which the rates of duty or tax play only one part. The Chancellor has announced his intention to increase rates of duty on fuel oil and gas oil, and this is likely to mitigate incentives to fuel switching after the introduction of the climate change levy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w07.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The carbon savings projected to arise from the climate change levy are based on estimates produced from the DTI energy model. They arise from reduced energy consumption and from the encouragement of renewable energy sources and combined heat and power systems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w07.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The climate change levy is expected to be broadly revenue neutral between manufacturing and services because, taking into account the 80 per cent. discount for energy intensive sectors that enter into energy efficiency agreements, the amount of levy paid by the manufacturing and service sectors is likely to be broadly equivalent to the amount each gains from the reduction in employers' National Insurance Contributions and the additional support for energy efficiency measures.

 The Government welcome the improvements in energy efficiency made by businesses in recent years. All firms that have already made energy saving investments will benefit from lower energy bills--and consequently a lower tax liability--than otherwise would have been the case. And the many firms that have invested in combined heat and power (CHP) plant will benefit from the proposed exemption of electricity generated in CHP plant from the levy.

<a name="91122w09.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The Government are contemplating new broadcasting and communications legislation, to be introduced early in the next Parliament, to ensure that a suitable regulatory framework is in place in the light of technological and other developments. Current statutory provisions relating to religious broadcasting will be considered in that context.

28. <a name="91122w10.html_wqn0"><B>  Mrs. Virginia Bottomley: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps he is taking to promote public confidence in his Department's political impartiality with regard to media regulation and ownership.  [98994]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 Provisions on media ownership and regulation are set out in the Broadcasting Acts 1990 and 1996. The media industry is also subject to general competition law such as merger control under the Fair Trading Act 1973.
<P>

<a name="91122w10.html_para0">Implementation of these provisions is a matter for the relevant independent regulators, not the Government. Political impartiality in broadcast content is provided for by the regulators through a range of mechanisms such as the BBC Charter, licence conditions and programme codes.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps the Government plan to take to improve the attractiveness to businesses of tourist areas.  [98995]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="91122w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The Government are taking a number of steps to ensure that businesses are attracted to tourism areas. My Department's tourism strategy, "Tomorrow's Tourism" outlines many initiatives in, for example, training, improved access, more readily available information. Additionally, we now have the English Tourism Council, a more strategic body which leaves more money free for the support of tourism in the regions. Tourism areas also benefit from other spending such as lottery funding, the Single Regeneration Budget and European Regional Development Budget.

 The National Asset Register for my Department covers the Government Art Collection (GAC), Royal Commission on Historical Manuscripts (RCHM), the Royal Parks Agency (RPA) and the ex-Royal Fine Art Commission (RFAC) (until 31 August 1999) and ex-Historic Royal Palaces Agency (HRPA) (until 31 March 1998), in addition to the Core Department (DCMS). The DCMS Asset register was introduced in March 1999 as a result of the need for improved assets records for the introduction of Resource Accounting and Budgeting. Information on assets sold prior to the introduction of the register may therefore be incomplete. The available information on assets sold is set out in the following table:
