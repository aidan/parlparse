To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the procedure for the review of an outstanding warrant of arrest issued by the RUC; how frequently an outstanding warrant is reviewed; and in what circumstances and by what criteria an outstanding warrant could be set aside.  [69881]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> There are various types of arrest warrant:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. Bench/arrest warrant</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. Committal warrant</FONT></UL>
<P>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. Extradition warrant</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. Enforcement of Justice warrant.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90209w01.html_para0">Different procedural arrangements for review apply to each. However, it should be noted that, generally, warrants issued under the appropriate legislation are returned if not executed, within the time specified therein. 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 1999 : Column: 126</I><P>
If a time limit is not specified the unexecuted warrant is returned to a court or issuing Justice at the end of twelve months for cancellation or re-issue.
<P>

<a name="90209w01.html_para1">Generally, warrants are not executed after a lapse of two years without instruction from the issuing authority in cases:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) to enforce appearance at Magistrates' Courts; and</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) to arrest for trivial offences.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90209w01.html_para2">Except in cases of a serious crime or where delay in execution may result in the escape of the accused, a warrant which has been on issue for more than four years is not executed without instructions from the issuing authority.
<P>

<a name="90209w01.html_para3">The setting aside of an outstanding warrant is a matter for the issuing authority.

 Nuclear submarines are not refitted at HM Naval Base Clyde. Repair and maintenance on nuclear submarines at the Clyde Naval Base is conducted by Royal Naval personnel and Civilian contractors. To meet fluctuations in workload and when it has been considered cost effective to do so, contracts for maintenance work have been placed with civilian companies. These are principally Babcock Rosyth Defence Ltd., Devonport Management Ltd. and Rolls Royce and Associates, all of whom have wide experience in this work.

<a name="90209w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The MOD takes account of a company's capability and capacity, including past performance, when deciding which companies should be invited to tender. Where there is uncertainty about the ability of firms to meet the requirement, companies that have expressed interest, including potential new suppliers, are normally asked to complete a pre-qualification questionnaire to provide information on, among other matters, their technical capability and delivery history. As part of the implementation of Smart Procurement, we are seeking, jointly with Industry, to reinforce our procedures for taking account of past performance in assessing tenders.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry is unaware of the level of profit included in competitive bids for defence procurement contracts since this is a judgment for the tenderers to make. In non-competitive contracts the level of profits is negotiated in accordance with the Government Profit Formula, on a company-by-company basis.

 One IPM7 walk through monitor is installed in the Clyde Naval Base. When leaving classified areas all personnel are monitored for contamination by trained Health Physics staff using hand held instruments. They also have the option of using the IPM7 at this stage. In the very unlikely event that personnel are contaminated, they are taken to the Health Physics Group for decontamination, which includes compulsory monitoring by the IPM7.

<a name="90209w02.html_para0">At MOD-owned nuclear establishments, it is the practice to monitor the working environment and exposed personnel for possible contamination. Contamination monitors are used as part of the overall monitoring arrangements.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> There is no single weapon which can replace the capability previously provided by anti-personnel landmines. Work is continuing to establish how best to provide the required capability in the future, consistent with our obligations under UK and International law.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 Participation in competitive sport within the Armed Forces has long been recognised as playing a very considerable part in Service life. In addition to being a key means of promoting physical fitness, team spirit and of great benefit to maintaining high levels of morale, sport within the Armed Forces contributes to military effectiveness by developing personal qualities such as motivation, courage, resilience, stamina and co-ordination.
<P>

<a name="90209w02.html_para2">Market research indicates that opportunities for competitive sport within the Services is high on the list of factors which attract many potential recruits to join the Armed Forces. It is my Department's firm policy to promote fitness and a healthy lifestyle among personnel and to encourage fully the participation by members of the Armed Forces in structured sporting activities, together with adequate time to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Armed Forces have traditionally set aside Wednesday afternoons, on an informal basis, to give personnel the opportunity to partake in competitive and non-competitive sporting activity. This is still encouraged although the level of participation is very much dependent on operational requirements and training commitments within the various chains of Command, with whom the final decision rests. In some cases representative sports are played on other days of the week in order to reduce the effect of absence from primary duties.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what will be the cost of relocating and retasking existing brigades in establishing the proposed northern division.  [70123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 No existing brigades are to be relocated as a result of the establishment of the northern division. Rather, there will be a transfer of responsibility for some existing tasks between Divisional and Brigade Headquarters; small numbers of staff will transfer accordingly, but the costs will not be significant.

<a name="90209w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 We estimate that the initial cost of refurbishing office accommodation at the Headquarters Scottish District in Craigiehall will be some &#163;250,000; there is a project to rebuild the headquarters in due course

and it was assumed in the review of the Army's divisional/district structure that this project would proceed at a cost of &#163;7 million during the second half of the next decade.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what criteria he based his decision to move the Army's 2 Divisional HQ from York to Edinburgh.  [70124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The criteria were that the headquarters of the Northern Division should be able to carry out its role effectively and at reduced cost when compared with existing arrangements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will estimate the cost of backdating the changes which became operative from 1 April 1975 to the Armed Forces pension arrangements to cover all those who retired before 1 April 1975.  [70230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w02.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The only change to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme which became operative on 1 April 1975 was the introduction of preserved pensions for those with insufficient service to qualify for an immediate pension. In line with public service pension scheme practice the improvement was not applied retrospectively to those who had already left the Armed Forces. An estimate of the cost of backdating the change is not available and could be obtained, if at all, only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="90209w02.html_para3">Furthermore, costs to MOD could not be considered in isolation from other Government Departments. It is the general practice for all public service pension schemes, when introducing improvements, to apply them only to those serving at the date of the change. If the pensions of all retired Scheme members were retrospectively increased each time a new improvement was introduced, changes to schemes would become very expensive and probably unaffordable.

 We announced in September last year that the Royal Tournament in its current form will end in 1999. A special event will be held in the year 2000 to celebrate the millennium. As we said at the time of the announcement, the nature of events in 2001 and beyond are subject to further work on timing, location and format. The future of the naval gun competition is being considered as part of that process. At present nothing has been ruled in or out.

<a name="90209w03.html_para5">Asylum seekers may generally receive benefit in the form of income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit, if they are port asylum applicants, or support from local authority social services departments, if they are in-country asylum applicants or asylum appellants.

<a name="90209w03.html_para6">The information requested on those who seek support from local authority social services departments is not available. But on those who seek income support, statistics available on the number of urgent case payments that are claimed, awarded and refused are shown in the table. Only a small proportion of urgent case recipients are not asylum seekers.

<a name="90209w04.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 My Department's Public Service Agreement (published in the White Paper "Public Services for the Future: Modernisation, Reform, Accountability") includes a target for the Home Office to achieve efficiency improvements of 3 per cent. a year; as well as targets for improvements against total spending on the police and the fire services of 2 per cent. a year, and on the probation service of 4 per cent. a year.
<P>

<a name="90209w04.html_para4">The White Paper describes the range of projects and targets which are in place to achieve these efficiency gains. For example, a Modernisation Programme has been launched which will develop better management, accommodation, personnel and Information Technology systems. Specific targets have been set, or are being developed, for correspondence, telephone response, sickness absence, procurement, processing of immigration casework and a number of other areas.
<P>

<a name="90209w04.html_para5">I have no plans to express these efficiency gains as a percentage of my budget, as this would be misleading in relation to the work that is underway. Rather, the efficiency improvements will be made up of a range of increases in output relative to input, budgetary savings and transfers of existing resources to meet new priorities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Section 43 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992 requires Police Authorities to have regard to the level of reserves needed for meeting estimated future expenditure when calculating their budget requirement. The Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy (CIPFA) has recently re-issued to police authorities advice in determining the appropriate level of reserves and balances. CIPFA recommends that the level of balances for a Police Authority should be around 2 per cent. to 5 per cent., depending on local circumstances.
<P>

<a name="90209w04.html_para6">The Home Office provides no separate guidance to police authorities on the use to which reserves and balances should be put. The allocation of all resources, including reserves, is entirely a matter for the Chief Constable and the Police Authority.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The statement "Modernising Planning", published in January 1998, set out a comprehensive agenda for action to improve the operation of the planning system at European, national, regional and local levels. Following consultation, changes are now being implemented. I propose to publish a report on progress shortly.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action the Government are taking to improve the quality of urban design.  [68278]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government take every opportunity to encourage higher standards of urban design and will be considering what further measures might be appropriate when the Urban Task Force reports in the early Summer. In the meantime, the Government are encouraging good design by publishing good practice guidance, including: "Places, Streets and Movement", a companion guide to "Design Bulletin 32", published last autumn, which aims to improve the design of housing layouts; and a more general "Good Practice Guide on Design in the Planning 



<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 1999 : Column: 147</I><P>
System", which we expect to publish in the Spring. In addition, design competitions were held for the Millennium Villages in Greenwich and Allerton Bywater, which demonstrate the Government's commitment to encouraging better quality development.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w06.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 In "A New Deal for Transport", the Government said that they would encourage the growth of regional airports to meet local demand. This applies to both passenger and cargo traffic. My Department has just commissioned a study to improve our knowledge of the UK freight industry and the ways in which Government action could support it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w06.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 As promised in our Manifesto we have abolished crude and universal capping. We will decide whether there is any need to use our capping powers once authorities have set their budgets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w06.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Representatives of the Corporation of London told my officials last summer that there is interest in the City in investing in Crossrail. My officials asked the Corporation to invite those willing to invest in the project to approach the Department. We have heard nothing about this since.

 A research project on Planning for Leisure and Tourism is currently being undertaken for my Department.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government's aim has been to raise planning fees gradually over a number of years until they enabled 100 per cent. recovery of local authorities' total estimated costs of determining planning applications. The two fee increases introduced in 1997 have brought us to this point and we have no immediate plans to raise fee levels. However, in the context of Best Value, my officials are currently working with the Planning Officers' Society on more systematic ways of measuring planning costs. This work may form the basis of a revision of planning fees in due course.

<a name="90209w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 An urban renaissance is vital in order to improve city environments and to tackle the problems of social exclusion. I welcome the Urban Task Force's Halfway Report 'Urban Renaissance'. The report shows that the Task Force's consultation exercise has gathered valuable contributions from a wide range of sources. This gives assurance that the Task Force's final recommendations will have a sound base. The Task Force will produce their final report and recommendations to the Deputy Prime Minister in the early summer.

<a name="90209w07.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 We have already allocated just over &#163;1.5 million for improved bus services in rural Derbyshire as part of the additional funding for rural transport of &#163;50 million announced by my right hon. Friend the Chancellor in his last budget. Over half of Derbyshire's allocation will be used to fund the Southern Derbyshire Rural Access Initiative, a scheme aimed at improving transport links to help combat social exclusion in rural areas. There will be further allocations in future financial years. In addition, &#163;600,000 has been allocated to Derbyshire for rural and non-package minor works in the local transport capital settlement for 1999-2000.

<P>

<a name="90209w07.html_para0">As part of his assessment of the type and level of services the network should provide, the Franchising Director, acting as part of the shadow SRA, will consider the options identified by Railtrack against the planning criteria already approved by Ministers.

 The Government's White Paper, "Modern Local Government--In Touch with the People" (Cm 4104) sets out our policy for more frequent elections for councils, including for London boroughs which would have elections by thirds in each of the years between elections to the Greater London Authority.

 The Government are committed to encouraging greater use of inland waterways, and will be re-examining the rules of the freight grant scheme with a view to increasing the number of applications for inland waterways projects. There has been a significant increase in the 1998-99 budget. However, as the scheme is demand-led it is not possible to set meaningful targets.

 On 25 November 1998 I held a meeting with representatives of the airline industry, and other interested organisations to discuss ways in which the problem of disruptive behaviour by airline passengers could be addressed. As a result a working group was established to consider ways of gaining reliable data about the number of incidents of disruptive behaviour and to consider the need for research into their causes. Its first meeting was on 1 February.

<a name="90209w10.html_para2">I have had useful discussions with a number of groups to discuss women and sport, including the Womens Sports Foundation and have valued proposals about how the Government can do more for women in sport. I shall be meeting shortly with my right hon. Friend the Minister for Women to discuss this.

 <i>[holding answer 1 February 1999]:</i> We have made significant progress with the Task Force. Having negotiated the necessary lead time for the sports to adjust, seven have sought our assistance to make the transition--rugby league, clay pigeon shooting, billiards and snooker, pool, darts, ice-hockey and angling. We have been in contact with the sports since the announcement in November 1997 and the expert group first met informally on 19 June 1998. Following this meeting, we sought detailed information on the sports' existing sponsorships,

<P><I>9 Feb 1999 : Column: 159</I><P>
and what commercial benefits they can offer new sponsors, in order to assess their needs and how a Task Force could help. We completed this stage of the exercise before Christmas and the group met again on 10 December 1998. Since then members of the Task Force have held individual meetings with the sports on the following dates:

<a name="90209w10.html_para3">I am pleased to confirm these meetings have been very positive. The sports recognise our determination to end the totally inappropriate links with smoking in a way that minimises the impact on them, and are working with us to help them establish new commercial relationships that can be sustained. The group will meet again shortly to consider the nature and timing of help needed to replace existing contracts, many of which have several years to run. We will also consider the frequency of further meetings this year. I will keep the House advised of all significant developments.

Around 2,110 pupils attended school assemblies, awards ceremonies or question and answer sessions involving a Sporting Ambassador. A total of 1,567 pupils also enjoyed first hand contact with Ambassadors through coaching or participation. Feedback from the pilot stage suggested that most benefit was gained when the Sporting Ambassadors lived locally, could be seen out training and who could identify with the school and pupils.<P>

 The Welsh Development Agency's highly successful Land Reclamation Programme is progressively removing the remaining scars on the Welsh landscape. Since 1976, over &#163;300 million has been spent on reclaiming some 18,000 acres of land and the Agency plans to spend &#163;18 million in the current financial year reclaiming a further 370 hectares of land. Sites currently being reclaimed include the former British Coal Workshops in Tredegar.

There can be practical difficulties in conducting such clinical trials--as well as significant ethical concerns. However, because of the concern about extensive "off-label" use of medicines in children, in 1997 European guidelines were developed to encourage the conduct of clinical trials in children. This is a major step forward and requires an applicant for a marketing authorisation (licence) in the United Kingdom or elsewhere in Europe, to justify reasons for not supplying data on use of the product in children.

This application for leave to appeal was granted on 4 February. We will consider the need for guidance to Health and Local Authorities once the result of the appeal is known.

<P>

<a name="90209w12.html_para3">In the Lords today, my noble Friend Baroness Hayman announced a new, modernised and strengthened system of self-regulation for nurses, midwives and health visitors. The review recommends new legislation to replace the current arrangements. The criteria and principles for new legislation echo the Government's clear commitment to work with the professions and the regulatory bodies to strengthen the existing systems of professional self-regulation. The new arrangements will be designed to:

<a name="90209w12.html_para7">The report recommends, and the Government accept, that the current dual regulatory structure (of a Council and four National Boards) be replaced with a new United Kingdom-wide body, with ultimate responsibility for regulating the professions, but national arrangements may be made in respect of some functions previously carried out by boards.
<P>

<a name="90209w12.html_para8">The Government have, however, decided not to accept recommendations relating to health visitors, who will continue to be a separate profession, retaining separate registration and representation on the new Council. A further review to explore the scope for the regulation of health care support workers is recommended, and we plan to commission this work shortly.




<P>
<P><I>9 Feb 1999 : Column: 169</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90209w12.html_para9">This is a thorough and thoughtful review, based on very extensive consultation. It was undertaken in the context of rapid developments and changes in the education and roles of the professions, and against the background of Government policies on the National Health Service and on devolution. This means that in Scotland and Wales, the new Council will be expected to commission educational quality assurance work in relation to nursing and midwifery from bodies whose structure and other functions will be determined by the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales. Within Northern Ireland it will be up to the Northern Ireland Assembly, once it is fully operational, to determine the arrangements. No separate body is envisaged for England, although it would be open to the Council to collaborate with the Quality Assurance Agency.
<P>

<a name="90209w12.html_para10">Many of the recommendations in the report reflect issues of good practice and are addressed to the new Council, which will be smaller and more streamlined and strategic, both in its structure and functions. Others cannot be achieved without new legislation to replace the current Act. It is widely accepted that there is a need to find a way to implement these changes and a power has been included in the Health Bill, currently subject to Parliamentary scrutiny, to effect changes to primary legislation by Order. We will be bringing forward an amendment to the Health Bill to enable us to repeal the Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors Act 1997 once the new arrangements are in place.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> The Government's strategic aims and clinical priorities for the National Health Service in Scotland are set out in "Priorities and Planning Guidance for the NHS in Scotland 1999-2002". Our plans to reform the structure of the National Health Service in Scotland to replace the internal market were detailed in "Designed to Care: Renewing the National Health Service in Scotland" (Cm 3811). I intend to publish proposals related to the broader health agenda shortly, taking account of the responses to consultation on "Working Together for a Healthier Scotland" (Cm 3584). All these documents are in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90209w14.html_para3">The Government's priorities for improving school education are set out in our White Paper "Targeting Excellence: Modernising Scotland's Schools" (Cm 4247) which was published on 27 January. Our priorities for post-16 education and training are set out in our Green Paper "Opportunity Scotland" (Cm 4048) published in September 1998. I sent the hon. Member copies of these documents, and copies are also available in the Library of the House. For higher education, our priorities are set out in the Government's responses to the Dearing and Garrick reports, published in February 1998. I sent the hon. Member a copy of the Garrick report, and copies of both reports are available in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what plans he has for the future disposal of healthcare waste from the <i>(a)</i> Hairmyres and Stonehouse Hospitals NHS Trust, <i>(b)</i> Law Hospital NHS Trust and <i>(c)</i> Monklands Hospital NHS Trust; what sites will be used for (i) the incineration and (ii) the landfill disposal of medical waste; and if he will make a statement.

 Following a recent tendering exercise which was carried out in consultation with public health doctors, specialist engineers and environmentalists, including the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, a contract was awarded to Eurocare Environmental Services Limited which will, from 1 April 1999, service the clinical waste disposal needs of two-thirds of Scotland's NHS Trusts. All of the Lanarkshire Trusts have given a commitment to be part of the contract which across Scotland is expected to realise savings of around &#163;6m for re-investment in patient care. Under the arrangements the bulk of the clinical waste from Lanarkshire will be treated at a disinfector/heat treatment plant in Cumbernauld. When processed, the safe, inert residue will be disposed of at a licensed landfill site near Cumbernauld. There are also low volume, higher risk clinical waste materials which will be disposed of by incineration at plants in the Midlands of England.

 The Barnett formula is used to calculate the Scottish share of changes to the baselines of those English or English and Welsh programmes which are comparable to Scottish programmes. It is not applied to specific projects. The Departmental Expenditure Limit figures for Scotland for the years 1999-2000 to 2000-01, which were calculated in accordance with the Barnett formula, are set out in Table 22.1 of the Comprehensive Spending Review White Paper "Modern Public Services for Britain: Investing in Reform" (Cm 4011).

 The Judicial Committee of the Privy Council is the final court of appeal of Trinidad and Tobago. It is for Trinidad and Tobago to exercise its sovereign right to decide whether or not it wishes to retain this avenue of appeal. The Government do consider, however, that if Trinidad and Tobago were to decide to withdraw from the appellate jurisdiction of the Judicial Committee, it would be appropriate first to ensure access to an appeals procedure of equivalent stature. There have been discussions to that effect between my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney- General of Trinidad and Tobago on several occasions.

 Following our initial response in the aftermath of Hurricane Mitch, (&#163;4.2 million bilateral emergency aid and &#163;10 million towards the World Bank's multilateral trust fund) we have been carefully considering our future assistance.
<P>

<a name="90209w17.html_para2">Part of the &#163;4.2 million assistance included rebuilding secondary roads and bridges, repairing water and sanitation infrastructure, restoring primary health and education services and work on epidemiological surveillance and epidemic control. A Department for International Development mission is planning to visit Honduras and Nicaragua on 22 February to check on the progress of this work and look at possible longer-term assistance. The team will hold meetings with the relevant government ministries and non-governmental organisations.
<P>

<a name="90209w17.html_para3">Before Hurricane Mitch struck, we had already planned to spend &#163;6 million in Central America over the next two years, working with some of the key multilateral organisations. We will now refocus our assistance in the light of the need for reconstruction. We have recently signed an agreement with the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) in which DFID will provide funds to strengthen the capacity of local organisations to enable them to make more effective use of loans provided by the IDB.
<P>

<a name="90209w17.html_para4">We are also currently looking at supporting a regional rural development and natural resources technical assistance unit (RUTA), possible co-operation with the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO) on health projects in the region as well as long-term support alongside the emergency road-building project announced in December.

 The UK and the European Commission rarely provide direct financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority. In cases where assistance has been so provided, special payment and accounting mechanisms have been incorporated to ensure that funds have been properly spent. UK aid to the Palestinians is largely in the form of technical co-operation and support to non-government organisations, who are major deliverers of services in the West Bank and Gaza. EC and UK projects and programmes are regularly monitored, including site visits, to ensure that funds are used for agreed purposes.
<P>

The problems encountered by the Agency during its first 2-3 years are a matter of public record. From a slow beginning, the amounts of maintenance collected and arranged rose to just over &#163;301M in 1995/6, and to just under &#163;400M in 1996/7.
<BR>
The &#163;547.14M collected and arranged in 1997/98 represented an increase of 37 per cent on the amount in 1996/97, while the amount retained by the Secretary of State in the same period grew by 27 per cent.
<BR>
Our emphasis is on getting maintenance flowing, and in doing this supporting the Government's aims for keeping lone parents off benefit and the New Deal arrangements for helping those on benefit into work.

My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has written to all English Local Education Authorities to urge them to match the cash increase in their education SSA with a corresponding cash increase in their education budgets. We will be monitoring the spending plans of authorities when they set their final education budgets to see whether they actually use the cash increases for education services.

 The Chancellor has regular meetings with the Governor of the Bank of England at which a wide range of issues is discussed. He also receives regular reports from the Bank. There is no record of him meeting the Chairman of Standard Chartered Bank since his appointment as Chancellor. On coming into office, the Government announced their proposals to reform the system of financial supervision. The first stage was the Bank of England Act 1998 which transferred banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. A further Bill implementing the reforms in full was published, in

 The Treasury has regular discussions with building societies and their representatives, who have put forward a number of proposals for legislation in recent years. Many of them, however, involve reducing Boards' accountability, or otherwise limit the rights of members--especially the less well off. This seems to the Government to be incompatible with the fundamental principles of mutuality. The Government have, however, increased the turnout threshold on conversion votes from 20 to 50 per cent., to ensure that conversions can occur only with the clear endorsement of members.

 We are actively working to finalise the new procedural guidelines and administrative arrangements, together with proposals on the charges livestock exporters would need to pay.

<P>
<a name="90209w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The specific information requested is not available. However, the European Commission's 1997 report on the common organisation of the market in raw tobacco says that the European Union consumes about 23 per cent. of its tobacco production. The main export markets for EU raw tobacco are the former-USSR, Central and Eastern European Countries, North Africa and the USA.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The European Commission's 1997 report on the common organisation of the market in tobacco says that there are about 135,000 tobacco farmers in the Community, and that the number of people who earn their living farming tobacco exceeds this figure. In addition, 



<P>

the report says that some 30,000 people were employed in the first processing of tobacco in 1990 (including seasonal jobs).

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimates his Department has made of the current compliance costs of the Parental Leave Directive to the United Kingdom, in the context of the Employment Relations Bill; how many newly-entitled employees there will be; how many are expected to be <i>(a)</i> full-time and <i>(b)</i> part-time workers; and how many in each category are expected to be employed in firms with workforces (i) up to 10, (ii) up to 20, (iii) up to 50, (iv) up to 250 and (v) over 250.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> Estimates are not available in the form requested. However, the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Employment Relations Bill, which has now been published, estimates the compliance costs of our proposals to implement the Directive at &#163;36 million per year to employers. The estimate assumes that beneficiaries will include some 61,500 parents per year who will take up the new entitlement to parental leave, and 560,000 employees who will be protected by the statutory right when they take time off to deal with a domestic emergency. Full-time and part-time employees will be entitled to the new rights on the same basis.

 Copies of the review of the Internet Watch Foundation, conducted by KPMG and Denton hall, were placed in the Libraries of the House of Commons and the House of Lords this morning. The report is also available on the Department's website. The report commends the success of the IWF since its inception in 1996, and makes recommendations for improvement to keep pace with the rapid developments taking place in the Internet industry.
<P>

<a name="90209w23.html_para5">The IWF's structure, hotline operations and relationship with the Internet industry, Metropolitan Police and National Criminal Intelligence Service were all examined as part of the review. Work on developing rating systems, future activities and funding arrangements were also considered.
<P>

<a name="90209w23.html_para6">Findings show a steady increase in the number of reports of potentially illegal material received and processed by the IWF, mainly from outside the UK. Other key points include:
<P>

<a name="90209w23.html_para7"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there were 453 actionable reports of illegal material on the Internet from December 1996 until end of August 1998;

But the Report also shows that a good deal more work needs to be done. I welcome the report's recommendations for the further development of the IWF and encourage the Internet Industry and the IWF to consider them carefully as a basis for developing the IWF's work in future.

<P>
<a name="90209w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Good progress has been made in consultation with industry in developing detailed plans for an auction of licences for third generation (3G) mobile telecommunications. The Government have been considering further how to provide benefits to the full range of customers from increased and sustainable competition in view of the opportunities presented by the Information Age.
<P>

<a name="90209w23.html_para20">Key issues addressed in consultation have included:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) means of helping potential new entrants to the mobile market in the UK compete on a fair basis;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) the opportunities provided by technical development affecting the proposed number and design of licences.</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90209w23.html_para21">In the light of these consultations the Government remain committed to their overall aim and objectives, which are those previously described to the House by my hon. Friend the present Financial Secretary on 18 May 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>233</i>. In particular, the Government continue to attach great importance to the further development of competition in the sector, including promotion of sustainable market entry. To this end it is minded to ensure the availability for a period of roaming onto second generation networks by any new entrants to the mobile market. It is also initiating a further brief consultation on the specific proposal that five licences be offered, a larger one being reserved for a new entrant.
<P>

<a name="90209w23.html_para22">The Government expect that, subject to market and other developments and to final decisions nearer the time, the auction will take place in the second part of the financial year 1999-2000.

 We call on all countries to abolish the death penalty. Where the death penalty is used we urge that it should be used only in accordance with the State's international obligations and international standards. Together with our EU partners we have made a number of representations in Trinidad and Tobago on the cases of individual death row inmates.
<P>

<a name="90209w24.html_para7">Last year, together with our EU partners, we also urged Trinidad and Tobago to revoke their decisions to withdraw from the American Convention on Human Rights and to denounce and re-accede to the first Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights with a reservation on death penalty issues.
<P>

<a name="90209w24.html_para8">We have also held a number of bilateral discussions on the subject of the death penalty with members of the Trinidadian Government, including discussions at the Caribbean Forum in Nassau, chaired by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary, and attended by members of the Trinidadian Government. My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, Baroness Symons, also invited the Trinidad and Tobago High Commissioner to call on her in response to their individual cases where death warrants had been served. We are currently considering, with EU partners, what further representations to make to the Trinidad and Tobago Government.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> Usage of this geographical term is as described in my answer to the hon. Member for Sevenoaks of 1 February 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>496</i>. This has no implications for our position on sovereignty over British waters around Gibraltar. It is not practical to conduct a survey of past usage, but I understand that both terms have been used in public documents in the past.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90209w24.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 This Interfax report was inaccurate in several important respects, as current investigations into the murders of the hostages in Chechnya confirm. Our information at the time of the report supported this assessment. We had seen nothing then, or since, to indicate that the hostages had ever been held outside Chechnya. H.M. Embassy had been in recent close contact with the Russian authorities, who had undertaken to inform us if they obtained any detailed information on the location of the hostages. It was clear then, as now, that no Russian rescue operation was planned. The media report followed a long series of similarly unreliable reports from Chechnya seen by the FCO during the previous 18 months.

<a name="90209w24.html_para9">As is usual in such cases, FCO officials circulated the report in Whitehall. A copy was also faxed to Granger Telecom.

 This Department does not keep a comprehensive record of telephone calls made by officials.

 No such promises were made. Following Senator Pinochet's arrest on 16 October, the FCO received two Notes from the Government of Chile (on 17 and 23 October). Neither of these refers to promises from HMG to assist in the Senator's travel arrangements.
