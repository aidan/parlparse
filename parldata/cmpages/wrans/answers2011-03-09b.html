As part of our reform of the welfare system we are introducing a number of measures to support young people to find employment. Jobcentre Plus local offices are being given more control to allow them to deliver a more personalised service in a way that is more responsive to local needs. Under the Work Programme, providers will be free to design support based on the needs of individuals and target the right support at the right time. Both Jobcentre Plus and Work Programme providers will work with local public, private, and third sector organisations where this delivers the best job outcomes for individuals.</p>

 On 16 December, Government launched consultations on a package of options for reforming the electricity market. The preferred package is to have a ‘contract for difference’ model for supporting low-carbon generation in combination with a targeted capacity mechanism, carbon price support and an emissions performance standard. Due to the high upfront costs and low running costs nature of most low carbon generating plant, the preferred package may increase business electricity prices and bills in the near term, but from the mid 2020s onwards prices are expected to be lower than they otherwise would be.

               <i>[holding answer 7 March 2011]:</i> It is not possible to make a reliable estimate of the likely commercial interest rate which will be offered to Green Deal customers at this stage. We are working with the finance industry to ensure that the design of the scheme is robust enough to secure the most efficient types of financing, which in turn, will drive down the cost. The Green Deal is a market mechanism and therefore it is not appropriate for government to dictate the interest rate. We may however, set out permissible financial terms in secondary legislation to ensure consumer protection, and will be considering whether these should place controls on the structure of interest rates which can be applied to Green Deal plans.</p>

 The Compact between this coalition Government and civil society organisations was agreed and launched on 16 December 2010. It was accompanied by guidance on accountability and transparency for the first time, ensuring that Government Departments as well as civil society organisations are clear about the level of commitment and the implications for not following the Compact. The Cabinet Office considers policy that is relevant to civil society organisations from a Compact perspective, ensuring that it is adhered to, and where it is not possible for whatever reason, that this is explained to the sector in an open and transparent manner.</p>

 The big society is more than a collection of policies—it is an approach which is at the heart of the Government's reforms across all policy areas with the aim of localising power and opening up public services and encouraging social action. Each department has a range of specific programmes which will contribute to growing the big society. These policies are coordinated across Government through meetings at official and ministerial level, including the Informal Ministerial Group on the Big Society and Localism, which shares ideas and supports progress on cross cutting-issues relating to the big society.</p>

1. The preferred statistics on benefits are now derived from 100% data sources. However, the 5% sample data still provide some detail not yet available from the100% data sources. DWP recommends that, where the detail is only available on the 5% sample data, the proportions derived should be scaled up to the overall 100% total for the benefit. These figures have been scaled up to the overall total.
2. Figures are rounded to the nearest 100 therefore totals may not sum due to rounding.
3. These data were extracted from the Department's tabulation tool at:
http://83.244.183.180/5pc/tabtool.html
then rated up.

 The UK Government can agree to the principles that underpin the Platform or the European Commission’s aspiration to lift 20 million people out of relative poverty by 2020. These goals are in line with the Government’s commitment to freedom, fairness and responsibility. However, our support is contingent on there being no additional resource implications for the UK and upon full respect for the principles of UK competence as provided for in the EU Treaties.</p>

<i>Guide to Quality:</i>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV—for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.
<i>Key:</i>
* 0 = CV&lt;5%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered precise
** 5 = CV &lt;10%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered reasonably precise
*** 10 = CV &lt;20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered acceptable
**** CV ≥ 20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes
CV = Coefficient of Variation
<i>Note:</i>
It should be noted that the above estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels mobile home sites etc.).

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport does not hold separate measures of the arts and creative industries’ contribution to the economy. The contribution of music, performing and visual arts to the economy is measured as part of the DCMS Creative Industries Economic Estimates. We estimate that the contribution of the creative industries to the economy as a whole was 5.6% of gross value added (GVA) in 2008. GVA is the most accurate measure of an industry's contribution to the economy and so this measure is used instead of GDP.</p>

The Department for International Development (DFID) is working with other donors to support the Government of Afghanistan with the implementation of its second National Education Strategic Plan, which aims to raise enrolment from 7 million to 9 million in the next three years. Key components of the plan include increasing the number of female teachers (by expanding their intake at teacher training centres); ensuring 200 secondary schools for girls are built in rural areas; and ensuring 2,540 local communities have increasing responsibility for managing safety arrangements at schools, so that both girls and boys can attend and enjoy school safely.</p>

 A recent Education Sector Analysis, conducted in preparation for Afghanistan’s application for the global Education for All initiative, highlighted many barriers to girls’ education, including lack of female teachers, limited number of girls’ schools, safety and security issues and distance of travel. The Department for International Development (DFID), along with other donors, is working with the Government of Afghanistan to help address these challenges. For example, the support we have provided through the Government’s Education Quality Improvement Programme has enabled communities and schools to come together to enhance safeguards for girls travelling to and being in school.</p>

 The Multilateral Aid Review (MAR) was conducted by staff from the Department for International Development (DFID), reporting directly to the Secretary of State for International Development. DFID staff sought comments and evidence from a range of stakeholders, including the multilateral organisations themselves, civil society organisations such as non-government organisations and trade unions, other Government Departments and developing country partners. In addition, two leading academics in the field of development studies acted as joint external reviewers for the Review.</p>

The Secretary of State for International Development discussed the ILO with Brendan Barber, General Secretary of the TUC, on 15 December 2010. Department for International Development (DFID) officials met the TUC in January 2011 to discuss the MAR’s findings relating to the ILO and I discussed the review of the ILO with representatives of the TUC in February 2011.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence has made no estimates of the total cost of its procurement and outsourcing functions. We have estimated that the cost of the commercial element of the procurement function in 2009-10 was £153 million. The commercial element of the procurement function is a sub-set of the overall cost, which also includes the cost of project management, the supply chain and the costs involved over the entire life-cycle of a project, from initial requirement and concept, through to ultimate final disposal. This estimate is based on an average cost of the number of commercial staff in the main commercial areas, including overheads. The estimate for the Private Finance Unit, which is part of the outsourcing function, was £0.7 million.</p>

 The Department currently has a contract with the Specialist Schools and Academies Trust (SSAT) to run the Enterprise Network to support enterprise education. The network is made up of Enterprise Learning Partnerships (ELPs), each chaired by a head teacher with representatives on the board from two secondary schools, two primary schools, a special school, a further education college and an employer. There are currently 54 ELPs covering 99.6% of local authority areas in England. Lead practitioners for each sector of education have been identified in each region to share their ideas for enterprise education with their peers.</p>

They will be able to use the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) for this purpose which, from financial year 2011-12, will include the £55 million that used to be notionally allocated for enterprise education but is no longer earmarked for that purpose. Schools are free to spend the DSG however they so choose.</p>

The recent Localism Bill included measures to give local organisations and local authority employees the right to challenge local authorities to run services if they can do things better or more cost effectively. The Government are also working with local authorities, the early years sector and the Association of Chief Executives of Voluntary Organisations, to discuss how to overcome practical barriers to increasing voluntary and community sector involvement in children's centres. In addition, the Department is investing £59 million each year over the next two years to directly fund voluntary and community sector organisations to deliver a range of grant funded activities of national significance in relation to children, young people and families, with a particular emphasis on early intervention and supporting the most disadvantaged.</p>

 The purpose of the Education Endowment Fund is to fund bold and innovative approaches into ways of raising the attainment of disadvantaged pupils in underperforming schools. If a sixth form or a further education college considered it could support an underperforming school to raise attainment then it would be eligible to submit an application for consideration to the organisation administering the Fund.</p>

               <a name="11030977000792"> The intention of the collaboration incentive as described in the Schools White Paper is to reward schools who support weaker schools demonstrably to improve their performance while also improving their own. The design of the scheme is still in progress, and so no decision has yet been taken about whether sixth form and further education colleges are in scope for any of its activities.</p>

 The Young People’s Learning Agency currently allocate the discretionary learner support fund to schools, colleges and training providers on behalf of the Department for Education. The funds are currently allocated according to a formula which takes into account a range of factors including the student population and levels of deprivation. We are considering the replacement for the EMA, including how the funds should be allocated to ensure that support is targeted on those children who most need it to allow them to continue in education.</p>

Were this to be used for the pupil premium a decision would need to be made about which areas should be defined as ‘deprived’. The number of pupils eligible for the pupil premium using either of these methods would depend on which ‘types’ were chosen to represent areas of deprivation. The more types selected, the more pupils would be living in them.</p>

 The Education Bill proposes a statutory duty on schools to secure access to independent careers guidance for all pupils aged 13 to 16. The guidance should be presented in an impartial manner and include information on 16 to 18 education or training options, including apprenticeships. Schools will have the freedom to decide how best to fulfil this duty in accordance with the needs of their pupils. This approach is founded on a partnership model where schools work alongside specialist careers advisers to ensure all pupils have access to appropriate levels of high quality support.</p>

            <p>Start children's centres was £1,135 million. From April 2011, funding for Sure Start will form part of the new un-ringfenced Early Intervention Grant which in total is worth £2,222 million in 2011-12 and £2,307 million in 2012-13. It is for local authorities to determine the most effective use of the funding in the Early Intervention Grant. We have ensured there is enough money in the Early Intervention Grant to maintain a network of Sure Start children's centres, accessible to all, while identifying and supporting families in greatest need.</p>

               <a name="11030977001031"> Intervening early makes sense socially, morally and financially. Local authorities continue to have duties under the Childcare Act 2006 to consult before opening, closing or significantly changing children's centres and to secure sufficient provision to meet local need, so far as is reasonably practicable. In addition, the Department for Education's partner supporting local authorities' work on children's centres until March 2011, Together for Children, will be ready to assist local authorities in making plans to keep centres open.</p>

 The RENEW North Staffordshire Pathfinder, for which Stoke on Trent city council is the accountable body, was allocated £108.2 million of housing market renewal funding in 2008-11. Dedicated funding for the housing market renewal programme ends in March 2011 and with the country facing a record deficit and less money available for top-down investment, we need to find innovative ways to deliver regeneration. This will require an ambitious and creative approach to the new funding sources such as new homes bonus, affordable rent/empty homes and private sector and asset based investment. I have also announced a transition fund of £5 million for growth and housing market renewal areas to retain key capacity to help tackle these issues.</p>

               <a name="11030977001205"> The new homes bonus, for example, is payable both on new build and on bringing long-term empty homes back into use. Stoke on Trent’s provisional new homes bonus allocation for 2011-12 is £1,105,641. There will need to be a much greater emphasis on refurbishment than previously. Where local authorities in former housing market renewal areas wish to develop a transition plan based on this approach, my Department and the Homes and Community Agency will be ready to help.</p>

 Good progress is being made in respect of the transfer of Thurrock Thames Gateway Development Corporation to Thurrock borough council. A first step towards this will be the co-location of the corporation with Thurrock council at its Grays offices. This will enable them to work more closely together during the final year of the corporation's operation. This co-location is an important step which will generate a number of benefits, for instance by encouraging the council and corporation to work together more effectively on regeneration and planning; and by promoting the sharing of knowledge and expertise between staff at the corporation and council and thereby strengthening the council's capacity to drive regeneration.</p>

               <b>Mr Paice:</b>
 The current EU regulatory framework governing country of origin labelling needs to be improved. This is why we are pressing for clearer origin labelling in negotiations on the new EU Food Information Regulation. We have been successful in extending mandatory origin labelling to all fresh meat with the possibility, subject to a review, of extending origin labelling to other foods. Negotiations are continuing and it is not expected that the regulation will be adopted and published until early 2012.</p>

The Forestry Panel will advise the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on all aspects of public benefits when it reports later this year.</p>

 We will put in place the necessary legislation to implement the provisions of the EU Timber Regulation in the United Kingdom. The forthcoming Due Diligence Regulations prohibit the first-placing of illegal timber on the EU market, restricting its purchase, possession and sale down the supply chain. This will be complemented by the Forest Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) Regulation, which requires timber imports from countries which have signed a Voluntary Partnership Agreement with the EU to carry a licence to prove legality. These new legislative measures underline our commitment to eliminate illegal timber from the UK market.</p>

 Thermal treatment includes both incineration/combustion and other treatments, such as gasification and pyrolysis.

                     <i>Notes:</i>
1. Estimate of alcohol-related admissions
The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory (NWPHO), which uses 48 indicators for alcohol-related illnesses, determining the proportion of a wide range of diseases and injuries that can be partly attributed to alcohol as well as those that are, by definition, wholly attributable to alcohol. Further information on these proportions can be found at:
www.nwph.net/nwpho/publications/AlcoholAttributableFractions.pdf
The application of the NWPHO methodology was updated in summer 2010 and is now available directly from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES). Information about episodes estimated to be alcohol-related may be slightly different from previously published data.
2. Accident and Emergency
Admission method Codes 21 and 28 were used:
21: Emergency via A&amp;E, including the casualty department of the provider;
28: Emergency: Other means including patients who arrive via the A&amp;E department of another healthcare provider.
3. SHA/PCT of residence
The SHA or PCT containing the patient’s normal home address. This does not necessarily reflect where the patient was treated as they may have travelled to another SHA/PCT for treatment.
4. Assessing growth through time
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in national health service practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.
5. Data quality
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.

 In 2010, the Department commissioned the Health Protection Agency (HPA) to conduct a cost-effectiveness study on the human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccination. This study is taking into account new data on the potential protection provided by the HPV vaccines against cancer and non-cancer diseases, including genital warts. This study includes data from two recently published papers that report on the numbers of borderline and mild smears that contained either HPV6 or HPV11<sup>(1)</sup>, and the economic benefit of reducing such smears by eliminating HPV6 and HPV11<sup>(2)</sup>. The cost-effectiveness study for the HPV vaccine, which has not yet been published by the HPA, will support the next procurement exercise for the HPV immunisation programme that is taking place in 2011.</p>

If a financial adviser from another member state sets up a branch in the UK, the RDR conduct of business rules will apply to it, including the disclosure and adviser charging rules. If it passports without setting up a branch, then its home member state conduct of business rules will apply instead—but a firm will not be permitted to operate on a cross-border services basis in the UK if it is doing so for the express purpose of evading RDR standards.</p>

1. Staff absence is given as sickness absence (paid time off for holidays and public duties etc. are referred to as annual and special leave respectively).
2. There have been structural changes within HMRC over the period covered by the table. Data which could not be attributed to a particular business stream have been recorded as ‘unknown’. The two former Departments did not move to a single IT system until November 2006 and that accounts for the relatively high number of unknowns in that year.
3. The numbers are actual days taken and not the full time equivalent.
4. The staff sickness absence reasons are ranked on the number of days taken by that absence.

 Businesses may move their headquarters for a combination of reasons, including tax, and can restructure in different ways with different tax consequences, depending on the facts in each case. One form of restructuring involves businesses formerly headed by a UK tax resident company creating a new parent company that is claimed to be tax resident elsewhere.

 The World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) publishes worldwide patent application and grant statistics every year, according to the information it receives from patent offices around the world. Although it has previously published comparator tables on the number of patents granted per million of population, it has not done so for recent years, and in this year’s publication it notes that patent offices do not consistently report the origin of patents granted.</p>

               <a name="11031010001414"> Several points should be borne in mind in making such comparisons. First, patents do not cover all areas of industrial and commercial endeavour, and so patent filings will reflect a country's economic structure. Some innovations are more likely to be monetised through other types of intellectual property, such as designs, trade marks, copyright, know how, and plant breeders rights. And there are some specific exceptions from patent protection under most national laws. Secondly, individual patents are not equal in value, which can depend on market forces and how well the patent has been drafted to stand up against challenge. Studies have shown that patent value is skewed so that a small percentage of patents overall turn out to have a very high value compared with the remainder. Thirdly, an applicant may choose not to patent in a particular  <br/>

 The UK is strongly committed to an EU patent, or a unitary patent, that delivers real benefits for businesses and the European economy. The proposed unitary patent will offer an additional choice to businesses wishing to obtain patent protection covering the majority of the EU market. Estimates of the savings to business and economic impact are difficult to make as they depend on the arrangements that are finally agreed. But a unitary patent should allow businesses to save the costs of filing translations in order to validate their patent in the different countries concerned. Compared with a typical European patent under the current system, there could be savings of between £10,000 and £20,000 per patent on translations alone. For UK businesses currently taking out around 2,000 European patents per year this could represent a saving of £20-40 million a year. Other savings should be possible from simplified administration and enforcement of patents in Europe; the proposals are not sufficiently advanced to allow quantitative assessment.</p>
