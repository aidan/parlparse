Grease from hot food premises is acknowledged as a significant cause of drain blockages. Drainage is dealt with in part H of the Building Regulations and when the guidance was comprehensively revised in 2002 additional guidance was added about the provision of grease control measures to hot food premises. Where drains malfunction, building legislation provides local authorise with enforcement powers to ensure that the problem is remedied.</p>

Millions of women and girls suffer complications following unsafe abortion and around 67,000 die as a result of these complications. Most of these abortions, complications and deaths could be prevented if people who wished to had access to family planning and if abortion services had been legally available and affordable everywhere. Progress to achieve Millennium Development Goal number five, Improve Maternal Health, cannot be made unless we are prepared to do something to reduce the death and disability caused by unsafe abortion.</p>

 Central records have been held since 2002 of all civilian staff dismissals and the disciplinary cases which lead up to them. Cases are recorded electronically under general classification headings, but those are not sufficiently detailed to enable identification of cases specifically related to loss of property. More detail about each case is recorded as free text of varying length which can be individually examined and which would include more detail about the precise nature of the offence.</p>

<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

** 5 = CV &lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise.<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt;20 Estimates are considered acceptable.<br>
**** CV = 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes.<br>

 Prior to April 2006, most primary dental services were provided under former General Dental Service (GDS) arrangements.

The primary dental service funding allocations made to West Hertfordshire PCT for each of the three years since PCTs assumed full responsibility for primary dental care services are in the following table. These are net of income from dental charges paid by patients, which are retained locally to supplement the resources available for dentistry. Actual expenditure levels are determined by the pattern and type of services commissioned by each PCT. PCTs may also dedicate some of their other NHS resources to dentistry if they consider this an appropriate local priority. Allocations are not apportioned by individual constituencies or towns; PCTs determine the distribution of resources within their area on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>

 Foetal anticonvulsant syndrome describes a group of disorders in which birth defects and developmental disorders occur in association with a characteristic facial appearance in children whose mothers took antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy. Information on the total number of individuals diagnosed in the United Kingdom with foetal anticonvulsant syndrome is not available, however epidemiological studies suggest that the incidence of birth defects in babies born to mothers receiving antiepileptic medicines is approximately two to three times higher than the background rate in the general population.</p>

Findings from this register were published in 2005 and suggested that almost 96 per cent. of live-births born to women with epilepsy did not have a major birth defect.

<p><a name="stpa_537"><a name="90303w0019.htm_para6"><a name="09030420001849">The authorised product information on sodium valproate for prescribers and the patient information leaflet contain clear advice about its safety of use during pregnancy. This includes information about the potential for birth defects and recommends that any woman taking sodium valproate who is likely to become pregnant should receive specialist advice on these risks. There is also a recommendation that if taken during pregnancy sodium valproate should be used as monotherapy at the lowest effect dose. Folic acid supplementation prior to pregnancy is also recommended as this may reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida.</p>

This features an automatic right to advocacy for any young person, independent consideration of all stage 2 complaints through an independent person, and also a review panel (with a minimum of two independent people on it) for all stage 3 complaints. The director of children&#146;s services will normally become involved with complaints that reach stage 3 (though s/he will be briefed on complaints in general and all significant cases by the complaints manager).</p>

 Access to the national health service care record 'spine' is strictly controlled by the use of smartcards, which are only issued on proof of identity and residence. The smartcards contain role-based profiles that restrict access to patient information depending on the role performed.</p>

 All chief executives of primary care trusts and directors for children and learners at each regional Government offices in England were sent a copy of &#147;Healthy lives, brighter futures: The strategy for children and young people&#146;s health&#148; and the &#147;Securing better health for children and young people through world class commissioning&#148; documents. In addition to this we sent a copy of each to a number of organisations. A list of these organisations are shown as follows. Both documents have already been placed in the Library and are also available from the Department of Health and Department for Children, Schools and Families websites, where hard copies may be ordered.</p>

The Secretaries of State for Health and Children, Schools and Families were involved at key stages in the development of the strategy. Both Secretaries of State hosted a deliberative event for parents and teenagers in June 2008, and further deliberative events were held with other groups, including child health professionals and parents of children with complex health needs. The cost of these events totalled &#163;125,120.07, including VAT. Other work to develop the strategy was carried out by officials from the Department of Health and Department for Children, Schools and Families and through a range of meetings with stakeholders. Costs for this work cannot be identified separately.</p>

 Overpayments can be identified for a variety of reasons following an audit of an institution&#146;s records. There is then a process of mitigation to determine the extent of any repayment. In addition there are ongoing adjustments to grant throughout the year to reflect student recruitment against indicative plans. As a result the information requested is not readily available. It is held across a disparate set of paper and electronic records and would take a considerable amount of time and resource to assemble. This information is therefore available only at disproportionate cost.</p>

Furthermore the term &#147;child abuse&#148; describes harm caused to a child arising from emotional. physical, sexual abuse or neglect caused by a parent or carer.

These included making it mandatory that a Deduction from Benefits Order or an Attachment of Earnings Order be the first form of enforcement to be applied following default or history of default. It introduced clamping of vehicles, fines payment work (currently being piloted), fine increases and the registration of financial credit (which may affect their ability to obtain credit). Other enforcement tools include warrants of execution, delivery and/or possession (where a bailiff may seize goods, money and land to the value of the debt). Imprisonment is the ultimate sanction for the non-payment for financial penalties, where the court has exhausted all other enforcement options.</p>

A range of interventions is available for prisoners with an alcohol problem.

 A multiple offender entry (MOE) is an individual offender who, after entering the cohort (by either being discharged from prison, or commencing a court order under probation supervision), commits a reoffence and is further discharged from prison or commences a court order within the same 1st quarter period in a given year.

1. The Police National Computer data can contain records where the type of court in which the case was heard was unknown. This missing information only impacts a very small minority of cases, and was more a feature of the data in the past than in the present. Thus, the sum of cases heard in magistrates courts and the Crown court in each year is less than all cases heard in England and Wales.<br>
2. The counts of persistent young offenders for the London borough of Bexley are very small subsets of the overall London and England and Wales populations, and as such are subject to year-to-year volatility.<br>
3. The counts for 2008 are based on provisional (incomplete) data and are therefore subject to being revised. Any revision should not result in a substantial increase in these counts.<br>

 The Government&#146;s Biomass Strategy, published in 2007, and the 2008 consultation document on the Government&#146;s Renewable Energy Strategy, issued by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, discuss the potential impacts on air quality from the use of biomass for local heating. These recognise the benefits in carbon reduction from the use of biomass, such as wood pellets, over fossil fuels such as coal or fuel oil, but that in some cases, this would result in increased emissions of air pollutants. The consultation document sets out ways the Government are seeking to facilitate uptake of biomass heat without compromising air quality or public health. A final strategy is due to be published later this year.</p>

 The current global economic climate is one of a number of factors determining investment in renewable energy projects.

For the most part vertically integrated companies are well placed to manage their own capital requirements.

Our Renewable Energy Strategy, due to be finalised in spring 2009, will build on these to provide an attractive framework for investment. Furthermore, the Secretary of State announced in the pre-Budget report that we would be extending the renewables obligation (RO) until 2037. This will ensure that investors can plan with confidence for the future so that over the next decade the market will continue to deliver the renewables projects that we need to achieve our 2020 target.</p>

Therefore, the NPSs only directly apply to decisions for new infrastructure in those areas. However, energy policy is generally a reserved matter and the Scottish Executive must have regard to policy statements on energy as a relevant consideration in decisions. NPSs are, for these purposes, a statement of Government policy, so we expect that NPSs will be a relevant consideration for decisions by Scottish Ministers on energy infrastructure in Scotland.</p>

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to his question today 259459 regarding the number of wind farms expected to begin construction in the next five years. It is not possible to provide a precise figure for the number of turbines as this will vary by site according to factors such as location and wind speed. In addition, larger turbines are being developed, meaning fewer turbines may be needed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_672"><a name="90303w0031.htm_para2"><a name="09030420004945">However, taking an average turbine size of 3 megawatts (MW) it is possible to estimate the number of turbines which may be built for projects awaiting construction and those presently in the planning system.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_673"><a name="90303w0031.htm_para3"><a name="09030420004946">For example, there are currently 7855.1 MWe of onshore and offshore wind developments awaiting construction. This would be equivalent to 2618 3MW turbines. For those in planning, 7261.7 MWe of onshore and offshore wind would be equivalent to 2420 3MW turbines. However, not all of these projects may receive consent.</p>

A further &#163;6 million is also available for the next financial year, 2009/10. In total therefore there is now &#163;6 million available for RRS in 2008/09 and &#163;12 million in 2009/10.</p>

</ul><a name="90303w0032.htm_brev5"><a name="09030420006173"><ul><p class="tabletext">I should set the position in its full context. We typically deliver our Rapid Response Service in partnership with other local agencies&#151;for example local authorities, the Learning and Skills Council in England and others. It is very common for these partnerships to be able to provide the support and services individuals need from within their existing resources&#151;for example, local Jobcentre Plus staff would make initial workplace presentations, existing publicly funded training opportunities would be made available to people.</p>
</ul><a name="90303w0032.htm_brev6"><a name="09030420006174"><ul><p class="tabletext">In that context, our Rapid Response Service funding is designed to ensure that we are able to deliver support which individuals need in a specific situation, but which cannot be sourced from partners&#146; existing programmes and operations. Examples of the uses of RRS funding include providing individuals with a Skills Transfer Analysis, enabling individuals to undertake job-related training that is not available through partners&#146; existing programmes and supporting individuals to be able to take up a new job, for example with initial travel costs.</p>
</ul><a name="90303w0032.htm_brev7"><a name="09030420006175"><ul><p class="tabletext">I should add that each Jobcentre Plus district has appointed a Rapid Response Manager to co-ordinate RRS support.

</ul><a name="90303w0032.htm_brev8"><a name="09030420006176"><ul><p class="tabletext">We have allocated the additional RRS funding equally between each English region, Scotland, and Wales. A similar amount is held centrally in a contingency fund for those who need to call on any extra funds.</p>

Other domestic conditions of entitlement, such as the disability conditions and the past presence test, still apply.

 The Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform has lead responsibility for sponsorship of the construction industry. However, my Department, and our agencies, such as the Homes and Communities Agency, have regular dialogue with those sectors of the industry most directly engaged in meeting our departmental strategic objectives. This includes, but is not restricted to, house builders and developers and their supply chain partners. The dialogue is maintained largely through regular meetings with both individual representatives and representative bodies, such as the Home Builders Federation, as well as participation in round-tables, seminars and other fora. The downturn in house building levels has featured regularly in these discussions, as have many other issues facing the industry. The Government have been keen to explore ways to ensure that the effects of the downturn on house building output can be mitigated, so that vital new homes continue to be constructed, jobs and skills can be protected, and so that everything possible is in place to assist a rapid recovery in the market.</p>

It also stresses that the fact that a child has reached 16 years of age does not change his or her entitlement to services or protection under the Children Act 1989.</p>

This includes a review of the literature on the neglect of adolescents and the preparation of evidence-based materials to improve practice in this important area.

It is not possible to specifically identify a sum for learning disabilities. The local authority will then apply its local funding formula, which will have been developed in consultation with the Schools Forum, to allocate funding to the schools in their area and to ensure that their formula takes account of the individual needs and pressures of their schools.</p>

 By the end of 2008-09 academic year I fully expect that we will have reduced the funding gap between schools and colleges to around 5.6 per cent. This is in line with our commitment made in 2004-05 to reduce the gap by 8 percentage points. We will continue to close the gap further as funding allows but our priority is to maximise participation in learning by young people.</p>

Mark Haysom, the LSC's Chief Executive, has written to the hon. Member setting out that in the current year the estimated cost of closing the gap would have been more than &#163;135m. A copy of his letter will be placed in the Libraries.</p>

Our funding system which came into effect for 2008/09 uses standard funding rates per standard learner number (SLN, a measure of the number of learners and the breadth of their learning). The base rates per SLN in 2008/09 are &#163;2,945 for school sixth forms and &#163;2,860 for FE college learners (including Sixth Form Colleges).</p>
</ul><a name="90303w0041.htm_brev2"><a name="09030431001210"><ul><p class="tabletext">As this is a new system there are no equivalent figures for 2007/08 but one may use the difference between the two base rates (&#163;85) as a proxy for the difference in funding in 2007/08, as the rates have both increased by the 'minimum funding guarantee' of 2.1%. We estimate that the number of SLNs in FE in 2007/08 was 1,002,322. Therefore the cost of bringing up the base funding rate per learner in all colleges would be approximately &#163;85 million. In addition, schools receive a further &#163;50 million towards pension payments for teachers. There are also a number of other factors influencing the funding differences between school sixth forms and FE, which are explored in more detail in a report undertaken for the LSC by KPMG, published on 6 May 2008.

As custodial establishments vary in size, the larger ones will carry out proportionately more assessments and will therefore benefit from economies of scale in price negotiations within awarding bodies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_737"><a name="90303w0041.htm_para9"><a name="09030431000979">Before 2006-07 local authorities were funded through education formula spending (EFS). This formed part of the annual local government finance settlement. EFS comprised school functions and local education authority (LEA) central functions, whereas DSG only covers the school functions. The DSG is based on each local authority&#146;s spend on schools in 2005-06, up rated each year for cost pressures and adjusted for changes in pupil numbers. LEA central functions are still funded through the local government finance settlement but cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department&#146;s time series as the two sets of data are not comparable. For information the EFS figure for Westminster in 2005-06 was &#163;97.5 million.</p>

 Meetings have been held at official level with both the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the US President&#146;s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) since the new Administration took power. Both USAID and PEPFAR are experiencing considerable transition and it will take some months before policy and funding changes are clarified. Discussions will be on-going to engage with and where appropriate to influence this process.</p>

In addition the US President has made a clear statement in support of UNFPA and the US Congress has already passed the omnibus financial year 2009 Spending Bill that provides for US$50 million for UNFPA.</p>

 We expect that 7 million people will have received food aid in February, and more disease outbreaks are possible. The Government of Zimbabwe have failed to procure the share of food necessary, in turn creating additional pressure on existing supplies. Although the harvest looks set to be reasonable, it will be small in scale. It is expected that a significant food aid programme will be required in the coming year.</p>

 Years of political and economic mismanagement have eroded a once very fine health service in Zimbabwe. General health status indicators have fallen in the last few years and especially since the failed elections of 2008. The number of preventable deaths has increased significantly as public health services have been depleted. Rural transport networks have become expensive and the majority of Zimbabweans have found it increasingly difficult to access health services.</p>
