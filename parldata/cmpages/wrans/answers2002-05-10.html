<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many cases have been brought against her Department under the Human Rights Act 1998; and what has been the cost in <i>(a)</i> legal fees to defend cases and <i>(b)</i> compensation payments. [45059]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We do not collect records of all cases in which the Human Rights Act 1998 is relied on. Human rights are now integrated in the general law and are rarely the sole basis for a challenge. We do monitor centrally those cases which we consider may be of particular significance to this department. We have recorded 5 cases to date.
<P>

<a name="20510w01.html_para0">We do not collect separate information centrally about the costs to public funds, legal fees or compensation payments in cases which include a human rights issue. In most cases it will be difficult to single out associated costs relating to human rights elements.

<a name="20510w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the recently diagnosed cases of bovine TB in herds in Denbighshire, Powys and Monmouthshire; and what steps her Department is taking to control further spread of mycobacterium bovis infection. [53204]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Powys and Monmouthshire have suffered a number of TB incidents in recent years. In the first three months of this year raw data show there were 37 new incidents in Powys, 20 of which are provisionally confirmed as due to bovine TB.
<P>

<a name="20510w01.html_para1">Raw data show that in Monmouthshire some 36 new incidents were disclosed in the first three months of the year, of which 19 are provisionally confirmed as bovine TB.
<P>

<a name="20510w01.html_para2">One new confirmed bovine TB incident was recently disclosed in a herd in Denbighshire. Investigations into the origin of this incident are still ongoing.
<P>

<a name="20510w01.html_para3">The State Veterinary Service in Wales, in close consultation with the Welsh Assembly Government, is working to clear the TB test backlog, to restrict the movement of cattle off herds with suspected TB and to target resources effectively.
<P>

<a name="20510w01.html_para4">The causes of bovine TB are complex and the Government is seeking to proceed on the basis of sound science drawn from independent scientific and veterinary experts. A wide-ranging research programme has been put in place on advice from the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG). The programme extends to the

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what <i>(a)</i> formal and <i>(b)</i> informal meetings her Department has undertaken with the European Commission since 1 January; and if she will make a statement. [54487]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and her Ministerial colleagues meet the relevant Commissioners at meetings of the Agriculture, Fisheries and Environment Councils. In addition, the Secretary of State has met bilaterally with Commissioners Fischler (twice), Byrne, Wallstrom, Kinnock and Patten. I have met Fischler once during the period mentioned. The number of contacts between officials of the Department and representatives of the Commission, in the wide range of fora where they meet, could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.

<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by what criteria flood defences are graded in terms of being <i>(a)</i> maintained at their current level or <i>(b)</i> in need of enhancement. [54234]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Operational responsibility for planning, design, construction, maintenance, inspection and operation of flood defence measures rests with local operating authorities (the Environment Agency, Local Authorities and Internal Drainage Boards). The operating authorities determine which flood defences should be maintained at their current level and which are in need of enhancement. Efforts are being made to collate such information on a National Flood and Coastal Defence Database.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Barker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps are being taken to ensure <i>(a)</i> detailed mapping of areas at risk from flooding, <i>(b)</i> that insurance companies recognise the difference in flood risk within post-code areas and <i>(c)</i> that households are graded in accordance to direct risk. [54236]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has published indicative flood maps and has made these available to local authorities. Copies have recently been made available to Members of Parliament in England and Wales showing the indicative flood risk areas in their constituency. Smaller scale versions are also available to the public via the Internet. The Department is in discussion with the Agency to further develop this mapping and is currently funding work that will improve the information available. Discussions continue with both the Agency and ABI to improve the information available for assessing insurance risk.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to fund the repairs to flood defence systems identified as Government targets following the Bye report into the 1998 floods. [54637]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government drew up High Level Targets for Flood and Coastal Defence in 1999 in liaison with local operating authorities (the Environment Agency, Local Authorities and Internal Drainage Boards). The targets are intended to facilitate a more certain delivery of national policies and objectives for flood and coastal defence. However operational responsibility for planning, design, construction, maintenance, inspection and operation of flood defence measures rests with the local operating authorities.
<P>

<a name="20510w01.html_para6">I understand that the Environment Agency has repaired flood defences damaged in the 1998 floods, has carried out some improvements and is considering other improvements where they meet the normal economic, technical and environmental criteria.
<P>

<a name="20510w01.html_para7">Funding from this Department for capital works to all operating authorities has increased from an outturn of &#163;73 million in 1998&#150;99 to a planned &#163;114 million in 2003&#150;04.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if resources will be made available to improve the accuracy of the Environment Agency's maps and website relating to flood risk assessments. [54639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department is in discussion with the Environment Agency to further develop the indicative flood plain maps, copies of which have recently been made available to Members of Parliament in England and Wales, local authorities and, the general public (via the internet). DEFRA is currently funding work that will improve the data available. More detailed information will be available (as hardcopy and via the internet) in the Autumn.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will take steps 



<P>
<P><I>10 May 2002 : Column 360W</I><P>
to ensure that the National Environment Research Council fund research into deep seabed impacts by trawling. [54867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Office of Science and Technology within the Department of Trade and Industry is the responsible body within Government for the allocation of funds to the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) for scientific research, not DEFRA. Within the budget provision from OST NERC is funding a programme of research into the ecology of deep sea fish and the impact of deep-water fisheries on both commercial and non-target species. DEFRA has in the past funded research at NERC's marine laboratories on a wide range of subjects, and also liaises with NERC over the development of its thematic programmes. DEFRA is funding an extensive programme of research at the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Acquaculture Science and several other institutes into fishing impact on the seabed, but focussing on coastal rather than deep waters.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Lazarowicz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to prevent trawling damage to seabed communities. [54870]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Department is currently looking to establish Special Areas of Conservation and Special Protection Areas to extend the EC Habitats and Birds Directive beyond 12 nautical miles with a view to protecting vulnerable habitats and species. One potential site is an area of coral reef off the North West coast of Scotland known as the Darwin Mounds thought to have been subject to damage by trawl gear. We will work to get the Commission to bring forward the necessary legislation to restrict fishing activity where a habitat is in need of protection but is situated in international waters. More generally, one of our priorities for the forthcoming review of the Common Fisheries Policy is the greater integration of environmental concerns into fisheries policy: this will involve action to reduce the impact of fishing on non target species and sensitive habitats.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what total sums of public money, unavailable to urban areas, were paid in each of the past four years to rural areas in all forms of subsidies, compensations, concessions and reduced charges. [54827]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w02.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 It is difficult to draw an absolute line between urban and rural areas. Support for farmers will be available to farmers within a mainly urban area, for instance. It must also be remembered that these figures represent targeted funds. Other finances are targeted at purposes relating mainly or wholly to urban needs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Minke whales can normally reproduce every 1&#150;2 years and Sperm whales every 4&#150;5 years. It is not possible to estimate the effects of current whaling activities in terms of the rate of change in global populations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is considerable scientific uncertainty over the numbers of whales of different species and in different geographical stocks. The International Whaling Commission (IWC), which is the primary international body responsible for the management and conservation of whales, estimated that <i>(a)</i> in 1995 there were approximately 149,000 Minke whales in the North Atlantic (excluding Canadian East Coast) and <i>(b)</i> in 1990, approximately 25,000 Minke whales in the North West Pacific and Okhotsk Sea. The IWC Scientific Committee is currently carrying out a major review of Minke whales in the Southern Hemisphere as no reliable estimate is available.

These figures indicate a significant problem in the bass fishery off south west England but not in other fisheries sampled. Those pair trawling teams monitored in the bass fishery caught dolphins at a rate a little in excess of one every two hauls. This is a cause for serious concern, and we have drawn the attention of the EU Commissioner and the French Fisheries Minister to it.<P>

SMRU have also completed an initial trial in the bass fishery of special gear designed to allow dolphins to escape. Information on this will be published as soon as it is available.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how much has been <i>(a)</i> budgeted and <i>(b)</i> spent on the Employment Zone scheme in each year since its introduction; and how much of the allocation in each year went into personal job accounts. [47929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The Department does not receive information from contractors on the specific amounts spent on personal job accounts. This is because funding for the personal job account is drawn from the overall payments made to the contractors. Expenditure on personal job accounts by contractors varies according to the needs of each participant.
<P>

<a name="20510w03.html_para3">In the financial year April 2000&#150;March 2001, the Employment Zone budget was &#163;56,374,000 and the spend was &#163;71,950,885.
<P>

<a name="20510w03.html_para4">For the financial year April 2001&#150;March 2002 the budget was &#163;87,026,000. Forecast expenditure will be published in the Departmental Report in May.
<P>

<a name="20510w03.html_para5">Reasons for the differences between the spend on Employment Zones and budget include better than anticipated performance by Zone contractors and more participants entering the programme earlier than forecast.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w04.html_spnew2"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Pension schemes are set up voluntarily by employers and they decide what the provisions of those schemes should be. Once a scheme is established scheme trustees are required to provide members with basic information about the scheme, including what benefits are payable and how those benefits are calculated. If employers choose to switch from a final salary to a money purchase scheme, the Government believes employers have a responsibility to make it clear to their employees if contribution rates change and what the implications of that are for their future pension provision.

The survey data was delivered to my Department on 25 September 2001, and after analysis was published on 14 December, a date which was outside any period for restricting publicity prior to a mayoral referendum.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (1) what plans he has to issue new guidance on aggregates as a technical note to Mineral Planning Guidance Note 1; [55073]

<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w04.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Following public consultation on principles to be adopted in planning for the future supply of aggregates in 2001, revision of MPG6 was in progress at the time that the Government decided to proceed with the Planning Green Paper. Work on MPG6 was put into abeyance so that any new guidance could conform with decisions to be taken in the light of consultation on the Planning Green Paper. The Green Paper proposed that priority should be given to revising MPG1, dealing with guidance for all types of mineral working, and suggested that MPG6 should be replaced by a technical note in support of MPG1.
<P>

<a name="20510w04.html_para7">Subject to an announcement on the conclusions of the Planning Review, work is in hand to publish a consultation draft revision of MPG1 in the Autumn of 2002, with draft supplementary advice on aggregates following early in 2003. Meanwhile, as a matter of priority, work is proceeding to update the national and regional quantitative guidelines for aggregates provision, at present in the 1994 edition of MPG6, with a view to consulting on these in mid 2002.
<P>

<a name="20510w04.html_para8">The supply guidelines in MPG6 have always been flexible. Paragraph 26 of MPG6 makes it clear that "If circumstances change, requiring a change in assumptions, the provision to be actually made can be adjusted. Consequently the figures contained in these Guidelines are not targets but are indicative figures for the purposes of preparing development plans and the administration of development control." In addition, paragraph 58 of MPG6 makes it clear that the regional guidelines "provide an indication of likely demand but the apportionment figure should not be regarded as inflexible".

<a name="20510w04.html_para9">"The preparation of development plans provides an important opportunity to test the practicality and environmental acceptability at the local level of the Guidelines figure. The provision to be made in each plan will need to be justified not only in relation to this Guidance, but also in relation to all other relevant considerations affecting planning for the area". In line with paragraph 105 of MPG6, the regional guidelines should always be subject to local review and updating in the light of local circumstances. The forthcoming publication of revised forecasts and guidelines will provide a good opportunity for authorities to do this in reviewing and updating their mineral development plans.

<a name="20510w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Existing planning rules do not address telephone kiosk glass advertising, which is a relatively new form of advertising. The issue raises a wide range of considerations including visual amenity, highway safety, public safety and crime, and the cost and other resource implications of formal regulation. The consultation paper which we issued on 11 July 2001 invited views on possible options for clarifying the position. I am grateful to all those who took the trouble to respond.
<P>

<a name="20510w05.html_para0">We have carefully considered the responses received and the range of factors involved. We have concluded that kiosk glass advertising should benefit from deemed consent but subject to certain conditions and limitations. This will mean that, subject to meeting conditions and limitations relating to geographical coverage, illumination and size of advertisement, such advertisements may be displayed without the express approval of the local planning authority. The siting of kiosk glass advertisements in conservation areas, areas of outstanding natural beauty, National Parks and the Broads will require the express consent of the local planning authority, as will advertising on more than one face of a kiosk.

Friend the Member for Wigan, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1091W.

 Social housing normally refers to subsidised housing provided by local authorities or registered social landlords for rent. For the purposes of securing affordable housing through the planning system, affordable housing encompasses low-cost market and subsidised housing, whether for rent or shared ownership, that will be available to people who cannot afford to rent or buy houses generally available on the open market. Local authorities are expected to define in their local plans what they consider to be affordable in the plan area, in terms of the relationship between local income levels and house prices or rents for different types of households.

 The Government recognises that there is an urgent and growing need to assist the number of keyworkers and others on intermediate incomes who cannot afford to rent or buy in high demand areas where house prices have risen sharply over the last few years. We are looking at a number of options for helping overcome this problem, including the potential to increase housing supply by using surplus public sector land of all types for affordable housing and by using modular unit construction techniques as illustrated by the Peabody Trust scheme at Murray Grove, Hackney. These techniques offer significant time savings and potential cost reduction. Normal planning rules have applied to recent modular developments.

Member for Galloway & Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Duncan) and on 14 June 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 644W, and 19 June 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 27W, to the then hon. Member for Galloway & Upper Nithsdale (Mr. Morgan). It is unclear how these inconsistencies occurred but it is possible the source figures came from data for planned firings rather than actual firings or there may have been a simple miscalculation. The above figures correct these errors.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w06.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2002]:</i> There are many reasons for Service personnel being medically downgraded on either a temporary or permanent basis. Personnel who are temporarily downgraded have incurred an injury or developed a medical condition for which they are receiving or awaiting treatment or are recuperating. Servicewomen who are pregnant or have recently given birth are also temporarily medically downgraded. Personnel who have a long term medical condition which prevents them from undertaking their full range of duties, but which allows them to be retained with limited employability, are placed in a permanently downgraded category.
<P>

<a name="20510w06.html_para4">Work is currently in hand in the Ministry of Defence to develop improved analysis of the causes of medical downgrading. This will enable us to ensure that we are adopting the most effective means of prevention and treatment wherever these are appropriate.

The MOD has collected liquidated damages from the contractor, on the basis of terms agreed at the time of contract signature. Liquidated damages are paid to the MOD in respect of the loss and damage caused by the late delivery of the missiles; this includes both the MOD's additional costs and the loss of capability. Accordingly, although the amount of liquidated damages received from the company exceeds &#163;7 million, the MOD does not regard this as a saving.

The above information is not restricted to new recruits as to do so would provide no meaningful information. New recruits would obviously have a shorter reckonable service than those that joined in 1990 as, by definition, they will have had less time to accumulate service. The information provided allows for a valid time series comparison to be made. To provide a breakdown of this information by Regiment could only be provided at disproportionate cost.<P>

Information gathered at exit interviews is recorded on the Continuous Attitude Survey; however, the Survey is anonymous so it is not possible to attribute information to any particular Regiment or individual. The last full leavers survey conducted covered the period July&#150;December 1999; questionnaires are still being returned for the latest Survey so data has not yet been analysed.<P>

The main reasons for leaving were identified as follows:<P>

Lack of job satisfaction<P>

Amount of separation from spouse/partner<P>

Effect of Army lifestyle on marriage/relationship<P>

<a name="20510w07.html_para1">The proposed sites off Lancashire by Shell and Energie Kontor lie within 15 miles of the airfield at British Aerospace Systems Ltd Warton and give rise to similar issues of potential radar interference.

This figure includes named capital ships, minor vessels and marine support vessels. Detailed records for the last five years of all surplus transactions are retained by the DSA. There was also one Upholder Submarine sold during this period. This was the responsibility of the MOD's Upholder Programme and records would be retained by that MOD branch.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to bring forward regulations on <i>(a)</i> mandatory investment by commercial companies into the development of non-animal alternatives to animal testing and <i>(b)</i> over-breeding of animals for experiments. [43970]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w07.html_spnew8"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government does not believe that setting mandatory requirements for investment into research into alternatives to the use of animals in scientific procedures is either desirable or necessary.
<P>

<a name="20510w07.html_para2">Nonetheless, every year the Home Office makes available to the Animal Procedures Committee (APC) a budget for research aimed at developing or promoting the use of alternatives which replace animal use, reduce the number of animals used, or refine the procedures involved to minimise suffering (the three Rs). Details of completed research projects are published in the annual Report of the Animal Procedures Committee, which is available from The Stationery Office.
<P>

<a name="20510w07.html_para3">The amount made available to the Committee for 2001&#150;02 for this specific purpose has increased to &#163;280,000. However, this is not the only money spent by the Government on seeking to develop alternatives, as other Departments also fund such work. It is estimated that the total spent on this by the United Kingdom Government is in the region of &#163;2 million each year. Industry also spends many millions of pounds each year on the search for and development of alternatives. To take this further on an international level, the United Kingdom Government will continue to support the European Centre for the Validation of Alternative Methods (ECVAM) through contributions to the European Union.
<P>

<a name="20510w07.html_para4">The Animal Procedures Committee looked at the issue of the over-breeding of animals for use in scientific procedures as part of its 10-year review of the 1986 Act. The Committee defined "overbreeding" as "the production in breeding programmes of animals intended for use in scientific procedures but which prove to be unsuitable for such use or surplus to requirements". With the exception of genetically modified animals, the production of which is a regulated procedure, these animals are not recorded in the annual statistics on animal use under the 1986 Act since they are not used in regulated procedures. Estimates vary significantly as to the number of animals that may be involved. The Animal Procedures Committee concluded that although some overbreeding was unavoidable, it can and should be minimised and it recommended principles of best practice to help to achieve this. The Committee also undertook to liaise with the Laboratory Animal Science Association, which has also been considering the issue of overbreeding and how it can be minimised, to refine these principles before finalising its advice. I expect to receive the Committee's report by the summer and will carefully consider the further advice it provides.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that terrestrial analogue signals will be maintained until everyone who can currently get the main public service broadcasting channels in analogue form can receive them on digital systems. The Independent Television Commission (ITC) require that any changes made by the broadcasters to the digital terrestrial television transmitter network conform with the ITC Code of Practice on Changes to Transmission and Reception Arrangements. This requires the continued reception of analogue services, to an acceptable technical quality, to those viewers affected by digital terrestrial services.

Relief of more than US $60 billion will be provided to these countries, reducing their debts by more than two-thirds on average. Of the 26 countries, 21 have reached Decision Point and are receiving interim debt relief on their "flow" of payment, and five have completed the HIPC process, and have received an irrevocable reduction in their stock of debt. We hope that a further three will reach their Completion Point this year. The prospects for the remaining eleven unsustainable countries are not good.

 Records may be closed longer than thirty years under section 5(1) of the Public Records Act 1958 (as amended in 1967) with the permission of the Lord Chancellor. If records are to remain closed, they must satisfy the criteria for extended closure set out in the Open Government White Paper (Cm2290, July 1993). This does not allow for records to be closed if they may cause embarrassment, whether to an individual or an institution.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what trading benefits accrue to <i>(a)</i> Israeli settlers in the occupied territories and <i>(b)</i> the Palestinian Authority through agreements with the European Union. [54729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20510w10.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The trading benefits of the EU/Israel Association Agreement apply to goods originating in the European Union and the State of Israel. The UK, along with the rest of our EU partners and the wider international community, does not consider the Occupied Territories to be covered by the EU-Israel Association Agreement. The EU has insisted in its discussions with the Israeli authorities that the territorial scope of the EU-Israel Association Agreement must be respected. In this respect, the European Commission published in November 2001 a notice to importers in the Official Journal of the European Communities alerting EU importers to the ineligibility of products originating in the Occupied Territories for the preferences provided under the EU-Israel Association Agreement.
<P>

<a name="20510w10.html_para2">Under the terms of the 1997 Interim Association Agreement between the EU and the Palestine Liberation Organisation for the benefit of the Palestinian Authority, industrial goods from the territory of the Palestinian Authority enter the EU duty and quota free. There are also preferences on agricultural products. Unlike the arrangements with Israel however there is no requirement for the Palestinian Authority to offer reciprocal market access for EU goods.

 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that existing controls under European Union harmonised legislation require prior notification to the enforcement authorities of imports of products of animal origin from third countries. Food which is not of animal origin entering the United Kingdom from third countries is not generally subject to prior notification. Food safety checks are however made under Great Britain's Imported Food Regulations 1997 and their equivalent in Northern Ireland on the basis of risk assessment by local food authorities at the point of entry

<P>
<a name="20510w13.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The White Paper "The new NHS&#151;Modern, Dependable" published in December 1997 set the cancer specific waiting time standard that everyone with suspected cancer will be able to see a specialist within two weeks of their general practitioner (GP) deciding that they need to be seen urgently and requesting an appointment. These arrangements were guaranteed for everyone with suspected breast cancer from April 1999 and for all other suspected cancers from 2000 and was based on evidence that delays in access to cancer services is a factor in poor cancer survival rates.
<P>

<a name="20510w13.html_para1">To support implementation of the standard, the Department set up a steering group of medical professionals, chaired by Professor Mike Richards. This steering group developed guidance for GPs to enable them to identify the symptoms and indications of cancer for early referral of patients with suspected cancer to a specialist.

<P>

<a name="20510w14.html_para3">One of the factors in establishing criteria for the allocation of additional equipment will be the relative provision of CT and MRI services to the population served.

<P>
<a name="20510w14.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 May 2002]:</i> The coming into force of the directive will not immediately remove any products already on the UK market. Lists of permitted vitamin and mineral sources remain open pending safety assessments for additional substances. The Government intends, when implementing the directive, to take full advantage of the opportunity we have secured for EU Member States to allow continued sale for up to seven years of products containing vitamin and mineral sources not yet on permitted lists.
<P>

<a name="20510w14.html_para6">During negotiations, the Food Standards Agency argued strongly that maximum permitted levels should be established on the basis of scientific risk assessment. Maximum levels will eventually be decided on the basis of recommendations made by the independent EU Scientific Committee on Food (SCF). The agency is now making strenuous efforts to forge strong links between the SCF and the UK's Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals which is already in the process of carrying out similar assessments.
