To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will publish the report on deaths in custody which was consulted upon last year; and if he will make a statement.  [86115]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 In May 2002 the Attorney General issued a consultation paper on the prosecution process in cases arising from a death in custody. During May and June he received many thoughtful responses, including the views expressed by those who attended a seminar which he held in May. The Attorney General had originally hoped to make a statement before the House rose in July, but was compelled to conclude that to do justice to this difficult exercise in the light of further developments following another case, the issues would need further work. He continues to be engaged on the project and expects to be able to publish a statement in the New Year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport (1) what representations she has received from the governing bodies of <i>(a)</i> Welsh and <i>(b)</i> Scottish Rugby Union in respect of the English Rugby Football Union's bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2007;  [86930]
<P>
<UL>(2) if she will make a statement on the English Rugby Football Union's bid to host the Rugby World Cup in 2007;  [86926]
<P>
(3) what assessment her Department has made of the likely <i>(a)</i> economic benefit to the United Kingdom and <i>(b)</i> benefit to amateur rugby of hosting the Rugby World Cup in 2007.  [86928]

<P>
<a name="21217w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 This Department fully supports the English Rugby Union's very strong bid for the 2007 Rugby World Cup. The RFU has already demonstrated its ability to host major events by providing first class facilities, organization and hospitality as co-host of the 1991 and 1999 Rugby World Cups.
<P>

<a name="21217w01.html_para1">To date this Department has not received any representations from the Welsh and Scottish Rugby Unions in respect of the bid.
<P>

<a name="21217w01.html_para2">It is anticipated that the UK would benefit from the additional tourism that this event would bring. The Rugby Football Union has commissioned an independent assessment of the potential economic impact of the 2007 Rugby World Cup from Bone Wells Associates. The assessment estimates that the tournament would bring approximately 175,400 visitors to the UK, spending approximately #100 per day over an average of 14 days. Hosting a major sporting event of this size would also provide UK companies with a number of opportunities for commercial sponsorship and investment. The Rugby Union is working on its own assessment of the economic impact of the 2007 World Cup and should make the results available after the final bids have been submitted on 15 January 2003.
<P>

<a name="21217w01.html_para3">The Rugby Football Union's bid document predicts that the 2007 Rugby World Cup will generate substantially enhanced income streams for investment in the development of grass roots rugby.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps her Department takes to ensure that all United Kingdom sport can benefit from the hosting of international sports events by an individual home nation.  [86929]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The sporting benefits of hosting major international sports events are not easily quantified. The economic benefit to the United Kingdom as a whole of individual Home Nations hosting such events is clear&#151;not least, because spectators from overseas often combine their visits to events held in the Home Nations with visits to other areas and Nations of the UK.
<P>

<a name="21217w01.html_para4">It is also clear that the hosting of major events by individual Home Nations generates benefits in terms of sporting prestige to the whole of the UK. However, it is not clear how the Government could ensure that such benefits accrue directly to sport in other parts of the country.

<a name="21217w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Sports Governing Bodies (Financial Assistance)</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what the cost has been to her Department of providing financial assistance to sports governing bodies preparing bids to host international championships since 1997.  [86927]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The provision of financial assistance to governing bodies for the preparation of bids for major international events is the responsibility of UK Sport or, in the case of the Football Association's bid for the 2006 World Cup, of Sport England.




<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 2002 : Column 679W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21217w01.html_para5">No payments have been made by the Department to governing bodies to assist in the preparation of such bids since 1997. Direct bid-related expenditure by the Department in that period has consisted only of 20,000 to cover the travelling costs of the Prime Minister's Special Envoy in his work in support of the 2006 World Cup bid.

To ask the honourable Member for Roxburgh and Berwickshire, representing the House of Commons Commission if the Commission will examine the case for locating a new parliamentary visitor centre outside the precincts of the Palace of Westminster.  [87378]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Kirkwood: </B> 
 Yes. The House of Commons Commission has considered the feasibility study produced by the consultants Haley Sharpe, and has asked them to carry out further studies of possible sites off the Parliamentary Estate. In the New Year the Commission will consider these studies, together with the views of the Modernisation and Finance and Services Committees, the Domestic Committees, The Speaker's Advisory Committee on Works of Art, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association United Kingdom Branch, the Inter-Parliamentary Union British Group and individual hon. Members. A final decision would need to be agreed with the authorities of the House of Lords.

<P>

To ask the Prime Minister how much debt arising out of the Second World War US/UK lend/lease programme remains outstanding; what recent discussions he has had with President Bush on this issue; whether he has sought its cancellation; and if he will make a statement.  [87760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w01.html_spnew4"><B> The Prime Minister: </B> 
 The Government intends to meet its obligations under the 1945 Agreement by repaying the United States Government in full the amounts lent in 1945. Therefore no representation to the United States Government has been made.

[87700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 The Scotland Office was established in its present form on 1 July 1999 and thus the department had no targets arising from the Comprehensive Spending Review 1998.

 In the 12 months ending June 2002, four claimants received more than #1 million each in direct grants and subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy in England. The payment of direct grants and subsidies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland was the responsibility of the devolved authorities in that period. In addition, 130 claimants throughout the UK each received payments in excess of #1 million as part of the market support measures of the CAP, such as export refunds, for which traders as well as farmers are eligible. The figures exclude any compensation received for animals slaughtered during the FMD crisis for reasons of disease control or animal health. We are unable to identify the total payments received by any individual or business making applications using more than one name.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2002]</i>: The farmgate and retail prices of conventionally grown foodstuffs, where available, are shown in table 1. Prices are not collected for English wine or brandy. Small quantities of cream and yoghurt are sold at the farmgate direct to consumers at retail prices. The amount of processing taking place between farmgate and retail varies from commodity to commodity; an indication is given in the table. Farmgate prices include produce destined for highly processed food, which is normally lower quality and sells at a lower price. Changes to the level of processing over time will impact on the trends shown within the table.

the UK industry, to a reduction of 80 per cent. in fishing effort on cod and haddock and of 75 per cent. on whiting. I do agree that we cannot ignore the scientific advice that radical action is needed to prevent the collapse of the cod stocks, but the action proposed would have a devastating effect on our fishing industry. I am determined to negotiate an alternative approach which will give sustainable fishing opportunities to our industry, while still respecting the scientific advice and leading to stock recovery.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans there are to fluoridate water supplies in the UK; and what health risks have been identified with fluoridation.  [86305]

<a name="21217w04.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21217w04.html_para0">We consider that decisions to fluoridate a water supply should be taken locally. We are seeking to ensure that, where a local community wishes to consider this option, they have easily accessible and reliable information on the effects of fluoridation. The only risk that has been identified is that of dental fluorosis or flecking or mottling of the teeth which, where it is judged to be cosmetically unacceptable, can be treated by dental polishing or, in extreme cases, by veneers.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w04.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what consultation has taken place with relevant groups regarding the fluoridation of water supplies in the UK; and if she will make a statement on her assessment of the impact of fluoridation on oral health.  [86307]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w04.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21217w04.html_para1">We funded research projects undertaken by the University of York in 1999&#150;2000 and the Medical Research Council in 2001&#150;02, aimed at strengthening the evidence base on fluoridation. Steering groups including consumers, people sceptical about the benefits of fluoridation, doctors, toxicologists and dentists contributed to these projects. The reports concluded that fluoridation achieves a 14.6 per cent. reduction in dental decay and that further research is needed to improve our understanding of this beneficial effect.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Substitutes for plastic made from potato starch have been developed and are being used for some types of packaging by some retailers. Such material is entirely biodegradable and can be composted.
<P>

<a name="21217w04.html_para11">A number of companies are marketing degradable plastics technology and products manufactured from these materials. These new materials are based on modified plastics manufactured from mineral oil and still have to be sent for recycling after use. We do strongly support the development of biodegradable plastics made from non-fossil sources, providing these will actually be composted and not sent to landfill.
<P>

<a name="21217w04.html_para12">Plastic bottles which can be crushed down once empty are useful, particularly in terms of saving space in household bins. We are looking at ways to encourage this.

 <i>[holding answer 27 November 2002]:</i> All Defra Ministers make a number of speeches every week and so it would only be at disproportionate cost that a fully comprehensive list could be assembled. However a list has previously been placed in the library of the House which shows the principal keynote speeches made by DEFRA Ministers from 7 June 2001 to 1 June 2002. Some of these are available on the DEFRA website (as are other, more minor speeches) and, where possible, the others are available upon request although generally not in an 'as delivered' format.

 We do not provide funding specifically for the development of schemes to recycle agricultural film waste. The Rural Development Service may consider funding under ERDP for a particular scheme on the basis of an application put to them. All relevant factors would be taken into account in considering any application that is made, including recycling facilities in Scotland.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment the Department has made of the effect on expectant and nursing sows of being kept in farrowing crates; and whether the Government plans to ban the use of farrowing crates.  [86583]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 December 2002]</i>: We have, for a number of years, funded research directly or indirectly related to the welfare of the sow and her piglets, from farrowing to weaning. Part of this research has been directed towards determining which aspects of confinement in farrowing crates could, potentially, cause frustration in pregnant and lactating sows. A key issue emerging is that changes in farrowing systems to improve sow welfare can frequently have an adverse effect on the welfare of the piglets. As a result, we are not yet able unreservedly to recommend free-farrowing systems for widespread commercial adoption.
<P>

<a name="21217w05.html_para0">Our research, and that of others, continues. Our aim is to reach a position where it is possible to avoid the close confinement of all sows.

<P>
<a name="21217w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 We have recently extended Bus Service Operators Grant (formerly called fuel duty rebate) to many community transport services and introduced a 100 per cent. fuel duty rebate on biodiesel. We are considering ways of applying this grant to scheduled coach services in 2003&#150;04 in return for half-fare concessions for older and disabled passengers. Our Bus Subsidy Review is considering whether any further changes to subsidy mechanisms will help to achieve our policy objectives for bus services, which include increasing patronage, modal shift and promoting social inclusion.

 Our national planning policy guidance on regional planning clearly states that Regional Transport Strategies, produced as part of Regional Planning Guidance, should inform and support the Regional Economic Strategies being developed by Regional Development Agencies.

<a name="21217w06.html_para0">My Department is committed to working closely with RDAs, in conjunction with Regional Planning Bodies, in the development of these strategies and in identifying transport improvements that will support economic regeneration in all regions. Last week, for instance, we announced a major package of improvements to tackle congestion on the country's strategic highway network, helping to support business competitiveness.

 The Government are fully committed to meeting or beating its casualty reduction targets for 2010 as set out in XTomorrow's roads&#151;safer for everyone". Total deaths and serious injuries in 2001 were 15 per cent. down from the baseline for the 40 per cent. target reduction. Child deaths and serious injuries in 2001 were 27 per cent. down from their baseline&#151;and thus over halfway towards their 50 per cent. target reduction.

 The draft principles adopted by the stakeholders meeting which we hosted on 26 November are as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We recognise that revenues from natural resources should be an important engine for economic growth, social development and poverty eradication, but, if not managed properly, can create negative economic and social impacts.
<P>
<BR>
We recognise that the benefits of resource extraction occur as revenue streams over many years and that, although highly price dependent, a public understanding of current and future revenue streams would help inform the choice of appropriate and realistic development options.
<P>
<BR>
We support the principle and practice of accountability for the stewardship of revenue streams&#151;from their receipt to their eventual end use.
<P>
<BR>
We are committed to honest, legal and transparent behaviour.
<P>
<BR>
We support the principle and practise of financial transparency&#151;as a necessary condition for good governance.
<P>
<BR>
We believe that a comprehensive, consistent and workable approach to the disclosure of payments and revenues is required.
<P>
<BR>
In seeking solutions, we believe that all stakeholders have important and relevant contributions to make&#151;including host and home governments, multilateral organisations, regulatory agencies, financial and lending organisations, non- governmental organisations and industry.
<P>
<BR>
We commit to develop effective mechanisms to achieve transparency of payments and revenues in the extractive industries. This will entail disclosure by oil, gas and mining companies of tax and non-tax payments to host country governments and government-linked entities, and transparency by governments over revenues from this sector. We encourage other Governments, national and multinational extractive companies and other interested parties to join us to develop effective and lasting solutions.

<a name="21217w08.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We broadly welcome the final report of the UN Panel of Experts, which contains some important recommendations aimed at ensuring that the Democratic Republic of Congo's natural resources are used for the benefit of all its people. However we believe that it contains significant inaccuracies and some allegations on which there is no evidence. We and other members of the Security Council have asked for further information from the panel on the claims contained within it. The panel's mandate expired when it submitted its final report, and there is currently no mechanism or process in place to take forward their work. We are working on a draft Security Council Resolution to resolve this administrative problem.

<a name="21217w08.html_para1">The above data combine projects that have been marked against the Reproductive Health Services and HIV/AIDS policy markers. Increasingly, DFID is helping to tackle HIV/AIDS within the context of large sexual and reproductive health programmes and sustainable health systems development. In these circumstances, it is often difficult to attribute spend to particular aspects of sexual and reproductive health. For example, provision of condoms serves the dual purposes of HIV/AIDS prevention and protection against other sexually transmitted infections as well as family planning. We strongly believe that a cross-sectoral approach to tackling HIV/AIDS is essential if we are to be successful. The International Development Committee share this view. This does, however, pose problems of attribution.

 Our forecast support for basic education amounts to #1.3 billion over the next five years, either through education sector support or direct budget support. Of this, about #500 million will go to Africa and #800 million to Asia. A substantial proportion will go to low income countries included within the Fast Track Initiative, notably to the five high population countries with large numbers of children out of school (India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nigeria, DRC) which the Government successfully pressed to have included in the initiative. These spending figures are forecasts, not targets or commitments, and depend on agreeing high quality programmes with our partners.

<P>
<P>

 My Department has provided 4,887 Mts of food aid through the World Food Programme and 6,400 Mts through Save the Children (UK) in 2002. In both cases, food was drawn down from the Emergency Food Security Reserve (EFSR) and distributed immediately following our commitment. Both organisations subsequently purchased food locally.

 In addition to the 11,287 Mts of food aid we provided in 2002, we have just approved the provision of 2,577 Mts of supplementary food aid through CARE International for 2003 for 286,300 vulnerable people in East and West Hararghe zones.

 The most recent figures for levels of malnutrition in The Gambia that we are aware of, come from a nutritional survey carried out in October 2002 by the World Food Programme (WFP), in collaboration with other agencies, in 29 villages.

<a name="21217w09.html_spnew1"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 On 2 December, a vehicle belonging to Medicins Sans Frontieres (MSF) working on an emergency relief project in the southeastern region of Mavinga, funded in part by DFID, was blown up by a mine resulting in the deaths of 7 people, and the wounding of 6 others. As a result of this tragic incident, MSF have stated their intention to reduce their humanitarian activities in the area&#151;one of the worst affected in Angola. Relief agencies in Angola state that landmines continue to restrict the delivery of humanitarian assistance.
<P>

<a name="21217w09.html_para0">According to the UN Office for the Co-ordination of Human Affairs (OCHA), Angola is one of the most heavily mined countries in the world. As many as 70,000 Angolans are believed to have lost limbs as a result of landmine explosions. My Department has allocated US$ 459,000 to UNDP for a project aimed at improving the effectiveness of mine action through strengthened coordination and planning at the provincial level in Angola. We will also be contributing 19.7 per cent. of the Euro6 million which the EC has recently made available for mine action in Angola. This includes 5 million for a variety of mine-clearance agencies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w09.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The Supreme Court ruling of 21 November 2002 upheld the Independent National Electoral Commission's (INEC) right to set guidelines for the registration of political parties, but held that these guidelines could not impose requirements in excess of those set out in the constitution. As a result, 22 new political parties have now been registered, bringing the total to 28. Though the initial ruling by INEC was exclusive, the court system was used to good effect by the excluded parties to ensure a much broader participation. Thus, while the courts ruled that INEC was not 'fair' to have excluded parties in the first place, the system as a whole can be judged to have been fair.
<P>

<a name="21217w09.html_para1">The registration of the additional parties will cause administrative difficulties, but it could have a beneficial impact, allowing more people to become involved in politics, and could increase the likelihood that parties will form on issue-based platforms. However the full impact of the registration of 22 new parties is yet to be felt. My Department is working closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to monitor developments.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2002]:</i> I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 1 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 601W. The latest figures for XSea", XLand", XAir" and Xother" are still those for 1998&#150;99. Ministry of Defence systems have been changing following the introduction (inter alia) of Smart Acquisition (formerly Smart Procurement) and the move from cash accounting to resource accounting and budgeting (RAB). Consideration has moved from recording and analysing inputs to the armed forces to providing capability. The latest DPA Accounts (HC13 dated 28 November 2002) show that under RAB in the financial year 2001&#150;02, the following resources were expended:

 The Ministry of Defence provided support to the Eighth Army Veterans' Association (EAVA) to commemorate the battle and a service of thanksgiving was held in Westminster Abbey on 30 October; the MOD organised and funded the service. Two other events were also supported by the Department: a Commonwealth service to commemorate the 60th anniversary of the battle (held at the Commonwealth War Cemetery, El Alamein) and an international service (at the Italian War Memorial, near El Alamein). No financial assistance was given to veterans to visit Egypt.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 It is too early to make even the broadest of estimates of how much the military assistance will cost at this stage, because the costs incurred during the actual strike periods have yet to be fully captured through the Ministry of Defence's central cost reporting system, and because we have no relevant historical examples to predict from. This prevents the Department from making any accurate costs estimates beyond those associated with the initial purchase of the urgent operational equipment necessary to equip the services.
<P>

<a name="21217w10.html_para6">In that regard, in the run up to the strike we incurred costs of around #8 million on purchasing major items of equipment such as protective clothing, breathing apparatus and hydraulic cutting equipment.
<P>

<a name="21217w10.html_para7">Under the rules that apply to operations of this sort, the Ministry of Defence will recover from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) the additional costs that are incurred in providing military assistance, ensuring that the operation is cost neutral so far as the defence budget is concerned.

 As the Government have stressed repeatedly, no decisions have been taken with regard to military action in Iraq. Military action there is neither imminent nor inevitable.

 Although opportunities for harmonisation are kept under review, there are currently no plans to bring the training and mobilisation of RAF reservists together with those of the Royal Navy, Royal Marines and Army at the Reserve Training and Mobilisation Centre, Nottingham. Volunteer members of the Reserve Air Forces are mobilised as individuals through the RAF station on which they are based, and where the necessary personnel and pay documentation is already held. In this way, mobilisation and the task of additional training, if required, is absorbed within existing resources. This also allows the reservist to be trained alongside any regular RAF personnel deploying on the same operation.

 Reservists called out into permanent service may apply for financial assistance in the event that their military salary is less than their earnings in civilian life. This assistance is paid in the form of a Reserve Standard Award (RSA). RSA is paid in banded rates that are related to a Reservist's rank. The current

rates are set out in the Reserve Forces (Call-out and Recall) Financial Assistance Regulations (Statutory Instrument 1997/309). Work is in progress to raise the current bands to reflect the increases in inflation since these were brought into effect, and provide for automatic adjustment in line with inflation. It is currently planned to introduce the revised regulations early in 2003. Reservists are also eligible to apply for a Reserve Hardship Award (RHA) if the RSA alone would cause his/her dependents hardship. There is no ceiling for RHA payments.

 The sponsored reserves concept involves a service normally provided in peacetime under contract by civilian staff employed by a contractor being provided on operations by staff drawn from the contractor's civilian workforce who have volunteered to become sponsored reservists. It envisages letting contracts for services on condition that the contractor maintains in his workforce an agreed element of staff who will have volunteered to become sponsored reservists. Should it be necessary to do so, these sponsored reservists would be called-out and serve alongside the armed forces. Their role as sponsored reservists is to continue to provide the contracted support services to the armed forces in an operational environment. They receive appropriate military training in peacetime to equip them to deliver the support required when called out for operations. The details of the individual roles of sponsored reservists will be reflected in their civilian employment contract and the contracts between the employer and the Ministry of Defence.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland how many rheumatoid arthritis patients in Northern Ireland are on consultants' waiting lists to assess their condition for the prescription of anti-TNF drugs; and how much funding is available for the prescription of anti-TNF drugs in Northern Ireland.  [86949]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 There is no waiting list for rheumatoid arthritis patients awaiting assessment for anti-TNF drugs. However, as of December 2002, there are approximately 260 patients who have already been assessed as likely to benefit from anti-TNF therapy, but have not yet begun this form of treatment.
<P>

<a name="21217w13.html_para0">Currently, some #1.14 million is employed by health and social services boards and trusts specifically for anti-TNF drugs. An extra #3 million was recently made available to boards and has been made recurrent, in recognition of the exceptional cost of new, effective but highly expensive drug therapies including anti-TNF drugs. Following the Secretary of State's budget announcement on 11 December 2002, further funding will be made available when requirements have been agreed with service providers.

 All patients on drug treatments are regularly monitored and treatment regimens are reviewed to assess effectiveness and possible side effects. Further funding for acute services was announced in the Secretary of State's Budget statement on 11 December 2002. Some of this will be made available for patients who could benefit from anti-TNF and other specialist drugs treatments and also for the infrastructure required to support these treatments. I expect anti-TNF drugs therefore to become more widely available next year.

<P>

<a name="21217w13.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21217w13.html_para1">There are a number of measures to support the families of members of the Ulster Defence Regiment (UDR) and the Royal Irish Regiment (R IRISH). Widows/widowers may be compensated under two schemes, the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) and the War Pensions Scheme (WPS). In addition, the R IRISH have a unique, stand alone Regimental Welfare Organisation that is specifically structured to provide dedicated welfare support to its bereaved families. This welfare structure, which is directly funded by the Ministry of Defence, links into the various agencies that provide support to the rest of the Army.
<P>

<a name="21217w13.html_para2">Apart from Government support, there are two regimental benevolent funds in operation, the UDR Benevolent Fund and the R IRISH Benevolent Fund. The aims of both funds are the same, namely to provide help and support to the families and soldiers of the regiment, former soldiers and their families and the bereaved families of those soldiers or former soldiers killed as a result of terrorist action.

 The design life of offshore wind turbines and infrastructure assets is typically considered to be 20 to 25 years.
<P>

<a name="21217w13.html_para6">Capital costs for offshore wind farms are of the order of #1,000,000/megawatt (MW) installed.

The report, XAssessment of Offshore Wind Energy Resources", commissioned jointly by the Department of Enterprise Trade and Investment and the Department of Public Enterprise in the Republic of Ireland, estimated that costs per installed megawatt (MW) (excluding decommissioning) for typical projects around the island of Ireland ranged from #840,000 to #1,080,000.

 The Government are determined that animal rights extremists will not prevent companies carrying out legitimate business in the UK and that these companies will be protected from intimidation and harassment. In recognition of the exceptional circumstances Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc have found themselves in, the DTI has previously agreed to provide banking facilities for Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc. The DTI is now extending its support to facilitate the provision of insurance services to Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc on a worldwide basis. Both these actions have been taken to secure Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc from the harm caused by the criminal intimidation and assault being directed at its employees, including their families and friends, and also those of its suppliers, customers and other companies. Huntingdon Life Sciences Group plc is a world-leading provider in the highly regulated area of essential research, development and toxicological testing services for the pharmaceutical, biotechnology and chemical industries. Any commercial damage to these industries or their supporting services, like Huntingdon Life Sciences, would have a very serious impact on UK scientific and medical research. The DTI is not using commercial insurance companies or brokers at this time and is providing insurance through its own resources.

 My Department's safe practice guidance for practical subjects does not set down maximum pupil numbers. Sizes of practical groups and pupil teacher ratios are matters for local education authorities and schools. They are required to assess risks to health and safety and should take account of potential hazards; the ages and abilities and special

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how far the education of children from Sangatte admitted to the UK under special arrangements will be the responsibility of local education authorities; what estimate he has made of the cost; and how local education authorities will be compensated by central government.  [87511]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w16.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 16 December 2002]:</i> Local education authorities will be responsible for the education of children from Sangatte as they would for any other child. They have a legal duty to ensure that education is available for all children of compulsory school age in their area, irrespective of a child's immigration status or rights of residence.
<P>

<a name="21217w16.html_para5">No estimate has been made of the cost, but the number of children is likely to be small, so local education authorities will be able to meet the cost of educating these children from their current budgets. Furthermore, as was announced on 5 December, there is to be an increase in education funding for the next financial year.

<P>
<P>

 These skills are supported and developed through several funded programmes. The Key Stage 3 strategy is focused on developing the skills of teachers in the national curriculum core and foundation subjects in all secondary schools. Generally, higher education institutions and other providers, including some subject associations, are funded to run postgraduate professional programmes in a number of priority areas, including secondary core and foundation curriculum subjects and specialist teaching in Key Stages 1 and 2. In partnership with the Wellcome Trust we are creating a national network of science learning centres to support the professional development of science teachers and science technicians.
<P>

<a name="21217w17.html_para1">The Department's Continuing Professional Development Strategy also funds schemes that support the professional development of individual teachers in areas of their choice. The strategy includes: 500 bursaries, available to all teachers in their fourth and fifth years in the profession; Best Practice Research Scholarships of up to #2,500 a year for around 1,000 teachers who submit proposals of appropriate quality; six-week sabbaticals for teachers with more than five years experience in challenging schools; a pilot Early Professional Development scheme&#151;in 12 LEAs&#151;which offers up to #3,000 for professional development to teachers during their second and third years in the profession. Teachers can, and often do, choose to spend their bursaries and scholarships on activities that develop their subject specialist knowledge and skills.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many applications made under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 were rejected in each year from 1991.  [85842]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Our central database only holds the requested information for the last two years. This shows that two applications were formally refused, both in 2001. One was for a project licence and the other for a personal licence. Over the same period 115 project licence applications, 54 personal licence applications and one application for a certificate of designation have so far been recorded as not proceeded with.
<P>

<a name="21217w18.html_para0">A feature of the regulatory regime under the 1986 Act is the discussion that often takes place at an early stage between applicants (or prospective applicants) and the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate. This means that proposals unlikely to meet the Act's stringent requirements are revised or withdrawn before formal refusal becomes necessary.

 The survey suggests many 14 to 15-year-olds thought cannabis was 'safe' to use. Most young people are aware of the enormous dangers involved in using Class A drugs but they often overlook the longer-term damage to health caused by smoking cannabis, particularly when it is smoked on a regular basis. We will be making sure that the harm it causes is communicated&#151;young people need to know the dangers that all drugs cause.

<a name="21217w18.html_para1">This is one of the reasons why reducing the frequent use of any illicit drug has been included within the updated drug strategy target for young people.

 Government statistics are not kept on the number of ethnic minority women's voluntary organisations in the United Kingdom. However the Council for Ethnic Minority Voluntary Organisations (CEMVO), an umbrella organisation funded by the Home Office to provide services to the black and minority ethnic (BME) voluntary and community sector had 444 BME women's organisations run by women on their database as of 9 December 2002.
<P>

<a name="21217w18.html_para6">Information for the number of ethnic minority women's voluntary organisations which have benefited from Health Action Zones or other regeneration programmes is not available centrally. Many programmes do however support marginalised groups and have strategies in place to increase their participation. In 2001 for instance, 560 (36 per cent.) of the 1,555 community champions funded by the Community Champions Fund were from BME communities, a success attributable to strategies such as simple application form and positive role models.
<P>

<a name="21217w18.html_para7">The voluntary and community sector (VCS) makes a vital contribution to tackling deprivation and promoting community cohesion. We are working across Government to further increase our support for the sector. Race equality has been placed in the mainstream of all areas of neighbourhood renewal and regeneration. We are also raising awareness of the Compact, the framework for effective partnership working between Government and the VCS, and are developing a more robust evidence base for marginalised sectors such as BME women's groups so that all parts of Government can better respond to the VCS's requirements.

 British passports are issued to children only when parental consent is given. If an application for a child's passport is made by anyone other than the child's parents, the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) must establish either that the applicant has parental rights or that a person with parental rights has given consent. In most cases where a child is in foster care parental rights are not transferred to the foster parent. The UKPS therefore advises the local authority to make the application in such circumstances and give details of the care order or other court order which deals with the issue of parental rights. Applications in which this information is provided are not delayed.

 We have not made final decisions about implementation of the measures in the Criminal Justice Bill, but on the basis of the modelling which has been undertaken to estimate the impact of the sentencing reforms and the cost of the Bill, we do not expect them to generate significant increases in the prison population. On current assumptions, the impact on the prison population of implementing the sentencing reforms would be broadly flat with a small reduction in places in late 2004 and early 2005, followed by a modest increase of up to 1,000 places between mid-2006 and early 2009, levelling out once the reforms have bedded in.

The prison population projections will be revised when firm implementation dates for new policy initiatives have been set. The prison service will then be in a position to work up plans for delivering the capacity needed to meet the revised projections.

 Details of race discrimination claims brought against the Home Office are not maintained centrally. However, the Treasury Solicitor's Department maintains a record of claims against the Home Office in which it is involved. It is not likely that there is a significant number of such cases in which the Treasury Solicitor's Department is not involved, and therefore the statistics from that office represent the most accurate estimate of claims against the Home Office. The table shows the number of race discrimination cases brought against the Home Office, including Her Majesty's Prison Service and the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, in the last three years, in which there was Treasury Solicitor's Department involvement:

<P>
<a name="21217w20.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Arrangements for removal of redundant concrete from the former Department of Environment building in Marsham Street are the responsibility of the contractor, Annes Gate Property Plc (AGP), dealing with the demolition and then, on this site, construction of the new Home Office headquarters building. AGP, whose arrangements were approved under the planning permission given by Westminster city council, have commented that the current waste disposal routing via the road network, instead of by barge, is more environmentally compatible. The waste is loaded into the transport vehicles once only and is then transported to the recycling centre approximately six miles from the site. This procedure is much less complicated and involves much less loading and re-loading of waste than transportation by water. Moreover, currently there are no recycling centres with the capacity that AGP require situated along the river.

 Visa regimes are maintained only where they contribute to effective immigration control. The visa regime has proved effective in reducing the numbers of inadmissible passengers travelling to the UK from Slovakia. Following Slovakia's accession to the EU in 2004, all categories of Slovak nationals will enjoy rights of free movement and will not require a visa to come to the UK. In the meantime, the visa regime on Slovak nationals, as with all visa regimes, will be kept under review and will be lifted when we consider that the threat to our immigration control is at an acceptable level.

The Ministry of Defence maintains an important jungle training school in Belize. The Governments of Belize and Guatemala are working closely under the auspices of the Organisation of America States (OAS) both to settle their long-standing territorial dispute and to agree on measures to build confidence on the border.

<a name="21217w21.html_para0">The picture is complicated. Some EC measures are directly applicable in the member states. Others require incorporation into national law.

<P>

 <i>[holding answer 16 December 2002]</i>: The Department for Work and Pensions is providing customers with information (including letters and leaflets) which clearly sets out the account options as part of the move to payment directly into bank accounts.

 <i>[holding answer 16 December 2002]:</i> Payment directly into accounts is a safe, convenient, more modern and efficient way to pay benefits and pensions. More people are already choosing to be paid this way. The Department conducted research of benefit recipients who were not already paid this way to provide an overview of their characteristics, experiences and attitudes.

Work will continue on simplification of this regulation under the forthcoming Greek Presidency.

 We have introduced a range of initiatives designed to encourage pensioners to take up their entitlements. For the minimum income guarantee (MIG) we have undertaken a national advertising campaign, which resulted in almost 140,000 successful claims, with an average gain of #20 per week. We have also reduced the MIG claim form from 40 to 10 pages, introduced a MIG specific leaflet, and we are identifying potential beneficiaries through key events, such as claiming state pension.

 <i>[holding answer 2 December 2002]:</i> There has been an increase in the number of people who save for their retirement through private pensions since the introduction of stakeholder pensions. Although not all stakeholder pension sales will be to new pension savers, it is widely acknowledged that stakeholder pensions have had a beneficial effect on the provision of pensions more generally. For example, as an alternative to designating a stakeholder pension scheme employers have broadened access to their occupational pension schemes to the whole of the workforce, or have opened group personal pension schemes to which they contribute. What is clear is that for a very large number of people stakeholder pensions have provided a route into pension provision that they had never had before.

 Central data on genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinic waiting times are available only for patients referred by general practitioners. GUM is an open access service and the vast majority of patients self-refer and therefore these data do not provide an accurate picture of waiting times for these services. One of the action points in the sexual health and HIV strategy implementation action plan is to develop a waiting times indicator for GUM and work on this is already under way. However, we are aware that there are pressures on GUM clinics which have led to long waiting times for some services. We have therefore invested over #5 million this year to improve capacity and reduce waiting times.

<P>
<a name="21217w28.html_wqn8"><B> Chris Grayling: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his policy is on amendments 9 and 11 to the Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products Directive.  [85798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w28.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Amendments 9 and 11 proposed by the European Parliament in relation to the draft Directive on Traditional Herbal Medicinal Products would have the effect of allowing applications for traditional use registrations where individual active herbal ingredients had had traditional use but there was not evidence of traditional use of that particular combination. Elsewhere, within the proposed Directive, applicants are required to supply evidence of the traditional use of the specific combination and member states may refuse applications if the data on traditional use is insufficient. The amendments would therefore probably have limited effect.
<P>

<a name="21217w28.html_para4">Our overall view on this issue is that active medicinal ingredients, herbal or otherwise, can interact causing adverse reactions and we would have concerns on public health grounds about combinations where safety was supported neither by tests and trials (as would apply in the case of a marketing authorisation) nor by evidence of long usage. In some cases one or more herbal ingredient in a combination could reasonably be regarded as non active, for example where included for taste or colour, and in that situation non active ingredients need not have been used as part of the traditional combination.
<P>

<a name="21217w28.html_para5">It is likely to be possible to demonstrate traditional use of a great many herbal combinations. During continuing negotiations, and subsequent implementation if the Directive is agreed, we will look for ways to ensure that the regulatory impact of demonstrating traditional use of combinations is contained to the necessary minimum.
<P>

<a name="21217w28.html_para6">Amendments 9 and 11 also follow through a concept introduced in Amendment 6 which has the effect that classification of a product as a herbal medicinal product would depend on the active ingredients being present at a pharmacologically active level.
<P>

<a name="21217w28.html_para7">We have some concerns about the proposal as drafted. There is an existing definition of a medicinal product in Directive 2001/83/EC. We would not wish to change that definition in relation to one category of medicinal product only (herbal medicines), in relation to an issue, (levels of pharmacological activity) that is a generic one, relevant to all medicines. Second, the amendment does not address the regulatory position of products which, under the existing definition, are classified as medicinal products by virtue of their presentation. Third, the dividing line between 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 2002 : Column 787W</I><P>
pharmacologically active and non pharmacologically active levels may be difficult to determine for many herbal substances.
<P>

<a name="21217w28.html_para8">Our top priority in relation to the definition of a medicinal product in the ongoing negotiations on the review of Directive 2001/83/EC is to resist the provision, originally proposed by the European Commission, that would give precedence to medicines legislation for any product which fell within the definition of a medicinal product, even if that product was already regulated under other sectoral legislation. This proposal could have lead to many more products being classified as medicines. From the outset of negotiations we have argued vigorously against this proposal, seeking to enlist the support of other member states and Members of the European Parliament. We are therefore pleased that the European Parliament has not supported the Commission's original proposal and we will continue to argue for its deletion from the proposals.
<P>

<a name="21217w28.html_para9">We also recognise that there are differences in member states' interpretation of the current definition of a medicinal product in relation to products close to the borderline of medicines and other regulatory regimes. We are therefore open to constructive dialogue, whether domestically or in a European forum, on this issue. We intend to discuss further the implications of these proposed amendments with the United Kingdom herbal sector in order to inform our negotiating position.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21217w28.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Any website reported to the Medicines Control Agency, which appears to be in breach of regulations regarding advertising, sale and supply of medicines is investigated. The agency works closely with other Government Departments and law enforcement authorities, both in the United Kingdom and abroad, in an effort to identify and take action where appropriate.
<P>

<a name="21217w28.html_para10">There is evidence that some unlicensed herbal medicinal products, whether sold via the internet or in other ways, may be of poor quality and in some cases may pose a threat to public health. Subject to the successful conclusion of negotiations, the proposed directive on traditional herbal medicinal products would provide a regulatory regime which should allow the public to choose from a wide range of herbal remedies made to assured standards of safety, quality and information. In turn this would make it possible for the public to be given much clearer advice than is currently possible about how to avoid unregulated herbal medicines which may pose a risk to health.

<P>

<a name="21217w29.html_para0">The costs of providing meals varies, depending both on the particular dish involved and the method of production. Typically, a traditional system produces meals more cheaply, while a delivered meals service is more expensive. A report by the Audit Commission in September 2001 found average spending on food and beverages was #2.20 for a cook-serve system, #2.40 for a national health service operated cook-chill/freeze service, and #3.70 for a delivered meals service. However, there are a number of other issues such as overheads and capital replacement charges, which also vary according to the production system in use and which affect overall costs. There is therefore no average per meal cost.
<P>

<a name="21217w29.html_para1">As part of the better hospital food programme, acute hospitals have been asked to include in their menus each day three of the dishes designed for the NHS by the 'leading chef' team. These dishes encompass main meals, desserts, salads and sandwiches. There are now 200 'leading chef' dishes included in the NHS dish selector and average costs for these dishes is no greater than those for other dishes currently in use in NHS hospitals.

<a name="21217w30.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 There were 26,922 deaths from lung cancer in England in 2001. The recent National Cancer Research Institute (NCRI) report, XStrategic Analysis 2002", analysed most of the directly-funded cancer research of government and charity funders. The analysis revealed that 60 per cent. of research spend was relevant to all tumour sites. The other 40 per cent. was relevant to specific tumour sites. Approximately 3 per cent. of the site-specific research was on lung cancer.
<P>

<a name="21217w30.html_para0">The NCRI has identified lung cancer as an area that might need more attention. We will be working with our research funding partners through the NCRI to fully understand the reasons for this and consider any actions that might be required.

<a name="21217w31.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 16 December 2002]:</i> Regulations to increase the tariff and cap for the recovery of national health service (NHS) costs following road traffic accidents were laid before Parliament on 11 December 2002. The regulations increase the tariff to take account of hospital and community health services (HCHS) inflation since 1997, which is the year the tariff was set. The regulations also increase the cap, as operational experience has shown 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 2002 : Column 796W</I><P>
that this was set too low when the scheme was introduced in April 1999. The increased cap would still relieve insurers of the full cost of treating those seriously injured in road traffic accidents.
<P>

<a name="21217w31.html_para1">The Department undertook a consultation on the proposed increases, which ran for three months between July and September 2002. Departmental officials discussed the consultation and the proposed increases with members of the insurance industry and their trade bodies.
<P>

<a name="21217w31.html_para2">The increased charges would increase income to NHS hospitals by around #56 million per year. However, as NHS costs are not repaid until the accident victim's compensation claim settles, which takes on average 18 months, NHS hospitals would not feel the full effect of the increases until the latter part of 2004. If this cost was spread evenly among all holders of compulsory motor vehicle insurance, then the cost of the average policy could be expected to rise by around 0.7 per cent., or around #3 per policy.

<a name="21217w31.html_para3">The consultation on increasing the level of charges and summary of outcome can be found on the Department of Health's website at www.doh.gov.uk/consultations
