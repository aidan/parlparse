<P>
<a name="71212w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Wyatt: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement about departmental responsibility for co-ordinating and promoting bids to host expos within the United Kingdom. [19155]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 December 1997]:</i> A town or city wishing to bid for an Expo would need to obtain the support of the relevant sponsoring Department, and, depending on the nature of the Expo proposed, that of other Whitehall Departments, in order to obtain Government endorsement for the project. Once obtained, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office would be responsible for lodging the formal application with the International Bureau of Expositions, the governing body for Expos. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office would provide tactical advice and assistance with lobbying.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport when he plans to meet the Chairman and trustees of the Greenwich Foundation for the Royal Naval College; and if he will make a statement. [19024]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 I met the Chairman and the Director of the Greenwich Foundation for the Royal Naval College when I visited the College on Friday 28 November. The Greenwich Foundation is working closely with Government and Greenwich Hospital to conclude arrangements that will allow it to take responsibility for the site as Defence use ceases.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many offenders aged 10 to 19 years to whom one caution has already been administered have received <i>(a)</i> a second and <i>(b)</i> more than two cautions in respect of further offences in each year since 1994. [19815]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Data routinely available centrally do not include details of repeat cautions.
<P>

<a name="71212w01.html_para0">For a sample of offenders cautioned for standard list offences in ten police forces during one week in November 1991, a record was submitted centrally on their first subsequent caution over the next two years.




<P>
<P><I>12 Dec 1997 : Column: 696</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71212w01.html_para1">From this sample, it is estimated that 20,800 offenders aged 10 to 19, who were administered a first caution for an indictable offence in 1991, received a subsequent caution for a standard list offence in the next two years. An estimate relating to those cautioned for summary offences is not available.
<P>

<a name="71212w01.html_para2">It should be noted that concern about repeat cautioning led to revised guidance being issued in March 1994 (Home Office Circular 18/1994) to discourage the use of repeat cautions. In a sample of offenders cautioned for standard list offences in all but two police forces in November 1994, the proportion of those aged 10 to 19 who had one previous caution was 11 per cent. The proportion with more than one caution was 6 per cent. In a similar sample collected in 1991, the respective proportions were 16 per cent. and 10 per cent.
<P>

<a name="71212w01.html_para3">Offences included in the "standard list" are given in appendices 4 and 5 of "Criminal Statistics, England and Wales, 1996" (Cm. 3764). These include all indictable and some of the more serious summary offences.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the media representatives who were invited by Sussex Police to be present at the raid on the rectory at Donhead St. Andrew on 21 November; and if he will make a statement. [20538]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I am told by the forces concerned that neither the Wiltshire Constabulary, which carried out the search at Donhead St. Andrews, nor the Sussex Police, invited any media representatives to attend.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when Sussex Police requested Wiltshire Constabulary to raid the rectory at Donhead St. Andrew on 21 November; and if he will make a statement. [20537]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I am told by the forces concerned that this operation was part of an inquiry involving a number of forces in which the Wiltshire Constabulary was requested to participate by the Sussex Police, but the decision to conduct the search at the rectory rested with the Wiltshire Constabulary.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 At the end of November, there were 23,243 claims under options A and B awaiting processing, and an additional 6,479 claims awaiting payment under option C, consisting of option C only claims and mixed claims on which an option A or B payment had been made.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what provision has been made in the current year to train serving teachers in information and communication technology. [19106]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Under the Grants for Education Support and Training programme, &#163;296.8 million has been made available in 1997-98 to support training for serving teachers in all National Curriculum subjects. A subject by subject breakdown is not yet available for this year, but information collected for 1996-97 suggests that approximately 5 per cent. of the funding is spent on IT courses.
<P>

<a name="71212w02.html_para0">In addition, &#163;1.2 million has been provided to fund this year's Multimedia Portable Computers for Teachers pilot, which is aimed at improving serving teachers' competence and confidence in the use of Information and Communications Technology in the classroom.
<P>

<a name="71212w02.html_para1">From early 1999 the first tranche of funds from the People's Lottery will become available to train the UK teaching force in the use of information and communication technologies. This initiative will meet one of the key recommendations of the Stevenson Committee report "Information and Communications Technology in UK Schools" and will be the first attempt to train all teachers in the use of IT.

<P>

<a name="71212w02.html_para2">The Department has six Task Forces which currently have a total of 93 members; no appointments have yet been made to the Skills Task Force. No salary or benefits are paid to members of these bodies. The Department is not responsible for any review bodies.

<P><I>12 Dec 1997 : Column: 700</I><P>
delivered locally by Training and Enterprise Councils (TECs). The Department records the number of places provided through OSCI in out of school clubs but not the number of clubs available throughout the country. The initiative has already created some 78,000 places and offers parents, especially women, the opportunity to participate more fully in the labour market by increasing the supply of good quality, affordable out of school childcare.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland what sums each Scottish local authority (i) has budgeted to spend in 1997-98 and (ii) has spent in each of the five previous years in <i>(a)</i> grants to voluntary organisations and 



<P>
<P><I>12 Dec 1997 : Column: 702</I><P>

statistics on local authority expenditure on the voluntary sector is being reviewed.
<P>

<a name="71212w03.html_para0">The funding of local voluntary organisations is a matter for local authorities. The Scottish Office has, however, issued guidance to local authorities requesting them to produce policy statements on working with and supporting the voluntary sector in their area. Scottish Office funding of &#163;240,000 over three years has been granted to the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations to provide information and support to voluntary bodies building partnerships at local level. As a result, 22 new partnerships agreements are in place between local authorities and their local voluntary sector.
<P>

<a name="71212w03.html_para1">The Scottish Office has joined COSLA's Task Group on the voluntary sector to take forward good practice guidance on positive partnerships and funding.

[20532]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71212w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 The degree of the year 2000 date change problem for my Department depends on a number of factors including the nature and relative importance of non-governmental organisations and suppliers to the business of the Welsh Office. My Department is following the guidance issued by the central Computer and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA) on the action to be taken to deal with the problem. The Welsh Office will assess the nature of its contractual relationships with non-governmental organisations and suppliers to establish the impact of non-compliance.
<P>

<a name="71212w03.html_para2">All non-governmental organisations and suppliers will need to show that their relevant systems are millennium compliant wherever these would have a significant impact on the business of the Department. If they cannot do so by 31 March 1998 we will review the contractual arrangements.

 The provisional capping plans that I announced on 10 December will increase Welsh local authorities spending power by over 4.5 per cent. My capping plans are not spending targets, however, and I cannot predict local authorities spending decisions for 1998-99. They have until March 1998 to set budgets.

 The extent to which improvements are needed to the road network between north and south Wales was one of the main issues raised for consideration in the recent consultation exercise on the review of the Welsh trunk road programme. The review process is still at an early stage and it is not possible to say when we will be able to give any indications as to the size and composition of the future trunk road programme.
<P>

<a name="71212w03.html_para3">A number of organisations and individuals submitted representations in support of improved links between north and south Wales during the review consultation period; and we will consider these very carefully before making any final decisions on the strategy to be adopted for the trunk road network.

 The life expectancy of the Type 23 Frigates and Type 42 Destroyers is expected to be in the order of 25 years, although this will be kept under review. The first Type 23 Frigate, HMS Norfolk, entered service in 1989. HMS Portland, the final ship of the last batch, which is currently under construction at Yarrow Shipbuilders, is due to enter service in 2001. The first type 42 Destroyer to enter service was HMS Birmingham in 1976 and the last HMS Edinburgh in 1985.

 The Department of the Environment has recently concluded that the Public Records Act (NI) 1923 does not empower the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland to purchase archives. Parliamentary approval for such purchases in the current financial year will be sought in a Supplementary Estimate for the Environmental and Other Services Vote (Department of the Environment Vote 4) Pending that approval, expenditure up to an estimated &#163;120,000 will be met by repayable advances from the Civil Contingencies Fund to ensure that Northern Ireland's archival heritage will be saved for posterity.
<P>

<a name="71212w06.html_para0">I am also examining the possibility of seeking Parliament's approval for new legislation which will specifically authorise such expenditure.

 Inspections of mink farms are carried out by advisers from the Farming and Rural Conservation Agency (FRCA), an Executive Agency of MAFF, as part of their statutory duties as the Department's wildlife advisers. FRCA are resourced to carry out all necessary visits to mink farms to ensure that the security arrangements in place meet the requirements laid down in the Mink Keeping Regulations 1975. Until recently, only one site visit was normally made each year at the time of the issue of the licence. However, to ensure that the necessary security standards are maintained throughout the year, an additional unannounced inspection will now be made to each farm during the year. As before, inspections will also be carried out following any reports of escaped mink.

<P>
<a name="71212w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 At the end of 1995, the latest year for which figures are available, the net book value of direct investment by UK firms in Yemen was &#163;15 million. This represents the cumulative value of investment after allowing for depreciation. During 1995, the flow of direct investment by UK firms in Yemen was less than their disinvestment, resulting in net direct investment of minus &#163;36 million.

<P>
<a name="71212w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The debate which has surrounded the European Commission's proposal for a Directive on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions has highlighted a number of ethical issues which surrounded this technology. Therefore, I announced on 24 November that my Department would be sponsoring a consultation initiative to seek public views on biological research.
<P>

<a name="71212w07.html_para4">My ultimate goal is to engage members of the public in debate to enable us to assess the issues that are of concern to a lay audience. However, I feel that an important pre-cursor to this is to involve interested parties active in the debate to add to the credibility that an inclusive approach will offer.

<a name="71212w07.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Last year, the Office of Science and Technology, the Research Councils and The Royal Society commissioned a survey of postgraduate career paths to contribute to the forward planning of training needs. This will be published in the near future, and the sponsors will be considering its results. The Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (BBSRC) is also undertaking its own research programme on the needs of particular industrial sectors. In all subject areas, the supply of first degree graduates is a factor.
<P>

<a name="71212w07.html_para6">The BBSRC supports postgraduate and postdoctoral training to meet the needs of its research, industrial and educational user communities for highly trained scientists and engineers. The Council has fixed the current level of its overall postgraduate provision at 2,000 studentships which it considers to be in line with those communities' needs. The BBSRC's scientific committees, which comprise experts from both industry and academia, advise on the needs for trained personnel in specific sectors of science and engineering, and allocate research studentships accordingly on an annual basis. The BBSRC also makes awards under the CASE and Industrial CASE schemes which link industry and academia in training and ensure that training is directly relevant to the needs of user industry. Further opportunities for training in biochemical engineering are available through the Council's participation in, and promotion of, the Teaching Company Scheme, Integrated Graduate Development Scheme and joint Industrial Fellowships scheme with EPSRC and the Royal Society, all of which are market driven by the needs of the user community.

Mr. Guy Walker has been employed in the food industry since 1961, most recently as National Manager for Unilever in the UK. He is also President of the Food and Drink Federation.

These are undertaken by Ministers and officials: where others outside Government are involved none are employed by the Department or receive payment other than expenses.

That is why we are committed to changing the payment culture in the UK by bringing forward a comprehensive range of new proposals to tackle the late payment of commercial debt including legislation to give business a right to claim interest. The legislation, introduced on 10 December, will provide suppliers with a statutory right to claim interst on commercial debt.
<P>

<a name="71212w08.html_para6">The Government also recognise the importance of effective credit management in reducing the incidence of late payment and are working with all the main small firms organisations and representatives from the credit management, factoring and trade credit banking and insurance sectors to encourage business support organisations and others to assist small firms with their credit management procedures and to promote a better payment culture.

 The most recent head counts by voluntary sector organisations show that the number of people sleeping rough in central London on any one night is around 280. In the Victoria area, the number of people sleeping rough in the May 1997 street count was 58.
<P>

<a name="71212w09.html_para0">Independent research into earlier phases of the RSI (1990-93 and 1993-96) has shown that the Initiative has been successful in helping many thousands of people to start a new life away from the streets. Victoria is one of five central London areas which attract large numbers of rough sleepers. It is not possible to disaggregate research data on the effectiveness of the Initiative in the Victoria area from that for central London as a whole. We expect to let a research contract to evaluate the effectiveness of the third phase of the Initiative (1996-99) early next year.

<a name="71212w12.html_para1">As for all medicines, Dianette has side-effects, and the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and CSM continue to monitor its safety. If new relevant evidence comes to light this is reviewed in order to ensure the risk of possible side-effects is outweighed by the benefits. Information on how to use Dianette, including its side effects and precautions in use, is available to health care professionals and to patients through the manufacturer's product information authorised by the MCA and in the British National Formulary, copies of which are available in the Library.
