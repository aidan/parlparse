<P>
<a name="80519w01.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Perham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list, in order, the London boroughs by <i>(a)</i> percentage change and <i>(b)</i> cash terms change, in council rent collected for each of the last four years.  [41154]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The information requested is not collected in the requisite form by my Department.
<P>

<a name="80519w01.html_para0">Data are collected through the Housing Subsidies and Grants Claim form by the Department on potential rent income and on actual rent outstanding at the end of the latest financial year. Deducting the latter from the former would provide an estimate of the current year's rent collected within the year. However, these particular responses on the form are not audited, the figures would not cover any rent collected after the end of the year, and not all authorities provide the rent outstanding figures.
<P>

<a name="80519w01.html_para1">The Audit Commission's Citizen Charter performance indicators for local authorities include an indicator on the percentage of rent collected.

<a name="80519w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Lorries</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Brake: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what costs have been incurred so far in strengthening bridges to accommodate 40 tonne lorries; and what estimate he has made of the costs of works yet to be undertaken.  [41902]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 For Trunk Roads in England, where assessment indicates that bridge strengthening work is required for a bridge to carry 40 tonne lorries, the work is then grouped with nearby maintenance and construction works so as to produce a programme which is most economical and least disruptive to road users. Consequently, contracts specify a range of work and it is not easy to separate the costs attributable to strengthening work alone.
<P>

<a name="80519w01.html_para2">The Agency estimated at the start of financial year 1997/98 that it needed some &#163;240m to complete the bridge strengthening programme for Trunk Roads in England.
<P>

<a name="80519w01.html_para3">In addition, over the period 1991/92 to 1998/99, central Government have made &#163;913m available to Local Authorities for expenditure on bridge works. It is not possible at this stage to provide an accurate estimate of necessary future strengthening work.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government are in regular contact with other European Member States to discuss how the European Community and its Member States can meet the targets that were set in the Kyoto Protocol. The Environment Council in June will consider how to develop measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases, including hydrofluorocarbons. The Government will be issuing a consultation paper later in the summer on policy options for meeting their commitments.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had with local authorities in London regarding the increase in provision of motorcycle only parking in prominent locations.  [42227]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 I and my officials have had a number of discussions with local authorities about parking in London although none specifically covered motorcycle parking. However, our new Traffic Management and Parking Guidance for London, a copy of which is in the Library, includes, in particular, advice that local authorities should consider the need for motorcycle parking in developing their approach to local traffic planning.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 May 1998]:</i> The Government have said that they will welcome proposals from interested local authorities for fully monitored experimental schemes in which powered two wheelers were permitted to use bus lanes, so that all the implications can be studied. After such trials, it will take a view on whether or not the practice is one that might be encouraged on a national basis.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action his Department is taking to address the concerns of fire service and insurance organisations regarding the practice of some water companies of reducing mains water pressure in order to reduce leakage rates.  [42699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w02.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 My Department has set up a National Liaison Group to improve the way that the water industry and fire service work together. Representatives of the fire service and the water companies on the Group are preparing a Code of Practice to facilitate better co-operation. Water pressure will be one of the issues covered. Following the Water Summit, water companies are working towards meeting their mandatory leakage targets in a variety of ways including the repair of customers' supply pipes and repair and replacement of mains. The Office of Water Services continues to ensure that any reductions in water pressure do not jeopardize water companies' statutory duties with regard to mains pressure and the delivery of water.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no power to issue such directions to local authority officials. A range of technical guidance exists on providing for the needs of two-wheeled vehicle users. This includes "Transport in the Urban Environment" published by the Institution of Highways and Transportation in collaboration with my Department, Design Bulletin 32 on the layout considerations of roads and footpaths, produced by my Department, and "Cycle-friendly Infrastructure" produced jointly by the Institution of Highways and Transportation, the Bicycle Association, the CTC and the Department. In addition, there is an extensive range of advice on providing for cyclists within our Traffic Advisory Leaflets and other material. This is listed in our cycling bibliography that is sent free to all local authorities.

[42326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government are committed to making best use of the existing road network. Future levels of funding for local road maintenance are under consideration in the Comprehensive Spending Review. It is for local authorities to plan their road maintenance, taking account of the needs of all groups of road users.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w02.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The EC Directive concerning the quality of waters for shellfish was formally transposed in England and Wales by means of secondary legislation in June 1997. The legislation replaced the administrative arrangements under which the Directive had previously been implemented and was the first step in a process to review implementation policy, including designations. Since the legislation was enacted, work has been proceeding with the review. A review of water quality standards for some of the Directive's parameters has been completed and discussions have been held with the shellfish industry, MAFF and CEFAS (Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science) to produce a candidate list of new areas for designation, and a public consultation paper on these issues is in preparation. We expect to issue this by the summer recess, but the timing of final decisions will be dependent on the response to the consultation exercise.

[42701]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w02.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The responsibility for ensuring safety in the Severn Tunnel rests primarily with Railtrack plc. Railtrack is responsible for maintaining the track and structure of the tunnel as well as regulating the flow of rail traffic through it. Railtrack contracts the maintenance of the tunnel to specialist contractors who undertake inspection, testing, maintenance and renewal work. Railtrack has management systems in place which are aimed at ensuring that their contractors carry out necessary work to the required standard.
<P>

<a name="80519w02.html_para0">A programme of major improvement works has been carried out in the tunnel over the past few weeks. This has included track renewal and drainage work. Following the completion of the work, Railtrack removed a temporary speed restriction which they had previously imposed because of poor track condition.
<P>

<a name="80519w02.html_para1">I understand that the Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate is content with the arrangements relating to fire emergencies, introduced after the publication of its report into the accident in the Severn Tunnel on 7 December 1991.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 My Department has worked with the Local Government Management Board, English Partnerships, Ordnance Survey and local authorities to establish a method of providing a consistent assessment of previously developed land which may be available for housing or other development, as the first step towards a complete Land Use Database for England.
<P>

<a name="80519w02.html_para3">Key features of the approach are to meet the needs of a number of organisations from a single data collection exercise, and to use information already held by the local authorities wherever possible, to avoid duplication of effort. Local authorities will be asked to draw up a list of previously developed sites along with information about the location, area, planning status and other relevant characteristics of each site. This will be done to a common format and using standard definitions that will be set out in guidance being developed jointly by DETR, Local Government Management Board, English Partnerships and Ordnance Survey following consultation with a number of local authorities.
<P>

<a name="80519w02.html_para4">English Partnerships will contract teams of surveyors which will visit each local authority to complete the data collection and to collect additional information about certain sites on the potential for redevelopment. Ordnance Survey will provide quality assurance on the geographical attributes of the data, and develop the list of sites into a 'map database' showing the site boundaries. Ordnance Survey will also develop a plan for extending the coverage of the database to other land uses, and for keeping the resulting National Land Use Database up to date.




<P>
<P><I>19 May 1998 : Column: 304</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80519w02.html_para5">Data collection will start in the summer. English Partnerships intends to publish information on an initial set of sites suitable for redevelopment by the end of the year; summary results for all sites should be available by March 1999. Meanwhile, local authorities will have consistent information on the amounts of previously developed land which may be available for housing to assist in the drawing up of national and regional targets for the reuse of land.
<P>

<a name="80519w02.html_para6">The database will also have value for other organisations. For example, officials are discussing with Urban Mines, an environmental NGO, which launches its own "Brownfield Sites" project today, to ensure the two projects are complementary. The intention is to secure agreements to make the information more widely available, including appropriate charging for commercial use.
<P>

<a name="80519w02.html_para7">We shall be discussing this work as it progresses with the Urban Task Force.

 <i>[holding answer 7 April 1998]:</i> The Chancellor announced in the Pre-Budget Report that he was considering proposals for an individual savings account and a working family tax credit, and that he would be consulting widely on these in the run-up to the Budget. Fishburn Hedges and Ogilvy and Mather were employed by the Treasury to look at the presentational aspects of the proposals. Their appointment was entirely consistent with long-established rules on the appointment of consultants by Government. The Chancellor drew on their work in preparing the Budget.

 As a specific tariff is not set for individual indeterminate sentence prisoners in Northern Ireland, the information sought is not readily available. Figures provided previously have been broad approximations for indicative purposes. Given the small numbers involved, disaggregation of these figures by affiliation and by year of possible release could be misleading and could result in individual prisoners being identified or drawing incorrect inferences about the future handling of their cases.

<a name="80519w04.html_para4">The table is an estimate of the number of indeterminate sentence prisoners at HMP Maze who could be released during the calendar years 1998, 1999 and 2000. The figures include prisoners in organizations which do not have a cease-fire and exclude prisoners who have already been given a provisional release date or are at an advanced stage of consultation about release.

The parties are, however, entitled to a free mail shot in the referendum. It is for the parties to approach the Post Office to arrange distribution of their material, and the Post Office then recovers the cost from the Government. Until that has happened, we do not know exactly how much money the mail shot will cost.

To ask the Prime Minister, pursuant to his answer of 18 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>265</i>, on duty-free shopping, what estimate he has made of the potential number of job losses that will arise from the ending of the trade in duty-free goods; whether, during the UK presidency, the Commission carried out the proposed survey; and if he will make a statement.  [42343]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w06.html_spmin2"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Department of Transport, Environment and the Regions has undertaken a study into the effect on the transport sector of the abolition of intra-EU duty and tax free sales in 1999. During the UK Presidency, the Commission has not undertaken a survey of the potential number of job losses that may arise from the abolition of duty and tax free sales within the EU. The position of the United Kingdom remains that it would not oppose a study should there be a consensus amongst member states in favour of such a study.

 I fully recognise the worries of export dependent small businesses in Wales about the current level of the pound. In setting interest rates, the Bank of England takes into account the effect on exchange rates and on exports. The Government's aim is a stable and competitive pound over the medium term. The most important thing is to deliver a stable economic environment--sustained growth, low inflation and sound public finances--while at the same time introducing policies to promote enterprise and investment and raise Britain's sustainable rate of growth. The Government are determined to take a long-term view and not be diverted from this course by short-term pressures.

Where failures in compliance are identified, undertakings are sought where appropriate and, in more serious cases, the authorising body will consider whether further action is required.

<a name="80519w09.html_wqn0"><B> Sir Raymond Powell: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade how much has been paid to <i>(a)</i> widows and <i>(b)</i> miners who were in receipt of state benefits for chronic bronchitis and emphysema; how many (i) miners and (ii) widows are entitled to receive these benefits; when the final payments are to be paid; and what arrangements apply to the interest on this money whilst negotiations continue.  [42341]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 May 1998]:</i> To date, over 200 interim payments of &#163;2,000 have been made to miners in receipt of Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit for chronic bronchitis and emphysema (PD.D12). We have recently extended the offer of interim payments to widows whose husbands were in receipt of PD.D12 benefit and, to date, 5 payments have been made. However, the speed at which such offers can continue to be made is reliant on the co-operation of the claimants' solicitors who need to submit evidence of receipt of benefit and confirm acceptance of the offer on behalf of the claimant.
<P>

<a name="80519w09.html_para0">The Department has also now extended the offer to all claimants currently in receipt of PD.D12 benefit, estimated to be in excess of 13,000. However, DSS are unable to provide a breakdown between miners and widows, whose husbands would have been receiving PD.D12 benefit.

<a name="80519w09.html_para1">At a hearing on 27 March, plaintiff's solicitors requested a three-month adjournment to allow discussions on settlement arrangements to be progressed. The Court granted the adjournment and these discussions are continuing. We hope that arrangements can be agreed quickly, allowing full and final settlements for valid claims to begin being made as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="80519w09.html_para2">Any interest payable on an award of compensation is usually calculated and paid at the same time as the award, i.e. at final settlement. If an interim payment has been made, then this amount is deducted from the compensation award before the interest is calculated.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the prisoners convicted of terrorist offences who have been transferred from Great Britain to prisons in the Irish Republic indicating the <i>(a)</i> date of transfer, <i>(b)</i> date and length of sentence and the crimes of which they were convicted, <i>(c)</i> organisation to which they claimed allegiance and <i>(d)</i> date of release under the rules governing such release (i) in Great Britain prior to the Belfast Agreement, (ii) in Northern Ireland prior to the Belfast Agreement and (iii) under the terms of the Belfast Agreement.

<P>
<a name="80519w09.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 May 1998]:</i> Since the Irish Republic ratified the Council of Europe Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons in November 1995, 23 prisoners convicted in England and Wales of terrorist-related offences have been repatriated to the Republic.
<P>

<a name="80519w09.html_para3">It is not normal practice to disclose the personal details of individual prisoners, nor does the Prison Service record centrally information on organisations to which prisoners may have claimed allegiance. However, the table lists for each of the 23 prisoners repatriated to date: their offences; date of sentence; sentence length; date of repatriation; non-parole release date in England and Wales; and, although the prisoners were not subject to the legislation applicable in Northern Ireland, dates of release, had they been so subject, prior to the Belfast Agreement.
<P>

<a name="80519w09.html_para4">The release, under the terms of the Belfast Agreement, of repatriated prisoners is a matter for the Irish Government.

<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 There are no new arrangements consequent on this specific case. The arrangements for processing claims made under the compensation schemes are being improved continually in the light of practical experience and our commitment to complete the compensation payments as quickly as possible. It is not simply a matter of staff numbers: this is a complex compensation scheme, mainly to fulfil the promise to be fair to all shooters who have surrendered weapons. New systems had to be developed and staff trained, but, where it is possible, routine tasks are identified which can be undertaken by non-specialist staff. Claims made under Options A and B will be completed shortly, allowing the examining staff to concentrate on the remaining Option C claims. The number of staff with the Firearms Compensation Section has been further increased since Easter and we are also making further use of data processing staff. Staff also regularly work overtime at weekends and on weekday evenings. We are processing the remaining claims as quickly as possible, while having regard to the need for careful checking of individual claims to guard against fraud.

 Claims under Options A and B of the large-calibre compensation scheme and the small-calibre ex gratia scheme should be completed by the end of the month, and those under Option C by the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="80519w10.html_para0">We anticipate that all claims for guns handed in after 1 February 1998 under the small-calibre compensation scheme will have been paid before the end of March 1999.

<P><I>19 May 1998 : Column: 333</I><P>
firearm certificate will contain a number of questions about the applicant's health. An applicant's medical condition or history may be a relevant factor in determining fitness to possess firearms. It is only right that the chief officer of police should have this information in order to reach an informed judgment on an application. Accordingly, it is proposed that the application form should seek the applicant's authority for the police to obtain factual information about these conditions from his doctor. It will be for individual chief officers to ensure that such information can be interpreted properly, through either appropriate training or access to professional medical advice. Correspondence from individuals and bodies with whom we may consult as a matter of routine is not normally published and we have no plans to do so.

 The Government are conscious of and share the concern that United Kingdom nationals, deported to this country from overseas jurisdictions on the completion of their sentences for serious crimes cannot be made subject to supervision. However, tackling the issue raises a number of complex legal and practical issues not least the need to ensure that any statutory obligations placed on returning prisoners do not result in an aggravation of their sentence. Consideration is at present being given to possible options to address the issue.

 As part of the Government's ongoing programme of policy and financial management reviews of non-departmental public bodies, my Department will conduct a thorough review of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland--the national body of survey and record of the man-made environment in Scotland. As is the norm for such reviews, the first stage will take the forms of a "prior options" study. This will include an examination of the scope for discontinuing, privatising, contracting out or transferring to another body some or all of the functions carried out by the royal commission. The review is now under way and I would welcome comments from interested parties. Comments should be sent by 19 June to: Mr. John Barber, Room 3.9, Longmore House, Salisbury Place, Edinburgh, EH9 1SH.

It is the first time a Government have a coherent and strategic approach to childcare. We are backing the strategy with a substantial investment of public money: almost &#163;5 million extra in 1998-99 with a further &#163;25 million to come on stream from lottery resources through the new opportunities fund over the years 1999-2003.

<P>
<a name="80519w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Government are opposed to restrictive practices which cannot be justified in the public interest. The legal profession is independent and self-regulating, and is responsible, in the first instance, for the rules governing the profession; but it is the duty of the relevant professional bodies to regulate their members in the public interest. As the Lord Chancellor made clear, on 24 February 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>555-57</i>, he is looking at the restrictions on who may exercise rights of audience in the courts, and he intends to bring proposals forward, in due course.
<P>

<a name="80519w12.html_para5">One change to those who may exercise rights of audience has already been made.

The Lord Chancellor has recently signed the orders which will amalgamate the five MCCs in Merseyside and the seven MCCs in the West Midlands. A number of other MCCs are developing their own proposals, whilst the remainder are considering the way forward.

 As Chairman of the EU Agriculture Council, I hosted an informal meeting of Agriculture Ministers in Newcastle upon Tyne from 10 to 12 May 1998. My noble Friend, the Lord Donoughue, 



<P>
<P><I>19 May 1998 : Column: 343</I><P>
Parliamentary Secretary responsible for the farming and food industry, represented the United Kingdom at that meeting.
<P>

<a name="80519w13.html_para2">In the course of the informal visit, I was able to show my EU colleagues the efforts which the UK Government are making, in partnership with the farming industry, to help put our beef industry on to a sound footing for the future. In particular, my EU Ministerial colleagues were given a comprehensive presentation of the cattle traceability system now being put in place in Great Britain with the aim of assuring consumers, retailers and farmers alike of the safety and reliability of our meat.
<P>

<a name="80519w13.html_para3">Linked to the theme of quality and sustainability of beef production, the information EU Council went on to discuss, on the basis of a UK Presidency paper, the challenges facing EU livestock producers in environmentally fragile areas of the Union, and the measure open to EU governments to assist them. A wide-ranging debate on this important subject gave rise to a number of important policy considerations which will be taken forward in the negotiations on the Commission's Agenda 2000 proposals for agricultural reform.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will assess the advantages of introducing separate regulation for food produced from land treated with pesticides; and if he will make a statement.  [41936]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Pesticides are used on over 98 per cent. of the agricultural and horticultural land on which food crops are grown. Land on which pesticides are not used and which conforms to other relevant standards can, if not already registered, be registered as organic. We do not see a need for further regulation in this area.

 It would not be a viable option for this Department to convert its existing fleet to liquid petroleum gas or compressed natural gas because the vehicles are predominantly diesel-powered and not readily capable of conversion.

<a name="80519w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The decision to source blood products from non-United Kingdom plasma follows the advice of the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM), which the Department, acting with the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Ireland Offices, has accepted.
<P>

<a name="80519w16.html_para7">The CSM, in consultation with its expert group on new variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease, undertook a risk assessment of individual plasma derived medicinal products. This assessment took into account the therapeutic benefit of the products, details of the manufacturing process, the theoretical risk of transmission, the quality and availability of alternative supplies and the blood product supply situation. In the course of that assessment, the CSM took evidence from the two UK blood product manufacturers, the Bio Products Laboratory (which is part of the National Blood Service) and the Protein Fractionation Centre (its Scottish equivalent).
<P>

<a name="80519w16.html_para8">The CSM's advice was that, although there is no evidence to indicate that nvCJD can be transmitted via blood products and the risk therefore remains hypothetical, it cannot be fully discounted. Therefore, as a purely precautionary measure, blood products should not be sourced from UK plasma for the time being. The full text of their advice is appended to the Department's press release of 13 May, copies of which are in the Library.
<P>

<a name="80519w16.html_para9">We would not accept non-UK plasma which was considered unsafe. The imported plasma will come only from centres approved by the UK Medicines Control Agency. Only when the inspectors are assured that the stringent safety standards applied to the new sources of plasma are equivalent to those currently available in the UK will plasma be imported.
<P>

<a name="80519w16.html_para10">Clinicians currently do not have to use Bio Products Laboratory or Protein Fractionation Centre products, but can use the licensed product of their choice. As a result, many of the licensed blood products already on the UK market are made from non-UK plasma and they have a high quality and safety record.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if her Department will use its information technology network to co-ordinate payments made by different branches of her Department and its agencies in order to avoid overpayments of benefit.  [42045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80519w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Department continues to exploit the opportunities provided by information technology to deliver significant improvements to the accuracy of its payment mechanisms. In launching the Active Modern Service programme, the Department reiterated its commitment to ensuring that people with a genuine claim to benefit receive their correct entitlement, paid at the correct time and for the correct amount.
<P>

<a name="80519w17.html_para1">The programme of work currently under way incorporates the development and design of integrated Information Technology Systems to allow speedier access to information held across the Department.
<P>

<a name="80519w17.html_para2">The structure of future customer records will be around individual customers, as opposed to the benefits they claim. This will provide a complete picture of the customers dealings with the Department and reduce the scope for fraud, inaccuracy and inconsistency. Each individual customer record will contain details of payments made and moneys owed.
<P>

<a name="80519w17.html_para3">Rigorous financial controls of each individual transaction will enable better accounting and speedier action to recover debt.

 We are considering the Vaccine Damage Payment Scheme, as part of the overall review of welfare which includes disability benefits, in consultation with the Department of Health. While this is on-going it is right that we should increase the payments to new claimants.

 The Comptroller and Auditor General does not have a guaranteed right of access to the relevant records of private bodies providing public services under contract. Where access is not provided for in the relevant contracts, the Comptroller and Auditor General may be unable to check that public funds have been used as Parliament intended and with due concern for regularity and value for money. The Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee and I have therefore recommended to the Government that the Comptroller and Auditor General should have a guaranteed right of access to contractors' records. The purpose would be to enable the Comptroller and Auditor General to audit the accounts from which the contractor is paid or pays in revenue, not to audit the contractors themselves.
<P>

<a name="80519w18.html_para0">Where the Comptroller and Auditor General does have access to contractors, he exercises this right only in the relatively few cases where he is unable to obtain sufficient assurance from other sources about the occurrence, propriety or value for money of the payments to, or receipts from, contractors. The resource implications of arrangements to guarantee access rights would depend on the additional extent to which such rights needed to be exercised. It would be for Parliament to decide what additional resources to provide to meet any needs identified by the Comptroller and Auditor General.

These will include intelligence reports. We are aware of five intelligence reports, received between 8 October 1997, when UNSCR 1132 was adopted, and 10 March 1998 when Lord Avebury's letter of 5 February was passed to Customs, which refer to Sandline, or companies associated with Sandline, and to the supply of arms or military equipment. They were seen by officials but not by Ministers.

 A body was found on 10 April by the Bosphorus in Istanbul. On 8 May, Turkish police showed a photograph of the body to a relative of Edgar Fernandes who provisionally identified it. The relative subsequently saw the body and confirmed on 12 May that the body was that of Edgar Fernandes. We do not yet have details of the circumstances of Mr. Fernandes's death. An early unofficial police statement referred to a blow to the back of the head. We are now awaiting the autopsy report from the Turkish authorities. We continue to press the Turkish police to investigate the death of Mr. Fernandes thoroughly.

 There have been no incidents during this period involving the Royal Navy or Royal Gibraltar Police and marine units of the Spanish Civil Guard. However, the Royal Navy was involved in two incidents in British waters around Gibraltar, on 22 October 1997 and 5 April 1998, involving incursions by Spanish naval patrol vessels. The Royal Gibraltar Police and the Royal Navy were involved in three incidents, on 5 July 1997 and on 13 March and 4 April 1998, involving incursions by vessels of the Spanish coastguard service.

<a name="80519w19.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 There was no incident on 6 April. However, on 5 April, a Spanish naval patrol vessel was observed moving within British waters off Gibraltar. When the Spanish vessel failed to respond to calls, HMS Nottingham, which was approaching Gibraltar at the time, requested her to leave. The Spanish vessel was escorted out of British waters by a patrol craft of the Gibraltar Squadron. Our Ambassador in Madrid later protested to the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs over this incident.

That problem has been compounded by the nuclear tests in India last week. It is all the more important now for India and Pakistan to continue their dialogue on all issues outstanding between them, including Kashmir. Both Governments are aware that we stand ready to help if called upon to do so.
