 In 1999, in line with national policy, the Wearside branch of the Crown Prosecution Service, in liaison with the police, South Tyneside magistrates court and the defence, introduced the Narey proposals. All defendants charged with a criminal offence where a guilty plea is anticipated now make their first appearance before South Shield magistrates court within five working days. All other cases appear in court within 48 hours. Present figures suggest that 50 per cent. of all defendants have their cases finalised far more quickly than previously was the case.

<a name="10313w01.html_para0">In April 2001, Crown Prosecution Service Northumbria will be altering its structure in line with the proposals of the Glidewell review. This will enable the Crown Prosecution Service to place greater emphasis on the more serious crime cases in Newcastle Crown court. The Crown Prosecution Service, together with other agencies, also helped to draw up a protocol with social services relating to unused material which assists in expediting cases involving child witnesses. The Crown Prosecution Service also has a "fast track" procedure for persistent young offenders cases with the Crown court and youth courts. All these changes illustrate the Government's successful policy of speeding up the work of the criminal justice system.
<P>

<a name="10313w01.html_para1">Since May 1997, the Crown Prosecution Service has successfully prosecuted a number of cases arising in the South Shields area. Of particular note is a "sting operation", set up by undercover police officers in South Shields, in the spring of 1998. This resulted in the recovery of thousands of pounds worth of stolen property and the convictions of 35 defendants who were sentenced to long terms of imprisonment, two of them for 11 years and 12 years respectively. In January 2000, the Crown Prosecution Service also successfully prosecuted two juveniles for the murder of a 46-year-old man in the South Shields area. Following a trial at Newcastle Crown court, they were both convicted of murder and detained during Her Majesty's pleasure.

<P>
<a name="10313w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Gale: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence on what dates depleted uranium shells have been <i>(a)</i> tested and <i>(b)</i> demolished at (i) the Shoeburyness Range and (ii) adjacent mud flats/sandbanks.  [149517]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2001]:</i> No reference can be found in Shoeburyness range records to open air firings of depleted uranium projectiles and none is believed to have taken place.
<P>

<a name="10313w01.html_para9">DERA Shoeburyness took over the adjacent Foulness site from the Atomic Weapons Establishment in 1999. This site had an indoor facility, in which some small experimental DU projectiles were fired during the 1980s. The building in which the firings took place was designed to prevent any escape of particulate DU into the atmosphere. It is no longer in use and was decontaminated in 1997.
<P>

<a name="10313w01.html_para10">No DU munitions have been destroyed at Shoeburyness or indeed any other DERA site.
<P>

<a name="10313w01.html_para11">Between September 1999 and June 2000, small quantities of DU long rod penetrators were held temporarily in transit at Shoeburyness, having been delivered to DERA for trials to be conducted by the Eskmeals team at Kirkcudbright.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many DU penetrators have landed on the land area of the base since test firing of DU shells at Dundrennan range began; and, of these, how many have not been located.  [151846]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Since test firing of depleted uranium (DU) penetrator rounds first began at Kirkcudbright in 1982, there have been 14 strikes within the range area, including 10 projectiles that struck the ground itself and four that struck the target gantry. The four striking the gantry are believed to have proceeded directly out to sea. Three of those striking the ground have been recovered intact, two are believed to have proceeded out to sea and the other five remain buried in known locations.
<P>

<a name="10313w02.html_para0">The path a penetrator would take when entering the soil at high velocity is not easy to predict so, while their entry point is known with reasonable accuracy, the ultimate position of the buried penetrators is not. Recovery attempts would involve a prohibitively large area and depth to be excavated for each round, incurring exceptional cost and with little chance of success.
<P>

<a name="10313w02.html_para1">As I mentioned in the Adjournment debate on 7 February 2001, we are now planning to undertake a survey using a device called an Exploranium of the areas where fragmentation of projectiles may have occurred--ie firing points, landing areas, target areas--in order to locate remaining and hitherto undetected small pieces of DU. This survey is unlikely to be able to detect the buried rounds because of their depth. The contamination caused by fragments remaining on or just below the surface is regarded by the experts as minimal. However, should any areas be found to be contaminated they will be fenced off.

<a name="10313w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Alasdair Morgan: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if test firing of DU shells at the Dundrennan range is exempt from regulation under the Ionising Radiations Regulations.  [151847]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the reply I gave, in relation to the Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999, to the Member for Ceridigion (Mr. Thomas) on 22 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 419W. The Ionising Radiations Regulations 1999 contain some specific exemptions relating to the Ministry of Defence and military activities, but these have not been invoked in the case of DU firing. It is, moreover, our policy that, where UK statutory regulations are not applicable, we undertake by agreement with the Government Departments concerned that the principles and spirit of the regulations are to be followed, and arrangements introduced will be, so far as is reasonably practicable, at least as good as those required by legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Menzies Campbell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what the average <i>(a)</i> length of operational tour and <i>(b)</i> interval between tours was for Defence Medical Services personnel in each of the last five years; and if he will make a statement;  [151803]
<P>
<UL>(2) what length of tour and interval between deployments his Department assesses to be optimal for Defence Medical Services personnel; and if he will make a statement.  [151800]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 March 2001]:</i> Operational tour lengths for Defence Medical Service personnel can vary from one month to two years, depending on their Service and their particular speciality. For example, on average consultants deploy for one month, nurses deploy for three months while others deploy for six months. Additionally, Royal Navy personnel are considered operational when serving at sea which can last up to two years although they may not be away from the UK for the whole of this period. On average, consultants deploy up to three times a year while others will deploy about once a year. Tour intervals are not always as long as we would wish due to a shortage of manpower in some specialities. It is not possible to provide averages for each calendar year separately, without disproportionate effort, bearing in mind that many deployments span more than one calendar year.
<P>

<a name="10313w02.html_para2">For all personnel, the Royal Navy aims that deployments, as opposed to normal operational tours, should be no longer than nine months and that total deployment time in any three-year period should not exceed 18 months. The Army's preferred tour interval is 24 months. The RAF seeks to maintain periods of at least 18 months between tours and to ensure that no individual is away for more than 140 days per annum or 280 days aggregated over a two-year period.

<a name="10313w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Soldiers are trained in the use of baton guns and when deployed are issued with guidelines about their use. Plastic baton rounds may be fired, if authorised by the commander at the scene, when absolutely necessary to protect against physical violence. In all circumstances, soldiers are trained to use no more force than is absolutely necessary.

<P>
<a name="10313w03.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Today I have laid before the House a White Paper outlining the Government's proposals to combat electoral abuse in Northern Ireland. This Government are determined to minimise opportunities for abuse, while avoiding putting obstacles in the way of people's legitimate exercise of the franchise. The White Paper sets out a comprehensive strategy to address the weaknesses in the electoral procedures that have allowed electoral fraud to take place. It is important to note that these measures will apply only to Northern Ireland, where electoral abuse is believed to be a more serious problem than elsewhere in the UK.
<P>

<a name="10313w03.html_para0">The extensive consultation and investigations that we have undertaken have ensured that our proposals are practical and realistic, and will make a real difference. Several of the proposals contained within that paper will require changes to the law, and we intend to bring forward legislation at the earliest possible opportunity.
<P>

<a name="10313w03.html_para1">In addition, I welcome the measures which the Chief Electoral Officer for Northern Ireland has put in place to combat fraud in future elections. The provision of enhanced training and guidance for electoral staff is under way. The Electoral Office already co-operates closely with the police in investigating suspected cases of electoral fraud, and this liaison has intensified recently in the run-up to the local elections. The processing of absent vote applications has been returned to the local electoral offices in order to allow local knowledge to inform the scrutiny of these applications.
<P>

<a name="10313w03.html_para2">I am happy also to be able to announce the initiation of a research project designed to measure the true extent of electoral fraud. This research will inform our continuing efforts to stamp out electoral fraud.

 Since the UK ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991 legislation has been introduced and recommendations have been made further to ensure the protection of the rights of the child in the justice system. Particular highlights include: the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, which removed the power of the juvenile court to give a custodial sentence for the care and protection of non-attendance at school; the Criminal Justice (Northern Ireland) Order 1996, which reserved custodial sentences for only the most serious and/or persistent offenders; and the Criminal Justice (Children)(Northern Ireland) Order 1998, which introduced short determinate sentences, half of which is served in custody and the other half under supervision in the community. On 1 March 1999, as a result of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, the Northern Ireland Human

Rights Commission (NIHRC) came into existence. It has taken a keen interest in the welfare of children in the justice system, taking as one of its first investigations the impact of custody on the rights of children. The Human Rights Act 1998, which came into force on 2 October 2000, formally incorporates the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) into domestic law. On a Quinquennial basis the Government are required to submit a report to the UN's Committee on the Rights of the Child. Such reports include details of measures that exist within domestic law, practices and procedures, to ensure the rights of children who come into contact with the police and other criminal justice agencies.

<a name="10313w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A recent Force Order on the provisions of the Human Rights Act 1998 highlighted other relevant International Standards, including the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. In drafting the Force Order the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission was consulted. No separate monitoring mechanisms are currently in place. However, consideration is being given to their introduction in line with Section 75 of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, when the Royal Ulster Constabulary becomes a 'delegated authority' for the purpose of that Act.

 Such powers are currently governed by the provisions of Parts IV, V and VII of the Terrorism Act 2000, its related Schedules 5, 7, 8, 10 and 14; as well as the relevant Codes of Practice issued under the Act which stipulate an express requirement on the police to ascertain if an individual is a juvenile.

 'Minors', i.e. children under 10 years of age, have no criminal liability in law in Northern Ireland and are therefore not subject to PACE etc. Any intervention by the police, therefore, is from a 'care and welfare' perspective as provided for by the Common Law and the Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995.

 All countries that access the concessional resources of the World bank and the IMF, including those that are eligible for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, need to produce a national poverty reduction strategy. These strategies, developed by Governments in consultation with civil society, set out policies and programmes to tackle poverty, and provide a budgetary framework for the allocation of all development resources, including the savings arising from debt relief. Improving the quality of education, and particularly action to attain the international development target of universal primary education, will be an important component of all countries' strategies.
<P>

<a name="10313w04.html_para1">By the end of 2000, the following 22 countries had qualified for debt relief under the HIPC Initiative: Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, the Gambia, Guinea, Guinea Bissau, Guyana, Honduras, Madagascar, Malawi, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Niger, Rwanda, Sao Tome and Principe, Senegal, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia.

 Access to in-cell television is an earnable and forfeitable privilege within the Incentives and Earned Privileges Scheme, which is intended to motivate prisoners to good behaviour, and to participate in work and constructive activity. Where the technology is available, in-cell television is being used increasingly to provide information to prisoners on developments within the prison, including education courses, visits times, work availability and canteen facilities.

Once applied, restraints may be removed subject to a risk assessment, and will be removed where a healthcare professional seeks their removal because of an immediate risk to the health of the prisoner, or because the prisoner is in pain or discomfort, or because the restraints are impeding essential treatment.

<P>
<a name="10313w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Prison Service RESPOND (Race Equality for Staff and Prisoners) programme unveiled in February 1999, consists of five main strategies:

<a name="10313w05.html_para10">The RESPOND programme enjoys the support of the Prison Service trade unions and staff associations, and &#163;3 million was earmarked to take it forward over the first three years.




<P>
<P><I>13 Mar 2001 : Column: 519W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10313w05.html_para11">A key element of the RESPOND programme is the development of RESPECT (Racial Equality for Staff), a national minority ethnic staff support network aiming to eliminate racism in the workplace. Around 1,500 delegates attended the launch of RESPECT in January 2001 at the International Convention Centre (ICC) in Birmingham.
<P>

<a name="10313w05.html_para12">RESPECT is able to provide support to minority ethnic staff who claim to suffer from racial harassment or discrimination. A free-phone support-line will be operational from Monday, 2 April 2001. Specially trained volunteers will offer the alleged victim a sympathetic ear and help them to identify courses of action available to them. RESPECT complements the help and support that is available through existing channels such as Prison Service Staff Care and Welfare Services, and trade unions and staff associations. RESPECT has around 900 members.
<P>

<a name="10313w05.html_para13">The Home Secretary's Action Plan, published in response to the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report, sets out a comprehensive programme to improve community and race relations. The 70 recommendations are wide-ranging, and those which apply to the police are concerned with tackling discrimination both internally within the service and as a service provider. On 22 February the Home Secretary published the Second Annual Report on Progress against the Action Plan. The Action Plan contains elements common to the RESPECT and RESPOND programmes in the Prison Service, such as targets on the recruitment, retention and progression of minority ethnic police officers and a programme of racism awareness training within police services to be delivered to all front-line staff by the end of 2002.

<P>
<a name="10313w06.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The number of previous offences of burglary admitted by prisoners has not been collected centrally since 1 April 1999, when the counting rules for detections changed. The new counting rules provide more precise and rigorous criteria for securing a detection, with the underlying emphasis on the successful result of a police investigation. Detections secured through 'prison visits' were omitted under the new counting rules. The total number of burglaries in England and Wales which were cleared up by the police from 'prison visits' in the year ending March 1999 was 58,898, 32 per cent. of all detections of burglaries in that year.

There is a very successful project in Biddick Hall where 22 young people involved in serious youth disorder did reparation in the same area repairing damage to a primary school, cleaning off graffiti etc. It has been very well received by local community/residents (and by parents of young people). It is too early to say definitively what the effects of these actions are on re-offending and reducing levels of youth crime. Recent police figures have however led to some concern about youth disorder. In relation to this, there has recently been a seminar funded and facilitated by Government Office for the North East, and in response to the concern the YOT will be taking appropriate action within the context of a proposed youth disorder strategy.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures he has introduced to increase the recruitment of police officers in Greater Manchester; what the cost of these measures was; and what evaluation has been made of their success.  [152809]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 March 2001]:</i> The Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) will enable police forces to recruit 9,000 additional officers over and above the number previously planned in the three years to 2002-03. Under the CFF, Greater Manchester police have been allocated a total of 588 extra recruits.
<P>

<a name="10313w07.html_para14">According to the latest information provided by Greater Manchester police, the force now expects to recruit 147 CFF recruits this financial year. CFF grant payments made to Greater Manchester police so far this financial year total &#163;1,388,171. CFF grant payments to forces are paid on the basis of anticipated recruitment of CFF officers. Variations in actual recruitment may affect total amounts due to individual forces, any overpayment may be reclaimed or offset against future payments.
<P>

<a name="10313w07.html_para15">The CFF is successfully helping Greater Manchester police to recruit officers over and above the force's previous plans.
<P>

<a name="10313w07.html_para16">To help forces meet their recruitment targets, the first ever National Recruitment Campaign was launched on 30 August. To 4 March 2001 over 121,000 responses had been received to the campaign advertisements. These had generated over 25,500 Expressions of Interest (EOIs) to forces, 1,598 of which had been passed to Greater Manchester police. The total expected campaign spend in 2000-01 is &#163;6.98 million excluding value added tax. The costs of the campaign cannot be broken down by individual police force as media for the campaign have been bought nationally.
<P>

<a name="10313w07.html_para17">The campaign has been very successful in generating inquiries and Expressions of Interest. Responsibility for processing EOIs rests with forces. Forces are being asked to report on the outcome of the EOIs with a view to assessing the effectiveness of the campaign.
<P>

<a name="10313w07.html_para18">For an indication of the expected impact of these measures and of the force's local recruitment activity on force strength, I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to her on 9 March 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 387W.

 <i>[holding answer 12 March 2001]:</i> Dogs are primarily used in pharmaceutical research and development, or in pharmaceutical safety and efficacy evaluations. They are also used, when no other species is suitable, in the evaluation of cardiovascular and cardiorespiratory problems in humans. Such work contributes to advances in human healthcare. Dogs are also used in the development of veterinary medicines and techniques.
<P>

<a name="10313w07.html_para19">The work undertaken by commercial pet food companies is for the purpose of ensuring that food products for pets are safe, effective and nutritionally complete. Most of the procedures conducted are so mild as to not require licensed authority. The procedures which come under licence are very mild. There are pet re-homing schemes in place for animals once tests have been completed.
<P>

<a name="10313w07.html_para20">Under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 dogs and cats can be used only where animals of no other species are suitable.

<P>

<a name="10313w07.html_para26">To comply with section 5(4) of the Act, any application to use protected animals in research must be subjected to a detailed cost/benefit assessment by Home Office inspectors. The likely adverse effects on the animals concerned must be weighed against the benefit likely to accrue as a result of the proposed programme of work. Such an assessment is applied to applications made by commercial pet food companies, as to any other. Information about the cost benefit assessment is set out in the paper by the chief inspector published as part of the Animal Procedures Committee annual report for 1997.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> I am not aware of any international environmental treaties which cover depleted uranium ammunition. The Chemical Weapons Convention does not cover depleted uranium ammunition.
<P>

<a name="10313w08.html_para0">Within the European Union civil uses of nuclear materials are regulated under the Euratom Treaty and subsidiary legislation. The Government's position is that the Euratom Treaty does not apply to military activities. The Radioactive Substances Act 1993 makes provision for the regulation of radioactive substances. The licensing provisions of the Act are applied to companies involved in the manufacture and assembly of depleted uranium ammunition and permits have been issued covering a number of such premises. Premises occupied on behalf of the Crown for the purposes of the armed forces or the Ministry of Defence are exempt from the provisions of the Act. However, the Environment, Agency does regulate these premises by administrative rather than statutory means.
<P>

<a name="10313w08.html_para1">Apart from the small amount of contained firing at Foulness and Aldermaston, test firing of depleted uranium has been concentrated on two sites. One site at Eskmeals in Cumbria has not been used since 1995. The Environment Agency believes from environmental monitoring reports it has seen that there have not been any potentially hazardous releases or emissions of depleted uranium to the environment from this site. The other site is at Dundrennan in Kirkudbright, Scotland from which shells are fired into the Solway Firth. A long-term environmental monitoring programme on the effects of depleted uranium test firing has been in place in Kirkudbright since 1983. In 1993, W. S. Atkins Ltd. was commissioned to produce an independent environmental impact assessment for Kirkudbright. The report concluded that the firing programme produced a negligible effect on the local environment.

 I represented the UK at the Environment Council in Brussels on 8 March, accompanied by Sam Galbraith, Scottish Executive Minister for the Environment, Sport and Culture. The UK, along with other member states, except Germany who abstained, voted in favour of the common position on the proposed Directive on motorcycle emissions. The Council adopted three sets of conclusions.
<P>

<a name="10313w08.html_para2">The Presidency proposed a compromise text on a Directive to limit emissions from motorcycles in two stages, 2003 and 2006. In supporting the proposed text on tighter limits from 2003, providing between 60 and 70 per cent. reduction in hydrocarbons and 30 to 60 per cent. reduction in carbon monoxide, member states accepted my amendment to extend the deadline for "enduro" bikes to assist the small UK manufacturers in adapting to the new limits. Germany proposed binding limits for 2006 to be agreed now, in advance of the Commission's proposed limits due by the end of 2002, which will be based on a new test cycle currently under development. The UK, along with the majority of member states, agreed to accept Germany's proposed limit values for 2006 as indicative non-binding limits only and the Council achieved a Common Position, with German abstention, that meets both our environmental and our manufacturers' needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) how the Government ensures that the cost of work carried out by contractors under the home energy efficiency scheme does not exceed the price which would be charged by local contractors registered with CORGI;  [153532]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Scheme managers are contractually required to appoint insulation and heating sub-contractors following the requirements set out under the UK's Public Procurement Regulations. In the case of heating contractors, I understand that both scheme managers advertised widely in the trade press and wrote to all CORGI registered gas heating engineers inviting them to tender. The scheme managers were required to accept those tenders that were the lowest in price and technically compliant.
<P>

<a name="10313w08.html_para10">The scheme is designed so that independent surveyors visit householders and advise the measures to be installed. Orders are then placed with the sub-contractors for the package of measures to be installed in each home. The scheme managers operate monitoring systems to ensure work orders are correctly carried out to the relevant specifications.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The scheme manager contracts were awarded in accordance with UK Public Procurement Regulations. An advertisement was placed in the Official Journal of the European Community and written tenders were invited on 29 October 1999.
<P>

<a name="10313w08.html_para11">Six compliant bids were received. These were assessed by a tender panel, which included external representatives. The panel unanimously recommended the award of contracts to the Eaga Partnership Ltd. and Eastern HEES Ltd. on the basis of providing the lowest priced, technically compliant bids.

<a name="10313w08.html_para12">The contract with Eaga Partnership includes a stepped clawback provision, whereby up to 75 per cent. of any profit in a given financial year is returned to the Department.

 <i>[holding answer 12 March 2001]:</i> The responsibility for marketing the home energy efficiency scheme in England rests with the scheme managers, Eaga Partnership Ltd. and Eastern HEES Ltd. The costs for this activity are included within their overall contract price. The scheme managers report that a total of &#163;3.05 million will be spent on advertising the scheme in this financial year, including the cost of the Warm Front Team campaign.

 <i>[holding answer 12 March 2001]:</i> The television advertising campaign for the Warm Front Team is being piloted in the Meridian area for four weeks from 23 February to 23 March. The campaign is intended to stimulate interest in an area where there is a low take-up of home energy efficiency scheme (HEES) grants. 85 advertising spots are planned for off peak times, when the target audience is most likely to be watching television. The cost of the television slots is around &#163;80,000, with the advertisements themselves costing some &#163;95,000 to produce.

 The Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) (England and Wales) Regulations 1999 give effect to the requirements of Directive 85/337/EEC on the assessment of the effects of certain public and private projects on the environment. The Regulations apply to categories of projects specified in Schedules 1 and 2 of the Regulations. For development listed in Schedule 1 of the Regulations environmental impact assessment is always required before planning permission may be granted. For development listed in Schedule 2, an assessment is required if the development is likely to have significant effects on the environment by virtue of factors such as its nature, size or location.

<a name="10313w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Shimizu judgment had the effect of weakening controls over partial demolition of unlisted buildings in conservation areas. We share the concern that the character of conservation areas could be adversely affected as a result. Following a consultation exercise last year we therefore propose to require submission of a planning application where in a conservation area it is proposed to demolish any boundary wall, gate, fence and other means of enclosure, and a chimney or porch on a dwellinghouse. This will give local planning authorities the opportunity to consider the impact that such works are likely to have on a conservation area. We shall bring forward the necessary amendments to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 in due course.

<a name="10313w10.html_para3">This measure is designed to address the direct effects of the Shimizu judgment. We are currently considering the recommendation in English Heritage's report 'Power of Place' for removal of a wide range of permitted development rights in conservation areas.

 The Government welcome the involvement of energy companies in tackling fuel poverty. Company schemes cover a variety of initiatives--special tariffs for low-income customers, advice on debt management, benefit checks and measures to improve the energy efficiency of people's homes. These schemes will improve referral networks and support the Government's programme for improving the energy efficiency of the housing stock, especially for the fuel poor. Some of this activity will result in the creation of new jobs, however, most of these initiatives are in the early stages of their operation and it is therefore not possible to separately identify, and quantify, the number of new jobs created as a direct result of these schemes.

 Under the UK Coal Operating Aid Scheme, as approved by the European Commission on 15 November 2000, applications for aid are considered under eight criteria. The full text of the Scheme is available on the DTI website at www.dti.gov.uk/support/coal.htm, but the criteria include: degression of costs must be demonstrated by the production unit; the level of subsidy must not cause the delivered price to undercut third country coal of an equivalent quality sold on equivalent terms; the coal covered by the application must be used for electricity generation or industrial purposes; no single undertaking will be eligible for more than &#163;75 million.
<P>

<a name="10313w10.html_para5">Applications which satisfy these criteria will be submitted to the European Commission for approval. It is not for the Import Parity Price (IPP) Panel to decide which collieries will receive operating aid. However, the panel will advise my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on the IPP in respect of contracts related to an application for subsidy. This advice will help my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry to ensure that the level of subsidy paid does not cause the delivered price of coal to undercut third country coal of an equivalent quality sold on equivalent terms. The panel's response to consultation on its methodology for advising on the IPP is also available on the internet at www.dti.gov.uk/support/coal.htm.

 Accurate information on the competitive domestic energy market is widely available.

Ofgem also produces more detailed price information and information on customer complaints, which is available from its website.

<a name="10313w10.html_para6">In January, Ofgem introduced website links to internet price comparison companies, which enable consumers more easily to decide which supplier is offering the tariff best suited to their needs.

 Approximately 5 million households in GB do not have access to the gas network.
<P>

<a name="10313w11.html_para0">The legislative position is that under the Gas Act 1986 (as amended) a Gas Transporter only has a duty to connect premises 23 meters from the gas mains. The same Act gives Ofgem a duty to ensure that all reasonable requests for gas through pipes are met, providing this can be done economically.
<P>

<a name="10313w11.html_para1">The Gas Act 1995 provided three ways a household can be connected to the mains. First, a consumer can go to one of the many competing Gas Transporters. Secondly, the Gas Transporter can apply to Ofgem to use a system of supplemental charges where the cost of making the gas connection is recovered over a period of typically 20 years by means of an additional charge on each unit of gas. Thirdly, the consumer can purchase the pipes and hire a specialist company to lay them for him--the so called "self-lay" system.
<P>

<a name="10313w11.html_para2">The Government are aware that many households which are not currently connected to the mains would like to be and, in the coming months, they will be working with Ofgem and the industry to ensure that the gas network provides the widest viable coverage.

 It is not possible to quantify the direct effect of all the Department's policies and actions. However, we do hold statistical information on the programmes administered by the Department and the expected effects of that funding in the South Shields constituency are set out.

buoyant. Despite the weak euro, exports continue to rise and currently account for 54 per cent. of UK production. I hope that these positive trends in exporting can continue.
<P>

<a name="10313w11.html_para3">In Norwich, two leading footwear manufacturers have taken part in a DTI-supported project which included supply chain management. A manufacturer has also made a substantial investment in new machinery. Another company is the world's leading manufacturer of ballet and dancing shoes. I remain confident that through strategic planning such companies have the best chance of remaining internationally competitive and leading in the market sectors or niches in which they operate.

 <i>[holding answer 9 March 2001]:</i> The size of the post office network and precise location of post offices is an operational matter for the Post Office, taking account of the formal requirement to maintain the rural network and to prevent any avoidable closures of rural offices and of the Postal Services Commission's advice on accessibility of public post offices.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The development of Universal Banking Services are at an early stage (they are not due to come on stream until 2003). Payment arrangements will be subject detailed to contractual negotiations between the Government and the Post Office.

<a name="10313w12.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Page: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what his estimate is of the reduction of fraud through the introduction of a magnetic card for the payment of benefits and pensions.  [153602R]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 By making payments directly into bank accounts, the Government expect to achieve savings of around &#163;100 million in current Instrument of Payment fraud.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what incentives the Government will give to individuals to encourage the utilisation of Universal Banking Services by benefit and pension recipients; and what is their cost.  [153600R]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 It is the Government's intention to identify and deploy effective incentives to encourage the utilisation of Universal Banking Services by benefit and pension recipients. The concept of Universal Banking Services are at an early stage (they are not due to come on stream until 2003) and a lot of detailed work will be necessary before decisions can be taken on what form that incentives structure might take.

 It is too early to say what the setting up and running costs of the Post Office Card Account element of Universal Banking Services will be; or what might be the percentage division of costs between the Government and the banking sector. The banks have agreed in principle to make a contribution but the precise figures are subject to commercial negotiations which we expect to be resolved shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 This is an operational matter for the Post Office. I understand that the Post Office informed post office outlets of the date when old &#163;20 notes ceased to be legal tender principally by issuing articles in a monthly internal publication sent to all front-line staff. The first of these articles appeared at the end of August 2000. In addition, a national helpline is available to front-line staff should they require further assistance.

 My Department issued a consultative document in May last year which elicited some starkly conflicting views, and highlighted a range of difficult moral, legal and equity questions. As a result of the complexity of the issues raised it is taking time to reach a decision on the way forward. None the less, the Government wish to see a just outcome to resolve this long standing matter. Having spoken to those involved, I do recognise the strong feelings there are about an early resolution.

The full advice on these and other aspects is available to all schools, parents and others on the Department's website, and has been sent to all Chief Education Officers in England, and to other education-interest groups.

Council and Committee business focused on preparations for the forthcoming European Council in Stockholm on 23-24 March.

Ministers also noted the inputs from the Employment Committee and the Social Protection Committee in the discussion on the preparations for Stockholm. The UK emphasised the importance of remaining focused on the priorities agreed at Lisbon, working towards creating choice and mobility in a dynamic and flexible labour market and, with Commission support, pressed for concrete outcomes at Stockholm: particularly in terms of basic skills, the skills and mobility taskforce, action on the gender pay gap, women entrepreneurs and a European employment target for older workers.

 There has been no application from Lincolnshire county council to the Secretary of State regarding the transfer of land to the Foundation Trustees of Sibsey Free Primary School. Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 requires local authorities to obtain the Secretary of State's consent before they can sell any playing field used by a school in the last 10 years. I understand that the land in question was previously agricultural land and has not yet been used as school playing field. Therefore, Lincolnshire county council does not need the Secretary of State's consent to transfer it to the School's Foundation Trustees.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w17.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 March 2001]:</i> Compensation for animals destroyed to control foot and mouth disease is paid at the full market value of the animal immediately before it became affected with disease, or immediately before slaughter in all other cases. Animals are subject to an independent valuation prior to slaughter. This will take into account whether an animal's pedigree status or any other factor has a bearing on its value.

<P>

<a name="10313w17.html_para0">This advice has been posted on MAFF's website www.maff.gov.uk. It provides basic information on how the disease is spread and explains what can be done to reduce the risk of disease spreading to animals contained on these sites.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w17.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Farmed deer are covered under the Animal Health Act 1981 and the Foot and Mouth Disease Order 1983 as ruminating animals, and are susceptible to foot and mouth disease.
<P>

<a name="10313w17.html_para2">An initial veterinary assessment indicates the risk of wild deer spreading the disease is low.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w17.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answers 6 and 12 March 2001]:</i> Compensation is payable for the market value of animals slaughtered to control foot and mouth disease. It is not payable for the consequential losses caused by foot and mouth controls, for example when movement restrictions cause animals to become ineligible for the human consumption market. There are no plans to make such payments in response to the current outbreak, but the situation will be kept under review.

<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 8 March 2001]:</i> Extensive tracings were made of personnel, pigs, livestock, feed and other agricultural vehicles onto and off all 16 infected premises. Investigations to date support the initial findings that the second infected premises was the index case and that pigs there were exposed to CSF virus in early June 2000.
<P>

<a name="10313w17.html_para5">The most likely source is thought to be an infected pork product, since back-tracing failed to reveal any evidence of infection and no other local source was detected. Subsequent spread was caused by commercial pig movements or by lateral spread.

However, achieving particular yields either by farm or in total is not one of the objectives of the scheme.

 <i>[holding answer 5 March 2001]:</i> Farm gate prices as measured by the index of producer prices for agricultural products declined 26.3 per cent. over the five years to December 2000. Retail food prices increased 3.9 per cent. over the five years to January 2001 compared with an increase of 13.9 per cent. for all items RPI. Agricultural commodities account for a relatively small proportion of the retail price of food, with most of the costs accounted for by processing and distribution.

 The regeneration of traditional resorts was identified as one of the key action points in "Tomorrow's Tourism", the Government's tourism strategy--published in 1999. The strategy set out a model regeneration plan and the Government, together with the English Tourism Council (ETC), have been working with regional and local authorities and the British Resorts Association to encourage the adoption of the model plan and the sharing of best practice. Resort regeneration has been extensively discussed at Ministerial Tourism Summits and the ETC have set up a Resorts Task Force, which has recently published its report "Sea Changes" which sets out a blueprint for seaside resort regeneration.
<P>

<a name="10313w18.html_para0">New assistance has been provided for many resorts through the new Structural Funds (Objective 2) and Assisted Areas maps. The Single Regeneration Budget has recently made &#163;172 million available to coastal areas and &#163;30 million has been provided from the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund to benefit a number of major resorts, including Southport. National Lottery funding continues to assist numerous seaside resorts.

Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally; in Hemsworth the number has decreased from 1,800 to 1,500 and in the Wakefield Metropolitan Authority area from 5,900 to 5,200.

In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over-75s of whom we estimate there are about 5,900 in Hemsworth and 19,200 in the Wakefield Metropolitan Authority area. 2,500 pensioner families in Hemsworth and 10,400 in the Wakefield Metropolitan Authority area are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners.

This will be helped by encouraging flexible careers and, in the short term, increasing international recruitment.

<P>
<a name="10313w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The National Beds Inquiry (NBI) was set up to review long-term assumptions about the volume of general and acute health services and their implications for the whole system of care. It focused on the needs of older people and considered the scope for alternative models of care. The consultation on the NBI report demonstrated overwhelming support for "care closer to home" and the development of intermediate care services. The NHS Plan set a target of 5,000 extra intermediate care beds by 2004, some of which will be in community hospitals. In the light of the NBI report and consultation and the NHS Plan, clear policy guidance was published on 15 February. This provides tools to help health authorities to benchmark their performance against comparable authorities and to assess future requirements for beds and services to meet the needs of local people in all areas, and requires them to develop action plans as part of a wider review of services to be undertaken in the summer. The guidance (HSC 2001/03:LAC (2001)4 "Implementing the NHS Plan: Developing services following the National Beds Inquiry") is in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w25.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Edward Davey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much each hospital in <i>(a)</i> London, <i>(b)</i> Surrey, <i>(c)</i> Kent and <i>(d)</i> Sussex paid in 1999-2000 to private taxi firms to collect blood from blood banks; what estimate has been made of the savings to these hospitals from using the free service provided; and what guidelines he plans to issue to hospitals within the emergency rider volunteers' catchment area to encourage them to take advantage of their services.  [152850]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested around the cost incurred to hospitals by taxi firms to collect blood from blood banks in London, Surrey, Kent and Sussex is not held centrally. The Department does not collect information of the savings to hospitals from using free services to collect blood from blood banks.
<P>

<a name="10313w25.html_para0">From 1 April 1999 the supply of blood and blood components has been covered by a National Service Agreement between National Health Service trusts and the National Blood Service (NBS). This agreement stipulates the cost of routine scheduled deliveries to trusts absorbed into the prices charged for the provision of blood and blood components. The trusts and the local blood centres agree the routine delivery schedules to a trust. The NBS uses its own vehicles, couriers or taxis to provide the ad hoc deliveries. The decision is based on cost and availability of mode of transport as the supply may be urgent. Regardless of the actual transport cost the trust is only charged &#163;11.50.
<P>

<a name="10313w25.html_para1">We have no plans to issue guidelines to hospitals within the emergency volunteers' catchment area to encourage hospitals to take advantage of their services. The NBS has a responsibility to ensure that the safety of the blood supply is not compromised. Therefore the transportation of blood, blood products and tissues is carefully controlled using the NBS transport fleet together with the specifically arranged contracts with third party suppliers. This ensures that the appropriate standard of vehicles and equipment is used, together with the appropriate training of staff, environmental controls and employment of route scheduling. The safety and security of the blood supply is paramount; therefore the use of volunteers to undertake this activity has not been actively pursued by the NBS.

<a name="10313w25.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Cousins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health when the decision was taken to replace the existing Northern Centre for Cancer Treatment at Newcastle general hospital; what recent changes in numbers of linear accelerators have been made; and how many successive business cases for replacements have been submitted since 1997.  [153195]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The 1993 Newcastle Strategic Review strategy document did not include provision for the relocation of the Northern Centre for Cancer Treatment (NCCT) from the Newcastle general hospital site. Arising from public consultation it became apparent that, as acute services were relocated off the Newcastle general hospital site, the NCCT would become increasingly isolated from access to surgery, medicine, anaesthetics, critical care and other clinical services. Plans were therefore drawn up as part of the Freeman hospital site development control plan. Consequently, the subsequent strategic outline case (SOC) (approved in April 1998) included the reprovision of the NCCT on the Freeman hospital site.
<P>

<a name="10313w25.html_para3">The SOC recognised the constraints on radiotherapy capacity in the existing NCCT (six linear accelerators in 1998) and proposed that the new NCCT should open with seven linear accelerators, moving swiftly to eight and with bunker capacity for nine.
<P>

<a name="10313w25.html_para4">Since the publication of the Royal College of Radiologists' Report on Radiotherapy and of the National Health Service Cancer Plan in autumn 2000, the outline business case (OBC) has been amended to note the potential requirement to construct up to 12 linear accelerator bunkers should further capacity be required in the future. If required, this extension would have funding implications over and above that detailed in the existing OBC.
<P>

<a name="10313w25.html_para5">In 2000 funding was agreed via the New Opportunities Fund (NOF) to replace two linear accelerators at NCCT. The trust also funded the upgrading of a third linear accelerator. In addition, a seventh bunker has been constructed, giving some additional capacity and 



<P>
<P><I>13 Mar 2001 : Column: 595W</I><P>
flexibility to maintain six operational linear accelerators during installation and upgrading works. The first NOF funded machine was commissioned in December 2000 and the second machine will be operational in December 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health when the major investment in new hospital facilities at the Freeman and RVI hospitals Newcastle was first accepted in his Department's programme; when it was decided to use PFI finance; how many business cases have subsequently been submitted; and how many health authorities had to be signed up to the business case on each occasion.  [153194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10313w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Newcastle Strategic Review (NSR), as a strategy, was approved by Ministers in December 1993. In the mid-1990s the centralisation of obstetrics and gynaecology services (which had previously been fragmented) onto the Royal Victoria Infirmary (RVI) site took place. In addition there was a &#163;11 million public sector investment to centralise ophthalmology services also onto the RVI site. In 1995 the first of the "fast track" public capital allocations were made (which finally totalled &#163;8.4 million) to facilitate further movement of acute services off the Newcastle general hospital site. Confirmation of the support to larger scale capital investment at RVI and Freeman to complete the implementation of the NSR was provided by the approval of the second wave strategic outline case (SOC) in April 1998, revisions to which were approved in September 1999.
<P>

<a name="10313w25.html_para6">The second wave SOC envisaged most of the capital investment being provided under the Private Finance Initiative (PFI). A similar position applied in the subsequent revised SOC proposals. This was in line with practice for almost all major hospital schemes referred to the Capital Prioritisation Advisory Group.
<P>

<a name="10313w25.html_para7">Complete consultation drafts (dated February 2000) of the Outline Business Cases (OBC) for the PFI construction of new facilities on the Freeman and RVI hospital sites were submitted to the Northern and Yorkshire Regional Office in spring 2000. Following the final confirmation of purchaser support these were subsequently revised and the final version of the OBC were submitted to the regional office in February 2001 and are now under assessment.
<P>

<a name="10313w25.html_para8">Complete consultation drafts of the business case for the &#163;15.3 million publicly funded enabling schemes for the NSR were submitted to the Regional Office in March 2000 and June 2000. The definitive version was submitted in October 2000 following support and approved in November 2000.
<P>

<a name="10313w25.html_para9">A full business case for the PFI replacement of the existing Energy Centre at the RVI was approved in December 2000. This scheme had not been a part of the NSR SOC.

 A study on the incidence of leukaemia near all 20 high power TV/FM radio transmitters in Great Britain was published in 1996 by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit (SAHSU). This study found that there was no observed excess risk of leukaemia within 2 kilometres of all the transmitter sites looked at as a group. The Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) evaluated the results of the SAHSU study. In their statement COMARE reiterated their previous advice that there is no firm evidence of a carcinogenic hazard from exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) from TV and radio masts emissions.
<P>

<a name="10313w25.html_para11">Last year a report on mobile phones and health was published by the Independent Group on Mobile Phones, chaired by Sir William Stewart. The Stewart report provided a rigorous and comprehensive assessment of existing research considered the possible effects on health of mobile phones and base stations (masts). The report concluded that the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to health of people living near base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines. Among its conclusions the Stewart group commented that the upsurge of mobile phone technology should be matched by good quality research. We have responded by setting up a new programme jointly funded by industry. The first call for proposals was issued on 9 February.
