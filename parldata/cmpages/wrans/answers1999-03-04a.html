<P>
<a name="90304w01.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Any plans by the Government to issue information during a referendum campaign on whether or not the UK should join the single currency would be made in the light of the Government's response to the recommendations from the Neill Committee on the conduct of referendums.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w01.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The Treasury will continue its dialogue with key external bodies to determine what information the public and business would need at each stage of the changeover process. Any information campaign would cover key concerns that the public and business may have. Chapter 8 of the Treasury's Outline National Changeover Plan provides further information.

<P>
<a name="90304w01.htm_wqn12"><B> Mr. John D. Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what is the total estimated cost, including <i>(a)</i> printing, <i>(b)</i> times and <i>(c)</i> staff, in the preparation of the booklet, "The Wheelchair Service", by the Southern Health and Social Services Council; which other area health boards and area health councils have already published documents on the Wheelchair Service; to what extent there is duplication amongst the documents; and if she will make a statement.  [73572]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w01.htm_spnew12"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 The total external cost of publishing the booklet "The Wheelchair Service--The Experiences and Perceptions of Users", is estimated at &#163;4,800 shared equally between joint publishers, Southern Health and Social Services Board and Southern Health and Social Services Council. The project began in December 1997 and was completed in January 1999. Two members of staff from the Council and three board officers were involved in developing the booklet as part of their on-going responsibilities to commission and assess the service needs of their users. As an integral part of the Board's and Council's activities, the total staff time attributed to this project is estimated at 25 man-days over the 13 month period. A detailed breakdown of staff costs is not readily available.
<P>

<a name="90304w01.htm_para4">The Western and Northern Health and Social Services Boards have carried out reviews of their commissioning arrangements for wheelchair services within the past three years. Reports of these reviews, which were conducted 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 1999 : Column: 824</I><P>
as an integral part of the Board's activities, were not formally published. Whilst these reviews may have covered some of the same ground, they were specific to their respective areas and therefore cannot be considered to constitute any duplication.
<P>

<a name="90304w01.htm_para5">The provision of wheelchairs appropriate to the needs of users and supplied by an efficient service is a key element in promoting the independence and mobility of people with disabilities. Their views are important in informing and shaping the services they use and this most recent survey has provided users, and their carers, with a vehicle for contributing to the improvement of a service upon which they greatly depend.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if district councils are obliged to set a rate in public; and if she will make a statement.  [73570]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w02.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Section 23 of the Local Government Act (Northern Ireland) 1972 requires that every meeting of a district council shall be open to the public. A council may, by resolution, exclude the public from a council meeting whenever publicity would be prejudicial to the public interest, for example, in the case of meeting at which confidential business is to be transacted or for other special reasons defined by the council. There is, however, no specific legislation which obliges a district council to set a rate in public.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. McFall: </B> 
 The latest available information shows that at 15 January 1999 there were 237,546 persons in receipt of State Retirement Pension. This total is comprised of 82,963 males and 154,583 females.

<a name="90304w02.htm_para1"><i>Letter from D. Carson to Mr. Roy Beggs, dated 2 March 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>You recently asked the Secretary of State to answer two Parliamentary Questions about the permitted level of expenditure per household for connection to mains sewerage, when it was last determined and whether the level of expenditure will be increased. You also asked what sum is used as the basis for determining the viability of a new project.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These questions have been forwarded to the Chief Executive of Water Service, Mr. HRF Plester, for reply. Mr. Plester is currently on leave and I am replying as the Service's Director of Finance.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Department of the Environment's statutory duty, under the Water and Sewerage Services (Northern Ireland) Order 1973, to provide sewerage facilities operates within the limitations that such provision must be both practicable, in engineering terms, and can be made at reasonable cost. Since 1973, therefore, reasonable cost allowances have been available for first time connections to the sewerage infrastructure. The maximum allowance is currently &#163;2,300 per domestic property (or equivalent). This maximum was set in 1986. It is currently under review by the Department.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Water Service test of viability for any new sewerage extension project is the &#163;2,300 maximum reasonable cost allowance multiplied by the number of properties to be served by the scheme.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Perhaps I can clarify by giving a model example. If, for instance, the number of domestic properties to be served by a sewer extension scheme is ten then the total Departmental expenditure available for the work is the reasonable cost maximum multiplied by ten-- 10 X &#163;2,300 = &#163;23,000. If the actual cost of provision is at or below this level, and the work involved is practicable, then the Water Service can programme the project in its capital works planning, subject to overall priorities.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If the cost of any scheme is estimated to be in excess of the maximum allowance calculated for the work then the applicant (or applicants) for the sewer extension may agree to pay the additional monies necessary to take the work ahead. The Water Service can then also programme the project in its capital works planning, subject to practicability and overall priorities.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope this explains the position clearly for you. Mr. Plester is happy to arrange a meeting to go into the matter in greater depth if you should wish this on his return. His secretary Mrs. Lynda Boyd can make necessary diary arrangements if contacted at the telephone number given above.</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 3 March 1999]:</i> The adopted text of Directive 98/44/EC on the legal protection of biotechnological inventions (EU Patent Directive) explicitly states that it is without prejudice to the obligations of the Member States with regard to international agreements, including the convention on Biological Diversity. Moreover, the Directive notes that as the Community is party to the Convention, Member States must have regard to those aspects of the convention which concern patent rights when implementing the terms of the Directive. More generally, the relationship between patent rights and the Convention will be one of the agenda items for discussion at international level Convention meetings later this year. The United Kingdom Government have, and will continue to play, an active role in these discussions.

 <i>[holding answer 2 March 1999]:</i> From September 1999, LEA's existing powers to make discretionary awards will be replaced by the new student support arrangements introduced under the Teaching and Higher Education Act 1998. For most HE and FE students who would otherwise have been eligible for discretionary awards, support will centre on access funds which we have increased significantly. LEAs will be able to support existing discretionary award holders during the remainder of their courses and will also be able to make discretionary payments to new students under the provisions of the Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998, if they choose to do so.

 Inspections of schools by the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) look at the effect of homework polices on the quality of education provided and the standards achieved by pupils. Inspection reports will therefore provide important evidence about the effect over time of introducing national guidelines. We are also considering other ways in which the guidelines might usefully be evaluated, once schools have had time to develop and implement their own homework polices in the light of them.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he expects the first trials of genetically modified crops to be completed; and what period of evaluation would be required thereafter before an application for commercial planting of a genetically modified crop could be considered.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 February 1999]:</i> The first trials of genetically modified (GM) crops in the United Kingdom were completed in the late 1980s. Since then several hundred further trials of GM crops have been completed. Each series of trials is subject to a consent which requires a report of the trial itself and a post trial monitoring report to be completed and submitted to the regulatory authorities. This information is used as part of the assessment of subsequent applications for trials. Those carrying out the trials also evaluate their work and often publish the results in the open literature where the information is accessible to all.
<P>

<a name="90304w05.htm_para2">The recently announced farm-scale evaluations of three types of herbicide tolerant GM crops to evaluate their impact on farmland wildlife will begin in April 1999 (for spring-sown rape and maize) and autumn 1999 (for autumn-sown rape). These trials will each continue for four years. It is intended that progress reports will be prepared at the end of each growing season so early results can be considered as they become available. The progress of the trials will be overseen by a steering committee. The evaluation of the results from each growing season will enable the committee to influence how subsequent stages of the trials should be undertaken.
<P>

<a name="90304w05.htm_para3">Under the current legislation applications for commercial planting must be considered as soon as they are received by one of the European Competent 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 1999 : Column: 838</I><P>
Authorities. Applications must contain the information laid down in the relevant directive (90/220/EEC) and an assessment of possible impacts on the environment. Once the Competent authority is satisfied that the required information has been provided, it must forward the dossier to the commission within 90 days of the application being made, with an opinion on whether or not approval should be granted. The dossier is then circulated to the other member states which must give an opinion to the EC within 60 days. If there is a qualified majority in favour of the product an EU wide marketing consent is granted.
<P>

<a name="90304w05.htm_para4">Once an EU wide consent has been granted under directive 90-220, commercial planting may commence, subject to any limitations and conditions set out in the consent and subject to the other necessary approvals having been granted, such as, the placing of the GM variety on the National List of Seeds or the EU Common Catalogue, approval under the Novel Foods Regulations and/or approval for the use of the relevant herbicide to be used on the new GM crop.

 The Extraordinary Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the Convention on Biological Diversity, meeting in Cartagena, Colombia failed to reach agreement on a biosafety protocol which is intended to govern the transboundary movement of living modified organisms (LMOs). The UK worked tirelessly alongside our European partners to seek to achieve a text acceptable to all sides that would secure adequate protection for the environment while avoiding the creation of unnecessary barriers to trade. However, while the EU's proposal for a compromise package received widespread support, there was not consensus.
<P>

<a name="90304w05.htm_para5">Among the key issues on which agreement could not be reached were how to deal with commodities intended for use as food or feed or for processing, the requirements for documentation or labelling of LMOs subject to transboundary movement and the relationship of the protocol to other international instruments.

 <i>[holding answer 2 March 1999]:</i> The Government were disappointed that the Extraordinary Conference of the Parties that met in Cartagena last week was suspended and therefore not able to adopt the Biosafety Protocol. Among the key issues on which agreement could not be reached were how to deal with commodities intended for use as food or feed or for processing, the requirements for documentation or labelling of LMOs subject to transboundary movement and the relationship of the protocol to other international instruments.
<P>

<a name="90304w05.htm_para8">The Government consider it important to maintain the momentum gained in Cartagena towards the development of international rules and procedures covering the transboundary movement of living modified organisms (LMOs). The UK, together with its European partners, will continue to participate actively in the process, with a view to concluding the Biosafety Protocol as a cornerstone of the international framework for biosafety.
<P>

<a name="90304w05.htm_para9">There are no immediate implications for the UK of the breakdown since the European Community legislation already controls all releases and marketing of LMOs within the Community including imports into the Community. At the international level, the Government will continue to promote the use of the UNEP International Technical Guidelines for Safety in Biotechnology wherever possible since these are currently the mainstay of the international framework for biosafety.

 <i>[holding answer 3 March 1999]:</i> Planning Policy Guidance note 11 "Regional Planning", a draft of which was published for consultation on 15 February, makes clear that regional planning bodies should work with Government Offices and other regional stakeholders to establish the level of housing required to meet the region's housing needs. In making this assessment, the Government's latest published household projections should be taken into account. Urban capacity studies should also be undertaken. Against this background of need and capacity, regional planning bodies are expected to take a realistic and responsible approach to future housing provision and should justify their views at the public examination of draft regional planning guidance. In preparing development plans (structure plans and UDPs) local authorities will be expected to reflect the housing figures set out in Regional Planning Guidance issued by the Secretary of State. Outside UDP areas, local plans are expected to be in conformity with the relevant structure plan.

 The information requested is not yet available. Latest figures, which relate to 1993, show the number of hectares of 'land previously developed for urban uses' (as defined by the Department's Land Use Change Statistics) that changed to residential use. These can be found in Annex A of the publication "Land Use Change in England No.13", a copy of which is in the House of Commons Library.
<P>

<a name="90304w06.htm_para12">The Land Use Change Statistics can provide more recent estimates for (a) the percentage of <i>land</i> changing to residential use that was previously developed, and (b) the percentage of new <i>dwellings</i> built on previously developed land. In 1996, the latest year for which a reliable estimate is available, 47 per cent. of <i>land</i> changing to residential use was previously developed, and 53 per cent. of new <i>dwellings</i> were built on previously developed land (56 per cent. including conversion of existing dwellings).

Between 1990 and 1996 the UK reduced total sulphur dioxide emissions by 46% and nitrogen oxide emissions by 25%.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w09.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Dewar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 February 1999]:</i> The Agriculture Business Improvement Scheme (ABIS) forms part of the Objective 1 Highlands and Islands Agricultural Programme (HIAP), along with the Marketing Scheme and the Crofting Township Development Scheme. There is no separate budget provision for the ABIS.
<P>

<a name="90304w09.htm_para1">The original budget provision for the HIAP was around &#163;23 million, but due to the strength of sterling against the ecu, this figure is now nearer &#163;20 million. To date, almost &#163;14.6 million has been committed under HIAP, and all three Schemes remain open to applications from farmers and crofters in the Highlands and Islands.
<P>

<a name="90304w09.htm_para2">As a consequence of consistent underspending against the HIAP budget provision, it is possible that all of the resources allocated to the Programme will not now be required. The Government are reviewing the budgetary provision for HIAP, but no decision has been taken on the possible virement of resources. The Government are planning to announce improvements to the ABIS next month to help stimulate uptake of the available funds.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 We are making two changes to the rules of the Woodland Grant Scheme today.
<P>

<a name="90304w09.htm_para3">We are keen to improve value for money from the Woodland Grant Scheme and have concluded that the payments currently offered for creating new woodland do not reflect the economies of scale available when creating very large forests. Payments for these large forests significantly reduce the funds available for delivering our other forestry objectives.
<P>

<a name="90304w09.htm_para4">We have therefore decided that from today, fixed rate grants will no longer be available for applications to create new woodlands of 300 hectares or more. They will be replaced by a grant linked to the overall costs likely to be incurred by the applicant over the first ten years. Normally the grant will be 60 per cent. of the costs, which will be agreed in negotiation with the owners. However, where there are particularly important public benefits in relation to achieving Biodiversity Action Plan targets, or helping crofter or community-based forestry schemes, it may be possible to pay 80 per cent. of the agreed costs. These payments will not exceed the grant that would have been paid using the current fixed rate grants.
<P>

<a name="90304w09.htm_para5">The rules of the Woodland Grant Scheme have also been amended from today so that grants are no longer available for land where the landowner has terminated an agricultural tenancy by means of a contested notice to quit. This change, which follows a recommendation in the Scottish Land Reform Policy Group's Report, is intended to discourage landowners from terminating tenancies, against the wishes of their tenants, in order to convert the land to woodland.
<P>

<a name="90304w09.htm_para6">Both these changes will apply throughout Great Britain.

Firms can now also pay taxes, file accounts, issue and redenominate shares and receive certain grants in euro.
<P>

<a name="90304w11.htm_para1">The Government's business information campaign was highly successful and resulted in over 350,000 copies of the Treasury's business factsheets being requested by UK firms and intermediaries. In addition, three quarters of a million factsheet leaflets have been requested and there have been three and a half million "hits" on our euro website.

 Most tourist services, including hotel and holiday accommodation, are subject to VAT at 17.5 per cent.

Additionally, many small businesses in the tourist industry are not VAT registered and thus charge no VAT at all to their customers.

 A quarter of the world is in recession and no country is immune from the effects of the current instability in the world economy. For example, in the three months to January, the value of UK exports to Japan and South Korea were down 25 per cent. on a year earlier, and even larger falls have been seen in exports to various other crisis-bound economies in Asia and elsewhere. But as a result of the tough and decisive action the Government has taken, Britain is now better placed to steer a course of stability in an uncertain and unstable world.

 The Government have decided that, subject to appropriate legislative approval, a Census of Population should be taken throughout the United Kingdom in 2001; the proposed date is Sunday 29 April.

<a name="90304w13.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> The Royal Air Force (RAF) and the Royal Navy (RN) participated in Exercise FLYING FISH 97, which took place in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements (FPDA), between 12-30 April 1997. The RAF deployed 450 personnel specifically to participate in this exercise. In addition, the RN had a number of ships in the area, taking part in Exercise OCEAN WAVE, from which approximately 1,900 personnel participated in Exercise FLYING FISH. The other armed forces participating were from New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore. Exercise FLYING FISH was the first of a new series of multinational tri-service exercises conducted under the auspices of the FPDA. The UK made the largest contribution to the exercise and also provided the command platform from which the exercise was controlled. The exercise improved the operational capability of UK forces which might need in future to deploy to the Asia-Pacific region in support of the FPDA. It also demonstrated the UK's capability to operate and sustain a RAF and RN deployment over large distances from the UK, and our ability to co-operate effectively with our other FPDA partners.

 Gurkha pensions are paid in accordance with the 1947 Tri-Partite Agreement between the UK, India and Nepal and are linked to the Indian Army pension code. Last year a review took place, incorporating the 1996 Indian Government 5th Pay Commission, which resulted in substantial rises for all our 26,000 British Gurkha pensioners and their families. The pension increases resulting from this review have been backdated to 1 January 1996. We have no current plans to hold discussions with the Indian Government on the issue of Gurkha pensions.

 I announced on 28 October 1998, <i>Official Report, </i>columns 360-67, that, subject to consultation with the Trades Unions, we planned to restructure the Army district organisation to produce a more effective and efficient framework for the administration of Army units in the United Kingdom. Following this consultation, I am now able to confirm that the restructuring will proceed as follows: the number of regional districts will reduce from six to three, covering Scotland and the North of England, Wales and the West of England and South-East England. Divisional headquarters for the higher administration of Army units in these regions will be at Craigiehall near Edinburgh, Shrewsbury and Aldershot. These reforms will also mean that the headquarters of the 3rd Division, based at Bulford in Wiltshire, will be freed of its regional administrative responsibilities and able to concentrate on its operational role including the command of its deployable units throughout the country. In addition, the London District headquarters will reduce to the status of a brigade headquarters and the headquarters of 43 (Wessex) Brigade will be transferred from Exeter to Bulford.

 The budget for centrally funded Defence Diplomacy activities for 1999-2000 will be found from within the Defence Military Assistance Fund (DMAF).

 The Defence Strategic Plan is a classified document and is therefore not published.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what arrangements are in place to enable the Defence Council to exercise collective ownership of the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review.  [74656]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w15.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Implementation of the Strategic Defence Review is discussed regularly at meetings of the Defence Council.

<P>
<a name="90304w15.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Keith Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what are the key milestones and timetables for deliverance of the Strategic Defence Review implementation.  [74646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w15.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Key targets for the Department and a timetable for achieving them, reflecting the outcome of the Strategic Defence Review, were set out in the Ministry of Defence's Public Service Agreement, published in December.
<P>

<a name="90304w15.htm_para4">A number of key milestones in the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review have already been achieved, including: decisions on the command structure, location and timetable for the establishment of a Joint Helicopter Command involving battlefield helicopters of all three Services, and a Joint RN/RAF Harrier force (Joint Force 2000); detailed decisions on the restructuring of the TA; the establishment of a Veterans Advice Unit and an inter-Departmental Services Families Task Force; plans for the reorganisation and enhancement of the Defence Medical Services; and the trialling of the principles of Smart Procurement through pilot Integrated Project Teams in the Procurement Executive and the logistics area.
<P>

<a name="90304w15.htm_para5">Over the coming weeks, I anticipate being able to announce further significant achievements in the implementation of SDR measures.
<P>

<a name="90304w15.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Keith Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what practical measures he plans to take to ensure that the implementation of the Strategic Defence Review is an open and transparent process.  [74658]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w15.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 We have sought to ensure that the openness which characterised the conduct of the Strategic Defence Review continues in its implementation. We have consulted widely within the Department, with the Trades Unions and with affected local authorities on implementation of individual aspects, and will continue to do so. Where appropriate (for example, in taking forward the Smart Procurement initiative) we have involved defence industry. We consulted widely on the detailed implementation of TA restructuring and on the restructuring and enhancement of the Defence Medical Service before taking decisions. I held a seminar at RUSI on 22 October 1998 to discuss the Review with journalists, academics and other

interested parties. We have kept Parliament informed as implementation of individual aspects progresses and will report further in the Defence White Paper later in the year.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At 31 January 1999 the amount of child support full maintenance assessment debt was &#163;507,794,866. This can be broken down further to &#163;296,044,407 (58.3%) collectable debt, &#163;197,532,203 (38.9%) possible uncollectable debt and &#163;14,218,256 (2.8%) deferred debt. Deferred debt is where the Agency has deferred the debt indefinitely, provided non-resident parents meet certain conditions

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>on payment of regular maintenance and any remaining debt. Where appropriate the parent with care will be compensated for the loss of this money.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To further increase the flow of maintenance and to help non-resident parents pay the arrears that they owe, wherever possible the Agency makes every effort to re-schedule debts; re-scheduled debts are those where the Agency has negotiated a closely monitored agreement with the non-resident parent to pay arrears by instalments. The amount of debt re-scheduled included in the &#163;507,794,866 at 31 January 1999 was &#163;395,578,470 (78%).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I cannot provide precisely all the information that you have requested on the current backlog, but have provided as much as possible from the most recent information available.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At 31 January 1999, there was a total of 278,518 maintenance applications outstanding.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We normally refer to our maintenance assessment backlog as cases that are over 52 weeks old and have not yet been assessed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>At any time, the Agency would expect to have a normal head of work of around 210,000 maintenance applications. The speed with which assessments can be cleared is constrained by the complexities of the current legislation which can require up to 104 separate pieces of information to be collected and verified before an assessment can be made, however the Agency is steadily reducing the time taken and is clearing the backlog of applications from the early years.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our original estimated volume of backlog cases outstanding in April 1997 was 225,000; by 31 January 1999 we had cleared 251,000, and in practice now expect to need to clear 300,000 cases. This is because as we have proceeded in clearing this work we identified more cases in the backlog than originally estimated. In June 1998 we introduced a major improvement of the Child Support Computer System (CSCS) which provided automated management information. To make full use of the automated information all of the existing cases on CSCS had to be checked to ensure their management information status was correct. This exercise involved validating 1.25 million cases, work was completed in December and means that we now have a reliable automated count of all work on hand.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To clear these 300,000 cases by 31 March will require the Agency to clear around 50,000 cases in February and March. Although this is very challenging we cleared over 27,000 in January, and therefore expect to clear the 300,000 cases.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We envisage that the extra resources which will be released as a result of clearing the maintenance assessment backlog will enable more resources to be concentrated on improving customer service and ensuring that parents meet their responsibility so that children receive the maintenance they are entitled to on a regular basis.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security (1) under the new system of periodic review of disability living allowance, how often recipients of the benefit will have their situation reviewed;  [74749]

<UL>(2) what information will be required from the recipients of disability living allowance when their situation is reviewed under the new system of review.  [74750]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="90304w19.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 From April 1999, a new fairer system of periodic inquiry into benefit entitlement will commence for existing recipients of Disability Living Allowance (DLA). People selected for inquiry action will be asked to complete a detailed questionnaire, based on the current claim form for DLA. This will provide the Benefits Agency (BA) with an up to date picture of the need that the individual has help with personal care and mobility and allow the BA to determine whether a review of entitlement would be appropriate. This will enable awards to be increased or decreased in line with entitlement. Initially, cases will be selected on a proportional basis across the range of awards to be included in the inquiry process.
<P>

<a name="90304w19.htm_para1">Some disabling conditions, and the needs that they generate, change very little over time, whilst others can be very variable in effect and/or degenerative in nature. The BA is working to establish the proper frequency with which individuals should be asked about their current needs, so that, in the future, inquiries can be made at the most appropriate time and new claimants can be advised from the outset when inquiries are likely to be made in their case. This action does not affect the responsibility of all claimants to tell the BA about changes that may affect benefit entitlement.

 The changes to the Social Fund Budgeting Loan Scheme will be introduced on 5 April 1999. Applications for Social Fund budgeting loans will be decided according to a few simple set factual criteria, rather than the discretion of the officer deciding the application. This will mean that those on the lowest incomes who apply for a loan will no longer be asked detailed questions on what they intend to do with the money before a decision can be made. In keeping with the Government's aims for an active modern Social Security service, these changes will make the applications

Of this total, &#163;98 million will be allocated to Community care Grants, &#163;436.7 million to loans and &#163;0.5 million will be set aside as a contingency reserve. To further improve the fairness of the Social Fund scheme we shall be allocating the loans budget to each Benefits Agency district with a view to achieving greater consistency in the level of successful applications across districts. Full details of budget allocations to individual Benefits Agency districts will be placed in the House Library on 24 March.

<a name="90304w20.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jon Owen Jones: </B> 
 The Local Government Bill, which includes best value provisions, is currently being considered by Parliament. The Bill makes provision for the National Assembly to be responsible for administering best value in Wales. The Bill provides a broad framework for best value and it will be for the Assembly to determine the more detailed aspects of the policy and how it will operate in Wales. The Assembly is likely to want to draw on the experience of all Welsh authorities involved in best value pilot studies. Once the Bill is enacted and the pilot studies have made further progress, the Assembly will wish to consider what guidance to issue to local authorities on best value.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the use of electro-convulsive-therapy treatment for mental health patients.  [73003]<P>

<P>
<a name="90304w22.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Electro-convulsive therapy (ECT) can be used for a variety of conditions, including depression, mania and certain forms of schizophrenia. It has been shown to be of most benefit where other treatments have failed.

An expert group, chaired by Genevra Richardson, Professor of Law at Queen Mary and Westfield College, has been appointed to undertake a review of mental health legislation in England and Wales and to make recommendations on the scope of a new legislative framework by 1 July 1999. The group's report will include advice on appropriate safeguards which should apply to the use of Electro-Convulsive Therapy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health which health regions plan to increase the number of mental health beds; and by how many.  [73225]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w22.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Mental Health Modernisation Fund will be used to increase the number of mental health beds in all eight health regions. &#163;19 million has already been allocated to health authorities, part of which is being used to increase the number of 24 hour staffed beds. In addition health authorities have just been invited to apply for additional resources for secure beds. Details are set out in circular Health Service Circular/Local Authority Circular 1999-038, copies of which are available in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to issue information from his Department to help the public make an informed decision when they vote on the single currency.  [73587]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w22.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Any plans by the Government to issue information during a referendum campaign on whether or not the United Kingdom should join the single currency would be made in light of the Government's response to the recommendations from the Neill Committee on the conduct of referendums. The Government will announce their conclusions on those recommendations when my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary publishes a White Paper and draft Bill before the summer recess.

<P>
<a name="90304w22.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 Her Majesty's Treasury will continue its dialogue with key external bodies to determine what information the public and business would need at each stage of the changeover process. Any information campaign would cover key concerns that the public and business may have. Chapter 8 of the Treasury's Outline National Changeover Plan provides further information. Copies of the plan are available in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what appeal mechanism he will establish in respect of decisions by the Medicines Control Agency to classify foodstuffs as medicines.  [73314]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w22.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We do not propose to give the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) the power to decide that a foodstuff is a medicine. The MCA has consulted on legislative proposals for classifying medicinal products, which include introducing a statutory right to a formal review of the agency's provisional decisions. The agency is now considering responses to the consultation exercise. We will decide in due course whether and what review arrangements we wish to put before Parliament.

<a name="90304w22.htm_wqn7"><B> Mr. Maclean: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) if health foods and dietary supplements will have to satisfy the same licensing criteria as medicines when the remit of the Medicines Control Agency is extended;  [73319]
<P>
<UL>(2) what limitations he plans to place on the Medicine Control Agency's proposed new power to declare any food product to be a medicine.  [73313]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w22.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The powers of the licensing authority, of which the Medicines Control Agency (MCA) is an executive arm, are set out in the Medicines Act 1968 and secondary legislation including the Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations Etc.) Regulations 1994. We have no proposals to extend the remit of the MCA to health foods and dietary supplements, which will continue to be subject to food law.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the number of health food products which could be reclassified as medicines.  [73312]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w22.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 We can make no such estimate since under European Commission law and United Kingdom law, health foods are not medicines.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if it is his policy to establish chronic pain management programmes in the NHS on the model of that at St. Thomas' Hospital in London.  [73949]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w22.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Research has shown pain management programmes, similar to the model at St. Thomas' Hospital, to be effective for selected patients whose chronic pain is not relieved by conventional treatments. Against that background, it is for health authorities and National Health Service trusts to plan local pain services, in consultation with health professionals, to meet local needs.

 The National Institute for Clinical Excellence will be not be operational until April this year, the officers and non-officer members have yet to be appointed and the terms of reference will be a matter for the Board of NICE to discuss at its first meetings.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Comparisons between March 1997 and March 1998 are affected by the reduction in the registration period to 15 months.<P>

2. Comparisons are for dentists with contracts at 31 March 1997 and 31 March 1998 and excludes dentists with no registrations on both dates.<P>

3. Dentists with contracts in several HAs are counted in each HA in which they have a contract but only once in the England total.<P>

4. The percentage increases and decreases may not equal a 100 per cent. because some dentists will have an unchanged list size. <P>

After each meeting of the Agriculture Council, I report back to the European Scrutiny Committee on the business conducted at the Agriculture Council meeting. The Government have recently extended arrangements for scrutinising Council business to include the Second and Third Pillars of the Treaty on European Union, as well as the First Pillar. The Government will continue to promote the interests of the United Kingdom at all meetings of the Council of Ministers. However, it has not been the practice of successive Administrations to indicate the position that Ministers propose to take in advance of Council.

<P>
<a name="90304w25.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The commercial market for meat and bone meal (MBM) has traditionally depended on its use in animal feed and in fertiliser. Because of the risk of transmission of BSE, the use of MBM in farm animal feed and agricultural fertiliser is currently prohibited.
<P>

<a name="90304w25.htm_para2">The Government will only consider relaxation of the rules prohibiting the inclusion of animal proteins in feedingstuffs and fertilisers, which are intended to prevent the transmission of BSE to cattle either directly or through cross examination, if SEAC advise that it is safe to do so. We would also wish to consult the EU Commission on any proposal to change the rules.
<P>

<a name="90304w25.htm_para3">The Meat and Livestock Commission (MLC) is currently producing an industry strategy paper for adding value to animal by-products, which includes restoration of the value of meat and bone meal from the rendering of porcine waste in dedicated plants through the incorporation of this material in poultry feed. Experience has shown that the effective enforcement of such selective controls is extremely difficult, and failure could prejudice the progress made so far in eradicating BSE and in restoring export markets. We are currently discussing with the MLC whether their paper should go to SEAC or whether further work should be done first to address the need for safeguards to avoid contamination of farm animal feed not intended for poultry.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what discussions he has had with Treasury Ministers about prohibiting putting farmers' corporation tax on the same basis as farmers' income tax in terms of offsetting trading losses against future profit; and what was the outcome of those discussions. [R] [73798]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w25.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I have had no discussion with Treasury Ministers on this matter. While taxation is a matter for my right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer, I understand that trading losses, including trading losses of farmers, can already be carried forward against future profits from that trade for Corporation Tax just as they can be for Income Tax.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what proportion of the consignments of live sheep that pass through lairages in the Dover region prior to export are inspected by his veterinary officials to ensure that they are being transported in compliance with the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997; what steps his veterinary officials take to ensure that sheep which pass through lairages in the Dover region prior to export are given the rest periods required by the 1997 Order; what proportion of loadings prior to export of live sheep at lairages in the Dover region are inspected by his veterinary officials; and if he will make a statement.  [74321]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w25.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The level of targeted spot checks carried out at the Dover lairages depends on the resources available, but at present the aim is to check one of the four lairages on each sailing day. Additionally, Local Authority enforcement officers carry out random checks 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 1999 : Column: 911</I><P>
of vehicles en route, and of lairages. This supplements the arrangements under which all animals exported for further fattening or slaughter are checked at Dover port.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90304w25.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 1999]:</i> Tuberculosis in cattle is a serious and multi-faceted problem in this country, and we consider that the only way to develop a sustainable control policy in the long term is to implement the wide ranging five point strategy, involving research and control, which I announced last August. That strategy reflects our evaluation of the Krebs Report, and of the ideas contained in several hundred letters commenting on it.
<P>

<a name="90304w25.htm_para4">We are willing to consider additional action which could usefully complement existing measures. Among the ideas being considered at present are more rapid responses to TB incidents, more comprehensive local testing, local badger culling outside the trial areas, and better advice to farmers on protecting the health status of cattle herds. We have not yet come to any conclusions. We are keeping an open mind while we discuss matters with interested parties. We will give serious consideration to any proposal which might help towards a solution.
