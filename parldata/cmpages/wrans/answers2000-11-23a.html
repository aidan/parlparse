<UL>(2) what representations he has received from labour organisations regarding job losses in Wales over the past six months; and if he will make a statement;  [136647]
<P>
(3) what representations he has received from companies in Wales which have made job reductions in the past six months; and if he will make a statement.  [136649]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 I have had correspondence and discussions with several individuals and groups, including trade unions and company managers.
<P>

<a name="01123w01.html_para0">Job losses are always unwelcome but it must be for individual companies to determine their response to market forces. The Government will continue to pursue its objective of securing long-term economic stability based on low inflation, allowing business to invest and plan ahead with confidence. The success of our policies is demonstrated by the steady fall in unemployment since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="01123w01.html_para1">When redundancies do occur, the Employment Service has a range of measures available to assist workers in securing suitable fresh employment opportunities. For large-scale job losses, this can include an on-site presence.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hanson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend and I meet regularly with the First Minister to discuss a range of issues, including measures to tackle substance abuse.
<P>

<a name="01123w01.html_para2">I understand that the Assembly's draft budget provides for an annual increase in direct funding for drug and alcohol initiatives of &#163;1.5 million by 2003-04. These extra resources will support measures set out in the Welsh substance misuse strategy, which was launched earlier this year.

from council house sales to <i>(a)</i> housing authorities in Wales and <i>(b)</i> Flintshire County Council in the current financial year; and if he will make a statement.  [137020]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hanson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend and I have regular discussions with the First Minister on a range of topics, including local authority finances.
<P>

<a name="01123w01.html_para3">I understand that the forecast of total receipts from the sale of council dwellings in the current financial year in Wales is &#163;39,081,000, of which &#163;1,600,000 relates to Flintshire County Council. Individual authorities are permitted to apply 25 per cent. of these receipts to the financing of new capital expenditure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Llwyd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what percentage of investment in Wales was of foreign origin in the last 12 months for which figures are available.  [135227]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Between 1 April 1999 and 31 March 2000, capital expenditure by overseas-owned companies, as reported at the time of the investment decision, was &#163;512,264,000. This cannot be expressed in percentage terms since a comparable figure of total investment in Wales is not available.

<a name="01123w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hanson: </B> 
 I have a statutory duty to consult with the National Assembly for Wales about the Government's legislative programme for each session of Parliament. However, my office and other Government Departments also liaise closely with the Assembly as policy develops. This means that consideration will already have been given to many Wales-specific issues before the commencement of the statutory consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Following the bad weather and flooding in Wales, I am happy to confirm that the Welsh budget will be increased by &#163;3 million over a four year period to 2003-04 as a consequence of additional funding made available because of the recent flooding in England. The Assembly can allocate its resources among individual programmes according to its own priorities.

<P>

<a name="01123w01.html_para4">An interdepartmental group, chaired by the Minister responsible for fisheries and the countryside, is looking at a number of issues arising out of the recent floods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 Having visited several parts of Wales in recent weeks, I am acutely aware of the serious impact of the floods on the farming community. It is for the National Assembly to decide what measures may be needed to assist farmers who have suffered loss.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what additional funding will be made available for the National Assembly of Wales to meet the unforeseen additional costs incurred by local authorities and other public sector agencies in Wales arising from recent acute bad weather and flooding; and if he will make a statement.  [138025]<P>

 Following the bad weather and flooding in Wales, I am happy to confirm that the Welsh budget will be increased by &#163;3 million over a four year period to 2003-04 as a consequence of additional funding made available because of the recent flooding in England.
<P>

<a name="01123w01.html_para5">There is an existing scheme, the Bellwin scheme, to help local authorities who incur unexpected costs in the work of dealing with floods and other emergencies, and the National Assembly for Wales is responsible for the operation of this scheme in Wales.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="01123w01.html_para6">Lottery-funded relief of the type suggested by my hon. Friend would not be an appropriate use of Lottery money, which funds specific time-limited initiatives that are additional to taxpayer-funded programmes. The Bellwin scheme, which in Wales is administered by the National Assembly, reimburses local authorities for excess costs incurred as a result of severe weather conditions. The Assembly Secretary for Finance and Communities

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will take steps to ensure that people who are HIV-positive do not suffer discrimination as a result of employment practices followed by his Department.  [137789]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 My Department's permanent staff are mostly seconded from the National Assembly for Wales and we operate the Assembly's employment policies. The Assembly is an equal opportunities employer. Its policy is that all eligible people should have equality of opportunity for employment and advancement on the basis of their ability, qualifications and suitability for work. All employees are entitled to equal treatment throughout their employment. Individuals should not be disadvantaged by conditions or requirements which cannot be shown to be justifiable.
<P>

<a name="01123w02.html_para0">The Assembly also has a well established procedure for dealing with discrimination and harassment complaints from its employees.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 I am not aware of such a decision. However, during the fuel protests in September, Customs and Excise exceptionally issued licences to many holders of red diesel, allowing them to use it in their vehicles after paying the difference in duty between red diesel and road fuel. This enabled many diesel users to overcome the worst of the shortages. Once supplies were re-established, all these licences were withdrawn.

<a name="01123w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 I meet the First Secretary regularly to discuss a range of issues, including health services in Wales.
<P>

<a name="01123w02.html_para1">Jane Hutt, the Assembly Secretary for Health and Social Services, set out her plans for the National Health Service in Wales (NHS Wales) in a statement to the National Assembly on 12 July 2000.

<P>
<UL>(2) what responsibilities regarding co-operation with the Irish Government to maximise the benefit which comes to Wales from the INTERREG Scheme are exercised by him; and what responsibilities are devolved to the National Assembly.  [138210]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Government retains responsibility for negotiating Structural Funds Regulations in the EU Council of Ministers, (involving the devolved administrations as necessary in accordance with the overarching concordat on co-ordination of EU policy issues). It was the UK Government, for example, which secured agreement to the Agenda 2000 package and the continued existence of INTERREG.
<P>

<a name="01123w02.html_para2">The National Assembly for Wales is responsible for the administration in Wales of European Structural Funds programmes and for developing and implementing the INTERREG programme with Ireland.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w02.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The climate change levy has been designed with safeguarding the competitiveness of manufacturing industries in all parts of the United Kingdom in mind. The final impact of the levy on individual businesses will depend on the extent to which they take advantage of the various exemptions, whether they take advantage of the new scheme of enhanced capital allowances for energy efficiency, and whether they are eligible for the 80 per cent. discount offered to energy-intensive industries that enter into emission reduction agreements.

 As an equal opportunities employer, the Department is committed to fairness and equality of opportunity for all in employment and advancement on the basis of suitability. The Department's equal opportunities statement requires that no eligible job applicant should receive less favourable treatment on the grounds of age, disability, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origins, religion or religious affiliation, or because they work part-time. We aim to develop DTI into an organisation that values the diversity of its staff and enables all to realise their potential by valuing the contribution of all and recognising the positive benefits that difference can bring.

 The bulk of the UK's current development assistance to East Timor is channelled through Trust Funds established by the United Nations, for the transitional administration, and the World bank, for reconstruction and development. We will contribute a total of &#163;5.5 million to the Trust Funds this financial year. In addition we are supporting a Human Resource Development programme implemented by Oxfam, which works with local NGOs and civil society groups.
<P>

<a name="01123w03.html_para1">During 1999-2000 we gave more than &#163;6.1 million through UN agencies and NGOs as emergency support for East Timor and for those refugees who crossed the border into West Timor.

 We do not expect the draft regulation to produce any large-scale increase in LDC rice imports in to the EU. LDCs represented 0.2 per cent. of rice imports into the EU in 1998 and less than 0.01 per cent. of rice imports into the United States. Guyana alone exported 40 times more rice to the EU than all of the LDCs combined. The draft regulation would give insufficient price incentive for any significant response from LDC producers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Foulkes: </B> 
 The problem of desertification is becoming increasingly widespread and acute. It is estimated that dry land areas in some 100 countries are prone to desertification. Its occurrence is exacerbated by the effects of climate change and the loss of biodiversity. The United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification is the principal international mechanism for addressing desertification in affected countries. The effects of desertification are felt most acutely in African states, a fact recognised in the objectives of the Convention.
<P>

<a name="01123w03.html_para4">We are concerned by problems of desertification and land degradation, since they are closely related to issues of poverty. To be effective, it is very important that actions to address desertification and land degradation are integrated into the sustainable development plans of affected countries. The latest UK report on activities in support of the Convention to Combat Desertification will be presented to the Fourth Conference of the Parties to the Convention in Bonn in December, which I hope to attend. Copies of the report will be deposited in the House of Commons Library on publication.

 Twelve countries (Benin, Bolivia, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Guyana, Honduras, Mali, Mauritania, Mozambique, Senegal, Tanzania and Uganda) have so far qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The international community is doing everything possible to bring a further eight countries to their Decision Point by the end of the year. In addition, under the Government's 100 per cent. policy, countries with remaining debts to ECGD and CDC are to receive relief when they qualify for relief under the HIPC Initiative.

 Women's rights and health are crucial factors in achieving the Government's objective of poverty elimination. We are strongly committed to supporting work towards eliminating female genital mutilation (FGM), a basic rights violation which must be stopped.

We seek to reduce the incidence of FGM by supporting advocacy to increase awareness of the dangers to women of the practice.

Offers of the ship in a regenerated condition have similarly found no customer.

 There are no instances where member states' governments have refused to accept the judgment of the Court, although there have been significant delays in the implementation of judgments. Such delays may result from the need to amend domestic law or be attributed to difficulties in a wider political context. However, the Government expect all member states to comply fully with the Court's judgments, and we regularly make our position clear to those concerned. The Government play their part in the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in carrying out the task of supervising the implementation of judgments and taking the necessary measures to ensure that they are implemented, and supports the principle that all cases should remain open until the committee is fully satisfied that they have been properly addressed.

My Department's advice therefore centres on it being better not to drink alcohol during pregnancy, suggests strategies to avoid alcohol consumption and advises that if alcohol is consumed that it be restricted to no more than two units (equivalent to one pint of ordinary beer) once or twice a week.

<P>
<a name="01123w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The statement said that we will provide &#163;535 million to fund capital maintenance works on local highways in 2001-02, an increase of 103 per cent. compared to 2000-01. The &#163;1,905 million that will be provided next year through the Highways Maintenance Standard Spending Assessment for Revenue Support Grant is an increase of 2.5 per cent. compared to 2000-01. Taken together these figures represent an overall increase of 15 per cent. in the amount available to local authorities for highway maintenance in 2001-02 compared to the previous year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what the estimated pigeon population was of <i>(a)</i> London and <i>(b)</i> the rest of England in each of the last 10 years.  [139659]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w07.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 My Department does not hold such detailed information on feral pigeon populations but I can provide a summary of the best information available.
<P>

<a name="01123w07.html_para0">Feral pigeons are one of the most abundant urban bird species and are also becoming increasingly common in the English countryside. Major concentrations are present in the conurbations of the south-east, west midlands and north of England. The bird's English range expanded by some 69 per cent. between the late 1960s and early 1990s, apparently due to the colonisation of rural areas in the 1970s.
<P>

<a name="01123w07.html_para1">Due to its secure conservation status and the difficulty of accurately surveying the high densities found in urban areas, the feral pigeon population has never been satisfactorily censused and many ornithologists ignore their presence on population monitoring plots. The BTO/JNCC/RSPB Breeding Bird Survey, commenced in 1994, will be the first scheme to provide adequate monitoring of the species. It may also enable us to derive a realistic population estimate, although this will be complicated by the difficulty of separating feral and semi-domesticated birds, and the fact that many thousands of birds, especially young homing pigeons, are added to the population every year.
<P>

<a name="01123w07.html_para2">The Breeding Bird Survey results for 1999 suggest that the English feral pigeon population has been stable in recent years, with a 3 per cent. increase on monitoring plots in the period 1994-99.
<P>

<a name="01123w07.html_para3">The London Bird Report for 1992 recorded "more than 2000" feral pigeons in Trafalgar Square alone. The latest issue of the London Bird Report covering 1997 states that although the overall population appears to be stable there has been a slow expansion to more rural and suburban habitats in recent decades, while at several well established sites there has been a recent increase in breeding numbers.

<P>
<a name="01123w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government recognise that the current disruption to the railways may displace traffic onto the roads, where travellers are on average at greater risk. It is therefore essential that the rail network is returned to a safe working condition as soon as possible. That is the aim of Railtrack's current rail replacement programme, to which the Government and HSE are giving every possible assistance. I am advised that statistics to quantify any increased risk arising from any consequent displacement of traffic from rail to road are not available.

[138788]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The primary risk arising from cracked rails is derailment, leading to fatal and serious injuries as occurred tragically at Hatfield. It is for Railtrack, as infrastructure controller, to manage that risk. To mitigate the consequences of such derailments, Railtrack have imposed emergency speed restrictions on the sites most affected by 'gauge corner cracking', until the track has been tested and replaced where necessary. Such speed restrictions in themselves may create further risks on the network, for example by increasing overcrowding at stations.
<P>

<a name="01123w08.html_para3">I am informed by the HSE that they have sought from Railtrack risk estimates on the cracked rails situation, and that HSE is working closely with Railtrack so that these restrictions can be lifted as soon as safety can be adequately assured. Extending the rail replacement programme would prolong the period for which restrictions are in place.

The CAA will investigate any incidents reported to them with enough detail but it is difficult to prove, for prosecution purposes, that a particular aircraft was responsible for an icefall. However, where there is sufficient information to suggest that a foreign aircraft may have been responsible, the CAA will refer the matter to the State of Registry of the aircraft for appropriate remedial action to be taken.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when he will publish the Regional Planning Guidance for East Anglia; and if he will make a statement.  [140322]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister has today published the Regional Planning Guidance for East Anglia. It is the first RPG to be completed under the new regionally based procedures with testing of the draft RPG at a public examination under an independent panel. It provides a clear strategy for the sustainable development of the region which will support economic growth and regeneration, meet the housing needs of all sectors of the community, and protect the environment. It provides a long-term planning framework for the East of England Development Agency's Regional Strategy.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para3">The RPG strategy reflects the Government's priorities in the Urban White Paper and policy guidance on planning for housing. It stresses urban renaissance and indicates that new development should be concentrated in the region's cities and larger towns. It proposes an initial target of 50 per cent. of new housing on previously developed land and buildings. This is below the national target of 60 per cent. but, given East Anglia's character, it will be challenging. It endorses the housing target proposed by the Standing Conference of East Anglian Local Authorities--SCEALA--of some 9,900 additional dwellings a year as the starting point for the plan, monitor, manage approach to housing provision. It also recognises the importance of an active rural economy and of the region's many market towns. These themes will be further developed in the Rural White Paper.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para4">The RPG reflects our emphasis on the integration of transport and development. It confirms that the A47 Thorney Bypass and the two remaining schemes to complete the dualling of the A11 to Norwich, have been added to the targeted programme of Trunk Road improvements. As set out in Transport 2010, the Government's 10-year plan for transport, DETR will be looking to speed up scheme preparation significantly.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para5">The Cambridge Sub-Region is central to the guidance. It meets the needs for a more sustainable approach to accommodating development to support the growth of the research and technology-based economy. It proposes a sequential approach looking first at the capacity of Cambridge, then possible urban extensions, then a new settlement, then at the area's market towns, always considering brownfield land first. It accepts the panel's recommendation for a review of the Cambridge Green Belt. This work is currently being carried out by the local authorities.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para6">The East Anglia RPG shows how the new arrangements for RPG are working to deliver regionally based strategies which will meet development needs and contribute to achieving sustainable development. It is for the local authorities to reflect the policies of the RPG in their development plans and to work with the private sector and other agencies to see those policies implemented.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w09.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Burgon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions when the draft statutory Guidance to the Environment Agency on the regulation of radioactive discharges into the environment from nuclear licensed sites, referred to in the UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges consultation document, will be issued for public consultation; and what its contents are.  [140495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government have today published a consultation paper setting out our proposals for Statutory Guidance to the Environment Agency. It brings together and publicises, for the first time, the factors that we require the Environment Agency to consider when setting discharge levels.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para8">The draft guidance reinforces the Government's commitment progressively to cut discharges and discharge limits. It will help deliver the commitment the UK has given to its OSPAR partners to ensure that by 2020, discharges are reduced to levels where the additional concentrations in the marine environment above historic levels, resulting from such discharges, are close to zero.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para9">The guidance will help ensure that discharge authorisations are consistent with the UK Strategy for Radioactive Discharges 2001-20, which is now being finalised following public consultation earlier this year.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para10">Central to the guidance is the need to ensure the protection of the public, not only within the UK but beyond our borders. For example, the guidance proposes that, in general, discharge levels are set so that Community Food Intervention Levels are not exceeded, even though there is no requirement to do so under law.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para11">Equally, none of the measures taken to protect the environment should compromise the safety of workers, and this is also covered in the guidance, in terms of both routine exposures and risks of accidents.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para12">Keeping radioactive waste to a minimum must be the key to reducing discharges. While the industry works to achieve this, we are asking the Agency to evaluate alternative ways of making allowable discharges so that the best practicable environmental option can be chosen.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para13">Each case will be considered on its merits but the presumption now will be that discharges should be minimised by requiring radioactivity to be trapped and immobilised for subsequent storage or treatment, rather than discharged into the environment.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para14">The guidance will encourage operators to keep their discharges to a minimum by setting strict limits on how much they can discharge. These limits will be subject to regular review. We also propose that there should be a "cap" on discharges from new plant.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para15">The guidance recognises that it is not necessary to apply a specific limit to every radionuclide which is discharged, but effective control over all discharges is essential. The Agency is therefore given guidance on which radionuclides, as a minimum, it should control.
<P>

<a name="01123w09.html_para16">New technology will play a vital role in reducing discharges. With this in mind the draft guidance requires the Agency to set timescales for research and development to be carried out into new technological developments.

<P>
<a name="01123w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The Home Department assumed responsibility for asylum support costs on 1 April 1999 as a result of the comprehensive spending review. These costs were previously the responsibility of the Department of Social Security and Department of Health. Their combined direct expenditure for supporting asylum seekers in 1997-98 was &#163;375 million and in 1998-99 was &#163;475 million. These figures include costs for supporting unaccompanied asylum seeking children.
<P>

<a name="01123w10.html_para1">Expenditure by the Immigration and Nationality Directorate for asylum support from 1 April 2000 to 30 September 2000 was &#163;317.4 million. For the financial year 2000-01, the Home Office has a provisional allocation of &#163;604 million for supporting asylum seekers, excluding provision for supporting unaccompanied asylum seeking children.
<P>

<a name="01123w10.html_para2">The comparable cost in 1999-2000 to the Home Office budget of supporting asylum seekers in the United Kingdom was &#163;537 million.

Kingdom. Work is at an advanced stage to enable this network to be connected to the Internet, providing better internal links within the Home Office and the potential for communicating electronically with IND's customers when suitable interfaces are developed. This network provides the platform on which increasingly sophisticated functionality is being built. The most important example of this is the database of information on asylum claimants which is used to monitor the progress of asylum cases. IND's private sector partners, Siemens Business Services, have provided these enhancements while at the same time continuing the development of their fully integrated caseworking system which will use the same platform. In addition, over 3,000 staff in IND now have access to the Home Office-wide desktop IT system, POISE, provided by SEMA Group--an increase of 2,200 in the last 12 months, extending availability to the majority of immigration service staff at ports and enforcement offices. A major operational system for the National Asylum Support Service has been developed and implemented in the last year on the POISE platform. Work continues on redevelopment of the Warnings Index. A new electronic fingerprinting database is being rolled out and will soon be fully operational. The IND website has been improved and will be relaunched shortly.

<a name="01123w11.html_para4">The Queen hopes to travel within the United Kingdom as widely as possible during the summer months of May to July, and especially the weeks running up to and following the Bank Holiday weekend. She has agreed to visit the armed forces on 27 June and to open the Commonwealth Games in Manchester on 25 July and to close them on 4 August. She will undertake a Commonwealth visit in the autumn. The Queen has also agreed to a grant of certain civic honours--city status and Lord Mayoralty--to mark Her Jubilee. Other elements of the programme will be announced in due course. It is Her Majesty's express wish that there should be no undue expenditure from public funds on the programme of celebrations.
<P>

<a name="01123w11.html_para5">The Queen has said that she sees her Golden Jubilee as an opportunity to express her thanks for the support and loyalty she has enjoyed during her reign. She hopes that events surrounding the Jubilee will create numerous opportunities for voluntary and community service and that as many people as possible will have the opportunity to enjoy the celebrations to mark this happy occasion.

 <i>[holding answer 25 October 2000]:</i> All parties involved in the future development of Crystal Palace are working towards a centre which meets the needs of the local residents and some of our world class athletes, within realistic funding parameters.
<P>

<a name="01123w11.html_para6">Sport England are in the process of looking at a number of options for developing the centre as a Community/ English Institute of Sport facility. The proposed development would provide high performance training facilities and support services for world class athletes in the south of London, and also provide recreational facilities for the local community in Bromley and surrounding areas.
<P>

<a name="01123w11.html_para7">It is anticipated that once the proposed options for the development of the site have been considered by Sport England in conjunction with the relevant national governing bodies, a meeting will be arranged with relevant parties to discuss the proposals and a possible way forward.

Additionally, I gather that there has been some flood damage to the Brooklands Motor Museum's Film Collection although it is not clear that this resulted from the recent severe weather.
<P>

<a name="01123w11.html_para8">Elsewhere, although there have been reports of the effects of flooding on the fixtures and fabric of museum and library buildings, collections seem to have been protected by good and quick-thinking management. This is to the enormous credit of all concerned.

 My right hon. Friend and I meet regularly with DCMS Ministers and discuss a wide range of issues including the Government's Sport Strategy. These discussions include the aspiration that schools should provide two hours of physical activity a week. The meetings are backed up by a comprehensive set of arrangements involving a wide range of partners in the educational and sports sectors, to advise on the implementation of the Sports Strategy. A group considering education issues is meeting monthly and will put proposals to both Secretaries of State in December. In September, the Prime Minister also announced further major investment in sport. &#163;750 million of Lottery funding will be targeted at refurbishing PE and sports facilities in over 1,500 schools and outdoor adventure facilities. In conjunction with this, the Schools Sports Co-ordinators scheme will be expanded to 1,000 co-ordinators in communities of greatest need, based in families of primary and secondary schools, and 150 Specialist Sports Colleges will be established by 2004 to provide the lead in innovative practice, and to work with partner secondary and primary schools to share good practice and raise standards.

 By helping unemployed people gain the skills and experience they need to find work, the Government's welfare-to-work programmes are playing a crucial role in helping disadvantaged areas. Training is available for those who need it through the New Deals and, for those aged 25 and over, through work-based learning for adults. In the most deprived areas of the

<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w13.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Employment Service strategy for engaging ethnic minority jobseekers and businesses in New Deal includes an action plan which is reviewed every six months with units of delivery in all areas.
<P>

<a name="01123w13.html_para1">Evidence from the reviews shows that the Employment Service are increasingly working in partnership with those representing ethnic minority groups to draw into New Deal those jobless people who are currently outside the system. Young people from ethnic minorities do better on New Deal compared to previous programmes and the general labour market. However, the numbers of those moving into unsubsidised jobs on leaving New Deal is 8 percentage points lower for young people from ethnic minority communities.
<P>

<a name="01123w13.html_para2">The Employment Service, with the help of New Deal Task Force's Ethnic Minority Advisory Group and the Black Training and Enterprise Group, has created an improvement plan focusing on areas where changes are needed.

<a name="01123w13.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The New Deal for young unemployed people applies to those aged 18-24. New Deal starts with an initial Gateway phase when an individual has had six months of unemployment. Latest figures show that in October 2000 there were 36,500 18 to 24-year-olds who had been claimant unemployed for six months or more. When the New Deal came into force nationally, in April 1998, there were 119,369 18 to 24-year-olds unemployed for six months or more.

<a name="01123w13.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Local education authorities and schools have a duty to meet children's special educational needs, including those of children with autistic spectrum disorders. Provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders is made in a range of settings from autism specialist to mainstream schools. A recent survey by the National Autistic Society of one thousand of its members found that 73 per cent. of parents were satisfied with the education their child was receiving. My Department continues to work closely with the society and others to bring about further improvement.

 The Government strongly recommend, in guidance for school caterers on implementing national nutritional standards for school lunches published on 15 November, that drinking milk is available as an option every day. Where milk is provided, it must be free to all pupils whose parents are in receipt of Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance. All other drinking milk must be charged for. We encourage local education authorities to participate in the European Union's school milk subsidy scheme. Although the level of subsidy is being reduced from 95 per cent. to 75 per cent. from 1 January 2001, my Department, along with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Department of Health, are pleased to be providing &#163;1.5 million a year in England to make up the funding shortfall. This measure will ensure that no additional costs fall to local education authorities or parents.

<a name="01123w14.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Value for money is the prime consideration in any decision to support a school's PFI project. Local authorities assess value for money by comparing the cost, in net present value terms, of the PFI scheme against what would be the assessed cost of a similar public sector project that would achieve the same outcomes. This assessment is done at the outline business case stage before the Project Review Group approves the project, and also confirmed at the full business case stage before the contract is signed.

When the 80 per cent. discount was introduced a small number of learning providers used the lack of a cap on the amount of public subsidy available for this discount to their advantage, finding ways to divert the moneys available into paying for very expensive courses.

However those candidates exempted from the tests need to produce a portfolio of evidence demonstrating that they can apply and select the skills in order to achieve the full key skill.

<P>

<a name="01123w16.html_para1">The Women's Unit is publishing the above report on secondary data analysis of the British Social Attitudes (BSA) survey series (1983-1998) and the Young People's Attitudes survey (1994 and 1998).

<a name="01123w16.html_para2">The report provides invaluable, comprehensive information about women's attitudes, tracking continuity and change over time wherever the data allow this. It shows the impact of age, occupation, education, income level and motherhood on women's attitudes across a range of issues.

<a name="01123w16.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 As a result of our economic and active labour market policies, the number of people aged 25 and over unemployed for 2 years or more has fallen by 63 per cent. since May 1997 and long-term unemployment 



<P>
<P><I>23 Nov 2000 : Column: 312W</I><P>
among 18-24 year olds has fallen by 72 per cent. But there is still more to be done. The New Deals are a key part of our efforts to tackle long-term unemployment; innovation and flexibility are embedded in them. From April 2001 we will be introducing an enhanced New Deal for those aged 25 and over, which will be much more flexible to ensure that we can address the barriers faced by each individual. Alongside this new programme, we are also testing further radical approaches--for example Employment Zones, with their personal job accounts, and Job Action Teams which provide very tightly focused extra help for the most disadvantaged neighbourhoods.
<P>

<a name="01123w16.html_para4">We are also making a major investment to harness new technology to improve access to jobs information for all unemployed people. We have already introduced a new national telephone service, which enables people to access all the jobs on the Employment Service database, all for the price of a local call. We are introducing new touch screen terminals into Jobcentres. All Employment Service vacancies are already on the Internet, and early in 2001 we will be launching a new "Learning and Work Bank" Internet portal, which will link these vacancies to careers information and details of learning and training opportunities. At the same time we are setting up 700 UK online centres to bring internet access into disadvantaged communities.

<P>

 Tackling long-term unemployment is a key priority for this Government, and we are already making significant inroads: 2-year-plus unemployment among those aged 25 and over is down 63 per cent. since May 1997 and in the same period long-term (over 6 months) unemployment among 18-24 year olds has fallen by 72 per cent.
<P>

<a name="01123w16.html_para5">From April 2001 we are putting in place an even more intensive range of support for adult unemployed people, which will begin on the first day of registered unemployment and increase in intensity in proportion to the individual's labour market disadvantage. This help includes supported jobsearch, training for people with serious basic skills needs and those lacking soft skills, occupational work-based training and work trials with employers. An enhanced New Deal 25-plus will provide high quality intensive help for people unemployed for eighteen months or more.

Benefits other than any tax-free lump sum must be taken as pension income which will be subject to income tax in the normal way.

<a name="01123w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Chancellor announced in this year's pre-Budget Report that the Government will further explore how the landfill tax credit scheme can be reformed, to ensure that the resources can be better used to increase recycling rates, particularly of household waste. We will be considering a range of options for reform in the run-up to Budget 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01123w18.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Any impact of landfill tax credits on council tax precepts should be minimal. Operators of landfill sites who are registered for landfill tax may claim tax credits for contributions that they make to support environmental projects. Under the landfill tax environmental bodies credit scheme, it is the landfill site operator who determines which projects to support. Although local authorities may be involved in such projects, they should have no direct control over the expenditure of environmental bodies and therefore will be unable to assume that funding will be forthcoming for the purposes of setting their budgets. It is possible, however, that a local authority may decide not to incur discretionary expenditure on an environmental project if it learns that that project has received alternative funding through an environmental body funded by landfill tax credits.

 EEC Regulation 1408/71 co-ordinates the social security systems of member states. These rules ensure that people covered by the scope of the regulation do not suffer undue loss of Social Security benefits if they move from one member state to another. The regulations prevent discrimination on grounds of nationality; they provide that contributions made in one member state may be taken into account when calculating benefit entitlement in another; and they stipulate which state is responsible for the payment of benefits.
<P>

<a name="01123w19.html_para0">Contributory benefits are generally paid by the state in which the person last worked and paid contributions. For non-contributory benefits, the general rule is that these are provided by the state where the person habitually resides in accordance with the legislation of that state.

 High Court judges, when on circuit, will normally stay in judges' lodgings close to their court. For those in the other specified categories, a night subsistence allowance is payable for sittings undertaken away from the office holder's principal court or tribunal. Circuit and district judges do not normally require overnight accommodation, as they are usually assigned to articular courts within reasonable travelling distance. However, they may receive expenses for being asked to sit elsewhere. No precise limit of distance or travelling time within which it would be considered reasonable for a judge to take hotel accommodation rather than return home has been prescribed.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what the arrangements are for overnight accommodation allowances and provision for <i>(a)</i> High Court and <i>(b)</i> circuit judges, when hearing cases away from home on circuit; and if he will make a statement.  [139412]<P>

<a name="01123w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 When sitting on circuit, High Court judges normally stay in lodgings which are provided by the Lord Chancellor's Department. They do not receive any allowances as the costs are borne directly by the Lord Chancellor's Department. Circuit judges who have to stay away from home overnight are entitled to allowances for accommodation expenses. On occasion, under arrangements made on a particular circuit, circuit judges may be accommodated in judges' lodgings, in which case no allowances are payable.
