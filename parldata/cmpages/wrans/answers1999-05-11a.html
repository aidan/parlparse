<a name="90511w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many extended sentences have been passed on <i>(a)</i> sexual offenders and <i>(b)</i> violent offenders under the provisions of section 58 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998.  [83346]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90511w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Section 58 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 was implemented on 30 September 1998. Provisional information taken from the Home Office Court Proceedings Database indicates that no extended sentences were imposed in the last three months of 1998. This is not surprising as the provisions apply only to offences committed after the commencement date, and therefore, few cases would have concluded in 1998. Data for 1999 are not yet available.

<P>

<P>
<a name="90511w01.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 To date, we are aware of three Sex Offender Orders having been granted. No information is held centrally to indicate the number of Sex Offender Orders which have been applied for.

<a name="90511w01.htm_spnew2"><B> Kate Hoey: </B> 
 The Commissioner of the Metropolitan police has provided a comparison between the 31 March 1999 budgeted manpower target levels and actual strengths. It should be noted that the target figures may be varied during any year by the Metropolitan police's Policy Board and this will change the number of vacancies at any one time. Vacancies are filled by recruitment and selection processes.

<P>
<a name="90511w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 I am advised by the Police Information Technology Organisation (PITO) that the majority of forces have access to either the X.400 Messaging Service, available on the Police National Network (PNN), or the Internet Mail System. All forces can also access the PNN Telephony Service and the Packet Data Service (X.25) which provides access to the Police National Computer. Internal data communication systems within individual forces vary in size and sophistication.

 Arrangements are underway for the United Kingdom to ratify the European Union Corruption Convention in September this year. The Convention does not give rise to the need for legislation in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="90511w01.htm_para0">Alleged offences of active or passive corruption of the kind referred to in Articles 2 and 6 of the European Union Corruption Convention are investigated primarily by the police whose role is to investigate offences which are committed within United Kingdom jurisdiction. Prosecutions are carried out by the usual prosecuting authorities, which in the main will be the Crown Prosecution Service. These procedures will continue in force following the ratification of the European Union Corruption Convention.

<a name="90511w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Each year, the Home Office makes available to the Animal Procedures Committee a budget to sponsor work aimed at developing or promoting the use of alternatives (which replace animal use, reduce the number of animals used in particular procedures or refine the protocols involved to minimise suffering). Work aimed at improving the environmental conditions in which laboratory animals are kept and transported is also sponsored.
<P>

<a name="90511w02.htm_para1">In developing replacement alternatives, animals do sometimes have to be used to produce comparative data that can be used to assess and validate the alternative. Reduction and refinement alternatives will still use animals, but will use fewer animals or cause less suffering to those animals.
<P>

<a name="90511w02.htm_para2">Of a total budget of &#163;259,000 for 1998-99, &#163;63,000 was allocated to programmes that involve the use of animals. In each case, the aim of the work was the development of reduction, refinement or replacement alternatives.

<a name="90511w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Marjorie Mowlam: </B> 
 I have today published the NI Executive NDPB 1998 Report (CM 4334) which has been laid before both Houses. This is the first report covering the activities of all Northern Ireland Executive NDPBs with the exception of those which are the responsibility of the NIO, which are covered in the recently published Executive Non-Departmental Public Bodies 1998 Report (Command Number 4157). These reports demonstrate the Government's policy of making public bodies more efficient, transparent and accountable.




<P>
<P><I>11 May 1999 : Column: 78</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90511w02.htm_para4">The Northern Ireland Executive NDPB 1998 Report brings together performance and trend data on the 40 Executive NDPBs sponsored by Northern Ireland Civil Service Departments. Between them these NDPBs have expenditure budgets amounting to &#163;1.3 billion and employ almost 24,000 staff. They provide a range of important services to the public in Northern Ireland and it is appropriate that their performance is reported upon in the same way as for large executive NDPBs in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="90511w02.htm_para5">The individual entries covering key performance measures and business summary data show that some NDPBs are performing well in terms of meeting stretching performance targets and delivering more efficient and effective services. There are some areas of weakness however: not all NDPBs have adequate performance measures in place and, in particular, proper measures of efficiency. While many of the bodies are small both in terms of staff numbers and the amount of taxpayers' money they receive, it is important that all should develop measures of performance and efficiency which demonstrate how well they are working for the community they serve. I trust that the publication of this report will encourage all NDPBs in Northern Ireland to address shortcomings in performance measurement and consider initiatives to secure improvements in overall performance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will investigate the reasons for New Deal for Young People participants who joined in July 1998 still being in the Gateway six months later; and if he will make a statement.  [82738]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90511w02.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 There have been a number of factors contributing to young people staying on the Gateway for longer than four months. In the majority of cases young people have had significant breaks from New Deal or are the subject of sanctions. Reasons for breaks include sickness and short-term employment; if a young person leaves the Gateway and subsequently returns within 13 weeks, they re-enter the Gateway at the point at which they left. Young people who are the subject of sanctions are currently classified as being on the Gateway.
<P>

<a name="90511w02.htm_para6">We have taken a concerted series of initiatives with New Deal Personal Advisers and partner organisations designed to reduce further the number of young people staying more than four months on the Gateway, when this is not due to breaks in their participation. We will also be using the provision announced in the budget to pilot more intensive Gateway measures and to enable the fourth month of Gateway to focus more sharply on a job or option-outcome.

 <i>[holding answer 10 May 1999]:</i> Pay awards will vary according to individual circumstances, and will depend on a headteacher's position on the existing pay spine and whether the school will move to a higher range on the new pay spine when its weighted pupil numbers are recalculated in the restructuring. The figure of 9.5 per cent. which has been quoted represents the average increase payable to the 2,970 headteachers of small primary schools with fewer than 100 pupils.

KPMG were appointed to draw up specifications for this work and also advise on the case for contracting out the ICT, Finance and Personnel Services.

The functions of the Ethnic Minority Achievement Service will transfer to the contractor on 1 April 2000 by which time the LEA will have reorganised this service to take account of the fact that most of the funding for extra teaching support now goes directly to schools.

 <i>[holding answer 10 May 1999]:</i> The Environmental Impact Assessment Report and the independent study commissioned by the Swiss government in respect of the Ilisu project in Turkey are not our documents and can be made available only with the consent of the owners. I understand that it is the intention to make available the Environmental Impact Assessment Report once the contract has been awarded, and I will ensure that a copy is placed in the Library of the House. Minutes of ECGD meetings are not disclosed for reasons of commercial confidentiality.
<P>

<a name="90511w04.htm_para5">Consistent with the Government's policy on the environment, the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) is supporting multilateral moves in the OECD to establish common principles, to be adopted by Export Credit Agencies, to take account of environmental factors in export credits. ECGD takes account of environmental factors, particularly in its assessment of large project finance cases, and is undertaking further work, in consultation with environmental consultants and its customers, to determine the best means of further enhancing its policy and procedures, and of raising the awareness of UK exporters, investors and overseas buyers on its approach to environmental issues. Relevant documents will be placed in the Library of the House when this process is complete. It would be premature for me to make a statement at this point in time.

 There are no plans to introduce levies in the United Kingdom on blank tapes, other recording media or recording equipment, nor do we have any plans to restrict the "time-shifting" exception in UK copyright law which allows home recording of broadcasts to enable viewing or listening at a more convenient time.
<P>

<a name="90511w05.htm_para3">An amendment proposed by the European Parliament to the draft EU Directive on copyright and related rights in the information society would require that right owners receive "fair compensation" where exceptions to rights are provided in national law permitting private copying of protected material on audio or audiovisual recording media. However, we do not consider that a levy or other form of payment would be justified in relation to the UK's limited "time-shifting" exception. We are concerned that the overall approach to exception in the Directive is too prescriptive and we will continue to press for more flexibility for member states in this area.

 The proposed statutory protection from liability in damages for the Financial Services Authority and its staff for actions carried out in good faith takes forward the existing form of immunity for regulators under the Financial Services Act 1986, the Banking Act 1987 and the Bank of England Act 1998.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 2 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>642</i>, on pensions, what large financial penalties 



<P>
<P><I>11 May 1999 : Column: 89</I><P>
are currently incurred by members moving from an occupational pension scheme; and how a pooled pension investment could be used to reduce these.  [83706]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90511w05.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 People who leave defined benefit occupational pension schemes in mid-career get paid up rights or transfer values which, depending on the terms of the scheme, are often worth appreciably less than the pension rights their period of service would have earned at normal retirement age. Those who leave a job after a short period often get nothing.
<P>

<a name="90511w05.htm_para4">In contrast, defined contribution pension schemes of all kinds provide individual investors with their own defined pension fund, allowing them to move jobs without these financial penalties. Pooled pension investments will be a particularly transparent vehicle for defined contribution schemes.

<P>
<a name="90511w05.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 There are no plans to change the CAT standards, or the tax treatment of CAT standard ISAs. To date, around 400 providers have registered as ISA managers. I expect many of these to sell stocks and shares ISAs which invest in managed funds.

 The Treasury press release of 1 October 1998 explained the meaning of CAT standards. The Inland Revenue and the Financial Services Authority have both published guides to ISAs which explain CAT standards, as did the Government's ISA advertising campaign. In addition, FSA requires firms which sell CAT standard products to provide straightforward information in the marketing literature which sets out how the standards are met. Many firms' own ISA guides also explain CAT standards.

 Persons registered for landfill tax may claim tax credits of 90 per cent. against contributions made to approved environmental bodies, up to a total of 20 per cent. of their annual tax liability, in each 'contribution year'. Credits claimed under the environmental bodies credit scheme since the introduction of the tax on 1 October 1996 to 31 March 1999 amount 



<P>
<P><I>11 May 1999 : Column: 90</I><P>
to &#163;141 million. In the same period, total landfill tax revenue gross of claims to environmental bodies credits was &#163;1.1 billion, giving rise to a maximum credit that could have been claimed of &#163;220 million. Therefore, some 64 per cent. of available credits have been taken up.

 The exemption from VAT on supplies to export houses is an optional measure in EC VAT law and we have very scant information about other countries' use of the measure.

 A new over-arching budget line, B7-612 entitled "Preparatory actions undertaken through non- governmental organisations (NGOs) in the campaign against child discrimination" is included in the 1999 EU budget.

It will also cover co-financing with NGOs which are members of the European Network on Street Children Worldwide.

 The Government want to move to as early an announcement as possible of a date for the switch-over from analogue to digital television transmissions. However, this can be done only on the basis of a properly considered strategy set against the background of actual digital services winning public acceptance, and which protects those consumers who wish to receive free-to-air television services as well as those who are potentially excluded from the new technology. The Government expect to say more about the development of a strategy for analogue to digital migration before the Summer recess.

 The level of the licence fee for colour and black and white television sets will be determined until 2001-02 under a five year formula linked to RPI announced in December 1996. The review panel chaired by Gavyn Davies is considering, against an expectation that the licence fee will remain the principal source of funding for public services for the BBC Charter period to 2006, ways in which funding to support public service output can be extended from other sources. The review will report by the end of July 1999 and the Government will then consult on its findings.

 The Government remain satisfied that lawyers will be prepared to undertake meritorious cases under conditional fee agreements. With the ability, potentially, to double their fees, they can continue to be expected to take on cases which, in their professional opinion, are more likely to have a successful outcome than not. It can be in no one's interest for weak cases to be pursued, especially as the protection in costs afforded by legal aid can force defendants with good defences to offer settlements in the face of what are little more than blackmailing claims.

 We will monitor and evaluate the impact of all of the key reforms under the Access to Justice Bill, not just the decision to withdraw legal aid from most personal injury cases. The Legal Services Commission will have a duty to inform itself about the need for services, the provision of services, and the quality of the services provided. Much of this information will be provided by the Regional Legal Services Committees. In addition, we are in discussion with all the major interest groups, including those representing the consumers, the professions, and the insurance industry, about the design of a research project to evaluate all aspects of how conditional fees operate under the reformed law.

 The Review concluded that the Public Record Office had greatly benefited from agency status and that it continued to perform an essential function of government. It recommended that the Public Record Office remain a Government Department and an executive agency. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Lord Chancellor have accepted these conclusions.
<P>

<a name="90511w09.htm_para0">The Review also recommended a fresh look at some elements of the Public Record Office's work and the exploration of further opportunities for private sector involvement. These recommendations were, where appropriate, carried forward within the Public Record Office's Comprehensive Spending Review and implemented.
<P>

<a name="90511w09.htm_para1">The Public Record Office is now well placed to lead essential changes in the introduction of electronic record keeping in government and the provision of on-line services for the public. It is also leading on improving records management and storage across government. Its education programme is being expanded, particularly in the direction of internet services to benefit schools and lifelong learners nationally.
<P>

<a name="90511w09.htm_para2">In the light of the Review recommendations and of the Comprehensive Spending Review, a new framework document has now been prepared to cover the next five years. This concludes the final stage of the Office's Quinquennial Review.

 The selection procedure for membership of the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) is carried out in accordance with the Commissioner for Public Appointments Unit's "Guide on Public Appointments Procedure". This document is publicly available and a copy is in the Library.
<P>

<a name="90511w10.htm_para1">In selecting applicants, our aim is to produce a committee with a range of scientific and technical expertise that will equip ACRE to deal effectively with its wider remit and the regulatory challenges ahead. In particular we are looking for expertise in the fields of genetics, molecular biology, microbiology, plant breeding, entomology, farmland ecology, wildlife/ biodiversity, agronomy and farming practice. Candidates needed to be acknowledged experts in their fields and be able to contribute effectively at ACRE meetings.
<P>

<a name="90511w10.htm_para2">As advertisement was placed in the national press inviting anyone with suitable qualifications or experience to apply. In addition, my officials invited stakeholders to come forward with nominations. All those replying were sent a full application package and all those who subsequently applied were considered by an independent selection panel.
<P>

<a name="90511w10.htm_para3">Other Government Departments involved in the procedure are the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Health and Safety Executive, Scottish Office, Welsh Office and the Department of the Environment (Northern Ireland). The appointments are made by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions acting jointly with Ministers in these Departments.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has <i>(a)</i> for the reduction of speed limits on country lanes and in villages and <i>(b)</i> to introduce a network of rural roads on which pedestrians, cyclists and horseriders will have priority over motorists.  [83184]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90511w11.htm_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The contribution speed limits can make in effectively managing speed on rural roads is one of the issues being considered within the current speed policy review. Local authorities will soon have the power to make 20mph limits/zones without the consent of the Secretary of State. The new legislation is likely to come into force later this month provided Parliament approves. Evidence suggests these limits are successful only in conjunction with measures that encourage the driver to slow down.
<P>

<a name="90511w11.htm_para0">That aside, there is much that can be done within existing legislation and using proven techniques to protect walkers, cyclists and horseriders from the worst excesses of traffic on minor country roads. The Department is working with the Countryside Agency's Countryside Traffic Management Group to develop good practice guidance on rural traffic management designed with sensitivity to the countryside environment.

<a name="90511w11.htm_wqn4"><B> Mr. Snape: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what representations he has received from the travel industry about the practice by airlines of separately listing the passenger service charge on air passenger tickets; what assessment he has made of the impact of the practice on the level of airfares; and if he will make a statement. [R] [83470]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90511w11.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We have received a number of representations on this issue, both from private individuals and from representatives of the travel industry, including the Guild of Business Travel Agents, the Institute of Travel Management, and the Association of British Travel Agents. I am examining, together with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, whether showing PSC as a tax may be in contravention of legislation on misleading price indications and trade descriptions. The Office of Fair Trading has written to the International Air Transport Association (IATA) about possible effects of separating out PSC and showing it as a tax in the context of the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1994, and has asked IATA to cease representing PSC as a new tax.
<P>

<a name="90511w11.htm_para1">Our general policy is to allow air fare levels to be determined by the market place wherever possible. However, before approving the separating out of PSC, the Civil Aviation Authority sought undertakings from British Airways (BA), the only UK airline with sufficient market share to enable it to bring market power to bear on fares, about the effect on fare levels. BA agreed to reduce its lowest fully flexible fare on such routes by the amount of the PSC, thus leaving the fare paid by the passenger unchanged. Within the EU, fares are governed by EC law. Nonetheless, on a number of intra-EU routes BA has undertaken to keep the total amount paid by passengers unaffected by the separation of the PSC. I understand that these undertakings have now been put into effect.

 The Minority Ethnic Liaison Officer works on a part-time, fixed-term contract as a member of the Department's Senior Management Structure.

 GCHQ's Communications- Electronics Security Group (CESG) offer IT security courses which are designed to match the stated training and awareness needs of government departments and other customers. CESG is the government expert on cryptography and can be approached by official departments should advice be needed.
<P>

<a name="90511w12.htm_para11">CESG is a technical authority and its courses make no specific recommendations about personal data as such. The actual type and degree of protection to be afforded to personal data, along with all forms of data handled by the government, is determined by relevant legislation and Cabinet Office guidance. CESG is currently working with CITU and other departments to provide design consultancy and design services that can help protect personal data in the context of modernising government.
<P>

<a name="90511w12.htm_para12">It is current policy that any personal data held or processed by the intelligence agencies, in accordance with their respective functions set out in the Intelligence Services Act 1994, are exempt from the relevant provisions of the Data Protection Act 1984 in order to safeguard national security.

 Since last July's Integrated Transport White Paper, which set targets for the introduction of green transport plans for Government Departments, we have completed a draft plan covering the FCO's UK estate. This covers all headquarters and main building, as well as other key buildings to which the White Paper's March 2000 target applies. The plan will be finalised shortly.

 The United States Base on Ascension is provided free from rent and charges to the US Space Command under the terms of the Agreement between the UK and US Governments Concerning the Extension of the Bahamas Long Range Proving Ground by the Establishment of Additional Sites in Ascension Island signed in 1956, as amended.
<P>

<a name="90511w13.htm_para0">Wideawake Airfield, which forms part of the US Base, is a key link in the RAF airbridge to the Falkland Islands. We are currently negotiating with the US Government to allow the use of Wideawake by civil charter flights. If these negotiations are successful this will improve access to both Ascension and St. Helena, some 700 miles away.

 Exercise Mono Prix 97-98, which took place in Kenya from 29 March to 27 April 1997, involved 140 personnel of No.2 Company 1 Irish Guards. No other personnel were involved. This exercise was designed to enable these personnel to gain extensive and realistic training experience, including live firing and jungle training, in a demanding environment, and I understand that these objectives were achieved. Records for the cost of this exercise are no longer held but the cost of the similar exercise in 1998 was &#163;49K.

 Exercise Strong Resolve, which took place in March 1998 jointly in Norway and in Portugal, and which involved some 50,000 military personnel, consisted of two halves; exercise Crisis South, in Norway, and exercise Crisis South, in Portugal. The pre-training to exercise Crisis South involved a combat enhancement phase which took part in France. The aim of exercise Strong Resolve was to exercise NATO's ability to cope with multiple, simultaneous crises in separate geographic regions, drawing on the resources of

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 1999]:</i> Exercise Strong Resolve, which took place in March 1998 jointly in Norway and in Portugal, consisted of two halves; exercise Crisis North, in Norway, and exercise Crisis South, in Portugal. Some 25,000 personnel were deployed on exercise Crisis South, the total cost of which is not held centrally by NATO. The cost of the UK participation was &#163;80k, excluding the costs of ammunition and spares consumed during the exercise as these costs are not separately identifiable.

 80 personnel from C(Gurkha) Company, 2 PARA trained with the French armed forces during Exercise Quickstep which was held in France from 8 to 16 September 1997.

 Exercise Cossack Steppe 97, which took place in the Ukraine between 13 to 21 September 1997, involved personnel from the armed forces of Poland, the Ukraine and the UK. The aim of the exercise was to test the ability of non-aligned forces to operate jointly, and I understand that the exercise fulfilled this aim. The total cost of the exercise is not available, but the cost of the UK contribution, 140 personnel from 2 PARA, was &#163;39K. This cost excludes the cost of movement by RAF transport aircraft to and from the Ukraine, as these figures are no longer available, and also excludes the costs of ammunition and spares consumed during the exercise, as these costs are not separately identified.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90511w14.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The turbulence associated with the refurbishment of the Ministry of Defence's main building in Whitehall has made it impracticable to introduce green transport plans for MoD buildings in London. Work involved in their production would inevitably be largely nugatory.
<P>

<a name="90511w14.htm_para1">In view of these practical difficulties and the fact that the majority of staff working London buildings use public transport to commute to work, we have decided that the Department's most immediate contribution to reducing vehicle emissions and energy consumption would be achieved by concentrating on more efficient fleet management. This particular emphasis is also more consistent with our approach to green transport plans as part of wider Environmental Management Systems. A switch to ultra-low sulphur diesel for all our wheeled vehicles is already underway and should reduce exhaust emissions in the utility fleet by up to 30 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90511w14.htm_para2">Outside London, a draft green transport action plan has been prepared for MoD's Abbey Wood site. Work on green transport plans for other sites is due to start once analysis has been completed of pilot surveys on commuting and duty travel which were recently conducted at three representative MoD sites.
<P>

<a name="90511w14.htm_para3">In conclusion, I must emphasis that MoD is not only a department of state but, as demonstrated by the events in Kosovo, also an operational headquarters which must be able to function around the clock and at times when public transport is not an option. Undoubtedly, this adds a further layer of difficulty to the production of green transport plans.

 The Benefit Integrity Project (BIP) came to an end on the 31 March 1999.

A complete list of those groups exempted from the operation of the Project is listed. No estimate has been made of the number who may have been contacted in error by the Project, however, safeguards were put in place to reduce such a possibility to a minimum.

<a name="90511w15.htm_spnew14"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Entitlement to help with prescription charges is based on the principle that those who can afford to contribute should do so. People likely to have the greatest difficulty in paying charges, for example children under 16, people over 60 and those on low income do get their prescriptions free. These arrangements ensure that no one need be deterred from obtaining necessary medication for financial reasons. The current prescription charge exemption arrangements were reviewed as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review. We noted that there was no consensus on what additional conditions might be included in any revised list of medical exemptions, or how distinctions could be drawn between one condition and another.
<P>

<a name="90511w15.htm_para0">For these, and other reasons, we concluded that all current prescription charge exemptions would be protected for the rest of this Parliament. We also decided that prescription charges would rise by no more than the rate of inflation over the next three years.

<P>
<a name="90511w16.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The rate of employers national insurance will be reduced by 0.5 per cent. from April 2000. This will have the effect of reducing the national insurance bill for hospital and community health services by approximately &#163;38 million. The reduction in employers national insurance rates is intended to compensate for the climate change levy announced in the budget. The overall effect of these two policies on the National Health Service is expected to be broadly cost neutral.

NHS trusts are also benefiting from a wide range of bidding exercises, handled through health authorities and the regional offices of the NHS Executive, to fund specially targeted initiatives as part of the Government's commitment to improve services and modernise the NHS.

 The Department and the Medicines Control Agency have evaluated the Posner Report together with all available evidence on the safety of human insulin. The independent advisory body to Government, the Committee on Safety of Medicines, has also fully reviewed the safety of human insulin on several occasions since its introduction, taking into account patient experiences of the effects of human insulin. The Committee has concluded that although some patients have experienced problems on transferring to human insulins and are better suited to animal insulins, there is no evidence of a safety problem specific to human insulin.
