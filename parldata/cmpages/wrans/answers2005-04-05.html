<a name="50405w01.html_dpthd0"><h3 align=center>TREASURY</h3>

<a name="50405w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Airport Passenger Duty</h3>





<p><a name="50405w01.html_wqn0"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the effect of Airport Passenger Duty on passenger numbers; and what assessment he has made of the merits of adjusting the level of such duty.  [224018]</p>








<p><a name="50405w01.html_spnew0"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 HM Customs and Excise analysis indicates that the price elasticity of demand for changes in Air Passenger Duty (APD) duty rates is low, and air travel has proven relatively unresponsive to changes in price. My right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced a freeze on air passenger duty for the year ahead in his recent Budget report. The Chancellor takes into account a range of social, economic and environmental considerations, including the effects of APD on passenger numbers, when setting levels of taxation.

<a name="50405w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Bereavement Grants</h3>





<p><a name="50405w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his answer of 4 March 2005, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1402W, on bereavement grants, whether occupational pension schemes are permitted to pay a non-taxable bereavement grant voluntarily on the death of a pensioner member aged over 75.  [224677]</p>








<p><a name="50405w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 Under the current pension tax regime an occupational pension scheme can make a tax-free lump sum payment on a pensioner member&#039;s death of up to &#163;2,500. There is no age limit on when this payment can be made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w01.html_para0">
From 6 April 2006, under the new simplified pension tax regime schemes can continue to pay lump sums on the death of a pensioner member unless the member is aged 75 or over when they die. In these cases survivors benefits must be paid in the form of income. Existing rights to a tax-free lump sum on death at age 75 or over on 6 April next year will be protected. Details are contained in the Inland Revenue Pensions Tax Simplification Technical Note that was published on 16 February 2004.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) if he will instruct the Economic Secretary to the Treasury to provide substantive answers to Questions concerning decennial censuses after consulting the Registrar General;  [224047]

<p>(2) whether Treasury Ministers have used their powers under section 2(1) of the Census Act 1920 to control and direct the Registrar General since 1990;  [224048]





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Apr 2005 : Column 1312W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>


</p>



<p>(3) whether the necessary permission to retain the <i>(a)</i> 1981 and <i>(b)</i> 1991 census records for England and Wales in the Office for National Statistics once they are over 30-years-old has already been granted by the Lord Chancellor.  [224049]</p>








<p><a name="50405w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 I am the Minister responsible for the population census. Day-to-day responsibility rests with the Registrar General, who is also the National Statistician.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w01.html_para1">
All Parliamentary questions to the Chancellor of the Exchequer are answered substantively. It has been the practice of successive Administrations for many years to delegate questions concerning the census to the Registrar General for answer by letter. All such letter answers are printed in the <i>Official Report</i>.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w01.html_para2">
The Registrar General undertakes his functions under section 2(1) of the Census Act 1920 and of any Census Order or Regulations made under the 1920 Act. His powers to carry out the census are subject to the control of, and in compliance with, any Ministerial direction by virtue of Section 2(2) of the 1920 Act. The Registrar General has regular meetings with the relevant Minister to discuss census-related issues. The Government&#039;s proposals for the 2001 Census were published in a White Paper (&quot;The 2001 Census of Population&quot;, Cm 4253) in March 1999. Parliamentary authority for the 2001 Census was subsequently given by virtue of the Census Order 2000 (SI 2000/744), the Census Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/1473), the Census (Amendment) Order 2000 (SI 2000/3249), and the Census (Amendment) Regulations 2000 (SI 2000/3351).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w01.html_para3">
I understand that no application has yet been made by the Registrar General to the Lord Chancellor, under the provisions of section 3(4) of the Public Records Act 1958, for him to retain the records from the 1981 or 1991 Censuses once they are over 30-years-old.

<a name="50405w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Child Benefit</h3>





<p><a name="50405w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what rationale underlies his policy of not means-testing for receipt of child benefit.  [223923]</p>








<p><a name="50405w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Timms </b> 
<i>[holding answer 4 April 2005]:</i> Child benefit is payable to every family in the UK in respect of each child. The Government believe it is right that society should recognise the importance of family life by providing financial support for every family with a dependent child.
</p>

<p><a name="50405w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Willetts: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assumptions of long-term employment rates for <i>(a)</i> men and <i>(b)</i> women underpin the Treasury&#039;s published figures on long-term fiscal trends.  [224669]</p>








<p><a name="50405w01.html_spnew4"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 As required by the &quot;Code for Fiscal Stability&quot;, the Treasury publishes illustrative long- term fiscal projections as part of the Economic and Fiscal Strategy Report (EFSR). The long-term 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Apr 2005 : Column 1313W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
macroeconomic assumptions are stated in Annex A of the EFSR. Regarding long-term employment rates, Annex A of the 2005 EFSR states that:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;By assumption, employment is driven entirely by demographic trends. Specifically, with the overall employment rate assumed to remain constant from 2009&#150;10 onwards, changes in employment levels reflect changes in the working-age population&quot; (Budget 2005, page 178).</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w01.html_para4">
No specific assumptions regarding the future evolution of male and female employment rates are made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w01.html_para5">
In addition to the illustrative long-term fiscal projections, the Treasury also publishes the Long-term Public Finance Report (LTPFR) alongside the pre-Budget report. The baseline results of the 2004 LTPFR are also based on the assumption of an unchanged total employment rate beyond the medium term. In addition, the 2004 LTPFR (pages 33&#150;37) presents results based on an alternative approach to projecting employment trends.
</p>






<a name="50405w01.html_sbhd5"><h3 align=center>Environmental Taxes</h3>





<p><a name="50405w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Watts: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the impact of environmental taxes <i>(a)</i> on manufacturing industries&#039; competitiveness and <i>(b)</i> energy prices.  [224017]</p>








<p><a name="50405w01.html_spnew5"><b> John Healey: </b> 
 The Government assesses the impact of environmental taxes against a range of social, economic and environmental factors, including impacts on competitiveness and energy prices, in the annual Budget process. As part of this, the Government have published an independent evaluation by Cambridge Econometrics of the climate change levy. This considers the environmental impact of the levy as well as its impact on the economy and energy prices. Copies are available from the House of Commons Library or the Customs and Excise website.

<p><a name="50405w03.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 Full implementation of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) is vital for peace in the whole of Sudan, including Darfur. However, the full benefits of a peace dividend for Sudan, including progress on debt relief, will not be realised until the conflict in Darfur is resolved. We are therefore pressing the parties in Darfur to negotiate a political settlement, consistent with the CPA.

<p><a name="50405w03.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mullin: </b> 
 We regularly discuss with both the Government of Sudan and the rebels the importance of access for all non-governmental organisations throughout Darfur. Our Ambassador raised this matter with the Government on 21 March and I discussed this with the Secretary General of the Sudanese Liberation Movement on 22 March. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary secured access for human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, in August 2004. Lack of security is the key factor hampering access throughout Darfur. We have made it clear to the Government and the rebels that they must abide by their commitments under Abuja humanitarian and security protocols and improve the situation in Darfur.

<p><a name="50405w05.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Rammell: </b> 
 We closely monitor the political situation in the Middle East. The fall of Saddam Hussein&#039;s regime removed the threat he posed to Iraq&#039;s neighbours.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w05.html_para1">
For Syria, the conflict gave rise to the movement of numbers of Iraqis across Syria&#039;s borders. There is evidence that some Syrian extremists have travelled to Iraq to take part in the insurgency. Syria appears to be the principal route for insurgents entering Iraq and continues to support former Iraqi regime elements who are based in Syria. We have repeatedly raised our concerns about these issues with the Syrian Government, and will continue to do so.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w05.html_para2">
For Iran, the removal of Saddam&#039;s Government has created an opportunity to re-establish Iran/Iraq relations on a more positive footing. A stable and prosperous Iraq is in the best interests of Iran as well as the wider region. We have encouraged Iran to play a constructive role and to support Iraqi efforts to preserve security. We have made clear our concern at the alleged links between elements of the Iranian regime and armed groups in Iraq who have sought to undermine the rule of law.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w05.html_para3">
For Jordan, the conflict gave rise to the movement of numbers of Iraqis across Jordan&#039;s borders. Since the conflict ended, Jordan has provided political support and practical assistance to Iraq.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w05.html_para4">
The conflict has had less direct effect on Israel and Palestine, although a source of funds for some Palestinian groups has dried up with the removal of Saddam Hussein. In recent months the Israeli and Palestinian focus has been directed internally towards the Palestinian elections and disengagement.

<p>

Successful elections were held in Iraq on 30 January. The formation of a democratically elected Iraqi Government should have a further positive impact on stability in the region.

And we will continue to press the EU to incorporate the principles of the EU Strategic Partnership with the Mediterranean and the Middle East as it develops its relations with other countries in the region.

However a sale, not in the class above, made to a member of the public, even if in wholesale quantities, will become a licensable activity under the 2003 Act when it is fully operational. A premises licence would therefore be required for the premises where the alcohol is stored prior to despatch if any of the alcohol is to be dispatched to the public, whether or not the business space was rented. In addition under the 2003 Act no supply of alcohol, in retail or wholesale quantities to the public, may be made unless it is made or authorised by a person who holds a personal licence.

<p><a name="50405w08.html_spnew10"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 It is for individual schools to decide how best to make provision for children with autism. The Special Educational Needs (SEN) Code of Practice advises schools and local education authorities (LEAs) that children&#039;s needs should be assessed individually and that provision should address the particular needs of the individual child. It gives advice to schools on making provision for children with SEN, including those with autism.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w08.html_para3">
The Department for Education and Skills, together with the Department of Health, has issued good practice guidance on making provision for children with autistic spectrum disorders which aims to raise awareness of autism. Nine of the 11 SEN regional partnerships have working groups focusing on improving provision for children with autism in their areas, using the good practice guidance. The regional partnerships have also been producing other autism guidance, including guidance on delivering the curriculum for children with autism in secondary schools, a transition toolkit for children with autism moving from primary to secondary school, and guidance for learning support assistants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w08.html_para4">
Over recent years many LEAs have used available funding to support in-service training on autism. As part of the Government&#039;s SEN strategy, published last year, the Department is working with the Teacher Training Agency to develop proposals for improving training in relation to SEN, including autism. An inclusion development programme is also being developed to strengthen the evidence base about what works in educating children with autism and build a consensus about how to implement good practice most effectively.

<a name="50405w08.html_para5">
The purpose of the data collection is to inform policy and planning, to study trends and to monitor the outcomes of initiatives and interventions on pupils with different types of SEN, not to classify individuals, or assigning children by type of need.

Also professionals from education and health fields may classify some children differently; and the levels of identification of SEN are varied between local authorities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps she has taken to improve the line of accountability of social services departments placing looked after children out of area since the passage of the Children Act 2004.  [222068]</p>








<p><a name="50405w10.html_spnew2"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 Children&#039;s services authorities are in the process of appointing the directors of children&#039;s services (DCS) and lead members for children&#039;s services required under the Children Act 2004. About 60 authorities report that they have a DCS in place or have appointed one; almost as many have designated a lead member. The director and lead member will improve children&#039;s services authority accountability for the placement of all looked after children by being, respectively, professionally and politically responsible on behalf of the authority for the safety and welfare of such children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w10.html_para0">
Although all members of the authority have a shared responsibility for corporate parenting, the lead member will take the lead in ensuring that looked after children have their interests protected, their opportunities maximised, their educational achievement enhanced and their care shaped to meet their needs. Draft statutory guidance, on which we have consulted and which will be published shortly, states explicitly that the lead member should take the local political lead in all corporate parenting issues. The 2004 Act also introduces a new duty on local authorities to promote the educational achievement of looked after children.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w10.html_para1">
The Department is currently conducting a review of local authority practice in placing looked after children in other local authority areas, with a view to both reducing their dependence on such placements and improving support for children who are placed out of

authority. In the meantime, we have written to local authorities to remind them of the importance of ensuring that looked after children are placed out-of-authority only where their assessed needs clearly justify it, and to review their current practice to ensure that they are meeting their existing statutory responsibilities; taking steps to prevent, wherever possible, children being placed away from home (e.g. by developing an adequate supply of good quality local foster and residential care places); and securing good outcomes for children who are placed out-of-authority.

<p><a name="50405w10.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Gibb: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will describe the synthetic phonics programme in the National Literacy Strategy.  [224328]</p>








<p><a name="50405w10.html_spnew3"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 The National Literacy Strategy, now the Primary National Strategy, places a clear and early emphasis on synthetic phonics instruction, reinforced by complementary reading strategies such as context, grammatical knowledge and word recognition. This is in line with the best available international research.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w10.html_para3">
We have produced structured teaching materials for teachers on synthetic phonics entitled &quot;Progression in Phonics&quot; published in 1999, and &quot;Playing with Sounds&quot;: a supplement to &quot;Progression in Phonics&quot; published in 2004. Copies of these have been placed in the House of Commons Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w10.html_para4">
The approach to the teaching of synthetic phonics advocated by the Primary National Strategy is that children should be taught as quickly as possible to identify, segment and blend phonemes in speech and writing, and that this should be taught directly, and not left to inference or invention. We recommend that synthetic phonics should be taught as a separate set of skills and knowledge within the broader structure of the literacy hour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w10.html_para5">
The Playing with Sounds programme is designed to support the learning and teaching of synthetic phonics for children from the ages of three to six. It begins with developing children&#039;s awareness and discrimination of sounds and supports their progression through segmentation and blending, to an ability to read and spell regular polysyllabic words. The pace at which children are introduced to phonic knowledge through the Playing with Sounds programme is quicker than that set out in the original National Literacy Strategy framework and supports the achievement of the foundation stage early learning goals.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many cues to word recognition are recommended in the Searchlight approach within the National Literacy Strategy; and if she will describe each of these cues.  [224329]</p>








<p><a name="50405w10.html_spnew4"><b> Derek Twigg: </b> 
 The National Literacy Strategy is based on the best international research available and supports the statutory requirements of the National Curriculum. It advocates a model of teaching reading which has come to be known by the &quot;Searchlights&quot; 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Apr 2005 : Column 1344W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
metaphor. The model characterises reading as the ability to coordinate and orchestrate four basic cues. These are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Fast automatic phonic decoding</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The recognition of word and word parts</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Predictions from knowledge of syntax to make sense of strings of words</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Predictions from context to aid comprehension.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w10.html_para6">
The Searchlight model is designed to enable the reader to cross-refer between cues, which support each other. The ability to use this range of cues together makes it less critical if one of them fails on any given occasion. However, we promote phonics as the first and foremost strategy that children employ as they encounter new words.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w10.html_para7">
Phonic decoding and instant recognition of high frequency irregular words are the cues employed at the level of word recognition; grammatical knowledge and understanding of context operate at the level of phrases, sentences and text as a whole. Therefore both aspects of the reading process, decoding and comprehension, are represented in the approach and complement each other.

 Officials in the School Standards Group are responsible for advising the Secretary of State on all aspects of the teaching and learning of literacy in schools. Further details can be obtained from the Civil Service Year Book and the DfES website. In addition, through the National Strategies, we draw on the expertise of a number of practitioners and academics who are constantly responding to and keeping abreast of the latest research. In this capacity Dr. Kevan Collins, Director of the Primary National Strategy, has provided advice to Ministers and officials on the implications of the Clackmannanshire study.
</p>


<p>

Over time our approach to phonics, which is the subject of the Clackmannanshire study, has been informed by a wide range of experts in the field. In 2003 we convened a seminar of all the leading researchers and practitioners working on phonics issues. The findings of this seminar were independently reviewed and used to inform the development of our most recent guidance on phonics &quot;Playing with Sounds: A supplement to Progression in Phonics&quot;.

When testing resumed in 2002, resources were concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds tested immediately after the FMD outbreak was greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, data for 2001 and 2002 is not comparable with other years.

<p><a name="50405w13.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Department has conducted a preliminary study which integrates scientific models developed at the Central Science Laboratory and Reading University to establish the overall costs and benefits of various badger culling options. Further work is needed on the model before we can draw conclusions on policy options. As scientific information is generated from the RBCT and other studies (e.g. Republic of Ireland Four Area Trial), it will be used to inform the assumptions used in the model and so reduce the uncertainty surrounding the results. The model will help inform policy decisions and areas for future research. It is at present not possible to reliably identify infected badgers except by post-mortem examination and laboratory culture.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will assess whether there is a link between an increase in human TB and the spread of bovine TB among cattle.  [224679]</p>








<p><a name="50405w13.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 There is no link between increase in human tuberculosis (TB) and the spread of bovine TB among cattle in the United Kingdom (UK). Human TB is most often caused by <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i> (which is usually acquired from another human) and not by <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i>, the cause of bovine TB, which nowadays is rarely transmitted to man.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w13.html_para1">
Between 20 and 50 (typically 40) people have been diagnosed with bovine TB in the UK annually since 1990, representing 1 per cent. to 1.5 per cent. of culture-confirmed cases of TB in humans. Their geographical distribution does not mirror that of bovine TB in the cattle population. Most cases are attributed to (i) reactivation of old infection contracted prior to widespread pasteurisation of milk, or (ii) infection contracted abroad.

<p><a name="50405w13.html_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Farmers are obliged to register land they intend to use as part of a claim to the Single Payment Scheme (SPS). Such registrations extend the process established under the Integrated Agricultural Control System, through which more than &#163;1.7 million land parcels were registered. Demand for land registrations is unprecedented, with requests from farmers intending to apply for SPS and those seeking to enter into agreements for the Environmental Stewardship Scheme. In the past six months the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has received nearly 25,000 registrations, when it normally expects to receive 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Apr 2005 : Column 1356W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
around 9,000 requests annually. The RPA has increased processing capacity but there is inevitably a current backlog of claims awaiting completion. At the current rate of progress most registrations will be processed by the end of June but some requests, particularly those received close to the 16 May deadline for submitting an SPS application ,might not be processed until August. The RPA is giving priority to those registrations that affect an outstanding scheme payment. Once the current round of applications has been dealt with, it is expected that the situation will stabilise and subsequent applications will be dealt with more quickly.

<p><a name="50405w13.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Just over &#163;1 million has been made available by Defra for setting up the Company and establishing the arrangements for the administration of the Scheme.

<p><a name="50405w13.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 No such assessment has been made. However, we understand that the RSPB is content with the existing arrangement of the feeding of Category 2 and 3 material (i.e. butchers&#039; waste) to wild necrophagous birds and that a derogation to permit the use of ruminant fallen stock as feed material is not, therefore, necessary. Accordingly, the UK has exercised the derogation that permits member states to authorise the feeding of animal by-products which do not contain SRM to birds of prey.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w13.html_para4">
Even when burial was permitted carcases were required to be buried in such a way that carnivorous animals (including necrophagous birds) could not gain access to them. Therefore the effect of the ban on burial is minimal as carcases should not have been left uncovered where birds could have gained access to them.

<p><a name="50405w13.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Department has not made such an assessment. However, the National Fallen Stock Company has analysed the coverage provided by the National Fallen Stock Scheme and concluded there is a reasonable choice of collection services available to farmers in most areas. The Company has said that under most circumstances it would expect carcases to be collected within 48 hours following notification and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Apr 2005 : Column 1357W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
since the Scheme began the Company has only received just over 200 complaints about delays in collection out of around 60,000 pick ups nationally.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w13.html_para5">
However, within this encouraging assessment, the Company has acknowledged that there are particular problems with service provision in North Wales and some other localised areas including the Isle of Wight where the only Scheme collector has left the Scheme. The Company is taking action to address these difficulties with the co-operation of the fallen stock collection industry and other relevant parties.

Defra has committed &#163;5 million in year one, &#163;3 million in year two and &#163;2 million in year three. There is equivalent funding from the Devolved Administrations, which, along with the Defra contribution, will amount to &#163;10 million in the first year for the UK as a whole.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action <i>(a)</i> has been taken in the past two years and <i>(b)</i> is being taken to prevent bacterial discharge into the sea at Sewerby near Bridlington; and if she will make a statement.  [224115]</p>








<p><a name="50405w15.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Morley </b> 
<i>[holding answer 4 April 2005]:</i> Since 2003 investigations have been under way into the impact of the discharge made by Munton&#039;s plc into the short sea outfall pipe at Sewerby. These have shown that there are no discharges of human sewage into the outfall, which is owned by the East Riding of Yorkshire council. The indicator organisms found in the discharge are present in the raw materials (grain) brought to the site and the malting process carried out there provides the humid, dark conditions which encourage multiplication.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w15.html_para0">
Following discussions between the company, the Environment Agency and the council, it has been agreed that additional treatment, by way of a reed bed system, should be provided to reduce bacterial concentrations and provide storage to balance flows. Discharge of effluent would also be limited to when there is sufficient dilution at the outlet to prevent visual nuisance.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs which countries are refusing to allow British beef to be imported; and for what reasons.  [216567]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Apr 2005 : Column 1364W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="50405w15.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Following is a list of 84 countries which we understand still impose a ban on the import of British beef. The situation in a further 27 countries has still to be confirmed. In addition there is continuing dialogue between the EU and Egypt on recently revised Egyptian import conditions. The reasons cited for the bans are animal and public health related.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w15.html_para1">
However, we consider that these bans are not justified in the light of science and the BSE controls applied in the UK. Currently, beef exports can only take place under the stringent conditions of the Date-based Export Scheme, which complies fully with EU and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) rules and guidance.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w15.html_para2">
We are currently working with the European Commission for recognition that, like most other EU member states, the UK is now a moderate (rather than high) risk country according to current OIE rules. We are also working with the Commission with a view to lifting the ban on the export of beef from UK cattle born after July 1996 as soon as possible after the over-30-month rule is replaced by testing and these cattle can be sold for human consumption in the UK.

<p><a name="50405w21.html_spnew2"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 The Financial Assistance Scheme is intended to provide those hardest hit by pension scheme wind-ups with assistance funded by the taxpayer. To ensure that the resources provided by the taxpayer are used most effectively, and to keep administration simple and cost-effective, the Financial Assistance Scheme will adopt a single simple set of rules, based on the most common features of occupational pension schemes, rather than attempting to replicate each particular feature of each individual eligible scheme. According to the Occupational Pension Schemes 2000 survey by the Government Actuary&#039;s Department, around 2/3 of active members of private sector defined benefit schemes have a retirement age of 65.

Interim figures can be derived by comparing administrative claimant count with entitlement figures derived from the Policy Simulation Model, based on the 2002&#150;03 Family Resources Survey.

Guarantee element take-up estimates thus formed can be roughly validated by comparison with existing minimum income guarantee entitlement and take-up estimates. However, in the case of savings credit this is not possible. It is thought that take-up for those on both guarantee and savings credit is to the order of 80 per cent. Similarly it is thought that around half of individuals entitled to savings credit only are taking up their entitlement, although there is no way of validating these results.

<a name="50405w23.html_para6">
Following a successful public trial, national roll out of the scheme began in October 2003 with the aim that by 2005 a majority of plastic card transactions should be Chip and PIN. The Chip and PIN programme announced in January that it reached all its 2004 targets for the roll out with customer research demonstrating that 71 per cent. of cardholders expect their next transaction to be Chip and PIN and 45 per cent. now using it for all or most of their card payments.

It is currently too early to assess the effects of Chip and PIN in preventing credit card fraud. The impact of Chip and PIN on card fraud is expected to be seen early in 2005 and hence will first be reflected in the APACS mid-year card fraud figures to June 2005, which will be available in the summer.

<i>[holding answer 16 March 2005]:</i> The Government works with the police and industry to tackle fraud and other online crime through a number of initiatives. A key factor in dealing with online fraud is prevention and education and the Government takes an active role in educating computer users about the risks of fraud committed through the internet. The Home Office website provides advice on avoiding internet fraud and the Home Office has also created, and maintains the &#039;e-tailing mini site&#039;, which forms part of the crime reduction website.

The Home Office is represented on an industry-led Steering Group which aims to tackle &#039;Card Not Present&#039; (CNP) fraud (which includes fraud over the internet). We support practical measures being introduced by the industry to increase levels of security for internet transactions. These include Address Verification Services (AVS) and Card Security Code (CSC), which inform merchants&#039; decisions on whether to proceed with an order. AVS/CSC can provide immediate results, with APACS reporting that some merchants have reduced their fraud levels by up to 80 per cent. Card schemes MasterCard and Visa have also introduced the 3D Secure system, known as MasterCard Secure Code or Verified by Visa, which requires password verification for internet transactions. The work of the CNP Steering Group has also led to the production of a manual (Spot and Stop Card Fraud Retailer Pack) which aims to educate merchants on the dangers of CNP fraud and the steps which can be taken to prevent it.

The sanction detection rate fell after 1999 but then stabilised at around 19 per cent. between 2001&#150;02 and 2003&#150;04.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w26.html_para7">
The Government have made clear their desire to raise performance in this area. It has set a goal of achieving a sanction detection rate of 25 per cent. by 2007&#150;08. To achieve that improvement, a major drive has been under way to both raise rates and also to address unacceptable variations in detections performance between forces. This includes ensuring that forces prioritise and maximise investigative outcomes and that officers and other police staff have the best training and the right skills to improve the proportion of offences brought to justice.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w26.html_para8">
Provisional data for 2004&#150;05 indicate that improvements are now being achieved and the sanction detection rate has improved in each of the last 10 months.

 It would incur a disproportionate cost to approach all country offices, to identify and list all projects in Africa directly or indirectly funded by DFID to support economic diversification.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w28.html_para2">
DFID&#039;s general approach to promoting economic growth covers: creating and maintaining a conducive investment environment for all types of businesses&#151;large and small, foreign and domestic, urban and rural; promoting trade and business linkages; providing broad access to assets and markets, especially for poor people and reducing insecurity and vulnerability, for instance through social protection schemes. Many DFID programmes in African countries incorporate projects which address one or more of these and therefore contribute to diversifying economic activity.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w28.html_para3">
In the case of Malawi, the greatest impediment to economic diversification and growth in recent years has been macroeconomic instability and the very high interest rates resulting from the previous Government&#039;s poor economic management. This led to a collapse in investment. Economic management has improved markedly since the May 2004 elections. In recognition of this, DFID is providing poverty reduction budget support (&#163;15 million in 2004&#150;05) to the new Government to enable it to stabilise the economy and bring interest rates down while continuing to provide essential services. There has been encouraging progress since the elections and there are good prospects for a new International Monetary Fund programme during 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w28.html_para4">
In addition to budget support, DFID supported several specific growth-related projects in Malawi. These include the Financial Services Project, which is jointly funded, by DFID (&#163;3 million) and the US Agency for International Development (US$2.1 million). It uses the Opportunity International Bank of Malawi to expand financial services to poor Malawians and small and medium-sized enterprises. Another financial services project is run by Concern Universal, and aims to develop methods of providing loans to poor Malawians on a fully sustainable basis. The project works only in rural Malawi, and seeks to support micro and small enterprises, and to provide new opportunities for trading and agro-processing businesses. DFID is also fully funding the reconstruction of the Rivirivi railway bridge, which was washed away by floods in 2003. This will

In February 2005 the World Food Programme (WFP) distributed food for 1.6 million beneficiaries from a target of 2 million in Darfur (80 per cent.). The shortfall was due to security, access and logistics difficulties, though it is a significant improvement on the January distribution figures of 1.2 million from a 1.8 million target (66 per cent.).

Nutrition levels continue to be a concern across Darfur and the picture is mixed. According to UNICEF there is growing evidence that the nutritional situation in select parts of Darfur is improving. The agency stated that admissions to therapeutic feeding centres have stabilised and decreased in most locations, indicating a potential decrease in the global acute malnutrition rate. However, in South Darfur, feeding centres run by Action Contra la Faim and Medicines Sans Frontiers (MSF) in Kalma Camp are operating at maximum capacity and the WFP has advised its partners to continue blanket supplementary feeding to improve children&#039;s nutrition. Meanwhile, World Vision continues to report high admission rates in Mershing, Manawashi and Duma feeding centres. In North Darfur an MSF rapid health and nutrition assessment of 330 children in Dali camp indicated that 10.7 per cent. were moderately malnourished and 0.9 per cent. severely malnourished.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the source was of the asbestos which was recently discovered in soil and water tests at Crosshill Quarry, Crumlin, County Antrim.  [221617]</p>








<p><a name="50405w30.html_spnew0"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 In the recent soil survey of the Crossbill Quarry site no asbestos fibres were detected in 38 out of 40 samples. Of the other two, only chrysotile (white asbestos) fibres were detected. These fibres are of a type used in insulation materials such as heating pipes, calorifers, hot water tanks and cavity walls.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w30.html_para0">
The analysis of water samples collected by my Department&#039;s staff recently from, and in the vicinity of, the Crossbill Quarry site were analysed for the presence of asbestos by Brunel University, Uxbridge. The analysis determined that there were amphibole asbestos fibres present. Amphibole is the generic term used to describe five different types of asbestos fibres (excluding chrysotile) and would not be uncommon in landfill sites used for the disposal of builders&#039; rubble. The levels of asbestos fibres in the water were considerably less than the limit set by the USA Environmental Protection Agency for drinking water.
</p>


<p>

However, while the fibre types have been identified in both the soil and water samples, it is not possible to be conclusive about the exact source of the asbestos in these samples.

 Each of the Health and Social Services Boards have recognised the need to increase the level of emotional and psychological support for diabetes sufferers in their local implementation plans and are taking steps to address gaps in service provision. While such support may be provided by various professionals, it is recognised that clinical psychologists have a key role. However, there is currently a limited availability of trained psychologists and the Regional Diabetes Steering Group will consider how this issue can be addressed.

All of these advisory groups are closely linked to the commissioning team that is responsible for the development of services for people with diabetes in each board.

 The Pharmaceutical Contractors&#039; Committee and the General Practice Committee of the BMA (NI) were consulted about the clarification, effective from 1 October 2004, of the rules in the NI Drug Tariff under which it is appropriate for pharmacists to be paid Multiple Dispensing fees.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w30.html_para3">
As this was a clarification of existing policy, and not a change in policy, a formal equality impact assessment was not considered necessary.

<p><a name="50405w30.html_spnew8"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 The commissioning of specific health and social care services in Northern Ireland, including publicly funded fertility services, is a matter for the Health and Social Services Boards. In their capacity as commissioners, Boards may decide to test the provision of services against private sector providers, although they are not compelled to do so. It is only when a decision is made to test the market that procurement requirements apply and the tendering process is initiated.

<p><a name="50405w33.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Spellar: </b> 
 The range of services provided by women&#039;s organisations is extensive and impacts primarily on disadvantaged communities. These services can be broadly broken down into three areas:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">i. Core activities&#151;community development and support to women on a range of matters.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">ii. Childcare&#151;early years provision day care.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">iii. Education and training&#151;often supported directly by child care provision, and aimed at building skills and confidence among women who have been out of education and/or the labour market for a significant time.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w33.html_para1">
Short-term funding of &#163;1.1 million has been made available to a number of women&#039;s organisations that are facing financial difficulties to enable them to continue to provide key services over the next six months period. This will allow them to continue to provide valuable services on which many people in their communities depend while alternative longer-term funding from a variety of Government Departments and agencies is considered.

<p><a name="50405w38.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 In December 1997, the Department launched the CALM (Campaign Against Living Miserably) telephone helpline in Manchester in response to the high rate of suicide and depression among young men aged 15 to 35 years old. The Department provides core funding for CALM, with local funding provided by local health and social care agencies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w38.html_para5">
The CALM initiative is aimed at raising awareness of depression amongst 15 to 35-year-old men and encouraging them to seek help. As part of this work, CALM provides a specialist national freephone mental 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>5 Apr 2005 : Column 1449W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
health helpline for young men with feelings of depression that offers confidential information, advice, referrals and telephone counselling from specially trained professional advisers. While the campaign is targeted at young men, all callers will receive the same basic service, regardless of gender, age, culture or sexual orientation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w38.html_para6">
CALM&#039;s services are focused on Manchester, Merseyside and Bedfordshire and callers to the helpline from these areas will receive, in addition to the help and support already mentioned for all callers, information about local services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w38.html_para7">
CALM&#039;s helpline is available from 5 pm to 3 am seven days a week, 365 days a year. When the service is closed, callers receive a message that provides details of opening hours and the telephone number for the Samaritans, should the caller wish to speak with someone urgently.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w38.html_para8">
The CALM helpline receives an average of 8,000 &#039;interactive&#039; calls every year, often long and in-depth. The average call time is 18 minutes. The helpline also receives many thousands of silent calls where the caller was not willing to talk.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how the Home Office and his Department work together in developing public information publicising the risks of developing schizophrenia from cannabis use aimed at <i>(a)</i> early age users, <i>(b)</i> carers, <i>(c)</i> chronic users and <i>(d)</i> professionals.

<p><a name="50405w41.html_spnew4"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The Department and the Home Office work closely together in publicising the health risks of all illegal drugs, including cannabis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50405w41.html_para2">
Both Departments, supported by the Department for Education and Skills, fund and manage the FRANK campaign, which informs young people and their parents, carers and families about the effects and risks of taking illicit drugs. The risks associated with cannabis use, including mental health illness, are documented. A FRANK information pack for practitioners, &quot;Communicating the health risks of cannabis use&quot;, was developed and approved by both Departments and published in 2004. Included is material that focuses specifically on young non-users, light users and those contemplating use. It also includes materials aimed at heavy chronic users. They draw attention to the important mental health risks of cannabis, including the risk that use can trigger serious mental health problems and that there is concern that people who use cannabis a lot when they are young may be vulnerable to mental health problems later in life. These will continue to be updated in the light of emerging evidence. Materials aimed specifically at cannabis users with mental health problems, their carers and the professionals who work with them are currently in development by the Home Office and the Department following consultation with key stakeholders.

<p><a name="50405w41.html_spnew5"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 This information is not held centrally. The complex nature of the delivery of stroke services means that we are unable to monitor expenditure. It is for primary care trusts, in partnership with strategic health authorities and other local stakeholders, to determine how best to use their funds locally to meet national priorities for stroke services.
