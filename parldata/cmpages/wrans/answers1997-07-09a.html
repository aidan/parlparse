To ask the President of the Council if she will list the names of those who have resigned from the Privy Council since 1967, indicating the reasons they have given. [6481]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Ann Taylor: </B> 
 Since 1967, Mr. John Stonehouse and Mr. Jonathan Aitken have asked for their names to be removed from the list of Privy Counsellors. In both cases, the reasons given were personal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Ann Taylor: </B> 
 The yellow Demand Form lists only titles which are held in stock in the Vote Office. Stocks of publications from the Council of Europe are not held but copies may be ordered through the Vote Office by use of the green Demand Form. Reference copies of many such publications are held in the House of Commons Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many complaints <i>(a)</i> his Department and <i>(b)</i> electoral registration offices received from those whose names did not appear on registration lists for the last General Election; and if he will make a statement. [6020]

<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 July 1997]:</i> <i>(a)</i> We have received around 400 complaints about non-registration for the last General Election. <i>(b)</i> Information on the number of complaints received by electoral registration officers is not compiled centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Barnes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the number of homeless people who fail to qualify for electoral registration because of the residence requirement; and if he will make a statement. [6013]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Howarth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 July 1997]:</i> Information on the number of homeless people who are not included on the electoral register is not available. The guidance issued to electoral registration officers makes it clear that no one should be denied the right to register simply because they are homeless. Although an elector must be registered at an address at which he or she is resident, that address need not be a conventional one.

<a name="70709w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if category A prisoners will be housed in Altcourse Prison. [7046]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Joyce Quin: </B> 
 It is planned that Altcourse prison, Liverpool, will house up to 25 category A prisoners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_wqn6"><B> Ms Kelly: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many persistent young offenders in Bolton, West he estimates will be affected by the Government's plans for fast-track punishment. [6474]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 It is not possible to give an estimate of how many persistent young offenders in Bolton, West will be affected by the Government's commitment to halving the time between arrest and sentence for persistent young offenders. We are taking early action to encourage all youth agencies to deal with cases more speedily and will be monitoring progress in achieving this aim.
<P>

<a name="70709w01.html_para0">We also believe that certainty and speed of outcome will send a clear message which will help deter some youngsters from offending. We are also encouraging the police and local authorities together to assess accurately the level of crime and disorder affecting the public in their area as a basis for a strategic partnership. It is hoped that this will provide a more accurate assessment of youth crime than basing a local estimate on an extrapolation from national averages.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Rendel: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to expand the number of non-custodial schemes to divert convicted youths from further crime. [5544]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 July 1997]:</i> It is the Government's policy to "nip things in the bud" with young offenders. For example, we have signalled an intention that offenders will be punished by ending the practice of repeat police cautions, introducing a new Final Warning which will trigger effective intervention by the new locally based Youth Offender Teams.




<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 1997 : Column: 467</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70709w01.html_para1">We will require the police and local authorities to identify local problems of crime and disorder and to develop a strategy to tackle local problems. This will build on best practice in preventing crime and diverting young offenders from further offending.
<P>

<a name="70709w01.html_para2">We will also introduce reparation orders and a new action plan order and will introduce Youth Offender Teams to plan and supervise community sentences aimed at changing offending behaviour.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he plans to implement Part III of the Police Act 1997. [6926]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We will implement these provisions as quickly as possible, but a number of issues need to be addressed first. In particular, Part III cannot be implemented until a code of practice has been approved by Parliament. I hope to announce shortly the start of a consultation exercise on a draft of the code.

<a name="70709w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Rohypnol</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what evidence he has evaluated of the illegal use of the drug Rohypnol; and what plans he has to warn people of the dangers of this drug. [6920]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Rohypnol (which is the proprietary name for the benzodiazepine drug flunitrazepam) is controlled under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 as a Class C drug. Statistical data on seizures and offenders and on those presenting for treatment do not separately identify Class C drugs, but there is anecdotal evidence of the misuse of flunitrazepam in Scotland and in the London area. There were three police seizures of the drug reported to the Forensic Science Service in 1996 which implies that there is little flunitrazepam misuse in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="70709w01.html_para3">In accordance with a decision by the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs to control flunitrazepam more tightly under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances 1971, we intend bringing forward later this year amendments to the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 1985 to increase the controls on the drug in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="70709w01.html_para4">Government funded publicity campaigns about the risks of drug misuse warn of the dangers associated with the benzodiazepines, such as valium and temazepam, generally. There are no current plans to highlight this particular drug within these campaigns.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to improve the facilities in attendance centres. [6921]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Attendance centres are operated from accommodation rented from local authorities, usually schools, with the centre making use of the facilities available at the location. The Officer in Charge of the centre can apply to the Home Office for funds to purchase additional equipment to ensure that the centre is able to offer a constructive and challenging regime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to review the guidance given to the police on the use of CS gas. [6923]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 We will review guidance to chief officers on the use of CS for dealing with public disorder in the light of any proposals resulting from current consideration of the subject by the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO). Guidance to chief police officers on the use of CS spray for self-defence is issued by ACPO, which keep it under continuous review.

<a name="70709w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment his Department has made of the advantages of a trial use of large print ballot papers and braille templates for elections; and what meetings officials from his Department have held with organisations representing blind and partially sighted people to discuss this issue. [6454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Officials from this Department last met representatives of the Royal National Institute for the blind (RNIB) on 20 March 1997 to discuss proposals to help blind and partially sighted voters to vote in person. RNIB's clear print guidelines, which include advice on the use of large print and the typeface for ballot papers, were circulated by the Home Office to Acting Returning Officers in February. There is no provision in legislation for the use of templates carrying the details of candidates in braille and large print, to be used in conjunction with the ballot paper available to all other voters at the polling station. Further research would be required to test the practical and timetabling implications of such templates and to ensure that they could be used without becoming subject to error or abuse.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will assess the advantages of introducing legislation to increase the penalties for drunken driving and related offences; [6619]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The offence of driving when unfit through drink attracts a maximum penalty of six months' imprisonment or a fine of &#163;5,000 or both, obligatory disqualification and endorsement of the offender's driving licence. Driving with excess alcohol in the blood attracts the same maximum penalty. We have no plans to increase these penalties or the maximum penalties for related offences.

 Local planning authorities were advised in a DoE letter of 17 March 1997 to seek the advice of the Royal Fine Art Commission (RFAC) on development schemes of national or major regional importance. The Royal Fine Art Commission is able to examine about 140 such schemes each year, not all of which have an impact on historic environments. The Royal Fine Art Commission will examine the design quality of a building itself and its impact on its surroundings. Its recommendations have no statutory force but there is a good record of their being adopted.
<P>

<a name="70709w02.html_para2">English Heritage is the Government's statutory adviser on the management of the historic environment in England. Local Authorities are advised in PPG 15 to consult English Heritage on all planning applications for developments affecting the setting of grade I and II* buildings and of grade II buildings in Greater London, and on major applications for development in conservation areas. In order to give advice about the impact of new buildings on their historic environment, English Heritage must take a view on both the quality and the appropriateness of proposed extensions or new buildings. English Heritage saw over 5,000 such applications in 1995-96.

 I understand that the South African Rugby Union own the television rights to the British Lions tour of South Africa. Consequently those rights were not covered by the voluntary code of conduct for the broadcasting of sports events which a number of UK sports organisations have adopted. However, rights to show highlights of the matches were acquired by S4C. The review of listed events will need to assess the effectiveness of the voluntary arrangements for unbundling the various types of broadcasting rights as a substitute form of access to some events.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The Chancellor of the Exchequer has asked me to reply as Director of the Office for National Statistics to your recent question on how many persons under 25 are (a) registered unemployed and (b) have never been employed nationally and in the parliamentary constituency of Stoke-on-Trent North.<i></i><i></i>
<BR>
The measure of unemployment, derived from the quarterly Labour Force Survey (LFS), is defined on a consistent and internationally recognised basis set out by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) and counts as unemployed people who are: a) without a paid job; b) available to start work within the next two weeks and c) have either looked for work in the last four weeks or are waiting to start a job already obtained. However, largely because it is a sample survey, information is not available from the LFS in as much geographical detail as from the claimant count measure described below.
<BR>
ONS also publishes the monthly claimant count, which is based on the administrative system and includes all people claiming unemployment-related benefits (i.e. Jobseekers Allowance, Income Support or National Insurance credits) at Employment Service offices on the day of the monthly count, who on that day had signed on as unemployed and available to do any suitable work. Essentially, all people who attend an Employment Service office to sign are counted, irrespective of whether they are actually receiving benefit.
<BR>
Data for the number of registered unemployed can only be derived from the claimant count. However, the claimant count does not have information on the numbers of people who have never been employed.
<BR>
The data you have requested for Stoke-on-Trent North can only be derived from the claimant count, as the LFS does not give details down to constituency level.
<BR>
The winter 1996/7 LFS shows that there were 1,592,000 people aged 16-24 who have never been employed (other than in casual or holiday jobs) in the United Kingdom. To put this information into context the attached table shows the total breakdown by educational and economic status. For example, you can see that, from the total of 1,592,000 nearly 83 per cent (1,322,000) were economically inactive, that is they had not looked for work in the past four weeks 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>9 Jul 1997 : Column: 475</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>or were neither available to start work in the next two weeks nor waiting to start a job they had already obtained. 1,186,000 of the total were full-time school, college or university students.
<BR>
The claimant count in April 1997 showed that there were 575 claimants under 25 in the Stoke-on-Trent North parliamentary constituency. This compared to a figure of 440,028 claimants under 25 in the United Kingdom in April 1997.

<a name="70709w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The Treasury does not yet hold this data centrally and information on total Government and individual departments' expenditure on tackling drug misuse is not recorded on an annual basis. The Government recognises the importance of greater clarity of information relating to drugs related issues and will therefore be appointing a "drug czar" to co-ordinate action against drugs. The drug czar will be working to the President of the Council as Chair of the Cabinet's co-ordinating committee on drug misuse. One of his or her first tasks will be to review urgently the existing drugs strategy, and put forward proposals for tackling the problem with renewed vigour. This review will include evaluating current Government expenditure.
<P>

<a name="70709w04.html_para0">The most recently available estimates we currently hold were published in the White Paper "Tackling Drugs Together" in May 1995. They show that at least &#163;526 million of expenditure in 1993-94 could be directly attributable to drug programmes and activities across the UK.

<P>
<a name="70709w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 In my earlier reply to my hon. Friend the Member for East Ham (Mr. Timms) on 24 June, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>454-55</i> I undertook to publish information each month about the cases handled by the 24 firms which have most cases to review. These are the firms for which the regulators (the Securities and Investments Board and the Personal Investment Authority) have published targets for completion of case reviews. Below is a table containing the information provided to me by these firms about progress with their casework to end June.
<P>

<a name="70709w04.html_para1">The figures in the table, which are those submitted by the 24 firms themselves, provide a benchmark from which future progress can be measured.
<P>

<a name="70709w04.html_para2">The volume of cases cleared is extremely disappointing. All the firms in the table have a great deal more work to do. Some appear hardly to have begun.
<P>

<a name="70709w04.html_para3">It is now imperative that all firms--not just these 24--which have sold personal pensions should make serious efforts to improve their performance in completing their caseloads. This is not only in the interests of their customers but also of their own reputations with the general public. The regulators will continue to monitor the firms' performance against the targets they have been set.
<P>

<a name="70709w04.html_para4">I will decide once I have seen some further figures to measure progress what further action may be called for.

 There is, in fact, no such requirement. In the county courts, liquidated claims are transferred to the defendant's home court on receipt of a defence. However, the plaintiff may apply for the claim to be returned to a court more convenient to him or her. The Lord Chancellor's Department is undertaking consultation on judicial case management, of which choice of venue is one element. Comments are sought by 26 September 1997.

 International expert discussions on the disposal of surplus US and Russian military plutonium have concluded that the two most promising options are the conversion of plutonium into MOX (mixed oxide of both plutonium and uranium) fuel and its subsequent consumption in nuclear power reactors, and the immobilisation of plutonium through vitrification. The UK was involved in these discussions and supports these conclusions. Future discussions are likely to focus on the most effective means of implementing these disposal options in the US and Russia. The UK will continue to participate fully in international consideration of this issue.

 A copy of the draft Treaty of Amsterdam has been placed in the libraries of the House. The Social provisions, which incorporate the Social Agreement, are on pages 59-66 (Articles 117-120). The changes that have been made to the Social Agreement text are intended to: incorporate elements of the existing Articles 117-120 TEC; replace co-operation with co-decision as the mechanism for consulting the European Parliament when legislation is adopted by QMV; allow the adoption by QMV of measures to encourage co-operation between Member States on combatting social exclusion; slightly broaden the provisions on the equality of men and women.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The minimum quantity of fissile material required for criticality in an underground nuclear repository would be the same as that in any other nuclear facility. This quantity is dependent on a number of factors including the geometry of the fissile material, the presence of moderating materials which reduce the velocity of neutrons, the presence of reflecting materials retaining neutrons within the system, and the presence of materials such as uranium-238, iron, and calcium, which absorb neutrons.
<P>

<a name="70709w06.html_para1">Limits and conditions of authorisation for any repository being developed in the UK would be based on "Guidance on Requirements for Authorisation" which has been issued by the Environment Agencies. This states that a developer would "need to demonstrate that the possibility of a local accumulation of fissile material such 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 1997 : Column: 484</I><P>
as to produce a neutron chain reaction is not a significant concern." This would be achieved by e.g. the establishment of fissile material limits on waste packages, constraints on packaging, provision of backfill and the maintenance of a high pH to suppress the solubility of plutonium.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w06.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 July 1997]:</i> All of the climatically sensitive ice shelves on the Antarctic Peninsula have suffered major disintegration, which is significant and unique within recorded history and results from the fact that summer temperatures now regularly exceed 0&#176;C. Given a continued warming, the ice shelves are predicted to disintegrate further in the coming decades.
<P>

<a name="70709w06.html_para2">The British Antarctic Survey has continuous records which begin in the 1940s and show a warming of 0.5&#176;C per decade in the Antarctic Peninsula. This is interpreted to be a regional effect, and has not been observed to the same extent elsewhere in Antarctica. It will be some time before it can be established whether these observed trends are part of a wider manifestation of global warming.

Taking each question in turn:
<BR>
1. "For what reason civilian staff in the Defence Postal and Courier Service have been replaced by serving military personnel; and how many posts which fell vacant in the past two years were filled by serving military personnel instead of civilian (service retired) personnel?"
<BR>
Overall, no civilian posts falling vacant in the last two years have been filled with military personnel. It is in fact the case that a number of military posts have been filled by civilians.
<BR>
2. "How many disciplinary cases within the Defence Postal and Courier Service have been initiated by military line management against civilian Defence Couriers in each of the past 10 years?"
<BR>
The management of the Defence Courier Service, which is a part of DPCSA, rests with military personnel. As all disciplinary cases are initiated by line management all cases against civilian Defence Couriers have therefore been initiated by military personnel. There have been 25 cases initiated in the past 10 years. The breakdown by year, from available records, is as follows:

1987: 2

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what measures he is taking to reduce the need for low-flying sorties through the use of flight simulators. [6986] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Flight simulators are extensively used in training but at present they can only complement, not replace, actual experience of low flying. We do, however, continue to monitor closely all developments in simulator technology.

<P>
<a name="70709w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I can assure the hon. Member that very close and frequent contact at ministerial level has been and will be maintained with German Defence Ministers on Eurofighter. The Government is determined to secure a four nation commitment to move to the production phase of the Eurofighter programme as soon as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will review the pensions of Ghurka soldiers who have served in the British Army. [7348]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w08.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Pensions paid to ex-British Army Gurkhas are regularly reviewed. Each year both new and existing pensions are increased in line with the rate of inflation in Nepal. This review, which is currently being undertaken, is effective from April each year. In addition to this, and in accordance with our responsibilities under the Tri-Partite Agreement 1947 which links the pensions paid to ex-British Army Gurkhas to pensions paid in the Indian Army, pensions paid to our Gurkhas are reviewed in the light of any changes that the Indian Army may make to ensure that equity of treatment is maintained. The results of the latest 10 year review undertaken by the Indian Government are expected to be announced later this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if the Coal Authority will transfer the cleared Monktonhall Colliery Site to the ownership of Midlothian Council. [6774]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 This is a matter for the Coal Authority. Under Section 3(4) of the Coal Industry Act 1994, it is the duty of the Authority to secure the best terms reasonably available for disposal of the site if a buyer cannot be found to keep the mine operational.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The levels of radioactivity throughout the Irish Sea are routinely monitored by the Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science an executive agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. The most recent report, which is entitled "Radioactivity in Food and the Environment 1995", is available in the Library of the House of Commons. The monitoring undertaken since the early 1960s has not detected any measurable effect on radioactivity levels in the Beaufort's Dyke area, which remain well within internationally agreed safety levels. At the moment I see no need to initiate any additional surveys or a public inquiry.

<a name="70709w08.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Salmond: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will commission the Aberdeen Marine Research Laboratory to conduct an investigation into radiation levels in the Beaufort's Dyke area. [6830]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w08.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science, an executive agency of the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, carried out comprehensive monitoring for levels of radioactivity throughout the Irish Sea. Such monitoring takes place on a regular basis and will continue. Involvement of the Marine Laboratory Aberdeen would therefore not be justified.

<P>

<a name="70709w09.html_para0">In general terms, factors such as battery technology and infrastructure/recharging systems have meant that electric vehicles have not as yet gained customer acceptance due to higher price, inferior performance and range. It is encouraging that industry is responding to this through the development of systems and products such as zinc air batteries which appear to offer improvements in these areas.

 The costs incurred to date by the Environment Agency and its predecessor body, the National Rivers Authority, in promoting an Order to become navigation authority on the Rivers Wye and Lugg are estimated at &#163;400,000 since 1995 when the proposals were first put forward. The total cost of assessing these proposals will not be known until the public inquiry into the application for an Order has closed, but the inspector's fees to date are approximately &#163;19,000. The additional costs of managing the navigation function are unlikely to be significant, but the Agency expects to appoint one additional full time member of staff who would have significant navigation responsibilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w09.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Dry stone walls are an important landscape feature. The main threats to their conservation stem from damage and neglect. To help address this, the Government provides grant assistance for the restoration of dry stone walls under the Countryside Stewardship and Environmentally Sensitive Areas schemes operated by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Local authorities and National Parks also have powers to operate local environmental grant schemes which may include assistance for the management of dry stone walls and local planning authorities have planning powers to control the demolition of dry stone walls in conservation areas. There are a number of such schemes operated by the Peak District and North Yorkshire National Parks, and information on these is provided to the Secretary of State every year in the context of his discussions of the National Park Authorities' Corporate Financial Plans.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w09.html_spnew10"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The latest information on national losses of dry stone walls are derived from a survey of the countryside in 1990 <i>(Countryside Survey 1990: Main Report, DOE, London, 1993).</i> The survey estimated that the total length of dry stone walls in the uplands of Great Britain in 1990 was about 103,000 km and that the overall length of dry stone walls had decreased by about 14 per cent. since 1984. However, due to the sample design used in the survey, there were substantial uncertainties attached 



<P>

to these estimates. The Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions is currently planning a repeat of this survey in 1998.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w10.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 My hon. Friend the Minister of State has received a letter from the Director General of the RSPCA expressing the Society's concerns about the legislation covering the keeping of wolf hybrids. Officials from my Department will be meeting the Society shortly to discuss this issue.
<P>

<a name="70709w10.html_para0">Under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976, a licence is required to keep a wolf or a wolf hybrid where one parent is (or both parents are) of a kind so specified in the schedule to the Act. I appreciate that there are detailed arguments about the make up and characteristics of wolf hybrids and there may be different interpretations of the meaning of "hybrid" and "parent" in the context of the Act. A number of local authorities have sought to clarify the position in the Courts. I am aware that a recent Court ruling has confirmed that a licence is required to keep a wolf hybrid under the Act.
<P>

<a name="70709w10.html_para1">I have no immediate plans to issue new guidance on the Act and the keeping of wolf hybrids, but I will wish to consider whether further guidance is required in the light of detailed consideration of the Court ruling and the RSPCA meeting.

<P>
<a name="70709w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Council house building, in common with private sector house building, has to comply with the Building Regulations which include requirements for the conservation of fuel and power. Strengthened requirements were introduced only two years ago, from July 1995, since when there has been little in the way of council house building. The strengthened requirements should ensure that the annual energy consumption for space and hot water in average new dwellings is 25 per cent. to 35 per cent. lower than before. The requirements represent the minimum compliance level for new housing in England and Wales and my Department is keeping them under review. Local authorities are of course free to apply higher standards in any of their schemes. They and other house builders are encouraged to do so through my Department's Energy Efficiency Best Practice Programme. Local authorities are required by Planning Policy Guidance Note 22 to have regard to renewable energy--including solar energy. Detailed technical guidance is freely available from the DTI and my own Department on how to make the most of this energy source.

 I understand that the Water Regulations Advisory Committee considered the health and safety of the occupants of premises when formulating its proposals for water regulations. Any representations about the scope and substance of these requirements should be made as a response to the consultation document which the Committee issued on 19 June.

[7147]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 The DETR and its Executive Agencies are undertaking systems audits and holding discussions with product and service suppliers to analyse the problem in detail in order to produce costed plans by October 1997. Details of costs, schedules and resources will be determined when these are produced, but the target is to complete essential changes by December 1998. Approximately, the equivalent effort of 14 staff is employed on the projects at this stage, excluding work in contracted service suppliers.
<P>

<a name="70709w10.html_para2">Directors and Agency Chief Executives are responsible for addressing the problem in their businesses and in most cases each has appointed a project manager.

The outstanding debt figures include both long term and short term borrowing. Local authorities provide data on outstanding amounts for temporary debt and investments in the Department's regular monthly and quarterly borrowing and lending inquiries, but information on longer term debt is collected as flows i.e. transactions during the relevant period. The Department conducted special surveys in 1991, 1993 and 1994 seeking information on the amount of outstanding longer term debt and investment. The figure for 1996 has been calculated from information supplied to the Department in the 1994 survey and the regular monthly and quarterly surveys, and may include estimated values.<P>

 The Approved Document for Part M provides guidance on reasonable provision of wheelchair spaces in sports stadia including an acceptance that it would be reasonable to provide a smaller proportion of wheelchair spaces in large stadia. The Department has made no assessment of either the advantages or the disadvantages of modifying Part M of the Building Regulations so as to provide for a smaller proportion of wheelchair spaces in large sports grounds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the differences in the method of operation between GP fundholders and locality commissioning; and when commissioning will be introduced. [6746]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 General practitioner fundholders are allocated a budget with which to purchase for their patients those health services included in the fundholding List of Goods and Services. A range of approaches to commissioning have already begun to develop locally. Details vary, but the usual pattern is that GP practices, (sometimes including fundholders) collaborate with their health authority to plan the local health strategy, determine priorities, and in some cases also commission services for all patients to ensure that all have equal access to high quality health care.
<P>

<a name="70709w11.html_para0">I announced on 26 June a programme to evaluate 20 GP Commissioning Group pilots over 2 years from April 1998, to complement an assessment of the range of existing activity.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list the Labour and Liberal Democrat hon. Members of the current House of Commons and of the House of Lords who have served as members of <i>(a)</i> NHS trusts and <i>(b)</i> health authorities in the past seven years. [6651]<P>

 The Department does not hold all the information on trust and health authority board posts held by current members of the House prior to this Parliament. 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 1997 : Column: 501</I><P>
Current Members of the House of Commons, of whatever party, are disqualified from serving as non-executive members of National Health Service trusts or health authorities. Ten Members of the House of Lords are currently also non-executive members of trust and health authority boards. Of these, one takes the Labour Whip, seven take the Conservative Whip and two sit on the cross benches.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many general and senior managers currently work in the NHS hospital and community health services; and how many of these have direct contact with patients. [6941]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 There were 20,590 whole-time equivalent senior managers and other administrative managers employed by the National Health Service Hospital and Community Health Service at 30 September 1996. Information on how many of these have direct contact with patients is not centrally available. The Government is committed to maximising the proportion of NHS resources devoted to patient care by removing the bureaucratic processes of the internal market and reducing management costs in health authorities and trusts.

(4) when he expects the review of the national distribution of central Government resources to primary and secondary health care to be completed; [7226]

<P>
<a name="70709w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 In 1997-98 an interim needs weighting for Community Health Services was introduced and applied to 11 per cent. of expenditure (leaving 14 per cent. not weighted for need).

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to change the recommended daily intake of vitamin B6 for women; and if he will make a statement. [7243]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w12.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Reference Nutrient Intake is one of several Dietary Reference Values. These estimates of nutritional requirements of healthy people are made by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy. They were last reviewed in 1991 and there are no plans for a further review. The current Reference Nutrient Intake of around 1.5mg/day for vitamin B6 is enough to meet the nutritional needs of virtually all healthy adults. The British National Formulary says that there is little sound evidence for claims that supplements of vitamin B6 can alleviate the premenstrual syndrome.
<P>

<a name="70709w12.html_para0">The Government is acting on the advice of the Food Advisory Committee and Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment to control the sales of vitamin B6 products because of the risk of adverse effects following consumption of supplements at doses of 50mg or above of vitamin B6 The levels of vitamin B6 in dietary supplements will be limited to a daily dose of 10mg.

Products containing higher daily doses will continue to be available as licensed medicinal products, or under the supervision of a pharmacist or doctor.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Patients eligible for National Health Service sight tests, who are unable to attend an optical practice, are eligible for a free domiciliary visit. There were 222,500 domiciliary visits paid for by health authorities in 1995-96.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The Department had never collected any information on numbers of private sight tests and, in 1989, it was Government policy to restrict the amount of information required from the private sector. In 1993 agreement was reached with the optical profession on the introduction of an annual survey of a sample of opticians' workloads, which provides the information on private sight tests currently used to make estimates of the total number of sight tests.

 The level of resources for community care in 1997-98 was announced in February 1997 as part of the local government settlement. That issue is now closed. My right hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Although it is possible to be specific for costs of some courses of drugs in hospital, the wide range of different drug treatments make it impossible to specify an average cost. However, the total cost of all drugs purchased by hospitals was &#163;874,353 million in 1995-96, the latest year for which the data are available.

 The Departments's 1996 publication <i>Promoting Clinical Effectiveness</i> defined clinical effectiveness as the extent to which specific clinical interventions, when deployed in the field for a particular patient of population, do what they are intended to do--that is, maintain and improve health and secure the greatest possible health gain from the available resources. This definition is still used.

<a name="70709w12.html_para1">The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 enables my right hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The current arrangements for keeping the United Kingdom rabies free are contained in the Rabies (Importation of Dogs, Cats and Other Mammals) Order 1974 (as amended). This requires certain rabies susceptible mammals to be quarantined for six months on entry to the UK. In the light of our commitment to do so, we are reviewing whether alternatives to quarantine might give equal or better protection against rabies. The review is taking account of the possibilities of vaccination and microchipping of animals.

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 1997]:</i> It would be difficult to outlaw this trade without affecting other, legitimate trade.

[6976]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Commission Regulation 716/96, under which the Over Thirty Month Scheme (OTMS), operates, requires the remains of cattle slaughtered under the scheme to be incinerated, or rendered and destroyed. This requirement covers the whole of the animal, other than the hide, and the Intervention Board have instigated a system of collecting OTMS blood from scheme abattoirs by means of tanker round. The blood is taken to one of two rendering plants in Great Britain for processing, prior to destruction.
<P>

<a name="70709w13.html_para0">Orkney Islands Council (OIC) have a contract with the intervention board to slaughter OTMS cattle offered to the scheme on Orkney, and to destroy the remains, including the blood, in a newly developed gasification facility. Because of difficulties with the chill facilities at the OIC plant in the first few weeks of June, the Intervention Board arranged for the remains of the OTMS animals slaughtered at the plant, including the blood, to be delivered to the renderer at Kintore in Aberdeenshire for processing.

<a name="70709w13.html_para1">A total of 4.2 tonnes of OTMS blood was collected from the Orkney cull abattoir on three separate occasions in June by the special tanker used to collect OTMS blood from the other participating abattoirs in scotland. This vehicle has a capacity of around 22 tonnes. All the invoices for this work have not yet been received, but it is estimated that the collection service, including ferry crossing, and rendering will cost in the order of &#163;5,000.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Domestic supplies of wild plant seed are obtained from harvesting existing species rich grassland meadows. The Countryside Stewardship scheme expects wild plant seed of local provenance to be used in the re-creation of species rich grassland or the restoration of hay meadows thereby generating a market for the material.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 This Department has no grant scheme that could offer support for the employment of such an adviser. Last October, shortly before the closure in England of the Marketing Development Scheme, the Weald Meadows Initiative sought a grant for a products co-ordinator and a marketing campaign for its wildflower products. This application did not fit well with the scheme criteria, and with strong competition for the limited funds available, it was not successful.

<a name="70709w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The re-creation, restoration and maintenance of unimproved grassland can be grant aided through the Countryside Stewardship scheme. Payments of &#163;85 a hectare per year are available for managing lowland hay meadows together with a supplement of &#163;30 a hectare per year for fields of less than 3 ha in size. Many of the remaining valuable grassland meadows are small in size and the additional payment is in recognition of the 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 1997 : Column: 509</I><P>

A one year supplementary payment is also available (normally for one year but occasionally up to five years) for additional measures to assist with initial grassland management work such as scrub control or spreading hay from species rich grassland to introduce flowers and grasses.

 The United States administration share this Government's wish to see an end to all violence in Northern Ireland and to reach a lasting political settlement which has the broad support of people on both sides of the community. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minster and the President continue to discuss developments in Northern Ireland on a regular basis. We are grateful for the close personal interest that the President has taken, and for the valuable work of Senator George Mitchell in the Talks process.

<a name="70709w14.html_para0">Considerable disorder has followed the Orange Order parade along the Garvaghy Road on Sunday. While recognising the anger felt in the Nationalist community, there can be no justification for the scenes of violence witnessed over the past few days.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about the Benefit Integrity Programme.
<BR>
The Benefit Integrity Project formally commenced on 28 April 1997, the first postal enquiries were issued on 6 May 1997. Starting from the end of July a two year programme will commence to visit some 150,000 Disability Living Allowance recipients at home.
<BR>
The project is due to be completed by 31 March 1999, the findings of which will help to inform decisions about future integrity work. It is estimated that the cost of the project will be &#163;10m a year.

I hope you find this reply helpful.

 Disability Living Allowance is increased every year, by law, by the rate of inflation as measured by the movement in the Retail Prices Index (PRI). The basket of goods used to calculate the RPI includes the cost of petrol as well as other motoring costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans she has to <i>(a)</i> revise the criteria for awarding and <i>(b)</i> increase the amount of moneys available to the social fund. [6969]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Social Fund is made up of two parts; the regulated and discretionary schemes. The regulated scheme is based on rules of entitlement and payments are not cash limited. Discretionary Social Fund payments are made from a national cash limited budget which is allocated to individual Benefits Agency District Offices.
<P>

<a name="70709w16.html_para0">The overall size of the gross discretionary Social Fund budget, and its allocation, is decided annually. It depends principally on the size of loan recoveries expected during the course of each coming year plus planned new provision voted for each year.
<P>

<a name="70709w16.html_para1">Details of the annual gross budget for the discretionary Social Fund and the principles used for its allocation are placed in the Library in March each year. The allocations principles will be reviewed as part of each annual budget setting exercise.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will withdraw new instructions issued to social security staff in August 1995 that require them when assessing eligibility for income support in circumstances where the claimant was alleging abuse or significant harm, to probe into the nature and extent of that abuse. [6970]<P>

<P>
<a name="70709w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 We want a system that supports work, savings and honesty; and provides better, simpler and more efficient services to claimants. The guidance on claims from young people in the circumstances described ensures handling by staff trained in these sensitive matters. The Government has no plans to withdraw the guidance which provides an opportunity to highlight cases of abuse and to take necessary action.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans she has to simplify the process for claiming income support by people who go into residential care for temporary periods. [6973]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 We will streamline services to provide better, simpler, more efficient services to clients. We fully recognise the importance that temporary placements have in providing respite care for carers and for those needing care. We are examining the current process for dealing with benefit claims to make procedures as simple and straightforward as possible and this will include the particular difficulties which can arise for people who need to claim Income Support for temporary periods in residential care.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government strongly believes that for people of working age work is the best form of welfare. We are committed to giving opportunities to sick and disabled people who have some capacity for work to do so. Some &#163;200 million from the windfall levy has been set aside to fund this important programme of work and other measures.
<P>

<a name="70709w16.html_para3">Over the coming months we will be looking to see what changes are necessary to ensure that the particular needs of people who have disabilities or who have lost contact with the labour market because of long-term sickness are provided for. We will make more detailed announcements in due course.

<a name="70709w16.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will list the number of applications for community care grants, the number of applications which were turned down and the number of refusals as a percentage of the total number of applications in each of the last three financial years. [6971]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70709w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Social Fund provides lump sum payments to help with exceptional or intermittent expenses. Applications to the discretionary Social Fund are made to the discretionary fund as a whole; not to parts of it. This means that an applicant may receive either a Community Care Grant or a loan depending on the social fund officer's assessment of the nature, extent and urgency of the need and the circumstances of the individual.
<P>

<a name="70709w16.html_para4">In 1995-96 for example, over half a million applicants who were refused a grant were instead awarded a loan. Similarly over 41,000 applications for budgeting loans were instead awarded a community care grant. Of those applicants who specifically request a Community Care Grant, the vast majority do not satisfy the appropriate criteria to demonstrate a grant is needed to promote care in the community. Over the three years to 1995-96, over 70 per cent. of the 1.25 million applications received annually for community care grants were refused on these grounds.
<P>
