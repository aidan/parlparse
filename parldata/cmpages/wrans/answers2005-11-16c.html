<p><a name="st_9"><a name="51116w02.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 Regulation (EC) No 785/2004 on insurance requirements for air carriers and aircraft operators, which came into effect on 1 May 2005, imposes minimum passenger and third party insurance requirements on all aircraft according to weight. During the process of adoption of the regulation in the European institutions, the Department for Transport submitted a partial regulatory impact assessment to the Commons European Scrutiny Committee, informing it that the regulation would impose a regulatory burden on aircraft operators. No further assessment of the effect of the regulation on the cost of insurance for aircraft operators has been made, but some heavy historic aircraft have had to increase their insurance levels in relation to third party liability. The insurance industry has recognised the problem and sought to make premia affordable.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport on how many occasions the Civil Aviation Authority has <i>(a)</i> issued warnings to and <i>(b)</i> made findings against (i) pilots and (ii) flight crew in respect of breaches of the annual limit for duty hours for commercial aviation, in the last year for which figures are available.  [27688]</p>








<p><a name="st_10"><a name="51116w02.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 UK airlines are required to have a flight and duty time limitation scheme approved by the Civil Aviation Authority and to take all reasonable steps to ensure that all members of their flight crew comply with the scheme. Such schemes have to include the statutory annual flight duty time limit imposed on individual members of flight crew. Flight time limitation schemes are designed to ensure that flight crew do not exceed annual duty time limits and breaches of the limits are few. The CAA does not keep a central record of breaches of duty time limits, but does audit operators records on a regular basis and, if required, ensures that changes to working patterns are instituted.

 There is currently no EC legislation establishing detailed flight time limitations for the flight crew of commercial aircraft. However, draft legislation on airline operational standards under consideration by the EC includes flight and duty time limitations and rest requirements. This legislation will impose an annual limit on flight duty time of 900 hours (pilots and flight crew). In addition Council Directive 2000/79/EC, which implements an industry agreement on working time for mobile staff in civil aviation (pilots and flight crew), establishes a limit of 2,000 hours for total duty time and a limit of 900 hours for flight duty time.

<p><a name="st_15"><a name="51116w02.html_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 European Directive 1999/94/EC requires car fuel consumption and carbon dioxide (CO <sub>2</sub> ) emissions information to be provided to consumers by means of labels and other media. The figures used are obtained by testing new vehicles to the ED fuel consumption/CO <sub>2</sub>  driving procedure on a chassis-dynamometer (rolling-road). This standardised procedure is aimed at providing prospective new car buyers with a simple comparison of the relative efficiency of new vehicles. By its very nature it cannot anticipate the fuel consumption and C0 <sub>2</sub>  emissions that will be achieved by any particular motorist under any conditions of use. Fuel consumption on the road is significantly affected by many factors, especially driving style, traffic and road conditions, load carried, terrain, and the use of heaters, air conditioning and lights. It is therefore impossible to provide a single fuel consumption and, hence, CO <sub>2</sub>  figure that is representative for all road users.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how much national lottery funding has been directed towards asylum-seeker groups in each year since 1997.  [25890]</p>








<p><a name="st_75"><a name="51116w09.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Since 1997 lottery distributors have awarded the following amounts in each calendar year to projects relating to asylum seekers. Due to the nature of lottery awards and the way in which information is stored on the Department&#039;s lottery awards database, some of this money will have gone to a wider group of people than just those seeking asylum. Similarly other lottery awards will have indirectly benefited asylum seekers.

 It is a fundamental principle of the social security system that only one benefit at a time can be paid for income maintenance. Carer&#039;s allowance provides a measure of financial support to those who give up the opportunity of full-time paid employment to care for a severely disabled person. As such it is not an extra-costs&quot; benefit. To pay both benefits in full therefore would duplicate provision for the same need.

<a name="stpa_61">Where carer&#039;s allowance is overlapped in full, the person maintains an underlying entitlement to the benefit which, in turn, gives them access to the carer premium in the income-related benefits such as income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit.

 In response to the themes identified by the Bichard inquiry, the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) embarked on a pilot exercise to explore and investigate the benefits and costs of facilitating the provision of an on-line identity authentication service to authenticate the identity of disclosure applicants.

<p>
<a name="51116w12.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_74">To that end, in July 2004 the CRB posted a Government Opportunities Notice seeking expressions of interest from suppliers of on-line identity authentication services to take part in a three-month pilot to trial products, at the supplier&#039;s own cost, with CRB registered bodies. Following the application of a basic sift criteria the following suppliers were invited to take part in the pilot: BT, Call-credit, Equifax and Experian. The pilot involved each supplier providing his or her product directly to a registered body. No charge was made to CRB or the participating registered bodies for the use of the products deployed at the registered bodies. Importantly, the on-line authentication check did not replace the current CRB authentication rules&#151;the check was conducted alongside the normal paper-based checks.

The general view of registered bodies participating in the pilot was that, while they could see the benefits of deploying similar systems in support of the identity authentication process for disclosure applicants, the type of system trialled

 It would be difficult to show a direct causal relationship between the target of making progress towards 50 per cent. of 18 to 30-year-olds having had experience of HE, and school age performance. But there is evidence that our strategy of transforming the aspirations of children in order to widen participation in HE is boosting performance. For example, participation in summer schools (and other university and school-based holiday programmes), visits to higher education institutions and discussion about life at university with higher education staff and student have all been found in independent evaluation to be associated with higher attainment at key stage 4.

These figures represent a count of all FCE&#039;s where the procedure was mentioned in any of the 12 (4 prior to 2002&#150;03) operation fields in a HES record.<br>

A record is only included once in each count, even if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field of the record.<br>

Finished Consultant Episode (FCE).<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year<br>

Main Operation<br>

The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode.<br>

It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, eg. time waited, but the figures for all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>





Secondary Procedure<br>

As well as the main operative procedure, there are up to 11 (3 prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary operation fields in Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) that show secondary or additional procedures performed on the patient during the episode of care<br>

Ungrossed Data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed)<br>

In 2005&#150;06, the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety provided &#163;550,000 to support nutrition and healthy eating, the Food Standards Agency allocated &#163;75,000 to non-school based nutrition education and the Department of Education has allocated up to &#163;10,000 to inform parents about the new nutritional standards for school meals and also provide them with general healthy eating advice for their children. This advice outlines the new standards and explains why they are needed in schools. It also outlines how parents can be involved by, for example, encouraging their children to eat healthier options at home and elsewhere. In addition, nutrition education forms part of the plans of Investing for Health Partnerships, Health Action Zones and a number of the Healthy Living Centres. The Big Lottery&#039;s Coronary Heart Disease, Stroke and Cancer programme has also supported a number of nutrition education initiatives in recent years.

<p><a name="st_317"><a name="51116w36.html_spnew7"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 Analysis of data over the last twenty years shows that the output of the manufacturing sector has tended to behave more cyclically than the economy as a whole, and that the distributive sectors have experienced a similar strength of cycle to that in the economy as a whole. One reason for manufacturing having a stronger cycle is that it is very dependent on world demand, and thus affected by external shocks.

<p><a name="st_319"><a name="51116w36.html_spnew9"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 There are no regulatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions. The EU Emissions Trading Scheme requires participants to produce carbon allowances equal to their emissions on an annual basis. Under the rules of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme Directive, the Government allocates a number of allowances to installations free of charge. If an installation emits a high level of carbon at one time, it can either purchase additional allowances to cover that or reduce its carbon emissions at other times so as to remain within its existing free allocation for the year or to sell allowances. The scheme therefore does not place any constraint on fuel switching in the event of temporary tightness in the gas supply market, whether due to a cold winter or other cause. The Government has no intention of waiving the requirements of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.

 With a share of over 15 per cent. of the world&#039;s proven reserves of natural gas, Iran has the potential to become an increasingly important gas producer. Whether Iranian gas might at some point in the future supply the UK market would depend on Iranian production and export policies, and be a matter for commercial operators who have every incentive to make their own assessment of the merits of supplies from different countries.

<p><a name="st_328"><a name="51116w37.html_spnew8"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 In the event of a shortfall in gas supplies the Government expect gas demand to reduce itself in response to rising prices. Which companies choose to reduce their gas consumption in this way is a matter for themselves and will depend on such matters as the terms of their gas supply contracts and their own individual cost structures. In previous years, the electricity supply industry has routinely responded in this way to seasonally higher gas prices, switching electricity production to coal-fired and other generating stations instead, and this sector would be expected to respond in the same way this year. This is described in detail in National Grid&#039;s Winter Outlook Report, published by Ofgem on 5 October and available at www.ofgem.gov.uk/temp/ofgem/cache/cmsattach/12493&#095;214&#095;05.pdf.

<a name="stpa_301">Information covering 2004 and the first six months of 2005 is expected to be available in early December. Figures already received covering 2004 show that the overall used tyre recovery performance has continued to improve.

<a name="stpa_302">Tyres disposed of to landfill arise from two principal channels, retail outlets and end of life vehicles (ELVs). In the former case, figures show a sharp drop from over 87,000 tonnes in 2001 to under 30,000 tonnes in 2003. In the latter ELV a figure of 57,000 tonnes has remained constant for a number of years on the basis that all ELV tyres not reused as part-worns or retreads are disposed to landfill. DTI, together with the Environment Agency, has commissioned a survey of landfill operators to cover 2004 and the first six months of 2005 to establish more accurately the volume of tyres disposed to landfill.

<a name="stpa_303">Tyre fly-tipping takes a number of forms, including those dealt with by landowners and local authorities, and those tyres dumped on the forecourts of tyre retail premises. No national data were collected before Defra and the Environment Agency set up the flycapture database in April 2004. English Waste Collection Authorities reported 23,046 incidents of fly-tipped tyres between April 2004 and March 2005. From April 2005 to September 2005 11,440 incidents were reported. The Environment Agency dealt with 280 incidents in 2004&#150;05 and 77 so far in this financial year.
