<a name="20129w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 It is DTI policy that recruitment is carried out on the basis of fair and open competition and selection on merit, subject to the exceptions permitted by the Civil Service Commissioners. My Department has systems in place, which ensure that the principles of fair and open competition are understood and followed in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Service Commissioners' recruitment code. These systems are subject to internal check and to external check by the Commissioners' approved auditors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Crausby: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the outcome of the Energy and Industry Council of 4 and 5 December 2001.  [31932]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Council considered several matters of interest to the United Kingdom.




<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2002 : Column 157W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para2">An exchange of views on the internal market in electricity and gas and on the Commission's Green Paper "Towards a European Strategy for the Security of Energy Supply" formed the centrepiece of this Energy Council.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para3">The key point to emerge from the discussion on the internal market in electricity and gas was that several member states are resisting a fully liberalised regime for gas, arguing that integrated companies should not be split and that prices for accessing pipelines should be negotiated rather than published. The UK maintained that legal unbundling of transmission system operators from the supply side was essential and that third party access to the system should be governed by "ex-ante" rules approved by the regulator and based on published prices. There was a large measure of agreement to this from other member states so far as electricity was concerned. In discussion of the draft directive's handling of public service obligations (PSOs), most member states, including the UK, were in favour of the definition of PSOs being left to subsidiarity though some argued for a more prescriptive approach.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para4">Member states generally endorsed the proposal by ETSO (European Transmission System Operators Association) for a temporary solution to the problem of cross-border trade in electricity, but most warned that this should be seen only as an interim solution for one year. The UK expressed concern at the lack of a clear road map to reach a definitive solution, arguing that there should be a clear definition of responsibilities between ETSO, member states and the Commission.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para5">In a brief presentation on its benchmarking study, the Commission noted that it showed a wide difference in market opening, prices and customer choice among the markets in different member states and that the study's main conclusion&#151;that markets which had opened the most had the lowest prices and the best protection for PSOs&#151;showed the need to move towards full market opening as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para6">The views expressed on these issues will be fed into a report with the hope that the Spanish presidency will be in a position to announce significant progress at the next European Summit in Barcelona.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para7">The Commission hoped that a final position on its Green Paper on Security of Energy Supply would be reached at the next Energy Council (6 June 2002), noting also that while there had been agreement on many points, some, such as nuclear energy and harmonising tax measures, were controversial.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para8">The UK and other member states praised the overall analysis in the Green Paper, supporting the focus on improving demand side management. At the same time, they expressed themselves satisfied with existing arrangements for the management of emergency oil stocks, with the focus firmly on the International Energy Agency as the appropriate forum. Member states agreed on the importance of consumer/producer country dialogue; several emphasised that such dialogue should not be confined to any individual or group of supplier countries.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para9">The UK emphasised the major contribution to security of supply that a liberalised and integrated energy market in the EU would play.




<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2002 : Column 158W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para10">All reserves were lifted on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the Energy Performance of Buildings, although the Commission asked for a declaration registering its dissatisfaction with the length of the implementation timetable. A presidency compromise text has therefore been agreed as a general approach. This was a good outcome for the UK as we secured flexibility that allows for other measures to be used, such as the provision of advice, to reduce the energy consumption and limit the carbon dioxide emissions of boilers.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para11">In their account of COP7 (7th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), the presidency and Commission noted that the EU had been a major player in ensuring that agreement was reached. The presidency concluded that the EU should now work towards a multilateral process for achieving the convention objectives, including targets beyond 2012 and looking at greater involvement of developing countries. The Commission noted that the overall aim of its draft emissions trading directive was to have an EU system in place in 2005 ahead of an international system scheduled to be in place by 2008. The proposed approach would take account of the overall costs of reducing emissions, with the aim of ensuring that an emission trading system should not disrupt energy markets and that market distortions be kept to a minimum. While welcoming these developments, the UK argued for a more voluntary, flexible EU approach, to allow for national circumstances, than that currently proposed, and in favour of doing more to encourage business to gain experience in emissions trading. The Commission also provided information on the European climate change programme.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para12">On state aid to the coal industry after expiry of the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) treaty, only two member states supported the security of supply justification for continued aid. The UK and others opposed this justification but were nevertheless prepared to accept some further aid to the coal industry for social, regional or economic reasons, given appropriate limiting conditions. In particular, aid should be digressive and time limited. The Spanish presidency will take the dossier forward in the new year.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para13">Finally, there was a brief progress report on the Energy Charter treaty and a short Commission presentation on the proposed directive on Biofuels.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para14"><i>Industry Council</i>
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para15">The Industry Council held a debate and adopted conclusions on competitiveness and enterprise policy in the EU. The key themes were better regulation, the economic impact of September 11, research and development, and quantitative targets. The UK asked for the Commission to produce a better regulation action plan for Barcelona.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para16">The Council adopted conclusions on the financing of SMEs. These recognise progress made in addressing problems for SMEs in obtaining finance, but also that more can be done. A number of initiatives have been identified, such as actions promoting entrepreneurship, and to encourage contacts between SMEs, bankers and other finance providers in order to improve their mutual understanding.




<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2002 : Column 159W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para17">The presidency introduced their progress report on modernising competition policy. A debate followed. All member states agreed the council should work towards adoption of the proposed regulation by end 2002. Most of the discussion focused on the issue of the relationship between national competition rules and EU law (Article 3). The Commission believes Article 3 is vital to ensure equal treatment across the Community and it would also simplify the Community legal structure. All member states supported the objectives of Article 3. The UK pointed to the need for consistency and sensible case allocation in the network, but noted some concerns on the regulated sectors, actions to address market failures, mergers, and criminal penalties, on which further discussion would be necessary. All member states agreed on the broad principles for co-operation between national competition authorities in a decentralised regime. The presidency concluded that work would continue.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para18">Council conclusions were adopted on state aid which look forward to further work by the Commission and member states to reform the state aids regime. The Commission presented the Ninth Survey of State Aid in the EU, drawing Ministers' attention to the state aid scoreboard and register that had been set up during the year to increase transparency.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para19">The presidency noted continuing discussions on the transfer of ECSC assets. Further technical legal work was necessary. The Commission briefly presented its latest report on the Monitoring of Aid to the Steel Industry. The Commission was still considering the state aid rules to apply following expiry of the ECSC treaty. Strict rules would continue as member states and the Industry wanted.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para20">The Council again discussed the Commission's proposals for a temporary defensive aid mechanism for shipbuilding, to be introduced in parallel with WTO action against Korea. The UK argued that the way to tackle the problem was through WTO action. The Commission's approach linking WTO action to aid had led to deadlock, from which only Korea benefited. Subsidies had not worked in the past and were further likely to weaken the WTO case. The Council was divided 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2002 : Column 160W</I><P>
about the proposal, and the presidency concluded that no qualified majority existed for the subsidy proposal. The Spanish presidency would need to pick up the dossier.
<P>

<a name="20129w01.html_para21">The Commission made a short statement on sustainable development, encouraging the Council to work on its environmental integration strategy and ideally complete it in time for Barcelona.

<P>
<a name="20129w03.html_spnew0"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 This Department has conducted no recent study on this issue. However, the Labour Force Survey (LFS), which is an Office for National Statistics data set covering the UK, examines whether such individuals are temporary employees by choice or because they cannot find a permanent job. The LFS defines temporary employees as including individuals engaged

 The Small Business Service has an office in each of the nine English regions. The SBS contracts via regional teams with 45 Business Link Operators to provide business support services throughout England. All of the coalfield communities are served by this local network irrespective of the specific location of the office.

 The following table shows the numbers of planned redundancies notified for each year from 1997 to 2001. Companies are required to notify only where they plan to make 20 or more people redundant. I regret there are no similar statistics for individual constituencies.

<P>
<a name="20129w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Home zones are not road safety schemes as such, but if they are carefully designed, they can make a contribution to overall road safety objectives. My Department is currently monitoring nine pilot home zones in England and Wales. A review of accidents is one of the elements included in the study. Data on personal injury accidents are being collected from the local authorities and interview surveys of a sample of residents in each pilot home zone include questions about road accidents. 'After' data will be collected once the schemes are completed. We would expect on-going monitoring of accidents in any home zone to be carried out by the local authority.

 We have received representations from local authorities on a number of matters relating to planning for housing. But this Government do not set national or regional housebuilding targets. We have a national land recycling target and each region proposes its own recycling target to be established through regional planning guidance.

 The Government set out their radical new vision for local government in the recently published White Paper, Strong Local Leadership-Quality Public Services. It contains a wide range of proposals to give local councils greater freedom to innovate and respond to local needs and aspirations of their communities. This Government believe in real local government which is truly in touch with the people it serves.

<P>
<a name="20129w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Sittingbourne northern distributor road proposal is a local road scheme for which developer funding is being sought. Kent county council, the highway authority concerned, have not identified this scheme in their local transport plan as one which requires public money, consequently no public funds have been made available for this scheme via the local transport plan settlement process.

<a name="20129w05.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Progress in introducing local transport improvements is contained in authorities' Local Transport Plan annual progress reports. The first such reports, covering the achievements made in 2000&#150;01 indicate that authorities are starting to lay the foundations for a modern, integrated, local transport system. We expect the next reports, covering the first year in which the increased funding from the 10-Year Plan was available, to show further evidence of progress with local transport schemes.

 Train operating companies carry out works to improve station facilities at railway stations for their own commercial reasons as part of their plans to improve the service for passengers and attract greater patronage. Such improvements may also be required by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) under a train operating company's franchise agreement, or as a passenger benefit negotiated by the authority where there has been a breach of a franchise agreement, or a change of control. An additional source of funding is provided by the SRA's Rail Passenger Partnership scheme. Up to the end of 2001, a total of &#163;45 million had been awarded to 38 projects, including improvements to railway station facilities.

 The additional provision comes from a &#163;2.3 billion transfer of funds from the previously unallocated budget within the Transport 10-Year Plan and, in relation to the 2 April 2001 agreement between the Government and Railtrack, from funds which are additional to those in the Transport 10-Year Plan.

<a name="20129w07.html_wqn2"><B> Chris Grayling: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many rail bridges would have to be raised to enable Britain to comply fully with European interoperability directives.  [30247]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 None. The directives provide for derogations for projects whereby the existing loading gauge, track gauge and space between the tracks can be retained. Therefore, existing rail bridges built to the current loading gauge would not have to be raised. These derogations can be given by the member states; they do not require approval from the European Commission.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w08.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Housing (Fire Safety in Houses in Multiple Occupation) Order 1997 requires that local authorities ensure that adequate means of escape and other fire precaution equipment are provided in all houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) of at least three storeys. Local authorities are encouraged to use their discretionary powers to enforce adequate means of escape and other precautions in other types of HMOs. A local authority will not register an HMO under a control scheme applying to its district unless it is satisfied that adequate means of escape from fire and other precautions have been provided.
<P>

<a name="20129w08.html_para8">The Home Energy Conservation Bill currently before Parliament would provide for a mandatory control scheme for HMOs of certain categories. When parliamentary time allows, all HMOs will be covered by the new housing condition regime, the Housing Health and Safety Ratings System (HHSRS). This risk assessment based system will give greater flexibility to local authorities in dealing with the potential risk of fires in individual HMOs and in enforcing remedies, than under the existing system.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions how many <i>(a)</i> deaths and <i>(b)</i> injuries were caused by fires in council-owned domestic homes by local authority in each of the past five years.  [30631]<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what initiatives are being pursued to promote the use of sprinkler systems in domestic houses; and if he will make a statement.  [30632]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w08.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Government are committed to reducing the number of accidental dwelling fire deaths. To underpin this commitment we have set a target to reduce preventable dwelling fire deaths by 20 per cent. by 31 March 2004. We aim to achieve this reduction through greater efforts in educating householders, by means of publicity campaigns, about what measures they can take to make their home safer from fire.
<P>

<a name="20129w08.html_para9">It has been our policy for some time that smoke alarms have a vital role to play in saving lives as they provide the vital early warning of fire and therefore help people to escape. Since 1987, when the cost of smoke alarms became affordable at around &#163;5, we have conducted, and will continue to run high profile national and regional television campaigns promoting smoke alarms, which have proved very successful.
<P>

<a name="20129w08.html_para10">The Government nevertheless recognise that in some cases more direct protection from fire may be appropriate and therefore provides guidance on a range of other fire protection measures, such as domestic sprinklers. The issue of domestic sprinklers is included in the 'Toolbox' of education and publicity material developed by the National Community Fire Safety Centre for use by fire brigades and others. We also plan to produce later this year a publicity leaflet to inform the general public about domestic sprinklers.

<a name="20129w09.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In Great Britain in 2000 there were 27,731 injury road accidents on roads with a 30 mph speed limit which involved a child casualty. There were 2,151 such accidents on roads with a 40 mph speed limit. These figures include accidents involving children aged under 16 and travelling as any category of road user, including pedestrians, cyclists and passengers.

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2002]:</i> I announced on 1 October 2001 a review of the Best Value regime for local authorities aimed at improving the quality of services. A review group, under the chairmanship of the Minister for Local Government, was set up to take this work forward. I asked the group to report by the end of 2001. In December 2001 the chair of the review group indicated that it had made good progress in a number of areas, but that it would like more time to consider carefully some significant proposals which had been put forward in mid December by members. I agreed to this and hope that the group can complete its work in the near future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department has no evidence to indicate that smoking while driving is a significant cause of road traffic accidents. However, the police do have powers to deal with those who fail to maintain control of their vehicles at all times or who drive carelessly or dangerously. Failure to exercise proper control, and careless driving, carry maximum fines of &#163;2,5000. The maximum penalties for dangerous driving are up to two years imprisonment, disqualification and an unlimited fine.
<P>

<a name="20129w10.html_para2">We will continue to educate drivers about the importance of remaining alert while driving. Rule 126 of the Highway Code deals with safe and responsible driving and highlights the need to concentrate and avoid distractions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department has had no specific consultation about the use of bus lanes by motor cyclists but is aware of a range of concerns about this use, especially among cyclists' organisations. The Department's advice does not promote motorcycling in bus lanes but we are carrying out research to see whether this should be changed. We would expect to consult organisations representing various road user groups if, following trials, any changes are proposed.

 In England, the 10-Year Plan for transport provides the resources to enable central Government, the Highways Agency and local authorities, through their Local Transport Plans, to take action on road safety to support the Government's strategy for achieving its UK road safety targets. These targets are to reduce by 2010 the number of killed or seriously injured in road accidents by 40 per cent., and children by 50 per cent., compared with the average for 1994&#150;98. Road building is expected to make a significant contribution towards achieving these targets. However, in England, local and central Government road building plans are not yet fully defined. In particular, on the strategic road network, the

<P>
<a name="20129w10.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In England, the 10-Year Plan for transport includes significant investment in the strategic and local road network to tackle the problems of congestion, pollution, and safety. On the strategic road network in England, the choice of specific schemes will depend on the outcome of the multi-modal studies currently being carried out. But the increased level of investment in trunk roads in England is expected to result in 0.4 per cent. more traffic on all roads and 0.9 per cent. on inter-urban trunk roads in 2010. The 10-Year Plan as a whole is expected to reduce traffic growth in England between 2000 and 2010 from 22 per cent. to 17 per cent. on all roads and from 29 per cent. to 26 per cent. on inter-urban trunk roads. Responsibility for these matters has been devolved in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to the Scottish Parliament, the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Executive Committee respectively.

<P>
<a name="20129w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Many of the proposals set out in our consultation paper "Control of noise from civil aircraft" (July 2000) concerned enabling powers relating to noise policy issues that will be dealt with in the air transport White Paper. There are also relevant provisions in the recently proposed EC Directive on "the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise related operating restrictions at Community airports". Having examined the responses to the consultation paper in this context, we have decided that it would be more appropriate to announce conclusions on the enabling powers in the White Paper itself.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what steps he is taking to ensure that crews on ships <i>(a)</i> registered in the UK and <i>(b)</i> sailing in UK waters comply with international safety standards.  [30748]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 International safety standards for seafarers are enshrined in the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping 1978, as revised in 1995, known as STCW 95. Those 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2002 : Column 200W</I><P>
standards are implemented in the UK through the Merchant Shipping (Training and Certification) Regulations 1997 and the Merchant Shipping (Safe Manning, Hours of Work and Watchkeeping) Regulations 1997.
<P>

<a name="20129w11.html_para1">All Parties to the STCW 95 Convention have until 1 February 2002 to comply with the requirements of the Convention. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and the Merchant Navy Training Board (MNTB) have worked closely to ensure that all maritime training courses properly reflect STCW 95.
<P>

<a name="20129w11.html_para2">To comply with the revised international standards, and to revalidate their certificates under STCW 95, seafarers have to undertake further short courses in, for example, Advanced Fire Fighting and Proficiency in Survival Craft and Fast Rescue Boats.
<P>

<a name="20129w11.html_para3">Seafarers holding foreign Certificates of Competency will only be able to sail on UK registered ships if the country issuing the certificate has been assessed by the MCA to be of STCW 95 standard with training equivalent to that of the UK.

<P>
<a name="20129w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Recruitment is a matter for the individual shipping companies themselves. There are Government measures, however, to assist and encourage the training and employment of British seafarers. We provide financial support for seafarer training through the Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme. Following a review of SMarT in autumn/winter 2000 and the receipt of EU state aid clearance, additional courses will be included in the scheme and levels of funding will be increased. We introduced the tonnage tax option as part of the Finance Act 2000, a key feature of which is a minimum training obligation. This feature is unique to the UK, and requires each shipping company opting for the tonnage tax to recruit and train one officer trainee each year for every 15 officer posts in its fleet and also give consideration to employment and training opportunities for ratings.

 <i>[holding answer 28 January 2002]:</i> There is no simple measure of capacity on the network. The part of the network used by the South West Trains franchise is congested in a few particular areas, especially where lines converge in the approaches to London. Under the proposed new franchise agreement Stagecoach plan a revision of the timetable to permit an increase in the number of trains into Waterloo from September 2003. Some new trains have already been introduced by SWT, providing additional capacity, and a further tranche are due to enter service at the end of 2002. In the longer term work to lengthen platforms will allow longer trains to operate on the Southampton and Portsmouth routes.

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) does not monitor performance by route group.

As part of the SRA's franchise replacement process it is intended that the First Great Eastern franchise will form part of a new Greater Anglia franchise from 2004.

<a name="20129w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government are aware that following the events of 11 September there has been a significant increase in the cost of insurance for the air transport industry. This is primarily a commercial matter, and we would expect the increased premia to be passed on to users of air transport services in the normal way.
<P>

<a name="20129w11.html_para5">In the case of third-party war and terrorism risks there was a market failure, with the insurance industry withdrawing cover above minimum levels in the immediate aftermath of the terrorist attacks. In response the Government intervened to guarantee levels of cover for airlines up to the amounts held prior to 11 September, with similar arrangements for airports and ground service providers. My right hon. Friend the Chief Secretary to the Treasury has recently announced that this scheme, as subsequently amended, will be carried over till 20 March 2002.

<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w13.html_spnew8"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 As the Horserace Betting Levy Board was unable to accept the Bookmakers' Committee's recommendations for the 41st levy scheme the matter, under statute, was referred to me to determine.
<P>

<a name="20129w13.html_para2">In considering the next scheme I have taken into account submission from the Chairman and independent members of the Levy Board, the Bookmakers' Committee, and the British Horseracing Board. In the interests of fairness and openness, these bodies were also given the opportunity to comment on each others' submissions.
<P>

<a name="20129w13.html_para3">I have also taken account of independent advice from Organisation Consulting Partnership on those submissions. A copy of their report is being placed in the Library and is being sent to those who provided submissions.
<P>

<a name="20129w13.html_para4">The criteria which customarily apply to the setting of levy schemes include the needs of horseracing and the capacity of bookmakers to pay. I can confirm that I have sought to reflect these considerations in reaching a view about how much bookmakers should be required to contribute in order to enable the Levy Board to give effect to the improvement of horseracing and its other statutory purposes.
<P>

<a name="20129w13.html_para5">The exercise of my responsibility to determine the 41st scheme has been made difficult by uncertainties currently facing the betting and racing industries. These include the effect of the introduction of a gross profits tax on betting, and the potential income for racing from its proposed sale of picture and data rights to bookmakers.
<P>

<a name="20129w13.html_para6">As to the former, it is difficult to judge the extent to which changes in bookmakers' turnover on horseracing betting will be reflected in their gross profits on that business. Although all recent levy schemes have been based on turnover it appears to me that, in current circumstances, it is not necessarily the fairest or most reliable indication of bookmakers' ability to pay the levy.
<P>

<a name="20129w13.html_para7">In all the circumstances, I am therefore minded to determine the 41st scheme on the basis of off-course bookmakers paying an average of 9 per cent. of their gross profits on horseracing betting. (As on-course bookmakers will not be directly affected by the tax changes I am minded to continue the flat fee arrangements of the 40th levy scheme). My officials will be working with the Levy Board so that the details of the scheme can be confirmed and promulgated in time for it to take effect from 1 April.
<P>

<a name="20129w13.html_para8">As to the sale of picture and data rights, it must be a cause of considerable disappointment that a full measure of agreement on the commercial terms which should apply has not yet been reached. Against this background of uncertainty and outstanding legal disputes I do not feel able to accept the Bookmakers' Committee argument that the 41st scheme should require only a nominal contribution from bookmakers from 1 May 2002. I have, however, taken account of the commitment from the British Horseracing Board that any payments in respect of 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2002 : Column 212W</I><P>
licences to use pictures or data which are purchased by that date will be offset against levy payments which the bookmakers concerned are liable to make thereafter.
<P>

<a name="20129w13.html_para9">As a result of these uncertainties it is hard to forecast how much the 41st scheme, determined in this way, will yield; but, on the basis of forecasts previously provided by the betting industry, it would be in a range from &#163;90 million to &#163;105 million in 2002&#150;03. A lower yield would reflect a lower level of profits. The scheme should enable both the betting and racing industries as well as punters themselves to share in the benefits flowing from the new tax regime; and enable the Levy Board to meet its own liabilities.
<P>

<a name="20129w13.html_para10">We would like to encourage the betting and racing industries to develop a modern relationship as business partners and move away from an adversarial approach. The levy scheme which I am minded to determine will give them a shared interest in developing their businesses to their mutual benefit. It is, however, clear that the levy system as a whole is flawed, and should not be needed if satisfactory commercial agreements between the parties can be made to work. We remain committed to its abolition, when parliamentary time permits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w15.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In my statement to the House of 23 January 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 891&#150;902, I estimated the total cost of refunding wrongly taxed Army pensioners at around &#163;30 million. The latest Inland Revenue estimate is that, to date, it has refunded in the order of &#163;6.5 million to eligible pensioners or their spouses. We believe that the majority of these pensioners or their spouses have already been identified but we recognise that there may be some beneficiaries eligible to claim where the pensioner is deceased. It is not easy to establish their number or the cost attached to such claims. Nonetheless, I would not expect the total to exceed &#163;30 million, and based on the repayments that have been made to all of the cases that have been identified it is likely to be significantly less. Of those so far identified as having wrongly paid tax, only 14 have not yet had refunds.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will estimate the cost to the Armed Forces Pension Scheme of increases to future pension payments to bring them to the level which would have applied but for the pay restraint policy in the mid 1970s.  [28724]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A number of previous Governments have operated pay restraint policies that have affected the pensions of all public servants retiring at the time. No estimate has been made of the costs of increases to future payments to remedy these effects or that specifically relating to the pay restraint policy in the mid-1970s. Periods of "trough" are not clearly defined and we therefore see major difficulties in costing any remedial measures. Nonetheless, for the information of veterans organisations, we are looking to see whether it would be practicable to give a broad estimate of the costs that might be involved for the major periods at issue. However, it has been the policy of successive Governments that retrospective action to redress such issues would not be appropriate and we do not plan to change this policy.

 In July 1997, when the assessment took place, sustainable development was not a specific factor to be taken into account when considering F680 applications, although the impact on the economy of the recipient country was. Sustainable Development was included in the EU Code of Conduct on arms exports that came into effect in June 1998. However, as the F680 application for the Air Traffic Control System for Tanzania did not include cost information it would have been difficult to take any impact related specifically to the financing of the equipment into account.

 Our direct co-operation with the Government of Zimbabwe reduced substantially in 2000. In April 2001 I halted our remaining Government to Government programmes. One programme of capacity building for rural district councils was allowed to run until its planned end date of September 2001. We continue to support a Government initiative to promote the inheritance rights of poor women, but money for this does not go through the Government. We support activities where the principal partner is not central Government, but which operate within Government systems where they are the only means of providing direct services to the poor, and where we are satisfied that they remain effective and impartial. These include the national HIV/AIDS prevention programme where our support is partially channelled through the public health system, and funding to complete long-standing commitments to rural water and sanitation projects through local government.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many businesses have been allowed to defer their taxation payments to the Inland Revenue as a result of the foot and mouth crisis; what the total value is of these deferred payments; how many businesses have since been required to recommence payments on deferred taxes; and what the total value of payments is that have been received on these deferred taxes.

 In the cumulative period 21 March 2001 to 20 January 2002 the Inland Revenue has helped 14,517 businesses by agreeing to defer &#163;118.60 million tax and National Insurance contributions for mainly between three and 12 months. No businesses seriously affected by the FMD outbreak have been required to recommence payments of deferred tax and we do not have full details of payments received on deferred taxes. However, a sample review of these cases in December 2001 revealed that as much as &#163;49.81 million had been paid voluntarily.

 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2002]:</i> Land at maintained schools is owned and held by a number of different bodies depending on the origins and category of school in question. Normally, only the governing bodies of foundation schools own their school land. At voluntary schools, the site ownership is usually split between school trustees and the local education authority, although at voluntary schools that were formerly grant-maintained, governing bodies will own the land transferred to them from the local authority. Local education authorities own land at community schools. It is also the case that some governing bodies may own land that is gifted to the school, but such land is usually held on specific trusts.
<P>

<a name="20129w19.html_para0">Governing bodies of foundation schools have always needed the Secretary of State's consent before they could dispose of any land. At any other category of maintained school where governing bodies own land they may be required to obtain consent from the Secretary of State before they sell their land. In other cases the sale of land will be subject to the terms of the trust on which the land is held. The sale of trustee owned land at schools has always been governed by the terms of the trust under which the land is held.

In recognition of the position in Portsmouth we have made &#163;280,000 available directly to schools to fund local recruitment and retention initiatives. In addition, Portsmouth will also receive assistance through the &#163;250 million Starter Homes Initiative which will enable teachers, as key workers, to purchase homes with the help of &#163;10,000 free equity loans. We have also announced our proposal to accept the School Teachers' Review Body's recently announced recommendations, including a further above inflation pay increase of 3.5 per cent. for all teachers and that good, experienced, teachers should in future be able to receive a &#163;2,148 pay increase on crossing the threshold after five years instead of seven. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State set out our longer term proposals for teachers and teaching in a pamphlet, "Professionalism and Trust", published in November 2001.

 Parents' views are an important part of the evidence base for an inspection. To ensure that parents have an opportunity to express those views, a parents' meeting must be arranged by the school prior to an inspection. In addition, schools are invited to distribute the parents' survey form. The decision to do so is entirely a matter for the school and any costs associated with the survey are borne by the school. An analysis of the data held by Ofsted is currently being undertaken. Once complete the results will be made available to the House through the Library.

<P>
<a name="20129w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> We announced on 14 December that DEFRA's quality control arrangements had revealed errors in the genotype results sent to the owners of five flocks participating in the national scrapie plan. The results had been provided to DEFRA by LGC, a private sector laboratory. As a precautionary measure DEFRA arranged for all of the blood samples tested so far by LGC under the national scrapie plan to be re-tested. This has involved re-testing over 4,000 samples. Although we have no had re-test results for all but 163 of those samples, the re-testing exercise is not yet complete. However, the re-testing has revealed some further errors in the original tests done by LGC. The re-testing exercise will be completed as soon as possible. All flock owners affected have been kept informed, and will be given revised results where this is necessary. DEFRA has already given corrected results to the owners of the five flocks where errors were originally

Following a detailed inspection, DEFRA is now satisfied with LGC's revised procedures, but we regard as serious the shortcomings which have occurred, and we will be closely monitoring LGC's future performance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if her Department will produce a strategy for reducing the release of dioxins to the levels recommended by the Committee on Toxicity for the tolerable daily intake for dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls, with particular reference to releases from <i>(a)</i> Environment Agency regulated activities, <i>(b)</i> local authority-regulated activities and <i>(c)</i> activities that are not regulated; and if she will make a statement.  [25197]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The recommendation of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT) is for a tolerable daily intake (TDI) for dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls of 2 picogrammes TEQ/kilogramme bodyweight. The Food Standards Agency's programme of research and surveys for these contaminants has shown that the average dietary exposure in the UK (1.8 picogrammes TEQ/kilogramme bodyweight per day) is already below the new TDI, although consumers who eat a lot of fatty foods can exceed the TDI.
<P>

<a name="20129w22.html_para0">Emissions from Environment Agency and local authority regulated activities are controlled under the systems of Integrated Pollution Control (which are progressively being replaced by the Pollution Prevention and Control Regulations) and Local Air Pollution Control. These and other controls have made a major contribution to the approximately 70 per cent. reduction in emissions of dioxins to air during the past decade. As the major industrial sources are reduced, the less well regulated diffuse sources such as bonfires have become relatively more important, so action is also needed in these areas. The Government believe that there is a strong case for reducing environmental emissions of dioxins and dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), particularly in the light of the revised recommended tolerable daily

In consultation with the devolved Administrations, other Government Departments and agencies the Department is, therefore, producing a UK position paper on dioxins and PCBs, which will set out proposals for achieving further reductions in emissions of these compounds, for consultation with a wide range of stakeholders.

 <i>[holding answer 25 January 2002]:</i> The date-based export scheme continues to be available as the means of exporting beef from the UK, although it has been in abeyance for the duration of the foot and mouth disease outbreak. We recognise that the conditions of the scheme are onerous and that this is a disincentive to potential beef exporters to operate under the scheme. For this reason we are pressing the European Commission to propose changes to the conditions of the scheme to make it a more viable prospect for a wider range of beef exporters.

discussions she has had with her counterparts in <i>(a)</i> Europe and <i>(b)</i> Norway, regarding the proposal to (i) take low impact fishing methods out of the quota system, (ii) introduce management regimes which encourage low impact fishing methods and (iii) establish systems which afford protection for low impact fishing methods in future policy development.  [30618]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Under Community legislation we are required to take account of all landings for quota management purposes: there are no exceptions. However, in the context of the on-going review of the common fisheries policy, the Government have made it clear that we have at hand an opportunity to give new recognition to the role of fishermen using selective and environmentally friendly fishing techniques which have a low impact on stocks, such as North sea cod long liners and mackerel handliners. In our public response to the European Commission's Green Paper on the future of the CFP, we make exactly that point.
<P>

<a name="20129w22.html_para1">In some cases, however, the Government have already introduced measures recognising the importance of certain low-impact fisheries. We have, for example, implemented enhanced underpinning arrangements in the south-west mackerel handline fishery, whereby the handliners receive a guaranteed minimum quota allocation each year. We also arrange 'quota swaps' to obtain additional fish where necessary.

<P>
<a name="20129w22.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Neither the Department nor the Government as a whole uses a single definition of a rural area, and it would be unrealistic to impose a standard definition for use in all contexts. For example, within a broadly "rural" county or district, not all parishes would be properly described as "rural". However, we recognise that there is a need for a more co-ordinated and consistent approach to the categorisation and use of definitions of urban and rural areas. For that reason DEFRA, DTLR, the Countryside Agency and the Office for National Statistics are working together towards a better set of definitions of urban and rural areas. In the short term, we plan to use for statistical purposes the definitions presently used by the Countryside Agency.

<a name="20129w22.html_para4">However, on-going work by CEFAS, in part carried out in co-operation with Danish fishery managers, is aimed at refining our understanding of the bycatch, in particular in relation to the extent to which young fish of each of the whitefish species figure in it.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect of industrial fishing for sandeels on the sea-life food chain.  [30357]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Using data from international scientific studies, CEFAS has related estimates of the abundance of the fish and seabirds in and around the North sea to information on the amount of sandeel found in their stomachs. The information results from comparing the average populations for the period 1974 to 1995 with a large amount of stomach data collected during intensive sampling of North sea stocks throughout two reference years, 1981 and 1991.
<P>

<a name="20129w22.html_para5">This work suggests that, on average, natural predators have eaten about 2.7 million tonnes of sandeels each year, compared with around 700,000 tonnes currently taken by the sandeel fishery.
<P>

<a name="20129w22.html_para6">On average 46 per cent. (1.2 million tonnes) was taken by mackerel, 22 per cent. (600,000 tonnes) by whiting, 6 per cent. by haddock, 5 per cent. by birds and 2 per cent. by cod.




<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2002 : Column 244W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20129w22.html_para7">As a percentage averaged over the year, sandeels represented 20 per cent. of the diet for mackerel and whiting, 10 per cent. for haddock and 5 per cent. for saithe and cod. For sea birds the percentage was higher, averaging 40 per cent. for sea birds, rising to 90 per cent. during the chick rearing period. This is why sandeel fishing is currently not allowed on the Wee Bankie and why there is a seasonal closure at Shetland.
<P>

<a name="20129w22.html_para8">Further national and international work is in hand to extend our detailed knowledge so that further measures can be considered if necessary.

 My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, has received a number of representations mainly in the form of parliamentary questions and correspondence.
<P>

<a name="20129w23.html_para0">The industrial action which commenced on 20 August 2001 and which has severely impacted on claims processing was suspended for two weeks, beginning 11 January 2002. This is good news and has enabled the Rural Payments Agency (RPA) to put more resources into

processing through overtime working. Additionally those offices with the largest backlogs are being reinforced by transferring in staff from other sites. The staff are keen to make up the lost ground and are working enthusiastically. That said there is no chance of RPA being able to recover before 31 January 2002 the several thousand man days of claims processing that has been lost. Arable Area Payments (AAPS) has been most seriously affected because this is a complex scheme on which it is not easy to deploy inexperienced staff.
<P>

<a name="20129w23.html_para1">By the end of the payment window on 31 January 2002 RPA expect to have paid around 90 per cent. of claims and providing the industrial action remains suspended, AAPS payments should be completed by around mid-February 2002.
<P>

<a name="20129w23.html_para2">Livestock scheme payments are also being affected but, although software has had to be upgraded to reflect regulatory changes on the bovine schemes and to carry out cross-checks on claims where holdings were affected by foot and mouth disease, RPA expect to make all the payments within the regulatory timescales.
<P>

<a name="20129w23.html_para3">My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, also had a meeting with the British Banking Association (BBA), including representatives of all the main clearing banks, on 22 November 2001. It is hoped that as a result of that meeting the BBA will be sympathetic to the effect that the industrial dispute is having on the cash flow of farmers who have received their payments later than normal.

 The Environment Agency has provided science-based advice on the methodology used to identify areas for designation. This is included as an annex in the consultation document "How should England implement the 1991 Nitrates Directive" published on 20 December 2001.
<P>

<a name="20129w23.html_para8">Nitrate vulnerable zones comprise land designated because it drains into nitrate polluted waters, or waters that could become nitrate polluted. Three methods are used to identify such waters.

<P>

<a name="20129w23.html_para9">For surface waters, monitoring data for nitrates collected over recent years are analysed statistically to identify monitoring points exceeding the level of 50 mg per litre referred to in the directive. In addition, trend analysis methods will be used to identify any additional monitoring points that can be expected to exceed 50 mg per litre in the future.
<P>

<a name="20129w23.html_para10">For ground waters, monitoring data from existing boreholes are processed using mathematical modelling to predict where ground water can be expected to exceed the level of 50 mg per litre, either now or in the future, as a result of nitrate leaching from land.

<a name="20129w23.html_para11">For inland, coastal and estuarine waters the Environment Agency consider a variety of criteria to assess whether waters are eutrophic or may become eutrophic if no action is taken. These criteria include: nutrient concentrations; occurrence and duration of algal blooms; low dissolved oxygen concentrations; changes in fauna, plant growth and algal growth; and occurrence and magnitude of paralytic shellfish poisoning. Only those waters where nitrate is considered to be a factor causing eutrophication are included for the purposes of designating nitrate vulnerable zones.

 From 2 July 2001 we replaced the exceptional hardship and exceptional circumstances schemes with improved arrangements that are broader in scope than the old Regulation 61 provisions. Subject to certain conditions, local authorities are now able to give additional payments to any person whose housing benefit or council tax benefit is restricted where they are satisfied the person is in need of further financial assistance with housing costs. Unlike the old scheme there are no prescribed definitions of either "exceptional hardship" or "exceptional circumstances".

<P>
<a name="20129w27.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2002]:</i> Our priorities for housing benefit are to drive up standards of service, tackle fraud and error, reduce barriers to work and tackle social exclusion. In support of these aims we want to ensure that housing benefit does not provide a disincentive to work by subsidising accommodation which a person could not otherwise afford. That is why housing benefit for rented accommodation in the deregulated private sector is restricted to the broadly average rent level for similar sized properties in a locality (the local reference rent).
<P>

<a name="20129w27.html_para0">Our policy is that local reference rents should reflect the generality of the market and must therefore be based on a geographical area large enough to take account of the bigger picture, reflecting a broad choice of housing.
<P>

<a name="20129w27.html_para1">Rent officers use their professional expertise and judgment to determine the size and boundaries of localities. Using fixed boundaries, such as local authority areas, would not necessarily reliably reflect the market. Moreover, market forces mean that, over time, the size and shape of localities will change. Information on those localities which happen to be co-terminous with local authority areas at a particular point in time is not collected.
<P>

<a name="20129w27.html_para2">The Court of Appeal in its recent judgment Regina (Saadat and others) <i>v</i>. The Rent Service took the view that the locality used by the rent officer to calculate a local reference rent was larger than that needed reliably to decide such a rent. The formula arrived at by the court under the order then in force runs counter to our intention that localities should be based on broad geographical areas. The application of this formula could also have led to a large increase in the number of localities nationally, making it impractical to operate, resulting in delays for people claiming benefit and putting an extra burden on local authorities.
<P>

<a name="20129w27.html_para3">We therefore acted swiftly to introduce amending legislation in the Rent Officers (Housing Benefit Functions) (Amendment) Order 2001, SI 3561 which now defines locality in a way which reflects Rent Service good practice. These amendments are designed to ensure that our policy is achieved and to restore certainty. They are not designed to change the way in which localities and local reference rents are decided or to widen the definition of localities so that they increase in size. The position for people claiming housing benefit is therefore unchanged, irrespective of the affluence of the area in which they live.
<P>

<a name="20129w27.html_para4">The Department wrote to the local authority associations on 1 November 2001, four days before the order was laid before Parliament, outlining the nature of the proposed amendments. No representations were received in the intervening period. There is no statutory requirement to consult the Social Security Advisory Committee about proposals to make orders, but the

<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w28.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 There is no maximum amount of income support or minimum income guarantee payable. The amount payable is dependent on an individuals circumstances and takes account of a number of factors. These include: whether the person is single, married or has dependants; their level of other income and savings; and receipt of other benefits such as attendance allowance.
<P>

<a name="20129w28.html_para1">From April 2001 the minimum income guarantee rate for a single pensioner is &#163;98.15 and &#163;140.55 for a couple.

<P>
<a name="20129w28.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Winter fuel payments are made automatically to people who are in receipt of certain benefits, which include retirement pension. These payments were issued prior to 1 January 2002 and represent the majority of winter fuel payments. Other people who are entitled to a winter fuel payment are required to submit a claim form. If the claim was received before 24 September 2001, payments were also made by 1 January 2002. However, inquiries from individuals regarding payments not yet received are investigated and a payment issued as soon as possible, where appropriate.

<P>
<a name="20129w28.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 On 7 March 2001 the Government announced proposals to replace the minimum funding requirement (MFR) with a long-term scheme specific standard in the context of a regime of transparency and disclosure, with additional measures to strengthen protection. Implementing these proposals in full will require primary legislation, and we are working with the pensions industry and other interested parties to develop proposals for legislation as soon as parliamentary time becomes available.
<P>

<a name="20129w28.html_para2">On 18 September 2001, we published "The Minimum Funding Requirement: The next stage of reform" which sets out our plans for the next stage of reform of the MFR, including consultation on draft regulations introducing interim changes to the MFR in advance of its replacement. The consultation period on the draft regulations ended on 10 December, and we plan to introduce changes before April this year. The regulations will not be retrospective.

 On 7 March 2001 the Government published "Security for Occupational Pensions: The Government's Proposals", which set out our proposals for providing more effective security for members of defined benefit occupational pension schemes.

As part of this process we are considering what arrangements should apply when a scheme is wound-up with an insolvent employer.

<a name="20129w29.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessments he has made of the compliance of the Review Panels to be established in order to adjudicate on the liability under Coughlan <i>v.</i> North Devon Health Authority, C.A. 1999 of a patient's property to be charged to pay for nursing home fees under Department of Health circular HSC 2001/015:LAC(2001)18 of 28 June, 2001 with Article VI of the Human Rights Act in <i>(a)</i> composition and <i>(b)</i> independence.  [22958]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w29.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2001]</i>: Counsel's view was sought before Health Service Circular 2001/015: Local Authority Circular (2001)18 was released, including compliance with the Human Rights Act 2000. Article 6 requires that in the determination of a person's civil rights and obligations there should be a fair and independent decision making process. A decision about whether someone is entitled to particular national health service services or particular local authority services is not considered to be a determination of a civil right within the meaning of article 6.
<P>

<a name="20129w29.html_para1">The question of whether a patient's property can be set against charges for nursing home fees is not a function of review panels.
<P>

<a name="20129w29.html_para2">The issue of nursing home fees is discussed in HSC 2001/17:LAC(2001)26 "Guidance on free nursing care in nursing homes" issued on 25 September 2001.




<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2002 : Column 268W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20129w29.html_para3">Neither the free nursing care nor the continuing care guidance deals with issues of whether the value of a patient's property should be included in the means test when assessing an individual's contribution towards the cost of nursing home fees. The relevant guidance, regarding local councils contribution to the costs of accommodation and board, is in the charges for residential accommodation guidance, which is underpinned by National Assistance (Assessment of Resources) Regulations 1992, regulation 25. Some of these decisions have to comply with article 6 of the Human Rights Act, and in these cases the complaints panel should be independent of the council.

<a name="20129w30.html_para3">In October 2001 we announced the investment of an additional &#163;300 million over this year and next as part of a radical 'cash for change' programme. This funding has gone to councils to enable them to reduce delayed discharges and targeted on the areas with the most severe problems. We are already seeing reductions in delayed discharge as a result of the funding.

<P>
<a name="20129w30.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Dentists, as independent contractors, can decide whether or not to accept patients for national health service care and treatment under a continuing care arrangement (for patients over-18 years of age) or under a capitation arrangement (for those under-18).
<P>

<a name="20129w30.html_para6">If a dentist decides to withdraw NHS care arrangements, under the terms of service he has the right to terminate these arrangements, provided that he gives the patients three months notice, in writing, and uses his best endeavours to complete any outstanding treatment, before the arrangements come to an end. He must also notify the health authority accordingly and give details of any care and treatment which he has agreed to provide and which is outstanding, including any arrangements made for completion of that care and treatment.
<P>

<a name="20129w30.html_para7">If a dentist wishes to terminate an arrangement with less than three months notice, he must apply to the HA setting out the reasons and asking the HA to terminate the arrangement. A dentist may ask the HA to terminate the arrangement immediately in the case of violent patients.

<P>
<a name="20129w30.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We are committed to ensuring that national health service dentistry is available to all who want it through registration with an NHS dentist or via NHS Direct. In supporting this commitment we have invested over &#163;100 million in the last two years. Significant resources have been invested in personal dental service pilots to improve access to NHS dentistry in areas with significant problems.

<a name="20129w30.html_para8">Registration can play an important role in promoting oral health through strengthening the relationship between patient and dentist.

 We have received no advice on the relative merits of cell research and the further development of pharmaceutical products in developing a cure for Type 1 diabetes. The Human Genetics Commission provides us with strategic advice on developments in human genetics and their social and ethical implications. To date, the Commission has given no advice relevant to cell research and diabetes. The Gene Therapy Advisory Committee has received no proposals for gene therapy research relating to diabetes and none is expected at present.

 An estimated 1.3 million people in England have diagnosed diabetes, of whom around 15 per cent. have Type 1 diabetes and around 85 per cent. have Type 2 diabetes. In addition, as many as 1 million people may have Type 2 diabetes without yet knowing it. Around 5 per cent. of total national health service resources is used for the care of people with diabetes. We see bringing clarity to the question of screening for Type 2 diabetes as a priority. We have asked the United Kingdom National Screening Committee to assess the benefits and disbenefits. The committee will make recommendations in 2005.

 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2002]:</i> The Department advised the Association of British Insurers of planned increases under the provisions of the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 in the tariff and cap on 7 December 2001. Officials have since corresponded with the association on these matters and I understand a further approach has been made to me seeking to delay implementation. However the increased charges will not have an immediate impact as they will only apply to road traffic accidents happening on or after 28 January 2002. As the average time to settle the relevant insurance claims is around 18 months, the full effect of the increases will not occur until summer 2003.

<a name="20129w35.html_para7">The latest published recorded crime statistics show that in the 12 months to March 2001, thefts of and from vehicles had reduced to 968,447 offences, a reduction of 10.1 per cent. against the 1998&#150;99 baseline; domestic burglary had reduced to 402,984, a reduction of 14.9 per cent; but robbery had increased to 68,447, a rise of 13 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20129w35.html_para8">We remain determined to reduce robbery rates, and the 12 month increase is half the 26 per cent. rise in the previous year. The robbery figures relate to the following police forces: Metropolitan Police Service, Greater Manchester, Merseyside, West Midlands and West Yorkshire.

 Recorded crime figures are published in financial years, with the most recent available figures being for the year ended March 2001. The information for the years from 1 April 1998 is given in the table.
<P>

<a name="20129w35.html_para9">The number of recorded crimes will be affected by changes in the public's willingness to report crime and police recording practices, as well as the real extent of crime. For example, the British Crime Survey has shown that, in England and Wales as a whole, victimisation for the violent crime in the survey which is comparable to recorded crime decreased by 19 per cent. between the 1999 and 2000 calendar years, whereas comparable violent crime recorded by the police increased by 9 per cent.

 An airline may occasionally refuse to carry passengers refused entry, illegal entrants and those subject to formal deportation proceedings if it has concerns for the safety of their aircraft, crew and passengers. We are aware of a small number of incidents where airlines have refused to carry certain individuals because of concerns they have about their conduct when boarding the aircraft. Where there have been concerns, the United Kingdom Immigration Service has arranged for the individual to be escorted during the flight.

 Since August 2001 the Home Office has produced two regulatory impact assessments (RIAs) on the Proceeds of Crime Bill; and the Anti-Terrorism, Crime and Security Bill. These RIAs are in the Library. One consultation paper has been issued since August 2001, the Motor Salvage Operators Regulations 2002, this contained a partial RIA. The consultation paper can be accessed via the Home Office website or www.ukonline.gov.uk/ citizenspace/consultations/.
<P>

<a name="20129w38.html_para4">On the Proceeds of Crime, consultation took place after the publication of the draft Bill. This consultation helped us review the draft Bill and some of our proposals and costings were modified. No assessment of commercial impacts was made.
<P>

<a name="20129w38.html_para5">No consultation with business was carried out before the Anti-Terrorism Crime and Security Bill was published. The RIA made it clear that many of the powers, with significant cost implications, would only be used should the need arise and a number of other measures would depend on the proposals to be covered in secondary legislation. Such secondary legislation will be developed in close consultation with the industry to ensure that there will be effective compliance with the measures proposed and that the costs of such compliance will be minimised.

 The Policy Action Team 6 report "Neighbourhood Wardens", published in 1999, was drawn up following visits to a number of existing schemes.
<P>

<a name="20129w39.html_para0">Proposals for new functions to be carried out by non-police officers were set out in "Policing a New Century" (CM5326), which included examples of similar schemes already in operation. The proposed new powers for Community Support Officers under the control of the Chief Officer of Police, or for members of Accredited Community Safety Schemes employed by others, are set out in the Police Reform Bill.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department under what circumstances GPs are allowed to prescribe heroin to addicts; what plans he has to change circumstances under which addicts can be prescribed heroin <i>(a)</i> by GPs and <i>(b)</i> through specialist clinics; what the timetable is for the proposed changes; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w39.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 January 2002]:</i> Current practice is to restrict to consultant psychiatrists and their clinical assistants the issue of licences to prescribe diamorphine (medical heroin) to drug addicts. In certain circumstances a GP may act as a consultant's assistant and therefore be licensed to prescribe under that consultant's supervision.
<P>

<a name="20129w39.html_para1">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has indicated that he would like to examine heroin prescribing for the small number of chaotic users who would benefit. The Department of Health has invited clinical experts to come together to review the current position of diamorphine prescribing, and it is intended to develop clinical guidance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 18 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 237W, how much funding was provided by central Government to neighbourhood watch in each of the financial years from 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02; and how much will be provided in the next financial year.  [25305]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w39.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Neighbourhood Watch is a movement of over 160,000 local schemes covering 6 million households. Local schemes are independent and largely self-financing. The police play a crucial supporting role, including providing advice on how to set up schemes and assisting with administration and publicity.
<P>

<a name="20129w39.html_para4">The Government have supported the National Neighbourhood Watch Association by sponsoring the cost of their annual conference in 2001, which was &#163;80,000. The organisation is largely self-financing with core funding being provided by the private sector. The Government recognise the role Neighbourhood Watch plays in the fight against crime and in building communities. We have given and will continue to give support in kind to the National Neighbourhood Watch Association. In 2000&#150;01 we produced publicity and training material for Neighbourhood Watch at a cost of more than &#163;100,000.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he plans to take to ensure that babies and children taken abroad are accounted for when their parents, guardians or minders return to this country; and if he will make a statement.  [30137]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20129w39.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 In the year 2000, 90 million people of all nationalities arrived in the United Kingdom. In light of this fact, it would be impracticable to conduct a check of all babies and children taken abroad when their parents, guardians or minders return. A child may have been left in a foreign country for an extended and legitimate period, for example for the purposes of education.
<P>

<a name="20129w39.html_para5">We do however take the well-being of children very seriously. That is why, following a careful review and consultation with interested parties, the United Kingdom Passport Agency moved to a policy of separate passports for British children from 5 October 1998. The reasons for this change of policy included the need to improve identification and prevent the unauthorised addition of 



<P>
<P><I>29 Jan 2002 : Column 304W</I><P>
children to an adult passport, and to reduce the potential for child abduction by giving better control of documents in cases of parental difference.
<P>

<a name="20129w39.html_para6">Where problems arise, the British police enjoy a close relationship with their European Union partners and exchange intelligence regularly. A Ports Precautions Scheme operates through local police to prevent the unlawful and permanent removal of a child abroad and in cases of urgent need, the assistance of Europol and, where appropriate, Interpol, may be invoked.

 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20129w39.html_para7">The Transforming Youth Work Development Fund will be available from April 2002 to March 2004. The majority of the fund will be allocated to local authorities. Regional Government offices will be asked to carry out an approval and monitoring role. In addition the Youth Service Unit will discuss reporting and management information with Government offices following the distribution and spending of funds. To aid this process local authorities will need to clearly indicate the outputs and outcomes that they will achieve. Government offices will ensure that local authority proposals include activities linked to social and community cohesion that are consistent with Public Order and Community Cohesion and Cantle recommendations. The Youth Service is a key partner in the delivery of the Connexions Service. Government offices will ensure that funds are used to build Youth Service capacity to engage effectively with Connexions. The success of the Transforming Youth Work Development Fund will be judged against whether these outcomes are achieved.

<a name="20129w39.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Representations in support of an increase in the present quota of non-European Economic Area students participating in the Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Scheme have been made by a number of interested parties, including the National Farmers Union.
<P>

<a name="20129w39.html_para8">The Government have listened to these representations and have agreed to increase the number of work cards available for use under this scheme. As agreed with the Industry, the student quota will increase from the present 15,200 to 20,200, spread over the next two years. Within that, a higher proportionate increase of 3,500 work cards will be made available to the scheme's operators this year, pro rata to the additional needs they have identified, for allocation to participants in the scheme.
