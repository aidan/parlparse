 The Climate Change Act 2008 sets greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets of at least 34% by 2020 and at least 80% by 2050 (both from the 1990 baseline). The first three carbon budgets, running from 2008 to 2012, 2013 to 2017 and 2018 to 2022, are set in line with the 34% target. This is based on the UK's share of an EU-wide greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of 20% from 1990 levels by 2020. Latest projections published in June indicate that on central scenarios we are on track to achieve the 34% target.</p>

In addition to a range of new policy initiatives, the coalition has already announced that central Government would reduce its carbon emissions by 10% within 12 months and that real time reporting of energy efficiency data would be implemented across Government HQ buildings. We are also supporting greater energy efficiency by introducing the Green Deal and have announced in the House that we are extending the carbon emissions reduction target (CERT) to the end of 2012. We are supporting the carbon price by arguing for the EU to adopt a 30% emissions target for 2020 and we will reform the electricity market to deliver the investment we need to ensure decarbonisation and security of supply.</p>

Ofgem administrate CERT on the Government's behalf, publishing quarterly updates of suppliers' progress towards targets. Ofgem accredit the carbon score of schemes where suppliers meet the terms of the operational guidance, including auditing and reporting requirements. CERT has been focussed around measures which deliver long lived savings, namely insulation. We estimate that the measures delivered under CERT will deliver lifetime savings of some 185 Mt CO2 by April 2011. An evaluation of the scheme will be undertaken in 2011.</p>

 The Department for Energy and Climate Change does not publish wholesale energy price forecasts. It publishes oil, gas and coal price assumptions for the period till 2030, which are used in the Department's analytical work. Rather than forecasting prices, DECC attempts to generate a number of price scenarios, based on estimates of fundamentals, that represent a plausible range that might materialise in the future. The assumptions do not capture short-term volatility in fossil fuel prices, but they are intended to reflect potential long-term trends. It is therefore possible to witness significant deviation from these trends in any one year. The Department keeps these assumptions under review, and will update them when necessary. The last review took place in January 2010 but no changes were made. In addition, as part of DECC's Updated Energy and Emissions Projections, DECC produce wholesale electricity price projections which arise from the fossil fuel price assumptions.

 There are 55 directly-employed security guards working for HM Courts Service (HMCS) at the Royal Courts of Justice. A further 57 guards at the Central Criminal Court are provided by Corporation of London. However, the majority of security guards currently deployed across the HMCS estate are provided under contract through third party providers. As at June 2010 there were approximately 1,439 security staff working at HMCS sites and a further 72 working at Tribunals Service sites. A complement of circa 300 guards is also available to draw on to cover leave/sick absences. At a minority of HMCS sites, a further (estimated) 24-30 security staff are provided under the terms of occupational lease agreements.</p>

 The cost to the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) for the use of the Government Car Service for the period 12 May 2010 to 12 July 2010 is £67,402.79.

Under the scheme, the police are able to issue penalty notices (£50 or £80) for a range of minor offences some of which attract a higher tariff. The recipient of a PND has 21 days to either pay the penalty or seek a court hearing. No admission of guilt is required and the PND recipient discharges all liability for the offence and receives no criminal record, if the penalty is paid. If no action is taken a fine of one and half the penalty amount is registered against the recipient of the notice. The courts are responsible for enforcing fines arising from PNDs in the same way as any other unpaid fine.<br>

 The Lord Chancellor's Advisory Committee on Justices of the Peace for Gwynedd covers two benches-Gwynedd and Ynys-Mon/Anglesey. It should be noted that benches do not necessarily correspond to county lines. It is not, therefore, possible to give exact figures for magistrates (aka Justices of the Peace) allocated to a particular county. The following table shows all recorded magistrates covered by the Gwynedd Advisory Committee area from 2006 to 2009 (this includes magistrates who were not actively sitting during the period).</p>

 The extra-statutory scheme has not begun accepting claims, and so no payments have as yet been made. We hope that the scheme will be in a position to start accepting claims shortly. The scheme will remain open for applications for the period of one year from the date on which it comes into operation. Payments will be made on a timely basis on receipt of applications, and any payments outstanding at the end of the one year period for applications will be made as soon as possible after that date.</p>

 It is essential that approved and effective techniques are available to staff in custodial establishments who find themselves dealing with young people whose behaviour puts the young people themselves, or others, at risk. The independent Review of Restraint in Juvenile Secure Settings, published in December 2008, concluded that, in exceptional circumstances, pain-compliant techniques were necessary in the secure estate for children and young people. Pain-complaint techniques are only to be used as the last resort, where all other methods of control have failed or would not succeed and where there is serious threat to the safety of young people or staff.</p>

 There are no techniques authorised for use in secure training centres that involve deliberately taking young people to the floor.

A young person must not be held on the floor for more than three minutes, after which he or she must be released. The Physical Control in Care manual makes it clear that girls who are pregnant must not be held face down on the floor. The manual also draws attention to the heightened risks of restraining other groups of young people, including those suffering from asthma, obesity, or recent head injury or who are in a psychotic state or a state of excited delirium.</p>

 The technique referred to in the question, involving pressure to the ribs, is one of two 'distraction techniques'.

 The Government are unable to provide the information requested. The Israeli Settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories do not have a separate country code. Consequently, it is not possible for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to separately identify imports from the Israeli Settlements.

 The Government are very concerned about the lack of freedom of religious expression in Eritrea, and about the imprisonment and reports of torture of members of certain religious groups. Following up reports of human rights abuses is difficult in Eritrea, but we have repeatedly pressed the Eritrean Government to address the situation. At the United Nations Universal Periodic Review last year the United Kingdom called on the Eritrean Government to address concerns relating to religious detainees. British officials raise human rights issues with the Eritrean Government at every suitable opportunity, in Asmara and with the Eritrean embassy in London. The EU also has an ongoing political dialogue with Eritrea and human rights concerns, including religious freedom, are raised as part of this.</p>

 The Government's policy on settlement activity in the West Bank and East Jerusalem is clear. Settlements are not only illegal under international law and in direct contravention of Israel's Roadmap commitments, but they also represent an attempt to create 'facts on the ground' which makes a two-state solution harder to achieve. It is important that consumers in the UK are able to make fully informed decision concerning the products they buy. That is why, in December 2009, Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs introduced guidelines in consultation with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to label more accurately produce from Israeli settlements that are sold in the UK. This does not represent a ban on the sale of products from Israeli settlements in the UK.</p>

<i> [holding answer 17 June 2010]:</i> Many seriously injured service personnel and veterans are already eligible for the England-wide free concessionary bus travel scheme by virtue of age or disability. Furthermore, the Department for Transport's guidance on eligibility for disabled people sets out that eligibility for a concessionary bus pass may be considered automatic for injured veterans who are in receipt of war pensioner's mobility supplement, where eligibility is linked to the ability to walk. We are currently considering how to extend the scheme to include automatic eligibility for veterans in receipt of similar awards under the new armed forces compensation scheme.</p>

They provide a long term view of the net growth in the number of households given a projected population and previous demographic trends. As such the household projections do not take into account changes in policy or economic circumstances that may have a material effect on future household formation and do not explicitly reflect the different tenure pattern and household formation of migrant groups.

This will also be determined by factors such as the ability of individual households to meet the cost of housing which is in turn influenced by the wider economic context. These projections also do not take into account the 2008-based population projections, subsequently published by the ONS, which include lower projected levels of net international migration. CLG expect to publish 2008-based household projections later this year.</p>
