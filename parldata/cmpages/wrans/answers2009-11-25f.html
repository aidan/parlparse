 No additional revenues would be raised. Companies capital gains are charged to corporation tax as part of their total profits, at the same rate as any income profits. Consequently companies' chargeable gains are already taxed at the relevant rate of corporation tax for 2009-10. It is highly probable that there would be a fall in net receipts once account is taken of any accumulated capital losses which are currently only given relief against future capital gains, rather than income.</p>

 The Government are testing the Thoresen Review's blueprint for a generic financial advice or 'Money Guidance' service through a large-scale pilot or pathfinder in the North West and North East of England. The £12 million pathfinder is jointly funded and delivered by HM Treasury and the Financial Services Authority. Launched in April, it is on track to meet its target to reach over 500,000 people by March 2010, through the Moneymadeclear website, helpline and face to face services provided by a wide range of local partners.

 The Defence Medical Services (DMS) provide an extensive range of medical treatment and wider support for wounded Service personnel. Since 2001 we have made numerous clinical and administrative improvements to the treatment that we provide, all of which are intended to improve the quality of care that our wounded personnel receive. Where these are a consequence of operational requirements, they have been funded from the Reserve (Conflict Prevention Fund). The Government have also funded many improvements from within the Defence budget, such as £24 million of additional funding over four years for the Defence Medical Rehabilitation Centre (DMRC), Headley Court, announced in 2008.</p>

 The European Air Transport Fleet (EATF) aims to address shortfalls in military strategic air transport capability, for example through the pooling of aircraft or shared procurement. The UK will indirectly benefit from the improved aircraft availability across Europe for support to operations through increased burden sharing. The UK procures military aircraft according to our national requirements and does not have spare capacity to contribute to the EATF. Therefore, we do not currently plan to participate in the programme. As such we have not carried out any detailed assessments of the potential wider benefits to the UK.

The main objective of these initiatives is that, by working more closely together in peacetime, it will allow for a more rapid and effective deployment of a multinational Amphibious or Carrier Strike Group force, when required, in the framework of NATO or EU-led operations.</p>

 The Independent Election Commission (IEC) was able to hold the first Afghan-led elections for over 30 years. In the face of insecurity and threats to its 160,000 staff across Afghanistan, it enabled millions of Afghans to come out and make their voice heard in choosing the future leadership of their country. While there were minor complaints about the quality of some of the materials it used, such as the hole punches to mark the voter cards, the operation overall was well resourced. The UK contributed £16.5 million to the UN basket fund for elections, which included recourses and capacity building for the IEC.</p>

Since 1987, the Government have conducted high profile national and regional television campaigns promoting smoke alarms which have proved very successful. Ownership has increased from 9 per cent. in 1987 to the current level of 80 pert cent. and we are seeking to raise it further as evidence suggests that those without alarms are often in those groups who are most at risk from fire. The Government are currently running a national media advertisement to promote smoke alarms ownership and maintenance messages.</p>

A specification for abortion services is currently being developed to support implementation of this new requirement.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_150"><a name="91125w0011.htm_para6"><a name="09112551001207">The Department has invested £20.5 million in 2009-10 to improve access to contraception to improve all women's knowledge of, and access to the full range of contraception and help reduce the number of unintended pregnancies, abortion and repeat abortions. This includes £7 million  <br>

It is up to individual dental providers to decide if they wish tender for services provided in accordance with the template. No changes are being imposed on existing providers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_163"><a name="91125w0012.htm_para6"><a name="09112551001310">While the template includes quality standards, in line with the recommendations of the Independent Review of NHS Dental Services in England published in June 2009, we will pilot these recommendations carefully before making any substantive proposals to the general dental services contract and the personal dental service contract used in commissioning primary care dental services generally.</p>

 While we have made no formal assessment, we consider that it is unlikely the scheme has made any significant impact on the availability of other drugs used to treat multiple sclerosis. The drugs included in the scheme are used within criteria developed by the Association of British Neurologists. The national health service is obliged to fund other drugs approved by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) within the terms of the appraisal guidance. Natalizumab (Tysabri) is the only other licensed medicine which has an impact on the course of the disease and has been recommended by NICE for use in the NHS.</p>

 The criteria for those wishing to seek entry as a student visitor are set out in paragraph 56K of the Immigration Rules and paragraph 2.14 of the Immigration Directorate Instructions.

In order to qualify student visitors must be coming to an institution that is either the holder of a sponsor licence for Tier 4 of the points based system or accredited by a UKBA approved accreditation body. Those attending an overseas higher education institution that offer part of their programmes in the United Kingdom may also seek entry under this route providing the overseas institution hold their own national accreditation and offer programmes that are of an equivalent level to a United Kingdom degree.</p>

<i> [holding answer 23 November 2009]:</i> In June 2009 Ofsted carried out a further inspection of Haringey's safeguarding services to assess progress following the joint area review (JAR) report of December 2008. Ofsted's subsequent report made clear that the leadership and management team in Haringey had made progress in a number of important areas, but it highlighted issues relating to front line practice that needed prioritising. The Secretary of State met with the leadership of the council to discuss the report and subsequently wrote to the council on 3 July. In his letter to the council, he made clear that Haringey must prioritise improving standards of front-line practice and supervision and that Haringey's plans must be kept under vigilant review with progress accelerated to keep children safe. He explained that Peter Lewis' monthly reports, alongside the rigorous monitoring the Department has put in place and the independent scrutiny of the LSCB, would be used to ensure that all partners keep focused on the priorities identified in Ofsted's report. He has asked Ofsted to conduct a further progress inspection before the end of January 2010, at which point he will decide whether any further action is needed to keep children safe in Haringey.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) produced an analysis of the role of skills in economic growth in 2008. This drew attention to the gender differences in the complex relationship between levels of education and skills and economic growth. More evidence at a country level is needed in this area, but this initial work suggested that the rates of return for higher levels of female education were particularly significant to economic growth. The World Bank found that every 1 per cent. increase in the level of women's education generates an additional 3 per cent. in economic growth. Importantly, failure to achieve gender parity at post-primary levels could be a bottle neck in the growth of the economies of our partner countries.</p>

 The National Offender Management Service has not mandated how body orifice security scanner (BOSS) chairs must be used and currently has no plans to do so. As is the case for many searching technologies and techniques, the decision on how to use the BOSS chairs is for individual governors to make, and will depend on their local circumstances, including their existing local searching strategies. The relevant Prison Service Instruction says:</p>
<a name="91125w0022.htm_brev7"><a name="09112551004146"><ul><p class="tabletext">'The frequency of searches using the BOSS and policies for its use are for local discretion'</p>

 Formerly prisons were ranked on their performance in the prisons weighted scorecard. However, this formed only one element of the final ratings for prisons. A new prison rating system was introduced for 2009-10, but the version used to produce the ratings for Quarter 1 did not lend itself to the production of a performance table.

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="91125w0023.htm_para8"><a name="09112551004018">The purpose of the MAPPA annual reports is to show what multi-agency intervention and resources bring to local public protection arrangements. The focus of the information in the annual reports, therefore, has been upon the offenders managed at level 2 and 3 rather than at level 1, where offenders are managed through ordinary agency management.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_298"><a name="91125w0023.htm_para9"><a name="09112551004019">However, in order to provide data on the whole offender population eligible for multi-agency management and resources, since April 2009 all areas have been required to record instances of offenders managed at level 1 of MAPPA who are charged with serious further offences (as well as those managed at levels 2 and 3), with a view to inclusion in next year's annual reports.</p>

 VAT is payable only on the places commissioned by the youth justice board in secure training centres and private sector young offender institutions. VAT is not payable on the places in secure children's homes or public sector young offender institutions. Therefore, VAT is excluded from these figures in order to provide a valid comparison between sectors.</p>
