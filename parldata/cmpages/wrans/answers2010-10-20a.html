 Burma is a military dictatorship. Power is controlled by Senior General Than Shwe. He has presided over a wide range of human rights abuses and political prisoners have increased under his leadership. He is the architect of the regime's so-called 'roadmap to a disciplined democracy', including elections scheduled for 7 November. These elections are designed to perpetuate military rule. The Government are clear that they will not be free and fair and lack international credibility.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 October 2010]:</i><i> </i>The Government are committed to improving current rates of mobility and giving social tenants more control over where they live. We have pledged to introduce a national social home swap programme to make it easier for social tenants to move to another home or another part of the country. The new scheme will increase opportunities to move by allowing tenants to easily see details of every other tenant looking to exchange their home.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_300"><a name="101020w0001.htm_para5"><a name="10102051000070">The homelessness legislation provides an important safety net for people who become homeless through no fault of their own but is not intended to facilitate mobility among tenants in social housing. The definition of intentional homelessness is set out in primary legislation, and in any particular case it is for the local housing authority to decide whether an applicant has made himself intentionally homeless. Where a person has given up his home in order to move to another area to look for work and not made arrangements for alternative accommodation (and there was no other reason for leaving the home), it is likely that a local housing authority would consider that he had made himself homeless intentionally.</p>

On 6 July we revoked Regional Spatial Strategies and regional housing targets and passed power back to local communities. Instead of going against the grain of local opinion and creating opposition to imposed new housing, we will increase housing supply by introducing powerful fiscal incentives so that communities benefit directly from housing growth. We are confident that our approach to housing, which rebalances power from central Government to local authorities and local people, and combines this with powerful incentives for local authorities, will deliver the housing that communities want and need. We will set out further details on the timetable for introducing incentives in due course.</p>

 There are no specific regulations governing the sale and labelling of Halal meat. However, if meat is labelled as Halal, this must not mislead the consumer. Information provided on the label or in the presentation of a food must not be false or misleading under the Food Labelling Regulations 1996 (as amended), section 15 of the Food Safety Act 1990 (as amended), Article 16 of Regulation (EC) 178/2002 (General Food Law Regulation 2004) and the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008. Information provided or the overall presentation of a food must not deceive the average consumer such that the average consumer would make a purchasing decision that they would not have taken otherwise.</p>

We recognise the potential of these services to meet the needs of customers and communities and to reach the most disadvantaged and vulnerable in society. These outreach services complement our core services delivered through other channels.</p>
</ul><a name="101020w0002.htm_brev7"><a name="10102062000671"><ul><p class="tabletext">Outreach schemes take a number of different forms. Among them are: outreach in local authority and community centres, providing ease of access to advice and support; prison outreach, which provides specific support to prisoners as part of their preparation for release; and outreach at school gates, children's centres and colleges. Much of this outreach work is by its nature local. However, national initiatives are evaluated centrally. For example, in 2008 the Work-Focused Services in Children's Centres pilot was set up, under which Jobcentre Plus Advisers are co-located full-time in children's centres and provide enhanced packages of support. An evaluation is testing the effect of this model on parents' preparation for (and movement into) work, as well as multi-agency working. Interim findings show that parents welcome accessing work-focused services in the children's centre, particularly in comparison to the local Jobcentre Plus office. This work is ongoing and the final evaluation report will be available in September 2011.</p>

They are helping people who had previously considered themselves to be outside the labour market. In August 2010 the initiative was extended to a further 13 social housing estates across England, Wales and Scotland.</p>

 DWP is developing the capacity of community sector financial service providers such as credit unions so that people on low incomes, traditionally not well served by mainstream financial institutions, have access to savings products, affordable credit and basic banking. By August 2010 the DWP Growth Fund had served over 300,000 people, of whom around 65% had been helped to open a bank or savings account. DWP Financial Inclusion Champions are also working with local authorities, social landlords and the community sector to encourage people to access these financial services.</p>

 Eligibility for the Motability scheme is dependent on a person being entitled to the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance or the War Pensioners' Mobility Supplement. Entitlement is not determined by medical criteria but by the extent to which a person's disability gives rise to mobility difficulties. This is consistent with Motability's objective of helping severely disabled people with personal mobility needs. The Government announced in the June Emergency Budget that it would reform disability living allowance and will continue to work closely with disabled people, voluntary organisations and medical experts to develop a new independent and objective assessment of need.</p>

 As part of our consultation arrangements, Pension Disability and Carers Service (PDCS) co-ordinates the PDCS Advisory Forum, membership of which comprises of 22 organisations that collectively represent a broad range of our customers. PDCS routinely consults with the Advisory Forum on how all our claim forms can be improved, which includes Disability Living Allowance (DLA), Attendance Allowance (AA) and Carers Allowance (CA) forms. A new child DLA claim form has been developed in partnership with voluntary organisations including the National Autistic Society, National Deaf Children's Society, Citizens Advice and the Family Fund. This is currently being tested but early feedback from customer and children's organisations has been positive. Additionally, to take account of a new legislative provision where the Higher Rate Mobility Component can be claimed from April 2011 by certain severely visually impaired customers, PDCS are developing a new DLA Adult claim form in partnership with Royal National Institute for the Blind, Action for Blind People, Citizens Advice and representatives from local authorities. It is expected that the new DLA Adult form will be available from February 2011.</p>

 There are a range of benefits available from the Department to help support people with life limiting conditions and for disabled people, including disability living allowance (DLA) or attendance allowance (AA), employment and support allowance (ESA) as well as housing benefit. An award of DLA can also give rise to a disability premium on out of work benefits such as income support and job seekers allowance.</p>

Similar fast track arrangements exist with employment and support allowance.</p>

 The coalition Government are committed to review public bodies, with the aim of increasing accountability for actions carried out on behalf of the state. For the Industry Training Boards (ITBs) we are reviewing the scope for a statutory levy to be operated by a private sector organisation. It is right that Government look at the options for increasing the flexibilities and freedoms under which employers can invest in training. If we cannot find a way of moving ITBs to the private sector, without compromising their ability to raise a statutory levy, then we can still explore ways to further encourage efficiency and flexibility.</p>

 Personalised care planning aims to put people at the centre of decisions about their care and should be offered to all people with long-term conditions including those living with rheumatoid arthritis. Care plans should be developed collaboratively with the individual and the health and social care professionals with whom they have regular contact. In most cases there will be a lead professional who will initiate the process, for example a general practitioner, a practice nurse, a specialist nurse, a social care worker or an allied health professional. Other professionals involved in the person's care should also be aware that they have a care plan and input as necessary.</p>

 There are no plans to screen blood already stored in blood banks for the xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) or to remove from storage blood donated by persons diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="101020w0002.htm_para50"><a name="10102065000048">A recent study in the United States (of America) reported that XMRV has been detected in a number of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) sufferers. CFS/ME sufferers can currently give blood when they are well. These data have not been replicated in Europe. An expert subgroup of National Expert Panel for New and Emerging Infections (NEPNEI) met in May 2010, to consider all available evidence about XMRV and conduct a risk assessment. The subgroup concluded that XMRV can infect humans but there is currently no evidence that it causes human disease and that on the evidence before the group, no public health action is required at this time. Since the subgroup meeting in May there has been no new scientific evidence that would change the conclusions of the subgroup. In July 2010, the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO), similarly did not recommend further measures at present. Both groups will continue to monitor the situation.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="101020w0002.htm_para51"><a name="10102065000049">However, from 1 November 2010, CFS/ME sufferers will no longer be able to donate blood. The UK Blood Services recognised that exclusion from donation by people with ME/CFS needed to be brought in line with that from other relapsing conditions for the protection of the donor, and not because of potential infection risks.</p>

 The change to the United Kingdom Blood Services donor selection guidelines (which comes into force on 1 November 2010) to permanently exclude from blood donation, anyone who reports that they have had chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)/myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is being made purely on the grounds of donor safety, as CFS/ME is a relapsing condition. It brings practice for CFS/ME into line with other relapsing conditions or neurological conditions of unknown origin, to avoid the potential for blood donation to adversely affect the donor.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="101020w0002.htm_para52"><a name="10102065000053">The change was not made because of a perceived risk to recipients of blood from CFS/ME patients and therefore does not affect the safety of organ donations and CFS/ME patients undergoing surgery.</p>

 Primary care trusts currently have responsibility for managing the delivery of general practitioner services, including taking account of the age, size and suitability of premises from which general practitioners (GPs) make their services available to patients. The arrangements for reimbursement of GP premises costs are set out in "The NHS Premises Costs Directions 2004", which has already been placed in the Library. Following the establishment of the NHS Commissioning Board, it will take on responsibility for contracting with GPs and for funding those arrangements under the GP contract arrangements applying at that time.</p>

When publishing information on sensitive clinical conditions such as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), public health interests must be balanced against patient confidentiality and data protection obligations.

 Victim Impact Statements are now officially known as Victim Personal Statements. All victims of crime or, in cases of homicide, the family of the victim are eligible to make a VPS. The present method of providing a leaflet to inform victims of the Victim Personal Statement is currently being reviewed, but the relevant information and the offer to make a statement can still be provided by the police.</p>

 The decision whether to grant bail is a matter for the discretion of the court and the Ministry of Justice does not issue guidance. However, the Crown Prosecution Service issues guidance to Crown Prosecutors on prosecuting cases of domestic violence and rape, and this includes advice on how prosecutors should approach the question of bail. The guidance makes clear that the primary concern of the CPS in such cases is the protection of the victim and any children that may be involved. It emphasises the need to gather as much information as possible on the needs and views of victims where the CPS is deciding whether to oppose bail or is recommending conditions to be imposed on a defendant before release. The CPS keeps its guidance under constant review.</p>
