 I have regular discussions with the First Minister on a variety of issues, including structural funds. However, The Assembly is responsible for the administration of European structural funds in Wales and it is entirely for the Assembly to determine how these funds are implemented.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what consultation his Department has held with the UK aviation industry about the transfer of legislative powers to negotiate with the USA from the UK to the European Commission.  [132559]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The granting of a mandate for the European Commission to negotiate a liberalised transatlantic open aviation area with the US was an integral part of a balanced package of measures on the conduct of aviation external relations agreed in the light of the European Court of Justice's decision in November 2002 in the "Open Skies" cases. The details of a possible mandate for the Commission to open aviation negotiations with the United States were under frequent discussion in Council and its Working Groups for several years, beginning with the so-called "soft rights" mandate agreed by Council in June 1996. Throughout this period the Department was in regular dialogue, both at Ministerial and official level, with all interested parties on our aviation relations with the US, including the prospects for comprehensive Community-level negotiations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will instigate a monitoring system for 



<P>
<P><I>16 Oct 2003 : Column 288W</I><P>
bus operators in receipt of local government subsidies to ensure proper compliance with quality bus partnership standards.  [132561]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Quality bus partnerships are normally agreements which require investment by operators in better vehicles or other means of improving services, so would apply to profitable services that are operated without subsidy. Where operators of subsidised services are able to use the facilities provided by local authorities under quality partnership schemes, it is open to the local authority to specify the required standards in the contract and enforce compliance with the operator's contractual obligations.
<P>

<a name="31016w01.html_para0">In the case of a statutory quality partnership under the Transport Act 2000, Traffic Commissioners have the power to impose financial penalties on operators who fail to comply with undertakings they have made under the partnership scheme, or place conditions on their licences.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the average public subsidy per mile travelled for <i>(a)</i> bus routes and <i>(b)</i> light rail and tram systems was in the last year for which figures are available.  [131926]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 For local buses in England, the average public subsidy per vehicle mile averaged &#163;1.32 in 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="31016w01.html_para1">Modern light rail and tram systems in England receive no public operating subsidy but the older Blackpool Corporation Tramway is supported. On the same mileage basis, the tramway received public subsidy of &#163;1.31 per vehicle mile.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe: </B> 
 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="31016w01.html_para2"><i>(a)</i> There are currently in excess of 200,000 businesses licensed under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 and monitoring the activities of all these businesses would create a significant burden on legitimate business.
<P>

<a name="31016w01.html_para3"><i>(b)</i> The Consumer Credit Act 1974 contains provisions that allow a consumer to challenge an extortionate credit bargain. However, only about 30 extortionate credit cases are known to have reached the courts since the Act came into force and of those, in only 10 did the court find the agreement to be extortionate.
<P>

<a name="31016w01.html_para4">I believe that these provisions have not operated effectively in enabling consumers to challenge unfair credit agreements and I intend to publish a White Paper this autumn, which will contain details of how I intend to make it easier for consumers to challenge unfair credit transactions.

In so doing they will obtain better prices through bulk buying, and thus better value for money, and also encourage broadband service providers to invest in creating more broadband infrastructure which they can use to provide a service to the public.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The average production of carbon dioxide per person in the UK, due to activities such as electricity generation and use, travel and industrial production, is estimated to have been almost 10 tonnes in 2001, the year for which latest published data on greenhouse gas emissions is available.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to reduce the emissions of carbon dioxide from industry into the atmosphere.  [131079]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide from industry are being achieved through the Climate Change Levy, Climate Change Agreements the UK and EU Emissions Trading Schemes and the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) regime.
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para0">The Climate Change Levy applies to energy used in the non-domestic sector. Revenues are recycled to levy payers via a 0.3 percentage point cut in employers' 



<P>
<P><I>16 Oct 2003 : Column 298W</I><P>
National Insurance Contributions, and receipts from the levy, administered by the Carbon Trust, provides additional support for energy saving measures.
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para1">Climate Change Agreements enable energy intensive business sectors to receive an 80 per cent. discount on the climate change levy in return for agreeing to meet challenging targets for improving energy efficiency or reducing greenhouse gas emissions. 44 sectors have signed agreements with the Government, including major energy intensive sectors like steel, chemicals, paper and non-ferrous metals.
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para2">The UK Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) enables target holders in this voluntary participation scheme to meet their emissions reductions targets through their own efforts, by buying surplus emissions allowances from those who have found it cheaper to reduce emissions, or if they over achieve, by selling their surplus allowances. 32 organisations are committed to delivering reductions of 1.1 MtC by the final (fifth) year of the scheme. Climate Change Agreement holders are also able to use the UK ETS to achieve their targets.
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para3">An EU Emissions Trading Scheme is due to start in January 2005 and will be mandatory for certain industrial sectors.
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para4">The Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) regime introduced by a 1996 EC Directive, and which is being phased-in through regulations produced under the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999, applies an integrated environmental approach to the regulation of certain industrial activities. In determining the conditions of an IPPC permit the designated regulator must take energy efficiency into account, which in turn contributes to reducing carbon dioxide emissions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the research being undertaken on the effects of carbon dioxide on environmental sustainability.  [131090]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Carbon dioxide emissions threaten environmental sustainability since they are the main cause of climate change. Defra funds a significant programme of research on climate change worth approx. &#163;12.7 million in 2002&#150;03. This figure includes &#163;8.4 million for the Climate Prediction Programme at the internationally leading Hadley Centre, which underpins the UK's research on assessment of the potential impacts of climate change on the UK, partly through the provision of a consistent set of climate change scenarios published in April 2002.
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para5">Research on the effects of climate change is also commissioned by the Department, other Government Departments and the Research Councils. Defra provides a focus for such research in the UK through the ground-breaking UK Climate Impacts Programme, which provides a link between researchers and stakeholders in industry and the public sector to enable them to assess the risks to their activities from climate change and to develop adaptation strategies to minimize such risks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the Government's plans to tackle climate change.  [131066]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Tackling climate change is a high priority for the Government which will continue to show international leadership by taking effective action to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para7">Policies outlined in the UK Climate Change Programme (CCP) will ensure that the Government are on course to meet its Kyoto commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. below base year levels by 2008&#150;12 and move towards the domestic goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010. The Government are committed to monitoring the effectiveness of the policies and measures in the CCP and will be reviewing it formally in 2004. In addition, as announced in the Energy White Paper, the UK is putting itself on a path to cut its carbon dioxide emissions by some 60 per cent. by 2050, with real progress by 2020.
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para8">The UK works closely with international partners to ensure that effective efforts to combat climate change are taken by all Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and that the Kyoto Protocol enters into force as soon as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the average temperature in England was in <i>(a)</i> August 1993 and <i>(b)</i> August 2003.  [131067]<P>
<P>
<P>

 Observations analysed by the Met Office show that the average Central England temperature was 14.6oC in August 1993, and 18.0oC in August 2003. The average Central England temperature in August during the period 1971&#150;2000 was 16.2oC and over that period the average trend in August temperatures has been a rise of about 0.3oC per decade.

 The UK's commitment under the Kyoto Protocol is to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases by 12.5 per cent. below base year levels by 2008&#150;12. Base year levels are 1990 for carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, and 1995 for the F-gases (hydrofluorocarbons, perflorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride).
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para9">The UK has also set itself a domestic goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010.
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para10">Data for emissions of the basket of six greenhouse gases for 2001, submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in April 2003, show that emissions fell by 12.3 per cent. between the base year and 2001. Provisional data for 2002 shows that emissions fell by around 14 to 15 per cent. between the base year and 2002.

<a name="31016w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I understand that 1,209 properties have been flooded in the period between January and June 2003 based on Environment Agency figures. In the most serious flooding incident in the Thames Valley over the new year, it is estimated that some 400 properties were protected from flooding and disruption to a further 1,000 properties was prevented by the Jubilee River flood alleviation scheme. In other areas of the country, flood defences have of course also reduced flooding.
<P>

<a name="31016w03.html_para11">The Department's policy is to reduce risks to people, property and the environment from flooding and coastal erosion through the provision of defences, flood forecasting and warning systems, increased flood resilience of property, beneficial land management changes and discouragement of further development on the floodplain. The Government invests significant sums of money each year to reduce risk and this investment profile is rising steeply with plans to spend approximately &#163;1.5 billion between 2003&#150;04 and 2005&#150;06.

 Under animal health controls the importation into England of products derived from bears is only permitted on the basis of a valid import licence issued by Defra. Each application for a licence is assessed on its own merits and in deciding whether or not a licence should be issued consideration is given to any animal health risk the product may present. In addition, the international trade in all bear species and their parts and derivatives is regulated by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). The Government implements strict policies on trade to conserve endangered species and maintains a precautionary approach banning all commercial trade in bear bile or gall bladders irrespective of whether or not they come from captive bred specimens, on the grounds that this trade is likely to be detrimental to the species. International trade in other products derived from farmed bears listed in the Appendices to CITES is subject to regulation to ensure that it stays below the level at which species might become endangered.

 The IWC has to operate within the terms of its parent treaty (the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling), which dates from 1946. Within the very real constraints of that treaty (which aims to facilitate the orderly development of the whaling industry and which also provides for unregulated whaling under "Special Permit" for scientific purposes), the IWC has done well to introduce and maintain, for almost 20 years, a moratorium on commercial whaling, to which all members, except Norway, subscribe. Changes to the terms of the parent treaty require the unanimous agreement of all; there is thus no prospect of securing desirable change while keeping pro-whaling countries within the ambit of the treaty.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the proportion of junk mail which can be recycled; what estimate she has made of the proportion of paper waste represented by junk mail in the last year for which figures are available; and what steps the Government are taking to reduce the volume of junk mail.  [131104]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Between 500,000 and 600,000 tonnes of paper was used in direct mail and promotions in the UK in 2002. In terms of total tonnage, this is a relatively small proportion of the overall paper waste stream. For example, the paper packaging waste flowing into the waste stream in 2002 was 3.7 million tonnes. However, junk mail is largely disposed of in the household waste and it should be possible to collect much of this paper for recycling.
<P>

<a name="31016w04.html_para1">The current level of recycling of junk mail is estimated to be some 13 per cent. We have, therefore, recently agreed a voluntary producer responsibility scheme with the industry to increase recycling of junk mail. Under this Agreement, the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) has undertaken to meet specific targets for the recycling of junk mail in the UK. The targets are:
<P>

<a name="31016w04.html_para2">The Agreement also requires the DMA and its members to continue to contribute to waste minimization by improving the targeting of distribution of direct mail and by making full use of, and publicizing, available services that allow householders to opt out of being sent direct mail, such as the Mailing Preference Service.
<P>

<a name="31016w04.html_para3">We believe that this Agreement will both increase the recycling of junk mail and reduce the amount of direct mail sent to homes.

<P>
<a name="31016w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There are currently stiff penalties available under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. These offences on summary conviction can carry the statutory maximum, and on conviction on indictment, a prison sentence of up to two years or a fine or both. Defra is currently considering whether to introduce a sliding scale of penalties under section 33 to reflect the seriousness of fly-tipping offences. If magistrates do not consider their maximum fine to be high enough, a case can be referred to the Crown Court, who have unlimited powers. Penalties for environmental pollution can therefore be awarded to any level under the current system.
<P>

<a name="31016w04.html_para4">Several steps have been taken with regard to sentencing and penalties. At the end of 2002, the Magistrates Association, in association with Defra, issued a guidance pack entitled "Costing the Earth" to all its members, highlighting the seriousness and costs of environmental crime.

 It is not appropriate for the length of abstraction licences to be tied to the life of planning permissions, as consideration of each address very different issues.

 Government's policy for waste is set out in Waste Strategy 2000 <sup>1</sup> . This is underpinned by the waste hierarchy which sets out the order in which options for waste management should be considered, based on their presumed environmental impact. This prioritises waste minimisation in the first instance, followed by re-use, followed by recycling, composting and energy from waste. Disposal by incineration and landfill are at the bottom of the hierarchy. These should only be used when all of the other options have been considered.
<P>

<a name="31016w06.html_para0">The Strategy, together with Government's response to the Strategy Unit report, "Waste Not Want Not", which reviewed progress in its implementation, have led to the introduction of a wide range of measures to move waste management up the waste hierarchy. These include significant increases in the Landfill Tax, from 2005&#150;06; the introduction of Best Value Performance Standards (or statutory targets) for recycling and composting for local authorities; and the creation of the Waste and Resources Action Programme, which was launched in November 2000 to create stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and products, and to remove the barriers to waste minimisation, re-use and recycling.
<P>

<a name="31016w06.html_para1">The Waste and Emissions Trading Bill, currently going through Parliament, proposes a system of tradable allowances, reducing year on year, for the amount of biodegradable municipal waste local authorities may landfill.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what estimate she has made of the cost of promoting British branding and identity in culture, media and sport overseas in the last year for which figures are available; and what element of this expenditure promotes <i>(a)</i> Welsh, <i>(b)</i> Scottish and <i>(c)</i> Irish branding and identity as a distinct component of that of the United Kingdom as a whole.  [131945]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 There are a number of Government Departments which promote British branding abroad. DCMS provides &#163;35.5 million per annum to VisitBritain (formerly the British Tourist Authority) to promote Britain overseas as a tourist destination. In 2002&#150;03 an additional &#163;20 million was provided from the Reserve in order to help tourism recover from the impact of the foot and mouth outbreak and the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001. Funds are not allocated for individual regions of Britain. Britain is promoted as a whole in a way which maximises the impact of VisitBritain's campaigns in individual markets overseas. Tourism is a devolved matter and is the responsibility of the respective administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.

<a name="31016w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 England's tourism industry is worth &#163;62 billion a year. &#163;52 billion of which is generated by domestic tourism. In 2002 British residents took 135 million tourism trips in England. Statistics for this summer will be available by the end of November. Early indications from the industry are that it was a strong season. In April this year, VisitBritain launched a &#163;4 million 'Enjoy England' campaign to promote domestic tourism in England. Following a consultation exercise over the summer, VisitBritain will shortly be publishing its three-year domestic marketing strategy for England.

It has 27 offices overseas and it runs on-going campaigns using advertising, PR, direct mail, the internet and other marketing tools.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w09.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence identifies the costs of operations in terms of the net additional costs it has incurred. The costs which the MOD would have incurred had the operation not been undertaken&#151;expenditure on wages and salaries or on conducting training exercises, for example&#151;are deducted from the total costs of the operation.
<P>

<a name="31016w09.html_para6">For the most part, the costs incurred will be those arising from the deployment and activities of the United Kingdom's force elements in Iraq. The same principle will apply to other nations contributing forces. There may be occasions when other nations draw food or fuel from UK sources. On such occasions, those drawing the supplies will be charged at an appropriate rate to recover UK's costs. Therefore the provision of this service will not incur additional cost. There may be other occasions where other nations make use of UK transport facilities where spare capacity exists. In such circumstances, a charge will not be levied. These are all reciprocal arrangements intended to make the most effective use of resources while not disadvantaging any of the troop contributing nations. Any attempt to apportion costs for this arrangement would be impractical.

 United Kingdom forces have two types of depleted uranium (DU) ammunition: 20 mm rounds used by the Royal Navy's Phalanx Close-in Weapon System (a missile defence system); and 120 mm anti-tank rounds (CHARM 3), fired by the Army's Challenger II (CR2) tanks.
<P>

<a name="31016w10.html_para0">The Royal Navy's Close-in Weapon System does not require anti-armour properties and in recent years, a new tungsten round has been developed for it. Since 1996, all replacement ammunition for the Phalanx system has been of the tungsten variety. Some ships still carry the 20 mm DU round, however, and would fire it should the operational need arise.
<P>

<a name="31016w10.html_para1">There is currently no plan to replace the DU penetrator in the CR2 Main Armament Weapon System although a programme is being commissioned over the next three years to determine the most cost-effective means of maintaining CR2's capability.

<P>

<a name="31016w10.html_para2">To date, DU has consistently outperformed all equivalents as a kinetic penetrator when employed in anti-armour weapon systems: its use, therefore, currently offers the best operational effectiveness in this role.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Ex-Service personnel are routinely encouraged to consider rejoining the armed forces. All three services ensure that regular contact is maintained with former service personnel from the moment of discharge (and in many instances in the weeks leading up to the discharge date), when their continued value to the armed forces is fully explained to them, and for a period of time thereafter. Such has been the nature of these initiatives that in financial year 2002&#150;03, a total of 762 ex-service personnel rejoined the armed forces and for the first five months of 2003&#150;04 a further 345 former service personnel have rejoined.
<P>

<a name="31016w10.html_para5">The armed forces greatly value ex-service personnel. Those who rejoin the regular forces bring their past experience and expertise with them which is particularly useful when individuals join branches or trades currently experiencing a shortfall.

 For the purposes of answering this question, it has been assumed that the hon. Member is referring to the non-operational use of firearms by Army personnel. The relevant rules maintain that unless an individual is ordered to make the weapon ready, or he/she is about to fire, the weapon is always to be made safe; that is no live round is to be carried in the breech, and, in the case of automatic weapons, the working parts are to be forward.

 The original in-service date for the landing platform dock Bulwark was March 2003. The current planned in-service date is March 2005. There have been a number of manufacturing, project management and productivity difficulties experienced at the BAe Systems Barrow shipyard which caused slippage to HMS Bulwark's sister ship, HMS Albion.

 British military assistance to Colombia is focused primarily on Explosive Ordnance Disposal training, and provision of British military education.

 The Ministry of Defence does not generally record the details of personal injury cases brought by members of HM forces by individual Service. This information could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost. The vast majority of cases are settled amicably. Three per cent. of cases proceed to trial. The information contained in the following table is in relation to personal injury claims received from members of HM forces since 1990. There is no direct correlation between the numbers of claims received in-year and claims settled and repudiated in the same year because of the time lapsed between receipt and investigation of the claim.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

7 per cent. of sales were to people not in work (e.g. children, spouses, the unemployed and pensioners).<P>

Earned income data are derived from the Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) and consists of all income chargeable under Schedule E (mainly pay, private and occupational pensions, retirement annuities and state retirement pensions) Schedule D Cases I and II (self-employment income), and miscellaneous other earnings.<P>

The SPI is a representative sample of nearly 200,000 individuals, drawn from the Revenue's Self Assessment, Pay As You Earn and Claims systems. Where we have been able to match these individuals to the SPI, primarily those with earned income, the totals in the tables are based on this sample.<P>

Around two-thirds of stakeholder pensions taken out in their first year on the market have been by people on moderate incomes (earning under &#163;20,000 a year). This demonstrates the encouraging start that stakeholder pensions have made in offering people, particularly modest earners, a new opportunity to save for their retirement.<P>

 Relatively short duration university studies represent good value for money. Shorter tertiary courses reduce both the direct and indirect costs of the course because, other things being equal, the individual will need to spend less on tuition and their foregone earnings will be lower. Individuals enter the labour market sooner and so have more time to recoup the costs of their investment through higher earnings.

We have also discussed this issue with ASEAN and other countries and encouraged them to raise the treatment of Aung San Suu Kyi with the Burmese Junta. While Aung San Suu Kyi's release from detention to home arrest on 26 September was a step in the right direction, the regime must go much further and fully release her and her NLD colleagues and engage in genuine dialogue to reach national reconciliation.

 The UK meets its obligations under the Marine Pollution Convention (MARPOL 73/78) and the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty through strict enforcement of the Antarctic Act 1994, the Antarctic Regulations 1995 and merchant shipping legislation. This ensures that pollution in Antarctica is minimised and that waste is removed from the region for safe disposal elsewhere. The British Antarctic Survey (BAS), as the principal UK presence in Antarctica, is one of the leaders in environmental and waste management in the region. BAS has introduced stringent waste management and recycling policies and has already undertaken major clean-up and removal of its former bases. It has introduced oil spill response plans, installed a sewage treatment plant at Rothera research station and is also implementing over the next five years a sustainable energy strategy. This will reduce consumption of hydrocarbon fuels and their emissions. Furthermore, HMG ensures that all other British activities in Antarctica are appropriately permitted. Such permits set pollution and waste disposal conditions for all British vessels, aircraft and expeditions operating in the area. The UK is also in the lead among Antarctic Treaty parties pressing for the adoption of stricter guidelines for the increasing numbers of large cruise ships entering Antarctic waters.

 We monitor the human rights situation in Sudan closely. The Embassy regularly lobbies the Government of Sudan on human rights issues.

We will maintain pressure on the Government of Sudan to improve its record and will continue to raise human rights violations at every opportunity both bilaterally and as part of the EU/Sudan dialogue.

While humanitarian assistance can help alleviate suffering, only a comprehensive solution to the conflict will provide the conditions for permanent improvement in Palestinian living conditions. We are encouraging Israel and the Palestinian Authority to resume implementation of the Quartet Roadmap to this end.

 The procurement process for independent sector treatment centres involved inviting bids from a wide range of independent health care sector organisations, which included BUPA and BMI.

<a name="31016w15.html_para0">The quality of bid submissions was very high and many companies, including BUPA and BMI were able to meet the stringent clinical standards requirements that had been set. The Department, along with local national health service sponsors, was also seeking examples of: additionality of staff, to avoid any disruption to the local NHS and to ensure that the

activity provided in these units was additional to existing work being handled in NHS facilities; innovative solutions in terms of methods of working and patient experience; and value for money in terms of the costs of each procedure, and the affordability of this activity for the local NHS health economy. In order to provide fairness in the evaluation process the bids for all schemes were evaluated by a team made up from central Departmental experts in procurement and clinical practice and local NHS clinicians and managers representing the sponsors of the schemes. The resulting preferred bidders and reserve bidders were therefore chosen on the basis of the criteria and BUPA and BMI were not able to demonstrate their competitiveness on enough of these to warrant their inclusion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health whether <i>(a)</i> NHS hospitals and <i>(b)</i> diagnostic and treatment centres will be paid more than the standard tariff for operations to reflect start-up costs they may incur.  [131911]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 From this year, the Government have introduced a new financial system to provide a transparent, rules-based system for paying providers of services to national health service patients. Primary care trusts (PCTs) will commission the volume of activity required to deliver service priorities, adjusted for case-mix from a plurality of providers on the basis of a standard national price tariff, adjusted for regional variation in wages and other costs of service delivery. By 2008, all NHS providers will be required to meet tariff.
<P>

<a name="31016w15.html_para1">The Department is currently consulting on whether and how additional support above tariff should be provided for up-front revenue costs of new investment. However, we expect many of the contracts for new independent sector treatment centres to be at or below tariff. Where in the short-term we may initially pay slightly more than tariff to some independent sector providers, this is to cover start-up costs so that the new facilities open as quickly as possible to treat more patients, reduce waiting lists and bring additional clinical staff to treat NHS patients. In these cases, local PCTs commissioning care from these new units will not be disadvantaged.

 Treatment centres offer high quality, pre-booked surgery and diagnosis facilities for the treatment of routine, elective national health service patients and will not be required to have intensive care beds.

Local trusts, primary care trusts and new providers will agree protocols for referring and transferring patients who require emergency or urgent care that cannot be provided by the treatment centre.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have no plans to publish un-audited in-year financial information. All national health service trusts have been asked to plan for and achieve financial balance in 2003&#150;04. Audited information for all NHS trusts will be published in their individual annual accounts and will be available centrally in autumn 2004.

<a name="31016w16.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the planned location is of the proposed diagnostic and treatment centre for ophthalmology for Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire.  [131399]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 October 2003]:</i> The ophthalmic treatment centre for Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire will be provided through a mobile unit.
<P>

<a name="31016w16.html_para1">The unit will provide services for patients in North Oxford, Wycombe and south west Oxfordshire and as it is mobile it can be used elsewhere as the need arises. The final locations will depend on discussions between local primary care trusts and will relate to demand from national health service patients, and will be convenient for patient access.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Information is not collected on the waiting time from initial dental consultation to being operated on under general anaesthetic for a child.
<P>

<a name="31016w16.html_para2">Information is collected on how long a patient is waiting for elective in-patient admission from clinical decision to admit. Information for the specialty paediatric dentistry showing the total patients waiting and the average waiting time for this specialty by primary care trust has been placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 It is not intended that any Government Department or agency that is not involved in providing care to patients will have access to patient records via the NHSnet.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The number of foreign owned private health care providers who are or have undertaken pilot programmes within national health service trusts is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="31016w16.html_para3">There are, however, a number of primary care trusts (PCTs) who are engaged in programmes with private organisations. These organisations are providing administrative support services to help PCTs design and deliver improved health care.

<P>
<P><I>16 Oct 2003 : Column 348W</I><P>
of the Transformational Change Programme, managed by the National Primary and Care Trust Development Programme (NatPaCT), which aims to help primary care trusts redesign services. However, we do not hold centrally details of all PCTs who have entered into arrangements with private organisations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what renal dialysis services are planned for <i>(a)</i> Queen Mary's Hospital, Roehampton and <i>(b)</i> the Kingston area.  [131943]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 This is a local matter for South West London Strategic Health Authority. There is provision for renal dialysis services within the Queen Mary's Roehampton rebuilding programme, which is due to be completed in 2005. In the meantime, options for developing services in the Kingston and North Wandsworth area are being considered by the local national health service.

<a name="31016w16.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Office of the Independent Regulator</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w16.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Dobson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the <i>(a)</i> staff levels and <i>(b)</i> running costs of the Foundation Trust Regulator.  [131907]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Subject to legislation, the Office of the Independent Regulator will be established as a non-Ministerial Department, which will be accountable to Parliament but not subject to direction from the Secretary of State for Health. The Independent Regulator is responsible for structure and staffing of the Office of the Regulator. However, he or she must consult the Minister for the Civil Service on the number of staff and their terms and conditions.
<P>

<a name="31016w16.html_para4">The extent of these costs and the number of additional staff required will depend on the number of national health service foundation trusts. In the Explanatory Notes to the Bill, published in March 2003, the Department estimated that, in the first full financial year, 2004&#150;05, the running costs would be &#163;2.3 million. This estimate was based on legal and financial costs, accommodation, expenditure on information technology and the running costs for 12 staff. Final arrangements for the structure and staffing of the Office are for the Regulator to determine and, once appointed, the Regulator will develop detailed proposals and estimates.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of the comparable costs of surgical procedures carried out in national health service hospitals, diagnostic and treatment centres and under contracts with <i>(a)</i> the United Kingdom private sector and <i>(b)</i> overseas health facilities.  [131493]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department carries out an annual reference cost collection exercise. This year, for the first time, we have collected information on the cost of activity carried out for the national health service by non-NHS providers. This does not include overseas treatment or independent sector treatment centres, although this may be included in future years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> patients' reactions to piped music in NHS waiting rooms and <i>(b)</i> whether this has any therapeutic effect; and if he will make a statement.  [132420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 October 2003]:</i> The use or otherwise of piped music in hospitals is a matter for local decision making, which should reflect the views of staff and patients. We are not aware of any specific research on the effect of piped music in national health service waiting rooms.

<a name="31016w17.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the levels of knowledge among builders of the housing design needs of disabled people.  [130979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w17.html_spnew0"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 No direct assessment is made. However, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister undertakes extensive contacts with builders' organisations such as the House Builders Federation and the National House-Building Council. Officials of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister discussed with builders from time to time their understanding of the Building Regulations, including Part M, 'Access and Facilities for Disabled People'.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w17.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what representations he has received on the adequacy of Part M of the Building Regulations in securing liveable accommodation for disabled people.  [130980]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w17.html_spnew1"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 The Requirements of Part M of the Building Regulations relating to housing were introduced in 1999, and are intended to make it reasonably safe and convenient for disabled people to visit new dwellings and to use the principal storey. The provisions are expected to enable occupants to cope better with reducing mobility and to 'stay put' longer in their own homes. Such representations as the Office of

the Deputy Prime Minister receive range from those who feel Part M should not apply to dwellings to those who would like to see it extended in different ways.

<a name="31016w17.html_wqn2"><B> Huw Irranca-Davies: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the nature of representations received in the last 12 months in respect of the Buildmark warranty scheme; and what major areas of concern were expressed in these representations.  [132514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w17.html_spnew2"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer given on 6 October 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1025W.
<P>

<a name="31016w17.html_para0">The matters raised included instances where defects in homes were not detected, where claims fell outside the terms of the cover and where the resolution service offered under the scheme was unable to settle a dispute between the owner and the builder, or did so only after some delay. The number of cases brought to the attention of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is small, bearing in mind that, at any one time, there are approximately 1.5 million homes covered by the scheme. However, any instance where defects come to light in a new home after hand over, or where appropriate remedial work is not carried out promptly, is regrettable. The house building industry must work for continuous improvement in quality of construction. The Buildmark scheme is helping them to do this.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w17.html_spnew3"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Since 20 June 2003, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has received <i>(a)</i> 402 representations from hon. Members and <i>(b)</i> 182 representations from members of the public, concerning high hedges, almost all in favour of the legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w17.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated on the effect of the projected housing numbers forecast for the South East on the level of water supply; and if he will make a statement.  [131514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31016w17.html_spnew5"><B> Keith Hill: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is committed to ensuring that projected growth in housing numbers across the South East has the necessary water and sewerage services. In the growth areas, proposals for increased housing are based on studies which assess infrastructure requirements including water, and as more specific locations for growth are defined in local studies and plans, the requirements can be considered in terms of specific capacity increases required.
<P>

<a name="31016w17.html_para4">Together with regional and local partners, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has held and will continue discussions with the respective water undertakers and environmental regulators over the level of water supplies needed to meet the projected housing growth across the South East.
