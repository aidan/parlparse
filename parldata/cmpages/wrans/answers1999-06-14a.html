<a name="90614w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Boswell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry (1) what changes in primary legislation will be required to implement the revised arrangements for wholesale electricity trading;  [86880]
<P>
<UL>(2) what has been the reason for the revised date for the planned completion of the Review of Electricity Trading Arrangements;  [86881]

(3) what is the cost of the Review of Electricity Trading Arrangements;  [86882]
<P>
(4) what estimate he has made of the additional costs which will arise in <i>(a)</i> establishing and <i>(b)</i> running a revised electricity wholesale trading market; and who will bear these costs.  [86883]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Government are committed to introducing legislation to implement new wholesale electricity trading arrangements and will do so as soon 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jun 1999 : Column: 2</I><P>
as parliamentary time permits. Consequently the earliest feasible date that new trading arrangements could be introduced is October 2000. The purpose of legislation would be to provide the powers to introduce conditions into electricity licences necessary for the implementation of the new electricity trading arrangements.
<P>

<a name="90614w01.htm_para0">Offer's 1999-2000 budget for the Review of Electricity Trading Arrangements programme is &#163;11.2 million. Preliminary estimates of annual costs to implement new electricity trading arrangements for each of the first five years are &#163;10-&#163;20 million for the central set-up, &#163;60 million for participants' set-up, and &#163;30 million for participants' operating costs. These implementation costs will be met by market participants. Against this, the Government's overall programme of electricity market reforms is expected to lead to a reduction in wholesale electricity prices of at least 10 per cent. over the medium term.

<a name="90614w01.htm_para1">As is said in the discussion paper "New and renewable energy, Prospects for the 21st century", we expect the proportion of electricity from renewable sources to rise to 5 per cent. by 2003. The Government are working towards a target of renewable energy providing 10 per cent. of UK electricity as soon as possible and hope to achieve this by 2010.

<P>
<a name="90614w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Financial support for capital investment is provided in various forms, including through grants, guarantees, tax allowances and general industrial support. One of the main programmes is regional selective assistance which over the last five years in Great Britain has provided offers of grant of &#163;1.6 billion to the manufacturing sector as a whole, of which &#163;935 million was offered to foreign-owned companies and &#163;51 million to the textiles and clothing sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many written or verbal complaints were received by his Department and the Office of Fair Trading in each year from 1996 to date about (i) unfair agreement terms being applied by oil companies to operators of retail petrol sites and (ii) the actions taken by the oil companies which did not conform to the agreement signed by the operators.  [86710]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My Department and the Office of Fair Trading have received a number of complaints about agreements between oil companies and petrol retailers during 1996-99. The cost of providing an accurate breakdown of these on a year-by-year basis would be disproportionate.

This phase will assess whether Agency status remains appropriate for each of the functions undertaken by RAFSEE or whether there are other more cost effective means of delivering RAFSEE's outputs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 8 June 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>211</i>, on satellite dishes, for what reason there will be a 12-hour delay between transmission and viewing by ships' crews.  [86874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w02.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The transmissions are received by RN ships using existing military satellite communications equipment, which was not designed to take video transmissions. The band width required for normal video transmission is considerably greater than that available on our military satellite system. However, recent developments in transmission technology now allow for the broadcast of compressed video transmissions over such systems. The time taken to transit the information in this way is dependent on the available band width. The drawback of this system is that the images cannot be viewed until all the video information has been received. On occasions where there is heavy use of the system for military communications, which have priority, only a reduced band width is available for video transmission. This means that there could be delays of up to 12 hours before one hour of material for viewing can be made available to the ships' crew. The advantage of utilising the military satellite system is that coverage is achieved over sea and land, whereas commercial satellite transmissions are generally directed towards land only. Large satellite dishes can provide limited coverage for vessels at sea, such as cruise ships, but there is no room to fit such dishes on frigates.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence for what reasons the nuclear weapon exercise Dimming Sun has been postponed; when this exercise is now due to be held; and what costs have been incurred by his Department to date in organising this exercise.  [86295]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w03.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The decision to postpone the joint UK/US Exercise Dimming Sun was taken in the light of present commitments in the Balkans, including the possibility that civil agencies in Norfolk who will participate in the exercise, might receive refugees from Kosovo. This decision will ensure that key exercise objectives can be met at a later date whilst ensuring that the conduct of the exercise does not interfere with our support to NATO operations in the Balkans. As yet, no new date has been set for the exercise.

This will reduce the fragmentation of acute services, improving clinical configuration and access to specialist equipment, in high quality purpose-built accommodation. We are committed to modernising the National Health Service and this redevelopment will offer better quality treatment. There is no planned reduction in numbers of patients being cared for, although it will be possible to achieve this in very slightly fewer beds than at present (931 from 942) because of the improved acute bed facilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w03.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 A unanimous decision was made at the European Social Affairs Council on 25 May to propose a thirteen year implementation period for extending the provisions of Council Directive 93/104/EC, the "Working Time Directive", to cover previously excluded groups, including junior hospital doctors. The Council has proposed a transposition period of four years from the date of adoption before new Europe-wide minimum standards apply. These standards will provide a statutory limit to the maximum average working week. There will be a staged period of nine years after transposition, during which interim targets will apply, before the 48 hours limit is reached.
<P>

<a name="90614w03.htm_para3">The decision formally to adopt this amendment to the Directive is subject to co-decision between the Council of Ministers and the European Parliament, which is due to re-assemble this autumn.

<P>
<a name="90614w04.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Medicines (Advertising and Monitoring of Advertising) Amendment Regulations clarify and strengthen existing procedures in the control of medicines advertising. The Medicines Control Agency undertakes pre-publication assessment of advertising in exceptional circumstances only and has no intention of extending that role. Any opinion given on the suitability of the advertisement for publication is based on the information provided by the company and the current scientific knowledge and is issued without prejudice to any action the MCA may have to take against a future complaint. In the unlikely event that a complaint is received about an advertisement which officials have previously agreed is acceptable for publication the advertisement will be reconsidered taking any new information into account in reaching a decision.
<P>

<a name="90614w04.htm_para4">We have clear legal advice that the proposals are compatible with both Community law and the European Convention on Human Rights. To publish the advice itself would break with the long-standing and important principle that legal advice given to Ministers is privileged.

<P>

<a name="90614w04.htm_para8">The issue of notices under the Schedule will not be automatic--the MCA will continue, as now, to discuss problems with advertising with the company concerned so as to secure acceptable changes. There is no provision for, or purpose in, threatening to issue a notice. The formal procedures will come into play only when informal negotiation fails to reach an appropriate outcome.
<P>

<a name="90614w04.htm_para9">The remit of the Independent Review Panel will be to consider written representations from advertisers who have been issued with a notice under paragraph 3 and advise Health Ministers on the compatibility of the advertisement in question with the Advertising Regulations. The Panel will not consider the issue of notices or other procedural matters. The amending Regulations provide for the making of written representations by the company concerned but do not preclude oral hearings where these are considered appropriate by the Panel. We have no objection to the reports of the Review Panel meetings being made publicly available. Furthermore, the Medicines Control Agency has already established a working group, the Medicines Advertising Liaison Group, to provide a forum for all regulatory and self-regulatory bodies concerned with the advertising of medicines to exchange information and opinions on advertising issues.

To ask the Prime Minister when he expects to publish the Social Exclusion Unit's report on teenage pregnancies; and if he will make a statement.  [87096]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w05.htm_spmin4"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Last summer, I asked the Social Exclusion Unit to develop an integrated strategy to cut rates of teenage parenthood, particularly under-aged parenthood, towards the European average and propose better solutions to combat the risk of social exclusion for vulnerable teenagers and their children. I am publishing its report today. Copies have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="90614w05.htm_para6">The UK has the highest rate of teenage births in Western Europe. Teenage parenthood is a problem that affects every part of the country, but it is far worse in the poorest areas and among the most vulnerable young people whose expectations and aspirations are low. The health and social outcomes for teenage parents and for their children are stark and worrying.
<P>

<a name="90614w05.htm_para7">The Social Exclusion Unit has undertaken a rigorous review of the evidence both nationally and internationally. It has found that three key factors contribute to our internationally high rates of teenage conceptions: low expectations of the future among many young people; ignorance about contraception and the reality of life as a parent, and mixed messages from adults about sex and relationships.
<P>

<a name="90614w05.htm_para8">The report sets out a national programme with two specific goals: to halve the rate of conceptions among under 18 year olds in England by 2010 and to lessen the risks of young parents suffering the consequences of social exclusion by getting more teenage parents back into education, training or employment. A &#163;60 million package has been put together within existing departmental resources to support the programme for the period of this spending review, and further funding will be considered in the next spending review.
<P>

<a name="90614w05.htm_para9">At a national level, a new task force of Ministers, led by the Minister for Public Health, will be responsible for co-ordinating the policy across Government supported by an implementation unit in the Department of Health. There will also be a National Advisory Group to advise Government and monitor the success of the strategy. Locally, every Health Authority and Local Authority will be tasked to work together in preventing pregnancy and in supporting pregnant and parenting teenagers, setting local benchmarks for progress. Areas with high rates will be eligible for resources from a local implementation fund of &#163;26 million.




<P>
<P><I>14 Jun 1999 : Column: 18</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90614w05.htm_para10">There will be a national publicity campaign to reinforce the report's key messages. New guidance will be issued to improve sex and relationships education in school with an emphasis on enabling teenagers to resist pressure to have sex too early. There will be better inspection of sex and relationships education and better training for teachers. Parents will be consulted and informed more fully about sex education in schools and given more support in talking to their children about sex and relationships. Special action will be targeted on prevention for the most vulnerable groups including children looked after by a local authority, those excluded from school and young offenders.
<P>

<a name="90614w05.htm_para11">The NHS will improve access to contraceptive and sexual health services for teenagers, including young men. New guidelines will set out the counselling that should accompany contraceptive treatment for under 16 year olds and there will be publicity to tell young people that they can talk to health professionals about sex and contraception in confidence.
<P>

<a name="90614w05.htm_para12">For those teenagers who do become pregnant we will pilot a new approach to support and childcare--'SureStart Plus' pilots based in areas covered by both SureStart and Health Action Zones. In addition, five pilots outside SureStart will test other ways of providing child care for 16-17 year olds to enable them to return to education or training.
<P>

<a name="90614w05.htm_para13">Under 16 year old mothers will be required to return to education. 16 and 17 year olds will be included in the ONE pilots (formerly Single Work Focus Gateways) and will have a personal adviser to look at their options, with the emphasis on a return to education. 16 and 17 year old parents will be able to take part in the Education Maintenance Allowance pilots from September 1999. By 2003 all 16 and 17 year old mothers who cannot live with their parents or a partner will be offered supervised semi-independent housing with support, not a tenancy of their own.
<P>

<a name="90614w05.htm_para14">The right to be a parent carries with it the responsibilities of parenthood. The Child Support Agency will vigorously pursue the non-resident parents of children born to teenagers to reinforce the message that, regardless of age, they are financially responsible for their children.
<P>

<a name="90614w05.htm_para15">The target the Government have set to reduce teenage pregnancy is ambitious, but it is the least that we should set ourselves if we are to tackle a problem that has been neglected for too long.

<P>
<a name="90614w06.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Fisheries Council met in Luxembourg on 10 June. I represented the UK together with my noble Friend, Lord Sewel, Parliamentary Under-Secretary at the Scottish Office.
<P>

<a name="90614w06.htm_para0">The Council adopted proposals introducing and allocating in 1999 two new Total Allowable Catches (TACs) for North Sea spurdog and Northern prawn. It also allocated for 1999 two existing TACs for blue whiting fished in Western waters and the Bay of Biscay. The UK secured an 81 per cent. share of the Spurdog TAC and 27 per cent. of the Northern Prawn TAC. On blue whiting we negotiated an increase of 5,000 tonnes in the proposed UK allocation. A further 7,000 tonnes was allocated to the UK under the Bay of Biscay TAC with the option of taking this in Western waters as a linked stock. This makes an effective total allocation of over 42,000 tonnes and gives the UK a 24 per cent. share of the two TACs, the highest of any Member State. The introduction and allocation of these TACs will enhance the conservation of stocks in the North Sea and Western waters.

<a name="90614w06.htm_para1">I drew the attention of the Council to the significance of forthcoming scientific advice sought by the Commission from the International Council from the Exploration of the SEA (ICES) on the need for precautionary restrictions on fishing activity to protect vulnerable seabird populations which depend on sandeels. The Commission promised to work quickly on appropriate measures once the ICES advice was available.
<P>

<a name="90614w06.htm_para2">The Commission introduced its second annual report on progress in the EU in following up on the Recommendations of the 1997 Bergen Intermediate Ministerial Conference on the integration of environmental concerns in fisheries management in the North Sea. This report was remitted for further study.
<P>

<a name="90614w06.htm_para3">The Commission made an interim report on the cost benefit study it is undertaking of the EU's Third Country Fisheries Agreements and the Council adopted Conclusions urging the Commission to pursue talks with Morocco on co-operation in the fisheries sector following the expiry in November of the present EU-Morocco Fisheries Agreement.

Friend and I have separately met representatives of the Federation of Fresh Meat Wholesalers (now the British Meat Federation) and jointly met a delegation of small plant operators led by an all party group of hon. Members. I have also had meetings with a representative of turkey producers, the National Farmers Union, Dr. Richard North, and most recently a further meeting with representatives of the all party Parliamentary group. These meetings included discussions on charging, but they were not set up specifically to review the current regime.

[86422]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Genetically modified (GM) soya, maize and tomatoes were rigorously assessed for safety by the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) under a voluntary scheme, which was in operation prior to the introduction of the Novel Food Regulations in May 1997. The safety assessment for GM soya was conducted in 1994; GM maize was assessed in 1995, 1996 and 1997; and GM tomatoes in 1994, 1995 and 1997. Equivalent bodies in other member states have also assessed these foods.
<P>

<a name="90614w07.htm_para7">All the data used in these assessments have been deposited in the British Library and the relevant information to enable this to be consulted together with details of the safety assessments are contained in the respective ACNFP annual reports, copies of which can be found in the Library of the House. In addition, details of the regime operating at that time are contained in the ACNFP Annual Report for 1994. We have no information concerning other places where the data may also be found.
<P>

<a name="90614w07.htm_para8">The ACNFP conducts the safety assessment of all novel foods on a case-by-case basis. The Committee require mammalian tests where it judges this is necessary to establish the safety of a particular food. In this context, tests on mammals were reviewed by the ACNFP as part of the safety assessment for GM maize and soya.
<P>

<a name="90614w07.htm_para9">Since May 1997, all novel food assessments have been carried out by the ACNFP in accordance with guidance produced by the European Commission's Scientific Committee on Food, which applies to all member states. A copy of this guidance, which does not differ in any significant way from the regime operated under the voluntary scheme, may also be found in the Library of the House.

 All member states are subject to the EC Novel Foods Regulation and are required to conduct safety assessments of all novel, including genetically modified, foods in accordance with the guidance produced by the European Commission's Scientific Committee for Food that supplements this regulation.

<a name="90614w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 An applicant wishing to obtain authorisation to market such a product must satisfy statutory criteria of safety, quality and efficacy under veterinary medicines legislation. It is for the applicant to provide the necessary research data to meet these requirements. There is a moratorium in the European Union on the use of recombinant bovine somatotropin (BST), which is to be reconsidered by the end of this year. The moratorium allows member states to carry out limited practical tests to obtain any further scientific data that might be taken into account by the Council of Ministers when taking a final decision. No such tests have been conducted in the UK.

<P>

<a name="90614w08.htm_para4">The introduction of the climate change levy will entail no increase in overall burden of tax on business as a whole, as the revenues from the levy will be fully recycled to business via a 0.5 per cent. reduction in the main rate of employers' National Insurance Contributions. Business will also benefit from an additional &#163;50 million for schemes aimed at promoting energy efficiency and support for renewable sources of energy, such as solar and wind power.

 The key principles are that staff transferring to private sector employers under PFI and other PPP deals should continue to have access after the transfer to a good quality occupational pension scheme, under which they can continue to earn pension benefits through future service on a basis which overall is materially at least as good as they had in the public sector; and that they should have the option of transferring their accrued pension benefits to the new employer's pension scheme on terms which give them a full credit for their past service.
<P>

<a name="90614w09.htm_para0">I am issuing new guidance to Departments and Agencies today which reinforces these principles and ensures that they will be applied consistently and openly to all transfers of Government staff.
<P>

<a name="90614w09.htm_para1">The new guidance will be adopted immediately by Government Departments and Agencies. I hope that other employers in the public sector will also apply its principles to contracting arrangements where staff transfer to the private sector, and the Government will encourage and facilitate that outcome. This does not affect arrangements being made in respect of PFI and other PPPs which are already underway.

<P>
<a name="90614w09.htm_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 May 1999]:</i> The work of the Code of Conduct Group is directed at the examination of potentially unfair tax practices across Europe. Such practices can distort competition and artificially attract investment and jobs away from member states such as the UK which have more neutral tax systems. The Code should help British businesses to compete on more even terms, protect UK employment and encourage investment here.
<P>

<a name="90614w09.htm_para3">The UK measures which were on the Group's initial list are: International Headquarters Companies; special measures for the film industry; enterprise zones; 100 per cent. first year capital allowances for SMEs in Northern Ireland and roll-over relief for balancing charges arising on the disposal of ships. The current list also includes a measure relating to Independent Investment Managers, which applies to non-residents who carry on a trade of dealing in investments in the UK through an independent agent; 100 per cent. capital allowances for expenditure on Scientific Research and 40 per cent. first year allowances for SMEs.

 The new system of periodic inquiry into entitlement to Disability Living Allowance is being developed in close and continuing consultation with organisations of and for disabled people. These discussions have taken particular account of issues such as the appropriateness of the literature to be used, and the treatment of very sensitive cases, where special attention is required to ensure that the process meets the needs of the individual contacted. The consultation has been constructive and I can announce that inquiry action is now starting, with the first inquiries being issued today. Cases involving people with mental health problems and cases made on behalf of children will not be included in the inquiry process until special arrangements have been discussed with relevant organisations and appropriate training delivered to staff. The inquiry process will be closely monitored and initial evaluation will commence after six months of operation, in January 2000.

 An important part of our programme of welfare reform is the need to ensure the amount of benefit paid to claimants is correct and remains correct, and that changes which could affect benefit entitlement are properly taken into account. This means having a system of review which is fair, appropriate and sensitive to the needs of individual claimants.
<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para3">We have recently made changes to the Social Security (Adjudication) Regulations which, from 1 June, introduced a common test of reasonableness for both misrepresentation of, and failure to disclose information about disability-related changes. These changes applied to Disability Living Allowance, Attendance Allowance and 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jun 1999 : Column: 36</I><P>
benefits for people incapable of work and are intended to protect vulnerable, disabled people from an unfairness in the application of the overpayment recovery rules. They recognise that it is often very difficult for claimants to understand that gradual improvements in their medical condition, or response to new treatment which helps alleviate their problems, might have an effect on benefit. Unless it is considered that the claimant could reasonably have been expected to be aware of a fact or to have reported a change in circumstances, any resultant change in entitlement which has the effect of removing or reducing benefit will not be applied retrospectively.
<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para4">Today I am laying regulations to ensure that the same provisions to benefit sick and disabled people are carried into the new system for decision making and appeals. In addition they will be extended to cover people claiming Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit and Severe Disablement Allowance.
<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para5">The regulations also deal with the circumstances in which a decision based on a determination about incapacity for work can be reconsidered. They make it clear that when deciding whether a person continues to be entitled to a benefit awarded on basis that they are still incapable of work, the decision maker may use the findings from carrying out a further All Work Test as grounds to make a new decision. The regulations provide that where the decision maker has clear information from a new medical report provided by the Department's examining doctor, that the person no longer satisfies the conditions for entitlement, the award of benefit can be changed.
<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para6">This approach is in line with past practice which was called into question by a decision of the Social Security Commissioners. It is not expected that there will be any impact in the outcome of decisions in individual cases.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on the future of the habitual residence test.  [87147]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w10.htm_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have now concluded the review of the habitual residence test and have identified a package of measures to produce a fairer and more efficient test. The test was introduced by the previous Government to tackle the perceived phenomenon of 'benefit tourism'. However, to date the majority of people adversely affected have been UK nationals.
<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para7">It is right that our Social Security system should be safeguarded from abuse by people with little or no connection to the UK and we will continue to do this. Clearly though it is also important to ensure that income-related benefits are available to UK nationals and other nationals who have strong and legitimate links to this country.
<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para8">We believe that the package will address these two concerns. We have accepted a recent judgment of the European Court of Justice which has made it clear that people returning to the UK from an EU member state and re-establishing their ties here should be treated as habitually resident immediately upon their return.




<P>
<P><I>14 Jun 1999 : Column: 37</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para9">However we believe it would be wrong to limit this important principle to people returning from a member state of the EU and have issued guidance to staff administering the test advising them to extend the effect of the judgment to people returning from any country overseas and re-establishing their ties here.
<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para10">We also propose to legislate to add to the categories of people who are to be treated as habitually resident those people who are brought here from an area of civil unrest or who are deported to the UK. Otherwise, subject to any guidance which may be given by the House of Lords in Nessa v The Chief Adjudication Officer (1) The Secretary of State for Social Security (2), a decision on which is awaited, the habitual residence test will continue to apply to seek to prevent abuse by those who do not have the appropriate ties to this country.
<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para11">We intend also to reduce the period when habitual residence inquiries are made from five years to two years and to introduce administrative improvements.
<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para12">We will trial a standard proforma, with a view to national implementation, to facilitate a more consistent approach to information gathering and decision making on cases requiring habitual residence action. We will also monitor the effects of how the test now operates.
<P>

<a name="90614w10.htm_para13">Taken together we believe these measures will result in fairer access to income-related benefits and will streamline the administrative process, while ensuring security against possible abuse of the benefits system by those with no real links to the UK.

 The national reporting system for injury road accidents does not specifically record whether an accident took place on a "country lane". However, in 1997, the most recent year for which figures are available, 5 per cent. of injury road accidents occurred on minor <sup>1</sup> , single-carriageway roads with a speed limit greater than 40 mph. Seven per cent. of fatal road accidents occurred on these roads.
<P>

<a name="90614w11.htm_para0">Around 1 per cent. of all injury accidents and of fatal road accidents occurred on minor, single-track roads (single-lane with two-way flow) with a speed limit greater than 40 mph.

<P>
<P>

 The Driving Standards Agency has a service standard that 97 per cent. of written complaints receive a reply within 10 days and the remainder within 15 days. The Agency does not record the number of complaints about ADI check tests such as to indicate individual cases. The overall number of such complaints is small and the Agency has not felt it necessary to keep a consolidated analysis.

<P>
<a name="90614w11.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 There are several opportunities for participation as public consultation about a proposed test centre closure involves the local authority, local driving instructors, and the local Member of Parliament. The Driving Standards Agency usually holds a public meeting and notifies the local media when a closure is proposed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w11.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Driving Standards Agency publishes a quarterly magazine and sends a copy to all approved driving instructors. This provides briefing on a wide range of matters relating to driver training and testing. Driving instructors have the opportunity to give their views via regular customer satisfaction tracking surveys. Local consultative meetings are held regularly with instructors, and driving examiners responsible for conducting check tests hold weekly surgeries with instructors. The Agency sends copies of relevant consultative documents to local driving instructor associations. Since July 1998, the Driving Standards Agency has posted copies of its consultation papers on a Departmental Internet website, and the Agency plans to open its own website soon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w11.htm_spnew11"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 An appeals process already exists against a decision to remove an instructor's name from the Register of Approved Driving Instructors. The current arrangements contain safeguards for the instructor, who is not normally removed from the Register unless he or she has failed three successive check tests, the final one being conducted by an Assistant Chief Driving Examiner. After that, the Registrar's decision to remove an instructor from the Register is subject to the appeals process. Appeals are considered by an independent panel. There are no immediate plans to introduce separate arrangements to appeal against the professional judgment of an examiner conducting a check test.

 A two-year research project is underway, considering the way car driving instructors are trained and tested. This will report next year, and we shall consider the criteria used for check tests thereafter. Organisations representing driving instructors are kept informed of the emerging results and there is ample opportunity for them to have input to the research. The Driving Standards Agency changed the frequency for Grade 4 instructors to be check tested from one year to two years from 1 October 1998. Consistency of assessment in the conduct of check tests is provided by training and supervision of the examiners conducting the tests.

 The Driving Standards Agency would provide a local testing service during a temporary closure if there was not a neighbouring test centre that could ensure customer service standards were maintained, and providing there was sufficient time to arrange a temporary centre.

 Since August 1998, theory test pass certificates have been printed showing the expiry date.

The Agency is considering a further mailshot to candidates who have held a theory test pass for a significant period and who may let it lapse by mistake.

<P>
<a name="90614w11.htm_spnew17"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Driving Standards Agency consults interested parties about test centre closures when time allows. Temporary closures for operational reasons are generally caused by events outside the control of the Agency, such as roadworks or road closures or health and safety issues affecting the property. Prior consultation in these circumstances is not always possible.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w11.htm_spnew18"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Examiners who conduct check tests are especially selected from the existing examiner workforce for the purpose. They have to successfully complete a six-week training course covering the theory and practice of driving instruction. After qualification, their professional development is supported by supervision by senior staff to ensure consistency and fairness.

 <i>[holding answer 8 June 1999]:</i> Visual censuses have been conducted in the West Sussex area for a number of years by the local Deer Management Group. However, this method of census is notoriously inaccurate and the Forestry Commission have been investigating alternative methods. As part of these trials the study area in West Sussex between Eatham and Buriton was surveyed at night during April 1999 using thermal imaging equipment. The results are currently being analysed and will be available shortly.

 Methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) has been used in petrol in the United Kingdom as an octane enhancer at very low levels for many years. Directive 85/536/EEC, which came into effect in domestic legislation on 24 April 1989, stipulates that member states may not prevent, restrict or discourage the production, marketing and free movement of blended petrol which contains 10 per cent. or less MTBE by volume. Directive 98/70/EC sets a maximum limit of 15 per cent. MTBE by volume applicable from 1 January 2000. Not all petrol sold in the UK contains MTBE; where it is used the concentration typically averages less than 1 per cent.

 I strongly condemn workplace bullying. It has no place in a decent society. The Government have already in place measures to protect workers. Some instances of workplace bullying may well constitute an offence under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997. Where workplace bullying presents a risk to a worker's health, health and safety inspectors could in principal use powers under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 to require an employer to take action to protect the employee's health. No further legislative measures are planned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w14.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Macdonald </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 June 1999]:</i> There is currently no statutory training path for doctors in homeopathy in the UK, although consultants in homeopathy have been appointed in the NHS. Since 1 January 1997 it has been a requirement to be on the GMC's Specialist Register in order to be eligible for appointment as a substantive or honorary NHS consultant. Doctors holding substantive NHS consultant appointments in homeopathy before 31 December 1998 were able to apply for inclusion in the Register under transitional provisions in the European Specialist Medical Qualifications Order 1995 (as amended). New consultants in homeopathy would ordinarily expect to be trained in another medical specialty recognised for the purposes of specialist registration, as well as in the non-statutory requirements for homeopathy.
<P>

<a name="90614w14.htm_para4">The requirements for specialist medical education are governed by European Directive 93/16/EEC. The practice of homeopathy varies greatly across the EEA, and there is no provision within the Directive to recognise homeopathy for the purposes of medical training. The Faculty of Homeopathy has previously indicated its intention to develop a nationally recognised training programme in homeopathy. In order to do so, the Faculty 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jun 1999 : Column: 53</I><P>
would need to satisfy the Specialist Training Authority of the Medical Royal Colleges (STA) that the training programme met the requirements of Directive 93/16/EEC. It would then be for the STA to apply to the Secretary of State for Health for inclusion of the specialty in the European Specialist Medical Qualifications Order 1995 (as amended).
<P>

<a name="90614w14.htm_para5">In Scotland trainees are able to undertake sessions in homeopathy at the Homeopathic Hospital in Glasgow during their training in General Medicine, provided that they fully comply with the Joint Committee on Higher Medical Training curriculum in General Medicine. At present the North Glasgow Acute Trust, of which the Homeopathic Hospital forms part, has two consultant physicians with an interest in homeopathy. It also has one higher medical trainee who is undertaking sessions in homeopathy. Two general professional trainees (Senior House Officers) are also based at the Homeopathic Hospital. In the west of Scotland registrars in general practice are funded to attend courses in homeopathy if they wish, but numbers who request it at that stage are small. Once they are in independent practice, however, demand increases and homeopathy courses are accredited for reimbursement by the NHS through the Postgraduate Education Allowance for GPs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w15.htm_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government are committed to the better enforcement of financial penalties imposed by the courts. The Access to Justice Bill, currently before this House, contains provisions which will give civilian enforcement officers and approved enforcement agencies employed by the courts wider and clearer powers to execute warrants issued against fine defaulters and those who have breached community penalties. This will enable responsibility for such work to be transferred from the police to the magistrates' courts, allowing the police to concentrate on fighting crime.
<P>

<a name="90614w15.htm_para1">Also, the Government's Crime Reduction Programme includes a project which will fund work to extend successful fine enforcement techniques and encourage courts to make greater use of fines.
<P>

[86058]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90614w16.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The Secretary of State's powers to revoke the licence of any person subject to home detention curfew are set out in section 38A(1) of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, which provides that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"If it appears to the Secretary of State, as regards a person released on licence under section 34A(3) above--</FONT></UL>
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the Secretary of State may, if the curfew condition is still in force, revoke the licence and recall the person to prison."</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90614w16.htm_para2">In addition, on 1 January 1999, the Government implemented section 103 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. This means that a curfewee whose original offence was committed on or after 1 January 1999 and who is charged with a new offence committed during the home detention curfew period will be liable to have his licence revoked by the Secretary of State under section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991.
<P>

<a name="90614w16.htm_para3">The 14 curfewees referred to in the question are not liable to have their licences revoked by the Secretary of State under section 39 of the 1991 Act, as their original offences were committed prior to 1 January 1999, and there are no grounds for recall under section 38A(1) of the 1991 Act. However, breaches of licence conditions not covered by these provisions may be dealt with by the courts under section 38 of the 1991 Act and may result in a fine and/or recall to prison.

 The requirement for Local Education Authorities to contribute to the Standards Fund was allowed for in the 5.7 per cent. increase in the Education Standard Spending Assessment for 1999-2000 announced in December. Cornwall County Council's own Education Standard Spending Assessment increased by 6.2 per cent. Local Education Authorities have accepted over 99 per cent. of the Standards Fund allocations offered to them, with Cornwall accepting 100 per cent. Around two-thirds of the Standards Fund must be devolved to school level, contributing to the funds available to schools.
