Cruelty to Animals—Protection of Animals Act 1911
Causing, permitting or falling to prevent unnecessary suffering-S5.4&amp; 32(1) Animal Welfare Act 2006
<sup>(2)</sup> The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences it is the offence for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by the courts and police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(4)</sup> Staffordshire police force were only able to supply a sample of data for magistrates courts proceedings covering one full week in each quarter for 2000. Estimates based on this sample are included in the figures as they are considered sufficiently robust at this high level of analysis.
<sup>(5)</sup> Post publication revisions have been made to 2009 figures to account for the late receipt of a small number of court records.
<sup>(6)</sup> The cautions statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When an offender has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence. From 1 June 2000 the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came Into force nationally and removed the use of cautions for persons under 18 and replaced them with reprimands and warnings. These Figures have been included in the totals.

 The UK contributes to the EU Budget as a whole and not to individual spending programmes within it and there is not, therefore, a specific UK contribution to Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) expenditure. The UK's share of financing the 2011 EU Budget is currently estimated to be 12.48%, after taking account of the UK abatement. Spending, in Heading 2 (mostly CAP) of the EU Budget in 2011 is currently estimated at €56.379 billion. Agreement has not yet been reached on the 2012 EU Budget.</p>

We have decided that the evidence doesn't justify taxpayer funded maintenance of tick controls (although pet owners could choose to do so if they wish as part of wider animal welfare considerations) and we are working with veterinary and welfare organisations to ensure that those travelling with their pets are provided with the necessary advice.</p>

               <a name="11091225000243"> Other non-endemic parasites posing a serious threat to public health (e.g. Leishmaniasis) are transmitted by insect vectors such as some species of sandfly which are not established in the UK. As such, there is negligible risk of the disease becoming established in the UK and there is no evidence to suggest we should introduce controls now.</p>

 No direct discussions have been held with the Commission's Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) as it deals with checking compliance with legislation that has already been implemented. We continue to press the EU Commission to act and act quickly to bring in additional enforcement measures to protect UK complaint producers. Simply relying on FVO Missions and infraction proceedings against non-compliant member states will not be enough to deal with the commercially negative impact that any non-compliance would cause.</p>

AHVLA is carrying out inspections of all laying hen premises in the UK to determine producer’s plans for 2012 and the level of conversion to date.

 The works in Bridge street are part of a project to provide improved security around the Northern Estate. It is being implemented by Westminster city council with funding by both Houses of Parliament. The project was endorsed by the Joint Committee on Security, and follows similar work elsewhere in Whitehall. Business case approval was given by officials in accordance with established procedures. The cost for the whole project was capped at £5.7 million, and the current forecast is within this limit.

               <a name="11091234000049"> ACE took part in a competitive procurement exercise to award new contracts for online and telephone family support services. Unfortunately, ACE’s bid was not as strong as others and the Department was not able to award a contract to them. Nearly 40 organisations submitted expressions of interest for contracts to operate family support services and these were predominantly from charities. We are not able to fund all the organisations that submitted bids.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 8 September 2011]:</i> Local authorities have a duty (under section 6 of the Childcare Act 2006) to ensure that there is sufficient child care locally to meet the needs of working parents and particularly families with disabled children. We want to improve the way in which local authorities keep parents informed about what they are doing to deliver this duty. The Government announced in the “Families in the Foundation Years” statement, published in July 2011, the intention to bring forward proposals that local authorities should report annually on their section 6 sufficiency duty, and in particular how they are supporting families of children with disabilities to access child care, available at:</p>

               <a name="11091234000125"> Local authorities have told us that the requirement (under section 11 of the Childcare Act 2006) to publish nationally prescribed sufficiency assessments every three years is burdensome. The Government consider that a local annual report would be a more effective way of enabling parents to hold their local authority to account. The Government have therefore also decided to consult on bringing forward legislation to repeal the section 11 duty. This consultation will be published on the Department for Education’s website later in the autumn.</p>

The data are estimates; they are weighted and grossed up to the total number of active providers in England to ensure the figures are representative of providers throughout England. These grossed up figures are not exact and are subject to margins of error.
<sup>(2)</sup> Percentages are rounded up to nearest whole number. The number of children's centres between the 2008 and 2009 surveys remained unchanged at around 2,900 centres. Therefore, the proportion of children's centres offering full day care remained stable.

The EIG enables the provision of pre-school services, such as children's centres, to be tailored to best meet the needs of local communities, taking account of evidence of what is most effective.

 When carrying out an appraisal of a project or policy, the Green Book sets out options that should be adjusted for material differences in tax. Differences in tax receipts between PFI and conventionally funded projects are considered as part of HM Treasury's Value for Money model which is run by the Department for each PFI project at the appraisal stage. The output of the model is one source of information that is used to inform the overall value for money assessment of the project.</p>

 The Department for Transport does not currently collect data on people undertaking paid or unpaid work experience. However, as part of the civil service wide 'Get Britain Working' programme, the Department has made a pledge to offer 1,000 Work Placements over the coming year. These will take place across all agencies and the central Department. Each placement will be two weeks in length and will be offered to jobseeker’s allowance customers aged 18 to 24. Eligible individuals will be those whose limited experience of work is acting as a barrier to employment. Although these placements will be unpaid in terms of departmental funds, candidates will still be in receipt of their benefits while in post. Any additional travel required as part of the candidate's placement (e.g. to and from the Business Skills Workshops) will be organised and paid for by the Department.

               <a name="11091234000278"> The Department considered that the scale of the total capital funding requirement, circa £2 billion, was beyond the capacity of the existing UK rolling stock leasing organisations, i.e. the ROSCOs. Consequently the Department included requirements for financing which, while including the ROSCOs as a potential source of funds, allowed a wider funding group to participate in the Thameslink competition. Ultimately this may lead to a more competitive train leasing market in the UK through the introduction of new funders.</p>

 It is standard practice for a number of internal processes to be worked through before an announcement is made. This was a significant announcement that other Government Departments needed to be fully aware of before it was announced. Given the significance of this announcement it clearly would not have been appropriate to make it during the parliamentary Whitsun recess, which added further to the delay.</p>

They will be afforded minimum rights, support and protection to a level similar to that they would receive as a victim of crime in the UK. The directive will allow UK citizens to move throughout the EU with confidence that should they fall victim to crime in any member state, their rights will be respected when participating in criminal proceedings and they will be able to access a minimum level of support across the EU.</p>

 The Government have made clear that all those committing human rights abuses and atrocities in Libya must be brought to justice. The UK led the drive for referral of the situation in Libya to the International Criminal Court in UN Security Council Resolution 1970 and called for a special session of the Human Rights Council which set up the Commission of Inquiry into Libya. The Commission reported systematic abuse of civilians, including evidence of excessive use of force, a pattern of enforced disappearances, and deliberate destruction and attacks on medical transports and facilities by Gaddafi forces.

 As recognised by the Committee of Public Accounts Forty-Third report of Session 2010-12, the chain by which military operations, such as those in Afghanistan, are supplied with essential equipment and supplies would be much more efficient if directed by a modern information system supported by appropriate skills and procedures. A comprehensive programme is under way to replace the current ageing and obsolete logistics information systems with new capabilities including the Future Logistics Information Services project (which will replace the base inventory systems), the Management of the Joint Deployed Inventory (MJDI) system (for deployed assets) and the Joint Asset Management Engineering Solution (JAMES) (to improve the management of land equipment).</p>

This will see a major step change in the support chain and materiel accounting, with a rationalised modern base inventory and warehouse service with easier reconciliation with the Ministry of Defence's finance systems.</p>

 Resettlement assistance is offered to all early service leavers, regardless of their age. This includes a briefing at unit level on all the services and organisations that are in a position to help them in their transition to civilian life and guidance on accessing the services available through the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) to which, as ex-service personnel, they have early access. DWP services include an interview by trained consultants, access to online job search facilities, practical guidance on creating and updating CVs, identifying transferrable skills and training opportunities, professional help in completing job applications and development of interview skills with the aid of expert staff.

 In February 2011, officials from the Department for International Development (DFID) in Ethiopia participated in a multi-agency assessment of villagisation (now officially known as the Commune Programme) in the Gambella region of Ethiopia.

I also discussed these issues with a number of Sudanese Ministers during my visit to Sudan in May. DFID does not route any funding directly through the Government of Sudan. We currently provide most of our funding through large multi-donor pooled funds managed by UN agencies. DFID officials in Khartoum work with the relevant ministries within Government of Sudan to help them identify and address the development needs of the country.

 The Government are scaling back the proposed Vetting and Barring Scheme to common-sense levels by reducing the scope of regulated activity and limiting barring to those who work in, have worked in or will work in regulated activity. Child protection remains paramount and the most serious offences will still lead to automatic barring. It is not possible to make the estimate requested, as not all sexual offences will result in barring either now or in the revised scheme.</p>

 As part of our package of reforms to civil litigation funding and costs, alongside the removal of recoverability of conditional fee agreements, success fees and after the event insurance premiums, there are a number of reforms to assist claimants in the new regime. There will be an increase of 10% in damages for non-pecuniary loss such as pain, suffering and loss of amenity. In personal injury cases, including clinical negligence, there will be a cap on the amount of damages that may be taken as a success fee. The cap will be set at 25% of the damages awarded other than those for future care loss. This will help protect claimants' damages, and is particularly important in clinical negligence claims, where the damages for future care and loss can sometimes run into many millions of pounds. Qualified one way costs shifting, which is to be introduced in personal injury including clinical negligence, will protect the vast majority of claimants from having to pay the defendant's costs if they lose.</p>

1. Displayed figures are subject to rounding.
2. Establishments are categorised in these tables by their main role as at the end of 2009-10. Establishments that have more than one role have been placed in the category that represents the primary or dominant function of the prison. For this reason, performance of prisons within a category cannot necessarily be compared on a like for like basis.
3. There are two unit cost measurements. The ‘direct resource expenditure’ includes costs met locally by the establishments. The ‘overall cost’ includes prison-related overheads met centrally by NOMS, for example, property costs (including depreciation and cost of capital), major maintenance, prisoner escort and custody service (relates to transporting prisoners) and central HQ overheads.
4. YOI refers to young offender institutions.
5. Data for Elmley, Standford Hill and Swaleside are reported under the Sheppey cluster. Similarly, data for Blakenhurst, Brockhill and Hewell Grange is reported together as a cluster. Data for Parkhurst, Camp Hill and Albany are reported under the Isle of Wight cluster.
6. Cookham Wood changed from a female closed prison to a male juvenile prison in October 2007. Data for 2009-10 is shown under the category male juvenile.
7. Dover and Haslar are not included as they are immigration removal centres operating under Detention Centre Rules 2001.
8. Lindholme includes Lindholme IDC. It is a split site, part category C training prison and part immigration detention centre.
9. The following expenditure is not included:
A one-off impairment charge of £525.05 million as a result of the revaluation of land and buildings.
Operation Safeguard (use of police cells).
Cost of capital on assets in the course of construction (£22.47 million).
Project, operating and commissioning costs totalling £2.71 million at HMPYOI Isis, as the establishment was not opened during the course of year.
10. Private prisons and public prisons are included. The unit costs are not directly comparable because of different methods of financing.
11. For certain prisons the unit cost is not typical, because they are in the process of change (e.g. Bure was building up capacity during the year).

 Employability skills are essential to ensure that employers can recruit the talent they need to enable sustainable economic growth, social mobility and to help build the big society. Employability skills vary by the age of a person, the point at which they leave the education system and the requirements of employers in different sectors. There are a number of Government programmes to support employability. As part of our skills strategy, aimed mainly at those aged 19 and over, the Government are funding literacy and numeracy courses for those adults who lack these basic skills. We plan to maximise the economic and personal returns of this training following a review of basic skills provision currently under way, and we will be taking the necessary steps to make it more effective. Functional skills qualifications in English, mathematics and information and communications technology will become mandatory components of all apprenticeships frameworks by September 2012 replacing key skills as part of the programme. Unemployed people on active benefits can access skills training fully funded by the Skills Funding Agency to improve relevant labour market skills, including their employability skills, where this is appropriate to help them get sustainable employment.</p>

 The data we hold centrally shows the total amount of income each HEI receives each year in new endowments given in that year, and income received on existing endowments already invested. It also shows the total value of endowments held by each HEI each academic year to 31 July 2008, 2009 and 2010. The table showing this data for the three most recent years available will be placed in the Libraries of the House. These figures are consistent with the published accounts for all HEIs.

               <b>Mr Davey:</b>
 Applications for registration as the owner of land on the basis of adverse possession can be divided into two types. First, there are those where the land concerned is unregistered and the application is to register the squatter as the first “registered proprietor” (in other words, the first registered owner). Secondly, those where the land has already been registered and the application is to register the squatter as the new registered proprietor.</p>

               <a name="11091246001192"> Land Registry does not have reliable statistics for the first type of application. One of the main reasons for this is that it is not unusual for these “first registration applications” to be made on more than one basis. For example, the title deeds may not be entirely clear, and so, while Land Registry is satisfied that the applicant can properly be registered as proprietor and completes the application, it might not be clear whether he or she has a “documentary title” (the land involved falling within the extent covered by the title deeds) or a “possessory title” (the land falling outside the title deeds but the applicant having acquired title by virtue of adverse possession). Such an application may well not be recorded as being an adverse possession application.</p>

 There have been no recent failures in the HM Revenue and Customs' online service for filing Company Tax Returns. There is, however, a live issue in that the service will not be updated until October 2011 to take account of the rate reductions that took effect when the Finance Act received Royal Assent on 19 July 2011. This is to avoid the risk of service disruption from implementing a large number of changes to HM Revenue and Customs' online systems at the same time. The Department is working, as a matter of high priority, to reduce the level of risk so that any future changes can be implemented without unnecessary delay for companies that want to file their Company Tax Returns early.</p>

 It is important that banks have procedures in place to verify both the identity of their customers, and the identity of people acting as guardians and deputies on behalf of their customers. Identity checks make it more difficult for fraud to occur, and so help to protect consumers. The Financial Services Authority (FSA) does not have specific rules on the procedures banks should take to verify identity, though the Government recognise that measures taken need to be proportionate to the risks posed, as well as being effective.</p>

1. Numbers of tests and diagnoses are adjusted for missing GUM clinic data in 2010.
2. Data are sourced from the GUMCAD report (2010). Due to different data collection and publication dates, GUMCAD data presented is one quarter behind the NCSP data.
3. GUM clinic chlamydia diagnoses include C4A and C4B and C4C (complicated and uncomplicated chlamydia) only.
4. The chlamydia tests reported are from sexual health screens performed at GUM clinics which include testing for Chlamydia,
<i>Community Chlamydia Testing Data:</i>
1. The NCSP offers opportunistic chlamydia screening to those aged 15 to 24 years attending a variety of non-GUM clinic settings. NCSP figures therefore include diagnoses among 15 to 24-year-olds only.
2. Data presented are based on all tests with confirmed positive chlamydia test results including partners/contacts as well as index cases.
3. The NCSP also collects data from laboratories on numbers of diagnoses made in those aged 15 to 24 years tested outside registered NCSP settings and GUM clinics.
4. Reporting of "Non-NCSP/Non-GUM" returns began in April 2008.
5. Numbers of tests and diagnoses are not adjusted for missing Non-NCSP/Non-GUM data in 2011.

 The Department's “End of Life Care Strategy” (2008) makes clear the responsibilities of the national health service to ensure adequate support for hospices, including through stronger commissioning and adhering to the principles of the “Compact Code of Good Practice”. The Department made £286 million additional funding available to help implement the strategy over 2009-10 and 2010-11. Hospices were in a good position to work with the NHS to secure some of this funding to deliver many of the initiatives recommended in the strategy. As part of this funding, the Department made available a £40 million capital budget for hospices in 2010-11 to support improvements to the care  environment</p>

 Guidance is available from the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on the safety and efficacy of endovenous laser treatment of the long saphenous vein, and on the circumstances in which general practitioners should consider referring patients with varicose veins to specialist services. The Department's elective care commissioning pathway for varicose veins, published in 2009, refers to NICE's referral guidance and to the use of endovenous laser treatment as a possible alternative to surgery for some patients.</p>
