 The terms of the debate on energy have changed in recent years.

It is also recognised that urgent action is required in both areas. Our public consultation on nuclear power found much support for our view that the evidence argues that nuclear power should be part of the solution to these challenges, although I recognise that not everybody shares this view.</p>

 Different orders and EC directives mean that the UK Government cannot define the period during which a foreign registered vehicle is exempt from the requirement to be registered and licensed with DVLA.

We do recognise that people do not necessarily want lap-dancing establishments in their neighbourhoods and we want to ensure local authorities have the powers to reflect the views of local people when considering applications. We will therefore consider whether or not lap-dancing clubs should fall under the category of sex encounter establishments under the Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982 and legislate if this is necessary.</p>

For this we rely on the International Labour Organisation (ILO), which estimates the number of children working in the mining sector to be over 1 million worldwide. DFID supports the International Labour Organisation (ILO) to help countries implement core labour standards that include the elimination of child labour. We are also working with the ILO and civil society organisations to promote efforts to remove children from all hazardous labour.

 Approximately 17 per cent. of the 44 weeks of instruction an officer cadet receives at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst is devoted to counter-insurgency tactics and operations.

 Most National Challenge schools serve areas where pupils are more likely than average to come from deprived backgrounds&#151;for example as shown by eligibility for free school meals. Nonetheless, since there are many schools in similarly adverse socio-economic conditions where more than 30 per cent. of students gain five or more higher level GCSEs including English and mathematics, local deprivation should not be seen as an excuse for low achievement, but important content in assessing the level of support needed to improve academic standards.</p>

 I have had many discussions, and received a range of representations on, the early learning goals in the Early Years Foundation Stage. The early learning goals are developmental milestones for children at the end of the EYFS, most of whom are aged five and over. The very strong consensus is that the majority of the goals are pitched appropriately, but some representations have questioned two specific goals on aspects of early literacy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_233"><a name="80630w0020.htm_para0"><a name="0807013000051">The fact is that around a third of children already achieve those two goals, and evidence shows that children who develop well in the Foundation Stage go on to do well in primary school.

These include Family Intervention Projects, the Parenting Early Intervention Programme, Respect Parenting Practitioners and funding for at least one new Parenting Expert in every local authority to provide evidence-based parenting programmes for parents of children who are considered to be at risk or those parents with problems that are known to put their children at risk.</p>

The Academy is providing training and support to increase the number of practitioners who can deliver evidence-based parenting programmes, particularly to vulnerable parents. They are also working closely with other third sector organisations to improve the availability and quality of parenting support across England.</p>

This includes structured parenting programmes, support groups, counselling and helplines. Parenting services for some of the country's most vulnerable, including teenage parents, disabled parents and families facing break up are to get a share of up to &#163;8 million in 2008-09 through the Parenting Fund.</p>

 The annual school sport survey collects data relating to participation in PE and sport by five to 16-year-olds in England. This enables us to measure progress towards our PSA target to have at least 85 per cent. of pupils doing at least two hours high quality PE and sport each week by September 2008. Currently, 86 per cent. of young people are doing the two hours.

A Building Research Establishment Environmental Assessment was not carried out because the project principally comprised a strip out of existing floors and creation of newly-configured office space and did not involve stripping the building back to its core, nor overhauling the main building plant.

 Requests made by patients under the provisions of section 10 of the Data Protection Act 1998 must be considered on a case by case basis. The Act makes it clear that a section 10 request should only be overridden where the purpose served by processing the data is sufficiently important to warrant doing so even where it is accepted that substantial harm or distress is being caused. We do not expect there to be many, if any, circumstances where this would arise in the case of an individual who is competent to make decisions. However, there may be circumstances, for example, where there are serious child protection concerns, where a doctor might feel that a parents request to opt a child out of having a summary care record is not in the best interest of a child.</p>

1. Nursing and midwifery figures exclude students on training courses leading to a first qualification as a nurse or midwife. Includes GP practice nurses.<br>
2. In 2006, ambulance staff were collected under new, more detailed, occupation codes. As a result, qualified totals and support to ambulance staff totals are not directly comparable with previous years.<br>

 Information about average waiting times for different types of cancer treatment, including radiotherapy, is not collected centrally.

They are a maximum wait of 31 days from diagnosis to first cancer treatment and a maximum wait of 62 days from urgent referral for suspected cancer to first cancer treatment. In the last quarter (January to March 2008), performance against these standards in England was 99.5 per cent. and 96.8 per cent. respectively.</p>

We have made the case throughout for a clear text consistent with the 13 existing sectoral counter-terrorism conventions as well as with international humanitarian law. A comprehensive convention could contribute to a more unified global response to terrorism and we will work closely with our European allies and other international partners to try to reach agreement in the next round of negotiations this autumn.</p>

 The Protection from Harassment Act was introduced primarily to tackle stalking. A research study published by the Home Office in August 2000 showed that it was being used to deal with a variety of behaviour other than stalking, including domestic and inter-neighbour disputes. There has been no research into the use of the Act specifically in relation to the internet but the law applies to online as well as off-line behaviour and we know from press reports that it has been used to convict people of harassment committed through that medium.</p>

 It is already an offence under section 72 of the Sexual Offences Act 2003 Act for a British citizen or UK resident to commit sex offences overseas against children under the age of 16 providing that such acts are also offences in the country where they are committed.</p>

1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income data, which is sourced from the Family Resources Survey.<br>
2. The reference period for Household Below Average Income figures is single financial years.<br>
3. Up to 2005-06, a child was defined as anyone aged under 16 or anyone aged 16 to 18 who is not married, in a civil partnership nor living with a partner, who is living with parents and who is in full-time non-advanced education or unwaged Government training. From 2006-07, this definition was extended to include 19-year-olds fulfilling these conditions to be in line with child benefit eligibility.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#147;Households Below Average Income&#148; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#145;equivalised&#146;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
5. Net incomes have been used to answer the question. This includes earnings from employment and self-employment, state support, income from occupational and private pensions, investment income and other sources. Income tax payments, national insurance contributions, council tax/domestic rates and some other payments are deducted from incomes.<br>
6. The median income is the income of the middle person in the population, such that half the population have incomes below the median and half the population have incomes above the median. The median is used instead of the mean income because the mean is affected by outlying cases with very high income values. This is consistent with relevant public service agreement indicators and the &#147;Households Below Average Income&#148; publication.<br>
7. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
8. Figures have been presented on both a before housing cost and after housing cost basis. For before housing cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for after housing cost they are. This means that after housing cost incomes will generally be lower than before housing cost.<br>
9. Number of children have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children, while proportions of children have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br>
10. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
11. A working family has been defined as one where at least one adult is in work, either through being self-employed, working full-time or working part-time.<br>
12. Families are defined as a single adult or couple living as married and any dependent children, including same sex couples (civil partnerships and cohabitees) from January 2006. A household is made up of one of more families.<br>

</td></tr></tbody><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="7"><i> Notes:</i>  1. These statistics are based on Households Below Average Income data.  2. The reference period for Households Below Average Income figures is single financial years.  3. Up to 2005-06, a child was defined as anyone aged under 16 or anyone aged 16 to 18 who is not married, in a civil partnership nor living with a partner, who is living with parents and who is in full-time non-advanced education or unwaged Government training. From 2006-07, this definition was extended to include 19-year-olds fulfilling these conditions to be in line with child benefit eligibility.  4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or "equivalised") for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.  5. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.  6. The Government's preferred measure of relative low income poverty is defined as being in a household with a household income of less than 60 per cent. of contemporary median income.  7. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are. This means that After Housing Cost incomes ill generally be lower than Before Housing Cost.  8. Numbers of children have been rounded to the nearest 100,000 children, while proportions of children have been rounded to the nearest percentage point. Ages have been split into four bands because of sample sizes. Total numbers of children are in line with National Statistics mid-year estimates.  9. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>

 HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) have too much office space and are engaged in a review programme to decide which offices should be retained as best suiting its future business needs. The two HMRC offices in Truro have been grouped in a cluster for review purposes with those in Falmouth, Redruth and St. Austell, and proposals were published on 11 June 2008. Both Truro offices have been proposed for vacation, but final decisions are not expected until later this year. Detailed feasibility work on how much HMRC might expect to save by the proposals is still at an early stage, but potential estate cost savings alone are estimated to be in the region of &#163;180,000 per year.</p>

The review is expected to result in a formal report, which will highlight best practice and allow UK Border Agency managers to work more closely with airport authorities and airlines to ensure that such occurrences are minimised.

 Full juxtaposed immigration controls were established at the Eurostar terminal at Paris in February 2004 and at the terminal in Brussels in October 2004. Since then, a total of 123 staff have been posted to these locations. Staff are posted from the UK for periods of between two and three years with their numbers being supplemented by staff who are posted on a short term basis.</p>

Although an exact figure is not available, some 50 staff have already taken advantage of this assistance. There is no requirement at present for staff to take a formal examination although this is currently under review.

 The Civil Service Management Code and the Overseas Compendium dictate that staff posted from the UK to work abroad are placed on the same salary scales as their equivalents working in central London, receive any applicable London allowances, as well as a 'Cost of Living Allowance' (COLA) to provide for the increased cost of living at post. These allowances are regularly reviewed and fluctuate in line with exchange rates and cost of living movements.</p>
