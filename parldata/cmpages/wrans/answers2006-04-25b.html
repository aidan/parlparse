<i>[holding answer 18 April 2006]:</i> The Animals Act 1971 currently has the effect of placing strict liability on the owner of animals that cause harm whatever the circumstances. This appears to be inconsistent with current liability law in other areas which allows for a general defence of reasonable care. The Government have acknowledged that there may be a case for an amendment to the Animals Act and expects to launch a consultation shortly on this matter.

 Local authorities have a duty under Part IV of the Environment Act 1995 to review and assess the current, and likely future, air quality in their areas. Where local authorities consider that one or more of the nationally prescribed air quality objectives for each of the seven pollutants is unlikely to be met by the relevant deadline, they must declare an air quality management area (AQMA), covering the area where the problem is expected. These local authorities must then take action, along with other agencies and organisations, to work towards meeting the air quality objectives.

In light of the conclusions of the Detailed Assessment, Kingston declared an Air Quality Management Area (AQMA) in respect of nitrogen dioxide, in August 2005. Kingston is currently developing their air quality action plan, which will set out measures to work towards meeting the air quality objective.

 H5N1 avian influenza was confirmed in a sample from the partially decomposed body of a Whooper swan found on the causeway at Cellardyke, Fife, Scotland. The swan is the first case of H5N1 detected in a wild bird in the UK and our current hypothesis is that it originated outside Great Britain. Ongoing intensified surveillance across the UK has not identified any other positive live or dead wild bird. There is also no evidence that the virus is present in domestic poultry.

 Most recent data from the Environment Agency (2002&#150;03) indicate that 44 per cent. of waste produced by business in England and Wales was recycled. This level of recycling exceeds what is being achieved for household waste, and is up from 37.5 per cent. in 1998&#150;89.

The Government have identified a need for further action on recycling by businesses and producer responsibility makes an important contribution to increasing recycling. The policy is aimed at ensuring that businesses take responsibility for the environmental impact of products that they place on the market, particularly once they become waste. Recent waste legislation, such as that implementing EC directives on packaging and end-of-life vehicles, places various requirements on producers, including recovery and recycling targets.

<i>[holding answer 24 April 2006]:</i> Good progress continues to be made in assembling the land for the Olympic Park. More than 80 per cent. of the land needed is already in public authority control. The London Development Agency (LDA) is responsible for the process of land assembly and its preferred option for acquiring land continues to be through reaching private agreements with landowners. Given the size and complexity of the site, the LDA has decided that it is necessary to exercise its powers of compulsory acquisition so as to be sure of securing possession of the land when required. A Public Inquiry for this Compulsory Purchase Order will begin on 9 May 2006.

 For 2005&#150;06, the Schools Formula Spending Share (FSS) system was used to distribute resources for nursery education between local authorities. The formula for under 5s used pupil numbers, weighted for deprivation, area costs and sparsity to divide up the overall total of resources for under 5s. That resulted in a unit of funding for under 5s of &#163;2,980 for Nottinghamshire. For 2006&#150;07, the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) replaced Schools FSS, and &#163;82 million was added to the total of DSG to fund the increased entitlement for nursery education from 33 weeks to 38 weeks per year. DSG has a single unit of funding for all pupils from 3 to 15: the baseline figure for Nottinghamshire for 2005&#150;06 was &#163;3,246 per pupil; and the figure for 2006&#150;07 is &#163;3,457 per pupil, which takes account of the additional funding for the increased entitlement for nursery education.

<sup>(5)</sup> School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(6)</sup> Combined local authority and school based expenditure includes all expenditure on the education of children in local authority maintained establishments and pupils educated by the authority other than in maintained establishments. This includes both school based expenditure and all elements of central LA expenditure except youth and community and capital expenditure from revenue (CERA). Certain elements of central local authority expenditure cannot be attributed to a particular phase of education and consequently a sector breakdown is not available. Pupil figures include all pre-primary pupils, including those under 5s funded by the authority and being educated in private settings (only available from 1999&#150;00), pupils educated in maintained mainstream schools and any other local authority maintained pupils. All pupil numbers are adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

Notes:<br>

2004&#150;05 figures are as reported by local authorities in their section 52 outturn statements as at 20 April 2006 and are subject to change. All figures are shown in cash terms and rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

The exercise also enabled governments from 15 nations to co-ordinate their efforts to address potential future weapons of mass destruction proliferation threats. Effective joint international action helps to address maritime security for UK shipping outside UK territorial waters.

The UK supports this approach and in 2005&#150;06 provided &#163;5.25 million to support the Government of Afghanistan&#039;s eradication effort. In particular, the UK supported the Ministry of Counter Narcotics targeting work to identify priority areas for eradication and provided equipment, including tractors and all-terrain vehicles.

To date, one grant has been approved by the Fund, which received some 30 proposals in its first two months of operation. It was anticipated that the Fund would disburse up to &#163;3 million of British and Swiss funds over its three-year life, with some &#163;400,000 allocated for the 2006&#150;07 financial year.

<p><i>(b)</i> Trained staff within the Health and Personal Social Services (HPSS) in Northern Ireland offer a wide range of support to the bereaved. This is in addition to the services available from voluntary, community and church organisations. In July 2005 the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety (NI) published a &quot;Careplan for Women who Experience a Miscarriage, Stillbirth or Neonatal Death&quot;.

 As set out in the formal Government response to the autumn 2005 consultation on pension scheme rules, the pensions industry overwhelmingly supported the option of introducing, from April 2007, a new regulated activity of establishing, operating or winding up a personal pension scheme. This new activity will cover independent trustees of self-invested personal pensions. Industry also overwhelmingly agreed with Government that it was sensible not to rush through this regulation before April 2007.

In the last local government finance settlement, we confirmed our commitment to continue the carers grant beyond 2006. Until at least the end of the 2007&#150;08 financial year, provision for the grant will be &#163;185 million a year.

<a name="stpa_70">In reply to your parliamentary question about the Child Support Agency, the Secretary of State promised a substantive reply from the chief executive. As he is currently unavailable, I am responding on his behalf. Please accept my apologies for the delay in responding to your question.
You asked the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many parents have been found to have been avoiding paying the rightful amount of child support in <i>(a)</i> Tamworth constituency <i>(b)</i> Staffordshire <i>(c)</i> the West Midlands and <i>(d)</i> the UK in each year since 1997.We cannot provide the information at the requested constituency or county level. We have some information at West Midlands level, but only in relation to cases under the old scheme until 2003. All other data is given at GB level, as the CSA does not cover Northern Ireland cases.There are a variety of ways in which a non-resident parent could potentially avoid paying the right amount of child support. For example, an NRP could:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">Refuse to provide information about their income or circumstances.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_41">By refusing to provide this information they are preventing the Agency from performing a maintenance calculation/assessment and could thus be said to be avoiding paying the rightful amount of child support. Where a parent consistently refuses to provide this information, the Agency may impose an Interim Maintenance Assessment (old scheme) or a Default Maintenance Decision (new scheme). Information on the number of DMDs and IMAs imposed by the Agency is attached as Table 1.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_42">Under-declare their income and assets. Doing this may result in the establishment of a lower liability for child maintenance than should otherwise have applied, had the NRP&#039;s true income and assets been declared. In this case the parent with care may then apply for a departure or variation (old and new rules respectively) from the standard formula, on the basis that the non-resident parent&#039;s lifestyle is inconsistent with the income they are declaring to the Agency. Limitations with management information means that the number of variations applied for is not available. However, the number of departures applied for is attached as Table 2.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_43">Failure to pay the full assessed amount of child maintenance. An NRP who does not pay the full maintenance liability due to them is clearly avoiding paying the rightful amount of child support. The number of NRPs who do not pay the full liability for which they have been assessed is attached as Table 3 and 3.1, relating to GB and west Midlands respectively.</p>

As part of this duty, EROs will be required where necessary to make house-to-house inquiries to ensure completed registration forms are returned for all eligible persons.

Operational guidance on planning for a pandemic was originally published in May 2005 and provides planning checklists for NHS organisations to inform and develop their plans. The Department continues to work with strategic health authorities to ensure that robust and resilient human influenza pandemic plans are in place across England and is currently reviewing operational approaches to the delivery of health care to ascertain whether further operational guidance may be helpful in support of local planning.
