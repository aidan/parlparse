On the basis of the findings and conclusions of the analysis, we announced further work to investigate what can be done in the short to medium term to improve the level of service provided by the existing Crossing.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_373"><a name="91111w0001.htm_para8"><a name="09111143000069">The study recommended further work on two possible measures, recognising that each had the potential to generate some small benefits by increasing throughput while avoiding impacts on safety. The first set of measures could see changes to the configuration of the toll plaza, signing and promotion of DART-Tags to see whether this would improve traffic flows. The second set of measures could entail one-way tolling with the removal of the southbound plaza to allow a larger improved northbound plaza. This work is being taken forward and is expected to take 12 to 18 months to complete.</p>

 Two knife amnesties were held in 2006 resulting in over 1,500 potentially lethal weapons being disposed of. Based on feedback from the agencies involved, and given the number of weapons disposed of, my assessment is that the amnesties have been very effective. In the period since I have focused on the development of an educational and preventative strategy including a knife awareness campaign, delivered through schools, on the dangers of carrying knives. In April along with the Department of Education, PSNI and Crimestoppers we delivered a series of drama workshops called 'Choices'. 54 schools, involving around 4,000 pupils took part and were able to use a knife crime information pack as part of the citizenship curriculum. A second programme is running in the week commencing 9 November aimed at year 12 pupils (15 to 16 years of age).</p>

Over the period that the answer covers, the Army have been committed on operations in not only Afghanistan and Iraq, but also have deployed in the Balkans, Northern Ireland, Cyprus and the Falkland Islands. When determining which units to allocate to operations, a number of considerations apply, not least the particular capability they offer. For example, those units which have deployed to Afghanistan will predominantly be those that operate in a light role.</p>

Determining amputations related to action specifically in Helmand would be complex and would at the very least necessitate interrogation of individual records. Even this would not be definitive as wounded could arrive at any one of many field hospitals, potentially including those outside Helmand. At the same time, casualties evacuated from Helmand field hospitals could have been wounded elsewhere. Consequently, obtaining verified data would be problematic and any data provided could not be relied upon.</p>

 The use by our armed forces in Afghanistan of all equipment types is kept under constant review to ensure that they continue to meet operational requirements. This includes the use of Snatch vehicles. Operational commanders have repeatedly stressed the importance of having a range of vehicles from which they can select the most appropriate for specific tasks. This includes a lighter, smaller and more agile patrol vehicle, such as the Snatch 2A and Snatch Vixen Land Rover. But to ensure that our personnel have the best possible protection, a strengthened variant of the vehicle, Snatch Vixen-Plus, is being procured for delivery to Afghanistan next year.

So only those who have failed to claim on arrival will be required to travel to Croydon to make their asylum application. The decision to designate Croydon ASU as the single site for applicants to lodge a claim for asylum reflects this fact. It also reflects the fact that the impact on Croydon is not expected to be dramatic as Croydon ASU has the capacity and existing infrastructure to screen the limited numbers of applicants that are expected to lodge an asylum claim at ASU Croydon once ASU Liverpool is re-designated. Before the change Liverpool ASU were booking on average between five&#151;10 appointments a day. This is the number of extra people who will be expected now to make their claim in Croydon. It is therefore considered that the effects on Croydon would be minimal, particularly as a partial appointment system has been introduced which allows increased opportunity to manage the flow of intake into the ASU.</p>

Those asylum applicants who are destitute will be accommodated away from London and the South East and there are transitional arrangements to take account of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children claiming in Liverpool. Once these transitional arrangements have ended, there should be minimal financial affect on Croydon borough council as the UK Border Agency fully funds the council on a per day basis for each UASC they are responsible for.

An analysis by age group is not available.</p>

<sup>(1)</sup><i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup><i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
The IC10 diagnosis code for pleural plaque is 392.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup><i> Primary Care Trust (PCT) of Responsibility</i><br>
A derived field providing the primary care trust responsible for the patient. Commissioning responsibility for individual patients rests with the PCT with whom the patient is registered. This means that patients with a GP in one PCT area may reside in a neighbouring or other area but remain the responsibility of the PCT with whom their GP of registration is associated. PCTs are also responsible for non-registered patients who are resident within their boundaries.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup><i> Strategic Health Authority (SHA) of Treatment</i><br>
This field is derived from the hospital provider code (procode). It indicates the SHA area within which the treatment took place.<br>
<i> Small numbers</i><br>
To protect patient confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional number (the next smallest) has been suppressed.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

This disposal was introduced as part of the Government&#146;s strategy to tackle low-level, antisocial and nuisance offending. It has been designed to provide officers with a means of dealing with simple, straightforward cases in a prompt and effective way, saving police time, reducing bureaucracy and reserving courts for more complex cases.

When a defendant has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence. From 1 June 2000 the Crime and Disorder Act 1988 came into force nationally and removed the use of cautions for persons under 18 and replaced them with reprimands and warnings. These are included in the totals.<br>

 During the past five years all public sector prisons have had at least one change of governor in charge. It is the policy of the National Offender Management Service to move governors to different types of establishment to enhance their experience and for reasons of self development.

 Automatic release at the half way point of sentence was introduced by the Criminal Justice Act 1991. Prisoners who are sentenced to six months therefore normally serve three months in prison. Adult prisoners sentenced to less than 12 months are not subject to supervision by the probation service on release from custody. However, they are &#145;at risk&#146; of return to custody by the courts, to serve the unexpired portion of the sentence, if they commit an imprisonable offence before the expiry date of the original sentence. Young offenders (those under the age of 22 released from a term of detention in a YOI) are subject to a minimum of three months supervision. Juveniles prisoners sentenced to a Detention and Training Order are supervised as part of the conditions of these sentences.</p>

 The issue of security keys in prisons is subject to careful monitoring with reconciliation and checks undertaken regularly. Stringent procedures are in place to ensure security keys are returned by all staff each time they leave prison establishments. Any failure to return security keys or to take them outside of the prison is considered a serious breach of security. This risk will be assessed and could result in a full or partial re-lock of the prison where it is felt that the key suite has been seriously compromised.</p>

 In May 2009 NOMS' consulting engineers, as part of the due diligence process, produced an environmental report on the former Dynamex site in Caernarfon in order to assess potential liabilities and constraints associated with ground contamination. The exercise included a review of existing reports which were based on previous tests on the soil. This evidence formed the basis of the assessment rather than carrying out further soil tests.</p>

 In line with Government policy across the public sector, probation boards and trusts are expected to meet efficiency requirements in order to maximise the value for money that they provide. These are focused on reducing back office functions and management overheads and maintain the priority given to resourcing front-line delivery. Boards and trusts are being supported by a national programme of specifying probation work and of benchmarking performance and cost to set clear standards for delivery and remove unjustified variation in costs. This programme, together with the intelligent use of probation work load data, enables local areas to manage the demands placed on individual staff more effectively.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_685"><a name="91111w0031.htm_para4"><a name="09111186002791">The Specification, Benchmarking and Costing Programme in NOMS has already identified a number of operational efficiencies.

1. These statistics are based on households below average income, sourced from the Family Resources survey. The Family Resources survey is available in the Library.<br>
2. Small changes should be treated with caution as these will be affected by sampling error and variability in non-response.<br>
3. The reference period for households below average income figures are single financial years. For the North East, three years of data have had to be combined due to small sample size.<br>
4. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#145;Households Below Average Income&#146; (HBAI) series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or &#145;equivalised&#146;) for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
5. For the households below average income series, incomes have been equivalised using Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) equalisation factors.<br>
6. Numbers of children in low income have been rounded to the nearest hundred thousand.<br>
7. Proportions of children in low income have been rounded to the nearest percentage point.<br>
8. The 1998/99 median income threshold has been held constant in real terms before applying this to the 2007/08 households below average income data.<br>

 The Government provided assistance, including funding, to establish the International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR) in 2004 as a vehicle for promoting dialogue and resolving conflict among member states. In late 2008 the ICGLR provided a forum for discussion between the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, and their neighbours in the wider region, on the problems of the eastern DRC. The ICGLR can play a role as a facilitator in bringing the countries of the region together, but real progress depends on the will and commitment of the leaders of the countries involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_849"><a name="91111w0046.htm_para0"><a name="0911126002405"><i> Letter from Mel Groves:</i></p>
<a name="91111w0046.htm_brev0"><a name="0911126003701"><ul><p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your question asking which Jobcentre Plus offices closed in each of the last six years are under consideration for reopening. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Acting Chief Executive of Jobcentre Plus.</p>
</ul><a name="91111w0046.htm_brev1"><a name="0911126003702"><ul><p class="tabletext">I have provided this information at Annex A.</p>
</ul><a name="91111w0046.htm_brev2"><a name="0911126003703"><ul><p class="tabletext">Since April 2002, when Jobcentre Plus was created by the merger of the former Employment Service and Benefits Agency, Jobcentre Plus has continued to refocus and transform the way it delivers its services. These transformation programmes have improved the quality and breadth of customer service, as well as the environment in which it is delivered. Customers no longer have to go to two separate offices&#151;often on the same High Street&#151;to receive help with both benefits and jobsearch. This has allowed us to rationalise our estate to provide excellent High Street coverage and a single, integrated customer facing office, at the same time reducing cost to the tax payer.</p>
</ul><a name="91111w0046.htm_brev3"><a name="0911126003704"><ul><p class="tabletext">Our approach to closure of a customer-facing Jobcentre is one that takes into account a range of issues, for example, the impact closure may have on customer service, and whether the work and staff can be relocated. When we are looking to withdraw our services from a location we are committed to full consultation with our customers, partner organisations, Trade Unions, staff, and local Members of Parliament.</p>
</ul><a name="91111w0046.htm_brev4"><a name="0911126003705"><ul><p class="tabletext">The great majority of our services (in common with most large, modern organisations) are now delivered through the telephone and internet. For example, to give customers more convenient access we have around half-a-million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. However, Jobcentres continue to provide an essential service&#151;especially to those customers most in need of tailored help.</p>
</ul><a name="91111w0046.htm_brev5"><a name="0911126003706"><ul><p class="tabletext">In addition to our network of modernised Jobcentres, we aim to make our services accessible to customers by providing a range of support through outreach, often delivering advisory and other support on Partner's premises. That is particularly important in locations where maintaining a Jobcentre could not be justified. Typically, such services can be delivered in partnership with Children&#146;s Centres, or on Local Authority premises, or in conjunction with one of our Welfare to Work Providers.</p>
</ul><a name="91111w0046.htm_brev6"><a name="0911126003707"><ul><p class="tabletext">Jobcentre Plus Customer Service Directors have reviewed their existing service delivery arrangements in meeting the challenge of the current economic climate, taking into account the planned welfare reform changes for the next two to three years. This review took into account the latest known information on the expected increase in business and customer volumes. This exercise has identified that some Jobcentre Plus offices currently face capacity pressures. These pressures will be met through a range of solutions.</p>
</ul><a name="91111w0046.htm_brev7"><a name="0911126003708"><ul><p class="tabletext">We have embarked on a programme of converting or extending our existing buildings where necessary, and widening our network of outreach facilities to make our services more accessible to customers. We are supplementing these measures by operating extended opening hours in some locations where the need for this is identified locally. This includes some offices opening to the public on Saturday.</p>
</ul><a name="91111w0046.htm_brev8"><a name="0911126003709"><ul><p class="tabletext">This programme is primarily focused on those buildings where we provide a face to face service for members of the public, but we are also implementing solutions across our network of Benefit Delivery Centres and Contact Centres to ensure they are equipped to meet any capacity challenge.</p>
</ul><a name="91111w0046.htm_brev9"><a name="0911126003710"><ul><p class="tabletext">The vast majority of sites affected have sufficient internal space which could be made available to enable capacity increases. The work to be carried out is of a temporary nature to ensure Jobcentre Plus has the flexibility to review the estate requirement in future.</p>

<i> [holding answer 9 November 2009]:</i><i> </i>Jobcentre Plus is equipped to offer advice to everyone who is looking for work. While most people find work relatively quickly and need only a little support from Jobcentre Plus others will require far more help. This is provided through a structured process of regular jobsearch reviews and support from our personal advisers on opportunities to help overcome things that may be making it harder to find work.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_852"><a name="91111w0046.htm_para3"><a name="0911126002435">As part of this, we have enhanced the package of support provided to people with extra support prior to redundancy, when they are newly unemployed, and at the six and 12 month points of their claim including a subsidy for employers, voluntary work and help to set up a business. For customers facing redundancy we have increased funding for the Rapid Response Service which is delivered in conjunction with partner organisations in Coventry and Warwickshire. This ensures that local resources are clearly targeted and includes areas such as  <br>

skills assessments and short training as well as jobsearch programmes to help people move quickly into employment and training.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_853"><a name="91111w0046.htm_para4"><a name="0911126002436">To coincide with the national launch of &#147;Backing Young Britain&#148; in July this year Jobcentre Plus in Coventry engaged with 25 key local employers, partners and stakeholders to secure their personal commitment to offering jobs, apprenticeships, work trials, work experience, internships and mentoring advice. We have also launched the Future Jobs Fund, worth around &#163;1 billion, which aims to create at least 100,000 new jobs for those aged 18-24 nationally. A further 50,000 jobs will be created in areas of high unemployment and all customers, irrespective of their age, will be eligible.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_854"><a name="91111w0046.htm_para5"><a name="0911126002437">In Coventry 29 per cent. of jobseeker&#146;s allowance customers are aged between 18-24 years old. There have been a wide range of organisations from the public, private and voluntary sectors who have made successful bids. To date approximately 8,000 jobs have been identified in the West Midlands.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_855"><a name="91111w0046.htm_para6"><a name="0911126002438">In October 2009, we also introduced the flexible new deal. The flexible new deal is delivered by contracted service providers working in partnership with Jobcentre Plus. In Coventry and Warwickshire these are Serco and Pertemps.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_856"><a name="91111w0046.htm_para7"><a name="0911126002439">Within the 12 months of starting on flexible new deal, jobseekers will undertake a minimum of four weeks of either full-time employment or continuous mandatory full time work-related activity. Jobcentre Plus will deliver early stages of the regime (before customers are referred to a provider), pay benefits and maintain contact with the customer through fortnightly signing. The flexible new deal gives providers the flexibility to deliver a more personalised and tailored service to the individual employment and skills needs of long-term jobseekers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_857"><a name="91111w0046.htm_para8"><a name="0911126002440">Jobcentre Plus in Coventry is working closely with a range of employers in both the public and private sectors in securing local employment partnerships (LEPS). LEPs are a key tool in supporting people from disadvantaged communities back into work. Jobcentre Plus work closely with customers, employers and partners to tailor a programme to ensure that individuals are job ready. Coventry city council is one of the leading public sector LEP recruiters and the HSBC processing centre in Coventry recently won the West Midlands 2009 LEP &#147;Unlocking Talent&#148; award.</p>

They will remain entitled to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. We also committed as part of Backing Young Britain to increase the number of graduate and non-graduate internships available to young people, with 10,000 internship and work experience opportunities for non-graduates, and a total of 20,000 graduate internships.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_859"><a name="91111w0047.htm_para1"><a name="0911126002506">The Budget announced a guaranteed offer of a job, work-focused training, or meaningful activity to all 18 to 24-year-olds before they have reached the 12 month stage of their claim to jobseeker&#146;s allowance. The substantial new work experience opportunity will be available through the introduction of the Community Task Force, in early 2010. Under the Six-Month Offer in place since April 2009 for all jobseekers reaching six months receipt of jobseeker&#146;s allowance there is a voluntary work placement option.</p>

For those aged 18 to 24 entering New Deal for Young People mandatory work experience will begin after 10 months of unemployment. For those entering New Deal 25 Plus mandatory work experience commences after about 21 months. In Flexible New Deal there is no age distinction and work experience can begin at the outset of the provision as part of personalised support.</p>

 The preferred method for reporting on the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance is the Jobcentre Plus Administrative System, which provides the source for the official claimant count figures published by the Office for National Statistics each month in the Labour Market Statistical Bulletin.

To bridge the gap for existing jobseeker&#146;s allowance customers at April 2009, and take account of the former New Deal 25 Plus customers in these areas being referred to Flexible New Deal providers earlier, revised contractual arrangements were agreed with existing New Deal (including Private Sector-led) and Employment Zone providers.</p>

5. Statistical group is a hierarchical variable. A person who fits into more than one category will only appear in the top-most one for which they are eligible. For example, a claimant of disability living allowance and jobseeker&#146;s allowance would appear in &#147;Jobseeker&#148;, not in &#147;Disabled&#148;.<br>

Employment and support allowance replaced incapacity benefit and income support paid on the grounds of incapacity for new claims from 27 October 2008. Prior to this, the &#147;incapacity benefits group&#148; referred to claimants of incapacity benefit (including credits only) or severe disablement allowance including people claiming income support on the grounds of incapacity.<br>

1. This information is available in the public domain at:<br>
www.nomisweb.co.uk<br>
2. Data are unrounded.<br>
 3. Changes to Jobcentre Plus vacancy handling procedures have led to a major discontinuity in the vacancy statistics pre and post May 2006. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
 4. These are not whole economy figures. Coverage relates just to vacancies notified to Jobcentre Plus and as such represent a market share of vacancies throughout the whole economy. This proportion varies over time, according to the occupation of the vacancy and industry of the employer, and by local area. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>
 5. Notified vacancies&#151;uses monthly data on the inflow of newly notified vacancies to Jobcentre Plus.<br>
 6. The stocks of live unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open.<br>
