estimated that there were 540,000 displaced people in Eastern Burma. Of
these, 340,000 were living in ceasefire areas; 108,000 were in State
Peace and Development Council (SPDC) relocation sites; and 92,000 were
hiding in conflict areas. DFID&#146;s approach to providing
assistance to these IDPs has been to work inside Burma&#151;including
assistance through local civil society groups (DFID has established
effective relationships with a range of ethnic minority and other
groups), through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC),
and by trying to improve access to displaced people to benefit from our
project activities. These are not the only mechanisms through which
donors can help (many, for example, fund cross-border teams operating
from Thailand) but they enable access to IDPs who would not be reached
by any other means, and through mechanisms which are much less-well
supported by other
donors.</p><p><a name="0606266000053">However, these
extremely vulnerable people are very difficult to access&#151;both

Border Consortium, a Thailand-based non-governmental organisation which

comprised approximately 340,000 people in temporary settlements in
ceasefire areas administered by ethnic nationalities, 108,000 villagers
who had been evicted by the Burmese Government and moved into
designated relocation sites and 92,000 civilians hiding from the
Burmese Army in areas most affected by armed conflict. The recent

Thomas</b><i> [holding answer 19 June 2006]: </i>The
Government believe that disabled people must be included in efforts to
reduce poverty and achieve the internationally agreed millennium
development goals (MDGs). We recognise that the needs of disabled
people must be addressed across all the MDGs to ensure their
achievement in an inclusive
manner.</p><p><a name="0606266000111">The
Department for International Development's (DFID) approach to
disability is set out in an Issues Paper&#151;&#147;Disability,
Poverty and Development&#148;&#151;published in 2000; copies of
which have been deposited in the Libraries of the House. DFID seeks to
take account of disability issues across all its activities, as well as
supporting a specific range of activities to empower disabled people.
In September 2005, DFID also published a policy paper on social
exclusion, entitled &#147;Reducing Poverty by tackling Social
Exclusion&#148;; again, copies of this document have been deposited
in the Libraries of the House. This sets out actions that DFID is
taking, or plans to take, to tackle the social exclusion faced by many
poor people, including disabled people, to make a real difference to
their lives.</p><p><a name="0606266000112">The
Government are actively supporting the drafting of a United Nations
International Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.
The purpose ofthe convention is to enable disabled people
across the world to have the same access to human rights protection as
non-disabled people. If the convention is adopted, it will enable
governments to be called to account for their record on protecting
disabled people from human rights abuses and help raise the profile of
disability issues worldwide.</p><p><a name="0606266000113">DFID also seeks to work with our
international partners&#151;including UN agencies, the World Bank and
partner governments&#151;to gain further support for tackling issues
of disability and other forms of social exclusion. However, we do not
believe this requires the creation of a new MDG and furthermore, it
could also detract from efforts to mainstream disability issues across
all the MDGs.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606266000010">Water and

DFID's bilateral expenditure is allocated to specific Input Sector

water and sanitation initiatives are so cross-cutting, this approach is
not sensitive enough to identify all expenditure in this area. DFID has
therefore done further research to produce a more detailed analysis of
its water and sanitation expenditure. DFID does not allocate its
multilateral aid by sector, but we have taken steps to estimate this
for water and sanitation. Based on these figures, DFID's total
expenditure on water and sanitation was &#163;221 million in 2003-04,
an increase from &#163;147 million in 2002-03.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 9W</b><br><p><a name="0606266000128">In response to

&#163;47.5 million in 2004-05 to &#163;95 million in 2007-08. We
anticipate that meeting the commitment will require an increase in

occurred when a northbound Victoria Line train was held in the tunnel

00.30 am on Tuesday 30 May. This was the penultimate passenger service
on the day. The problem required the traction current to be switched
off and when repairs were completed normal passenger services had
ceased and engineering hours started on the line. Delays then occurred
as due to safety procedures the current could not be switched back on
to move the train until it was confirmed that no workers were on the
line. Eventually passengers were taken off the train and walked back to
Highbury and Islington station before 03.00
am.</p><p><a name="06062622000277">HMRI and London

should ensure that protracted delays in detraining passengers do not
occur in the future. HMRI will continue to monitor the effectiveness of
these and other procedures which relate to the evacuation of passengers

Actuary's Department projections, employment would now need to increase
by more than 2.5 million in order to achieve 80 per cent. in the long
term. This is because the Government Actuary's Department has increased
their projection of the "working age"
population.</p><p><a name="06062622000337">We are
currently considering the implications of this population change.
However, our long-term aim of80 per cent. employment is
unaffected, and the commitments in the Green Paper to reduce by one
million the number on incapacity benefits, help 300,000 lone parents
into work and increase by one million the number of older workers will

Disability Living Allowance&#148; covering the period 2004-05. The
&#145;customer error&#146; overpayment figure includes around
&#163;580 million (7.9 per cent. of DLA expenditure) which was
removed when reported in the Departmental Resource Account. These were
cases where the change in customer&#146;s needs may have been so
gradual that it would be unreasonable to expect them to know at which
point their entitlement to DLA might have changed. These cases do not
result in a recoverable overpayment as we cannot quantify or define
when the customer&#146;s change occurred. Because legislation
requires the Secretary of State to prove that entitlement to DLA is
incorrect, rather than requiring the customer to inform us that their
needs have changed, cases in this subcategory are legally
correct.<br>4. Incapacity

eligible for help from new deal 25 plus. People who have been claiming
jobseeker's allowance (JSA) for 18 months and who have not previously
participated on new deal 25 plus, are already required to attend the
gateway stage of the new deal25 plus programme. This is a
period of up to four months of intensive job search and specialist help
and support to improve job prospects. This is followed by the intensive
activity period (IAP) which is currently voluntary for people aged 50

help people return to
work.</p><p><a name="06062622000479">Since
April 2004, we have been piloting mandatory participation in the new
deal 25 plus IAP for people aged 50 to 59 who have been claiming JSA
for18 months. The pilot has offered people in this age group
more extensive help back to work. Kingston and Surbiton was not part of
the pilot, however, interim pilot data have yielded positive results
and, as announced in our Welfare Reform Green Paper, we will be
commencing a phased national
rollout.</p><p><a name="06062622000480">Between 1979
and the mid 1990s, the number of people on incapacity benefits trebled.
Growth in the caseload has since slowed significantly, and in November
2005, there were 2.71 million people claiming incapacity benefits, a
fall of 61,000 over the year. Although 46 per cent. of those claiming
incapacity benefits are aged between 50 and state pension age, between
2000 and 2005 the number of people in the 50 plus age group fell by
52,000. This has contributed to the overall reduction in the incapacity
benefits
caseload.</p><p><a name="06062622000481">Like
other age groups, people aged 50 or over who are on IB will be able to
benefit from the rollout of the successful Pathways to Work service
across the whole country which will be completed by 2008, including
Kingston and Surbiton. Pathways offers new IB customers early support

be important, particularly in our most deprived communities. The
Department&#146;s priority is to ensure that all initiatives are more
effectively targeted at those with the greatest degree of labour market
disadvantage. This means that we constantly have to review our
programmes and services to ensure that they provide good value for
money and continue to meet the needs of our customers. Area-based
initiatives such as Action Teams and the Working Neighbourhoods Pilot
have, to date, helped over 170,000 people in some of our most deprived
communities move into
work.</p><p><a name="06062622000485">Many of the
practices and ideas developed by Action Teams have been integrated into
Jobcentre Plus mainstream programmes and services. Examples include
outreach work in local communities and the greater discretionary
funding that is available to advisers. We also aim to build on lessons
learnt from the recent Working Neighbourhoods
Pilot.</p><p><a name="06062622000486">Our successful
Pathways to Work pilots have been acknowledged internationally as the
best way of helping people on incapacity benefits back into work
quickly and many of the pilots are located in areas with high levels of
incapacity benefit claims. Much of the success of Pathways is directly
attributable to the partnership approach at the local level with strong
advocacy from local partners, access to a wide range of specialist
expertise, and a unified complementary approach. It is this partnership
approach that we are extending further with our Cities Strategy.
Private and voluntary sector providers currently deliver and support a
number of different programmes within our Pathways to Work pilots. We
will shortly be announcing the future roll-out of
Pathways.</p><p><a name="06062622000487">Our future
strategy will build on the success of Action Teams, and other
community-based initiatives; including the introduction of a Deprived
Areas Fund (DAF) from October 2006, which will provide Jobcentre Plus
with the flexibility to decide how funding could add value locally
against a continued central objective of increasing the employment rate
in the local areas. This fund will enable districts to target resources
where they are most needed. Funding will be allocated at a district
level, to enable Jobcentre Plus District Managers to exercise greater
discretion over how the funding should be utilised in their area. DMs
will use their knowledge of the local labour market, coupled with
evidence of &#145;what works&#146; to support the needs of local
residents.</p><p><a name="06062622000488">Partnership
working with local government is especially important to DWP in
promoting the economic vitality of localities. Local area agreements
(LAAs) have been devised to provide a common and simple framework that
leads to central Government, local authorities and partners agreeing
local outcomes.</p><p><a name="06062622000489">On 16
March 2005 the Chancellor announced the Local Enterprise Growth
Initiative (LEGI). Its purpose is to release the economic and
productivity potential of the most deprived local areas through
enterprise and investment&#151;thereby boosting local incomes and
employment opportunities and building sustainable communities. The
proposed fund will distribute up to &#163;50 million per year for
2006-07 rising to &#163;150 million by 2008-09, and will be

individual efforts and resources, with a strong focus on outcomes
combined with greater opportunity for local flexibility and innovation.

Laws:</b> To ask the Secretary of State for Work
and Pensions in what circumstances a credit will be awarded towards a
qualifying year for <i> (a)</i> the basic state pension and state second
pension, <i> (b)</i> the basic state pension only and <i> (c)</i> the
state second pension only, if the proposals in the May 2006 White Paper
&#145;Security in retirement: towards a new pensions system&#146;
are implemented in full; and which credits will apply on a weekly

[76607]</p><p><a name="06062622000909"><b><a name="06062622001285">James
Purnell:</b> The White Paper &#145;Security in retirement:
towards a new pensions system&#146; (Cm 6841) sets out a package of
proposed reforms. It includes a number of measures which would help to
make the system more flexible, and make national insurance credits more
valuable, and more
generous.</p><p><a name="06062622000910">The proposed
reduction of the number of qualifying years needed for a full basic
state pension to 30 is a very significant change that makes the system
more flexible; it allows people to undertake a variety of activities
during their working lives, and still be able to build a full basic
state pension. This would be particularly beneficial to
women.</p><p><a name="06062622000911">Credits
would be made more valuable by removing the first contribution
condition, so that credits count towards pension entitlements in
exactly the same way as paid contributions for the first time. This
clearly signals that social contributions are rewarded and recognised
by society in the same way as paid work. The credits would be awarded
on a weekly basis only to the extent needed for the year to become a
qualifying
year.</p><p><a name="06062622000912">In
addition to making credits more valuable, the credits system would be
made more comprehensive and generous, by reforming home
responsibilities protection into a weekly credit and introducing new
weekly credits for parents and carers&#151;aligned in BSP and S2P and
these would count towards satisfying the qualifying years in the same
way as paid contributions.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 63W</b><br><p><a name="06062622000913">Assuming the White Paper

as autonomous bodies, are responsible for determining what advice
should be provided to their students on plagiarism, and also what
policies should be in place to detect plagiarism and determine
disciplinary action. The Quality Assurance Agency's Code of Practice
and the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC) provide advice and
guidance to institutions on dealing with this issue. JISC includes on
its Plagiarism Advisory Service website a list of well-known European
and US essay bank websites, to make academics and teachers aware of
these sites. In addition, last November the Qualifications and
Curriculum Authority appointed Professor Jean Underwood of Nottingham
Trent University to advise them on further measures which might be
taken in schools and colleges and by awarding bodies to reduce the risk
of plagiarism from internet
sources.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606271000088">Learning and Skills

October included the decision for the Learning and Skills Council (LSC)
to cease funding provision from 2006-07 that is rightfully the
responsibility of employers, such as health and safety training. This
was part of our commitment to rebalance responsibilities between
learners, employers and the state as well as ensuring that we direct
resources to enable those without the basic skills for employability to
receive the support they
need.</p><p><a name="0606271000891">Following wide
consultation on these changes the LSC has considered representations
from key stakeholders and has agreed to allow some local discretion in
2006/07 to provide limited support for this provision depending on the
assessment of need. Where this provision is part of a coherent
curriculum offer supported by a clearly stated rationale then the
provision will remain eligible for LSC
funding.</p><p><a name="0606271000892">The LSC is

[79442]</p><p><a name="0606271000976"><b><a name="0606271001477">Mr.
Dhanda:</b> Anyone concerned that a child may be a
&#147;child in need&#148;, whether as a young carer or for any
other reason, should refer the case to local children&#146;s services
for an initial assessment. Children and their families are also able to
make such contact
direct.</p><p><a name="0606271000977">Section 1 of
the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 provides that at the
time a local authority assess a person&#146;s needs for community
care services or assess the needs of a disabled child, an individual
who provides or intends to provide a substantial amount of care on a
regular basis for that person has the right to request an assessment of
his ability to provide and continue to provide care. The authority must
take that assessment into account when making any decision about
services for the cared for person or to meet the needs of the child, as
the case may be.</p><p><a name="0606271000978">The
Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 (&#147;the 2004 Act&#148;)
makes three principal changes to the law with the objective of
providing further support for carers and helping to ensure that they
are not placed at a disadvantage because of the care they provide.
First, the Act requires local authorities to inform carers, in certain
circumstances, that they may be entitled to an assessment. Second, when
undertaking a carer&#146;s assessment, the local authority must
consider whether the carer works, undertakes any form of education,
training or leisure activity, or wishes to do any of those things. The
effect of this is that the local authority will have to ask the carer
about those activities during an assessment, and then take this into
account when making the decision about whether the needs of the cared
for person call for the provision of any services by them. Third, the
Act provides for co-operation between local authorities and other
bodies in relation to the planning and provision of services that are
relevant to
carers.</p><p><a name="0606271000979">Guidance makes
clear that children who are carers should routinely be assessed under
the ChildrenAct 1989. The Children Act 1989 already gives
local authorities a duty under schedule 2, paragraph 1(2) to publicise
their services to families with children in need and to take steps to
ensure that those who might benefit from the services receive the
information.</p><p><a name="0606271000980">The 2001

Government have recently announced an additional &#163;45 million
funding for targeted youth crime and ASB prevention activities for
those young people at most risk. This increase in funding means that
all YOTs now have dedicated money to spend on prevention. Programmes
are delivered by a range of multi-agency staff, including youth
workers, enabling a wide variety of experience and expertise to be
brought together. The new funding has been allocated to local YOTs and
areas are beginning to deliver new prevention services from June
2006.</p><p><a name="0606271001179"><b><a name="0606271001558">Ann

Sutcliffe</b><i> [holding answer 21 June 2006]:</i> The
overall allocation from the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to Youth
Offending Teams (YOTs) for prevention programmes totals &#163;59
million, which includes existing Youth Inclusion Programme (YIP)
funding of &#163;14 million, as well as the &#163;45 million of
additional funding. The additional funding was allocated differently in
England and Wales, as the Welsh Government became involved in devising
the formula for the
latter.</p><p><a name="0606271001181">For the 138
YOTs in England, the allocation was based on the same funding formula
as that used for the core support grant to YOTs. This formula weights
each area's allocation according to the following elements: 10 to 17
population (40 per cent.); size of area (10 per cent.); six deprivation
indices, including income and employment (50 per
cent.).</p><p><a name="0606271001182">For the 18 YOTs
in Wales, the allocation was based on a new funding formula devised by
the All Wales Youth Offending Strategy Group. The formula weights each
YOT&#146;s allocation according to the following elements: 10 to 17
population (50 per cent.); sparsity (low population density, leading to
difficulties accessing services and greater cost of providing them)
(13.33 per cent.); five deprivation indices including income,
employment, health, education and housing (26.66 per cent.); caseload
(10 per cent.)</p><p><a name="0606271001183">In some
areas, YOTs were already receiving money for specific prevention
programmes (YIPs) from an existing funding
stream.</p><p><a name="0606271001184">When the new
funding formula was applied, the effect in these areas would have been
to reduce the overall funding allocated to prevention. To avoid this
and to allow them to begin to develop additional prevention services,
funding for the affected YOTs was adjusted so that they all received an
amount of at least &#163;20,000 more than they were previously
receiving.</p><br><notus-date day="26" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>26 Jun 2006 : Column 123W</b><br><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="0606279000001">Communities

often benefiting areas outside of the constituency within which the
group securing the grant is based. It is not therefore practicable to
produce a list of constituencies which have received the highest level

private sector dwellings that are returned to occupation or demolished
each year as a direct result of action by the local authority.
Information, comprising local authorities' returns for Best Value
Performance Indicator 64 for 2004-05 has been placed in the Libraries

brought back into use or demolished by Luton council was 11. However,
the variance in the overall size of the private sector housing stock,
and the proportion of these houses which can be defined as empty, will
differ between each local authority area and therefore, the indicator

the Residential Development on Greenfield Land Direction requires local

for the provision of houses or flats on five hectares or more on

State with an opportunity to check general compliance with the guidance
set out in national planning policies, and to consider whether an
application should be called in for her own determination.</p><p><a name="0606279000874">Regional policies to protect

Spatial Strategy (RSS) for the North West of England, formerly known as

enhancing urban living. The continued and extensive use of green belt
policy is an essential tool. The RSS says that the case for exceptional
substantial change to green belt will need to be established by a
strategic study and that, in turn, will inform a future review of RSS.
It says that there will be no need for such a study in Greater
Manchester before 2011. The RSS is currently in the process of being
reviewed. The North West regional assembly published the revised Draft
RSS for consultation on 20 March 2006. The responses to the
consultation will be examined by a panel set up by the Secretary of
State. The panel will then carry out an examination in public to debate
selected topics, based on issues raised in the consultation responses,
before making their recommendations to the Secretary of State. It is
likely that any proposed changes to regional green belt policies will
be examined carefully by the panel and subsequently by the Secretary of
State.</p><p><a name="0606279000875">Local

</i>The Government's guidance to planning authorities
on development and flood risk is set out in &#145;Planning Policy
Guidance Note (PPG) 25&#146;. This advises that planning applications
in flood risk areas are always accompanied by a flood risk assessment,
and that the Environment Agency is consulted. Flood risk areas are
those mapped by the Agency as being at risk from river and tidal
flooding, but sites outside such areas can also be at risk due to local
topography, for example at the foot of hills where storm-water runoff
may overwhelm sewers. Flood risk assessments should address the source
of flooding, its potential extent, depth and speed of inundation and
its likely impact on the development during its lifetime, taking
climate change into account. They should demonstrate how the risk will
be managed and identify any residual risk (the risk remaining after
flood defences have been taken into account). Proposals for the
development of new properties with basements would have to demonstrate
(to the satisfaction of the Environment Agency and the Local Planning
Authority) that the residual risk to the development and its occupants
was acceptable. In addition, the introduction of basement accommodation
into a flood risk area should also not materially increase the flood
risk to other properties or occupants. The new Planning Policy
Statement (PPS) 25 that we intend to issue this autumn will strengthen
this advice.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606279000043">Rushenden Link

Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development&#148; (PPS1),
published in 2005, places strong emphasis on the role of planning in
helping to create safe and sustainable communities. Planning

capable of being a material planning consideration in the consideration
of planning

regard to the guidance we have published in &#147;Safer Places: The
Planning System and Crime Prevention&#148; (Office of the Deputy
Prime Minster/Home Office, 2004). This offers detailed guidance on the
lay-out of all buildings and spaces to reduce the risk of crime,

measures such CCTV in new
development.</p><p><a name="0606279001258">&#147;Safer
Places&#148; advises that in designing and considering development

should be considered. The guidance also highlights a number of examples
of best practice involving &#145;Secured by Design&#146; principles

or crime prevention design
advisors.</p><p><a name="0606279001259">Alongside

</i>We assess that the Priory Group provides an
excellent in-patient psychiatric service based on an individual's
clinical needs. Service liaison officers routinely visit the Group's
hospital units where we have in-patients to ensure that our
arrangements are working effectively in terms of patient care and
treatment, including attending ward rounds that involve service
patients; the service liaison officer also acts as a &#147;service
advocate&#148; for the patient. They also meet regularly with Priory
representatives to discuss treatment and best practice. We assess the
contractual elements of our agreement with the Priory Group at
quarterly meetings held between the MOD and the Priory Group. Both the
service liaison officer and contract meetings examine the Priory's
performance against the particular performance indicators of the
contract. Furthermore, the MOD&#146;s Directorate of Healthcare
monitors, on a daily basis, case management and financial components of
the
contract.</p><p><a name="0606279001702">The
MOD's requirement for the provision of in-patient mental healthcare was
advertised in the "Official Journal of the European Communities" and
the "MOD Contracts Bulletin". Four companies&#151;The Priory Group
Ltd., Cygnet Healthcare Ltd., Affinity Healthcare, and Selrack
Consulting&#151;expressed an interest in the requirement. They were
then invited to an Industry Day, in order to give them a better
understanding of the requirement and to enable them to discuss with MOD
in more detail what they would be able to provide. Following the
exchange of information at the Industry Day, the MOD decided that
Selrack Consulting would be unable to provide the services required and
therefore invited the three remaining companies to tender. The Priory
Group Ltd. and Cygnet Healthcare Ltd. submitted bids. The bid from The
Priory Group Ltd. best met our requirements to provide high-quality
mental health inpatient care nationwide, without delay, and within easy
reach of unit, base or
home.</p><p><a name="0606279001703">The
contract with the Priory Group commenced on1 December 2003.
Reception of service patients by the Priory Group's inpatient
facilities was phased-in between 1 December 2003 and April 2004. This
phase-in period allowed MOD and the Priory Group to develop
interoperable working procedures and the MOD the opportunity to
gradually enhance its community-based mental health
teams.</p><p><a name="0606279001704">Since
the beginning of the contract, The Priory Group has admitted 730

address human rights issues more systematically; a new system of

represented the UK on Tuesday 20 June. In his speech, he called for all
to work together towards an effective HRC. Non-governmental
organisations and national human rights institutions will have the
opportunity to address the Council at this inaugural session. We expect
the agenda for the further work of the session to be presented for
agreement towards the end of this first week.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="0606279000097">Japan/South

The treaty places important constraints on the use of space, including
prohibiting the deployment of weapons of mass destruction in space and
military activity on the moon and other celestial bodies. Since 1967,
there has been growing support for the Outer Space treaty: 98 states
have now ratified the treaty and an additional 27 are signatories. The
Outer Space treaty has become the cornerstone of international space
law and the UK continues to be a firm supporter and to abide by each of

constructively to ensure that paramilitaries or others are not able to
operate, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eeelam (LTTE) calling a halt to
acts of violence against civilians, the security forces and police, and
both sides ensuring that intimidation, acts of violence, abductions and
killings cease. We continue to believe that dialogue is the only way to
achieve a negotiated settlement to the conflict, which takes full
account of the legitimate demands of all communities and promotes a
democratic and stable Sri Lanka. All sides need to exercise restraint

The count of occasions is based on each incidence of suspension, where
an incident is defined as a count from the first day a pupil was
suspended until the last day suspended. In previous years, the count of
occasions was based on each record of suspension identified by the
education and library boards, where in some instances, longer periods
of suspension may have had more than one record. This change is due to
an improvement in the data collection systems for suspensions in the
education and library boards which has enabled better analysis of the
data. As a result, the number of occasions pupils were suspended in
2004-05 has decreased from previous years&#146;. However, care should
be taken when comparing the number of occasions in 2004-05 with the
number of occasions in previous
