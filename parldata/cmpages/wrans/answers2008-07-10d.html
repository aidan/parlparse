 There is no precise formula to determine the number of allotments which local authorities provide for their residents. Instead, section 23 of the Small Holdings and Allotments Act 1908 places a duty on local authorities (except for inner London boroughs) to provide a sufficient number of allotments where they consider that there is a demand for them in their area.</p>

Total waste arisings have fallen by 19.8 per cent. since the baseline year (2004-05) of the Sustainable Operations on the Government Estate waste target. This has been as a result of the introduction of effective waste streaming programmes in the majority of the Department&#146;s main offices. Waste streaming has resulted in numerous new recycling initiatives being introduced, including CDs, plastic bottles, glass, food waste, furniture, spectacles, fluorescent tubes, cardboard, batteries, cooking oil and mobile phones. The Department has also introduced new initiatives such as duplex printing to reduce paper consumption and subsequent waste, think before you print campaigns so that only essential items are printed, and an IT re-use contract which results in old IT equipment being collected, refurbished and then externally re-used. In addition the Department has worked with its suppliers to reduce the amount of packaging associated with deliveries.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment his Department has made of the link between a productive working life and health in the formulation of policy; and what assessment he has made of the effects on public health of a mandatory retirement age. [213606]</p>

 We commissioned an independent evidence review of the links between health and work. Published in 2006, the &#145;Is work good for your health and well-being?&#146; evidence review highlighted the positive links between health and work. This evidence has helped shape the Health Work and Well-being Strategy, a cross-government initiative which includes this Department, the Department of Health, the Health and Safety Executive and the health departments of the devolved administrations, which seeks to help people who have a health condition or disability remain in or quickly return to work. One result of the strategy was the commissioning of Dame Carol Black, National Director for Health and Work, to carry out a review of the health of the working age population. The review, &#145;Working for a healthier tomorrow&#146; was published in March and highlighted the challenges around health and productive working lives. The Government are currently considering Dame Carol's recommendations and will respond formally in the autumn.</p>

In October 2006, the Employment Equality (Age) Regulations introduced a default retirement age of 65 and gave people the right to request the option of working longer. Employers do not have to use the default age of 65. They can choose a higher age, or remove their retirement age altogether. Some, including this Department, have chosen not to have a compulsory retirement age.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_367"><a name="80710w0009.htm_para8"><a name="08071088001615">Government policy is to encourage individuals to continue in employment as long as they choose to do so and are capable of meeting the requirements of their employment which will include consideration of any health issues. Research shows that the three main reasons given by older people for working after state pension age are because they enjoy their job/working; they want to improve their finances and they want to keep fit and active. Giving people the choice to work up to and beyond state pension age is critical to ensuring the economic prosperity of our society in terms of health, work and pensions.</p>

 A number of diagnostic tests for the detection of <i> Mycobacterium bovis</i> (<i> M. bovis</i>) infection in badgers have been developed through DEFRA-funded research projects at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA). Currently, although a great deal of research has been, and continues to be, carried out in veterinary and medical laboratories to try to develop PCR tests that can be used for routine diagnosis, results so far have shown that the technique is not yet able to perform as well as conventional bacterial culture in the detection of <i> M. bovis</i> in terms of sensitivity, specificity or reliability. Detection of <i> M. bovis</i> directly from live badgers and their excretions using PCR is difficult, largely because of the low levels and intermittent nature of excretion of <i> M. bovis</i> by infected animals but also because of the difficulty in extracting DNA from mycobacteria and the presence of components that slow down the PCR in clinical samples (so-called &#145;PCR inhibitors&#146;).</p>

Nor would it be possible to establish whether the DNA detected was from <i> M.</i><i> bovis</i> mycobacteria that were viable and infectious. Even if a validated PCR test was available, scientific evidence shows that small scale, localised culling of animals from infected setts is likely to increase disease.</p>

 With the recent reforms of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), in particular the decoupling of support from production, farmers are now free to follow market signals in terms of their planting decisions.

The Government&#146;s aim is to ensure that farmers can respond fully to the market, and for this reason we support the abolition in the CAP Health Check of set-aside as a supply control. We have also provided financial assistance to the Home Grown Cereals Authority to provide price risk management training to arable farmers.

<i> [holding answer 7 July 2008]:</i><i> </i>A single cell embryo contains two pro-nuclei. One contains the nuclear Deoxyribo Nucleic Acid (DNA) from the sperm and one contains the nuclear DNA from the egg. The two pro-nuclei form the entire complement of nuclear DNA within the single cell embryo. Upon division of a single cell embryo the DNA of the pro-nuclei replicates, and following cell division the two cells each contain a single nucleus. In the Human Fertilisation and Embryology (HFE) Bill the DNA within the pro-nuclei of a single cell embryo, and DNA within the nucleus of any other cell, are given equivalence. This ensures that clauses in the HFE Bill which refer to nuclear DNA, are also referring to pro-nuclear DNA. It means that, even though a pro-nucleus and a nucleus are not scientifically equivalent, clarity is provided for the purposes of the prohibitions and licensing on the HFE Bill.</p>

The Graduate Leader Fund is designed to incentivise the recruitment, employment and retention of graduates in private, voluntary and independent sector full day care settings.

 Child care sufficiency assessments had to be completed before the new duty on local authorities to secure sufficient child care for working parents came into force. The purpose of requiring all local authorities to undertake such assessments was to ensure that they have a better knowledge of supply, demand and the gaps between the two than had previously been the case, so that they are able to prioritise appropriately as they pursue their duty to secure sufficient child care for working parents. Every local authority will need actively to manage its child care market if it is to secure and sustain sufficient child care in both the short and the longer term.</p>

The BBFC consider that a &#145;PG&#146; film should not disturb a child aged around eight or older. However, parents&#151;and those acting in loco parentis&#151;are advised to consider whether the content may upset younger or more sensitive children. There is no need for the legislation suggested, as there is no legal restriction on schools showing PG-rated films to pupils. Teachers are best placed to decide whether showing a film to illustrate an issue is a good way for children and young people to learn, but they must ensure that the film is suitable for all students to view. Responsible school policy may require teachers to seek the agreement of parents.</p>

 The Department for Children, Schools and Families and the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills continue to promote the Government&#146;s strategy for international education through active participation in international organisations including the European Union, the OECD, the Council of Europe, the Commonwealth and UNESCO as well as through the development of a number of bilateral and international education programmes such as the Prime Minister&#146;s Initiative for International Education, the Prime Minister&#146;s Global Fellowship Programme, the Graduate Work Experience Programme (China and India); the International School Award and the Global Gateway; the International Leadership and Learning Programme and the Teachers&#146; International Professional Development Programme.

1. Prior to 2004, results of pupils in tasks/tests at Key Stage 1 were reported alongside teacher assessments.<br>
2. In 2004, new assessment arrangements where only teacher assessments (informed by task/test results) were reported were trialled in some LAs. In 2005 this trial was rolled out to all LAs and from 2005 to date teacher assessments, informed by the outcomes of national tasks and tests are reported. As a result, figures for results from 2005 and 2007 in the table are not directly comparable with those for 1997, and care is needed in interpreting trends in the data.<br>
Due to a change in policy, the figures for 2005 onwards are taken from teacher assessment results.<br>
3. Teacher assessments for science were only reported from 2005 onwards. Prior to 2005, test/task results for science are not available.<br>

 Creating an effective international system is a priority for the Department for International Development (DFID). DFID has performance frameworks in place with 36 of our multilateral partners. These set out specific measurable goals and targets against which to monitor performance. DFID is increasingly using financial incentives, either as a positive incentive or as a sanction, in support of these performance management arrangements. To date, DFID has used performance related funding to encourage IDA, Regional Development Banks and UN agencies to address specific areas of poor performance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_535"><a name="80710w0025.htm_para14"><a name="080710107001951">For example, DFID recently concluded an innovative five-year agreement with the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), creating incentives for UNRWA to deliver on its own efficiency targets. DFID adopted a multi-year funding strategy to encourage reform and reward good performance and put in place an additional &#163;2 million performance contribution for financial years 2008-09 and 2009-10, a &#163;3 million performance contribution for years 2010-11, and &#163;3.4 million for the final year of the arrangement.</p>
