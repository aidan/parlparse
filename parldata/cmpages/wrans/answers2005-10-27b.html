 Fire and Rescue Authorities do not keep separate figures for their total spending on control centres: the CIPFA statistics cover control room staffing costs only. Therefore the FiReControl project had to commission detailed work on current and forecast costs as a basis for the FiReControl Business Case in 2004. The current version of the business case includes an average forecast cost of &#163;75.6 million per annum as total cost of providing control services from 2004&#150;05 to 2006&#150;07, at 2004 prices.

<p><a name="st_31"><a name="51027w04.html_spnew4"><b> Jim Fitzpatrick: </b> 
 Initial estimates of the cost of establishing nine regional control centres were provided in the Strategic Outline Business Case, which was based on the report by Mott MacDonald &#039;The Future of Fire and Rescue Service Control Rooms in England and Wales: Update 2003&#039;. Mott MacDonald calculated that over a 10 year period, at 2004 prices, the regional control option would deliver a total net saving of &#163;155 million. It estimated project costs at &#163;100 million, comprising project management costs, technology costs, accommodation costs and redundancy. The Outline Business Case (available on www.firecontrol.odpm.gov.uk) was based on more detailed work and different assumptions, so the costs shown in that cannot be directly compared with the Mott MacDonald costs.

 The Treasury&#039;s Two-Year Review of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA), the outcome of which was announced in December 2004, included a reduction in Financial Services Authority (FSA) consultation burdens and reforms making the FSA handbook of rules easier to use. The FSA has subsequently launched other initiatives to simplify its handbook of rules further. The administrative burden associated with requirements to report information to the FSA is currently being assessed by independent consultants as part of the Government&#039;s initiative to assess all such burdens generated by all Government bodies and regulators. In parallel the FSA has commissioned independent consultants to assess the cumulative burden of all forms of financial regulation in three business sectors. A person dissatisfied with the FSA&#039;s response to a complaint may approach the Office of the Complaints Commissioner, which publishes an annual report. In light of these reports there are no current plans to review the FSA&#039;s complaints procedures.

<p><a name="st_61"><a name="51027w07.html_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Tax and national insurance have different structures. Many of the differences between the two systems result from the fact that they serve different purposes. Income tax is designed to raise revenue for public spending while NICs are directly linked to entitlement to contributory benefits. Since Martin Taylor&#039;s report on work incentives in 1998, the Government have been pursuing a policy of alignment as far as is possible, for example replacing the multiple employer rates with a single rate of national insurance for employers, and aligning the starting point for paying both employers&#039; and employees NICs with the income tax personal allowance. HMRC continues to work with employer representatives and others to look for opportunities to align the tax and NICs rules at a practical level, while having regard to the individuals&#039; benefit entitlements.

 DFID staff in the UK Representation to the UN Food and Agriculture Agencies in Rome and elsewhere monitor the Global Information and Early Warning System of the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) and the Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) of the US Agency for International Development. The UK Representation in Rome receives all food availability updates from the FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP) and participates in regular discussions of impending and actual food emergencies with those agencies and other donors. DFID staff also regularly attend briefings on the joint FAO-WFP Crop and Food Supply Assessment Missions. To help improve the quality of information provided by WFP, DFID has funded the strengthening of WFP&#039;s Vulnerability Assessment Monitoring capacity.

 DFID monitors the evolving food-security situation across Africa through our network of country offices, our humanitarian advisers, and a wide range of specialist partners, including NGOs, the UN and Red Cross agencies. The Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations (FAO)&#039;s report is an important source of information, based primarily on food production. DFID takes this into account in making an overall assessment of the humanitarian situation, while also looking at vulnerability, access to food, coping mechanisms, nutritional status and other indicators.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51027w12.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_85">In Southern Africa (including Malawi, Swaziland and Zimbabwe), DFID has invested heavily in the vulnerability assessment committees (VACs), the main

<a name="51027w12.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_86">we judge that there are 10.7 million people in the region facing food shortages. Many of these people will require emergency food aid, but some will manage until the next harvest using their own coping strategies and other non-food assistance. In Southern Africa, in response to our assessments, DFID has allocated a total of &#163;56 million for humanitarian assistance and will continue to monitor the situation closely.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51027w12.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_87">In West Africa, DFID has just undertaken its third humanitarian assessment mission since June, to the Sahel (including Burkina, Mali, Mauritania, and Niger). Based on these findings, and those of other partners, we concur with the FAO&#039;s September analysis. More recently we have judged agricultural production from the ongoing Sahel harvest to be high, bringing relief and recovery to many areas, but with pockets of continuing need due to localised shortages or the continuing consequences of the recent crisis. In the Mano river countries (including Cote d&#039;Ivoire, Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone), insecurity and population movements have certainly undermined food security, as also suggested by FAO. In both sub-regions, DFID has delivered more than &#163;9 million of humanitarian assistance this year to help address these concerns.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51027w12.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_88">In East Africa., DFID has undertaken humanitarian assessments in Ethiopia and Eritrea. Humanitarian advisers based in Sudan constantly monitor the humanitarian situation there, including emerging food crises. The UK is spending &#163;70 million on its humanitarian assistance in Sudan this year. In Ethiopia, DFID is contributing &#163;43 million to a national safety nets programme providing food and cash to poor families. Eritrea continues to be affected by serious food shortages. It is however, becoming increasingly difficult for relief agencies to operate in the country, affecting the quality of data and the options for humanitarian assistance. The situation in Somalia is also of great concern as increasing insecurity in the grain producing areas of the south reduces the availability of food. Uganda and Tanzania have had good harvests. Civilians displaced by conflict in the north of Uganda, and refugees from Burundi and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) in Tanzania, are unable to support themselves and require continuing assistance, for which DFID is providing support.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51027w12.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_89">In Central Africa, DFID assessments have been undertaken in the DRC and Burundi. We agree with the FAO&#039;s assessment that while production has generally been at or above average, serious food shortages remain among some groups, notably displaced people in the DRC. The Republic of Congo normally produces little food, being reliant on imports. The Central African Republic had a good harvest last year, but the basic indicators remain very poor. In addition insecurity in the north has led to difficulties for the population there, and has resulted in people seeking refuge in southern Chad. Chad also experienced an average year in terms of food production, but refugees there from Darfur, and Central African Republic are not able to produce or

<p><a name="st_141"><a name="51027w14.html_spnew15"><b> John Reid: </b> 
 As stated in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, the UK purchased 58 Trident II (D5) missiles. Missiles are either deployed onboard UK submarines or held ashore at the Royal Naval Armament Depot Coulport, on a temporary basis, or in the United States at the Strategic Weapons Facility Atlantic, as part of a shared pool of US/UK missiles. In line with the policy set out in the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, the UK maintains a stockpile of fewer than 200 operationally available nuclear warheads, 48 of which are onboard the single submarine on deterrent patrol. The remaining warheads are held ashore in the UK; none is stored in the United States.

 All the UK&#039;s Trident missiles have been de-targeted since 1994, and the submarine on deterrent patrol is normally at several days notice to fire. The missiles can be targeted in sufficient time to meet any foreseeable requirement.

A further &#163;485,000 is being invested in 2005&#150;06 with the ASA through the school to community programmes; club links and step into sport (SiS), which are aimed at sustaining participation outside school hours.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his policy is for tackling persistent and prolific offenders.  [19789]</p>








<p><a name="st_203"><a name="51027w19.html_spnew8"><b> Hazel Blears  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 19 October 2005]:</i> The prolific and other priority offenders (PPO) strategy is at the heart of the Government&#039;s efforts to reduce crime and disorder. This strategy, which was launched by my right hon. friend the Prime Minister in March 2004, targets not only existing prolific offenders but also those young people who are on the cusp of a prolific offending lifestyle. The strategy has three strands: prevent and deter&#151;to stop young people becoming prolific offenders; catch and convict&#151;tackling those who are already prolific offenders; and rehabilitate and resettle&#151;working to increase the number of offenders who stop offending by offering a range of supportive interventions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51027w19.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_133">This multi-agency approach to offender management built on, and replaced, the previous persistent offender scheme. Since September 2004 PPO schemes have been established in each Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnership area in England and each Community Safety Partnership in Wales. These schemes allow local partners, such as the police, prisons, probation and the local authority to concentrate their joint efforts on monitoring and rehabilitating the relatively small number of people who have been identified locally as causing most harm to their communities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51027w19.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_134">Over 10,000 existing prolific offenders have been identified by schemes across England and Wales. In addition, about 4,000 young people are likely to be identified as suitable for support as part of the prevent and deter strand. An initial impact evaluation for the strategy is currently underway. Guidance for all three strands, as well as monthly performance management framework reports, can be found on the website http://www.crimereduction.gov.uk/ppominisite01.htm.

 These provisions govern the wearing of protective headgear by motorcyclists, the keeping of dogs on a lead on designated roads and dangerous, careless and inconsiderate cycling. We believe the offences they create serve a useful road safety purpose. Their enforcement is a matter for the police. Chief officers of police are best placed to decide on the level of priority that should be given to these offences in the light of their perceived seriousness, conflicting demands on police time and resources, and local circumstances.

<a name="stpa_146">My Department is currently undertaking a project to evaluate the extent to which an improved prescribed canvass form might make the registration process simpler for electors, and whether other electoral forms might also benefit from greater standardisation. Any regulations arising from this project are likely to be made during 2006.

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs what guidelines have been issued on follow-up procedures to be used by electoral registration officers for individuals who have failed to register; whether she plans to reform these guidelines; and if she will introduce a duty on local authority canvassers to visit electors who fail to register.

<p><a name="st_234"><a name="51027w21.html_spnew15"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 Guidance to electoral registration officers is issued by the independent Electoral Commission. The Commission&#039;s most recent guidance on administering the annual canvass of electors was published in their circular number 16 of 2005. The Electoral Administration Bill, introduced on 11 October, includes a new duty on electoral registration officers to take all necessary steps to ensure comprehensive registers. Those steps include the following specific measures:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_36"><i>(a)</i> Sending the canvass form more than once to any address;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_37"><i>(b)</i> Making house to house inquires on more than one occasion;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_38"><i>(c)</i> Making contact by such other means as the registration officer thinks appropriate with persons who do not have an entry in a register.</p>
</ul>

 In accordance with the Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986, the boundary commissions for England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland base their recommendations on the number of electors on the register in force on the date that the review is announced.

 The Electoral Commission&#039;s recent report, &quot;Understanding Electoral Registration: the extent and nature of non-registration in Britain&quot; 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>27 Oct 2005 : Column 549W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
examines these issues in some depth. The research identified that the majority of non-registrants in 2000 came from three groups; those living with their parents (particularly attainers), people who have moved within the six months prior to the qualifying date, and people renting from a private landlord. The research highlighted the importance of people&#039;s individual and household situation and attitudes towards politics and voting. There was also a link between the presence and actions of the head of the household and non-registration.

These identifiers are specified at clause 14 as a signature, date of birth and such other information relating to an individual as is prescribed. Although this power to prescribe further identifiers is wide enough to provide for the collection of national insurance numbers, the Government does not intend to move forward in this way.
