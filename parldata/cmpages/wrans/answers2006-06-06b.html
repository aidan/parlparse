to all tables:</i><br>1.
The groupings Bottom 10 per cent., Top 10 per cent., Bottom 20 per
cent. and Top 20 per cent. of the Before Housing Costs and After
Housing Costs income distributions are consistent with DWP's National
Statistics' series, Households Below Average Income (HBAI). It is
presented in this manner to be consistent with HBAI. The Bottom 10 per
cent. relates to individuals in households with the lowest 10 per cent.
of equivalised household income.  2. Real income growth is
represented by the percentage change in decile or quintile income
medians that have been adjusted for inflation. Year on year growth
estimates are volatile.  3. Comparisons for the bottom decile
should be treated with particular caution. Decile medians for the
bottom 10 per cent. are more volatile as they are affected to a greater
extent by fluctuations in households reporting very low
incomes.  4. The Family Expenditure Survey (FES) data covers
selected years from 1979 until 1995-97 where information is available.
The Family Resources Survey (FRS) data is for all financial years
1994-95 until 2004-05.  5. Comparisons of estimates between
the two sources should be treated carefully: FES figures are for the
United Kingdom, FRS figures are for Great Britain;<br>
The reference period for FRS figures is
single financial years. FES figures are single calendar years in 1979,
1981 and 1987, two combined calendar years from 1988-89 to1992-93 and
two financial years combined from 1993-95 to
1995-97;<br>The FRS was
established by the then Department of Social Security in order to meet
the Department's analytical demands; A review, available on the
internet, into the differences in income values between the two surveys
concluded that the differences in monetary value estimates across
surveys were too large to justify publishing direct comparisons.
Furthermore, large fluctuations in the difference between surveys for
overlapping years mean that a spliced time series may be no more
accurate than the unadjusted series. 6. Page 5 of the Child Poverty
Progress Report showed growth by quintiles AHC and much higher growth
for Q1 than Q5. This is borne out in this PQ. However, BHC progress was
only slightly better for the bottom quintile than the top
quintile.  <i> Source:</i>  The Family Resources

order to estimate the eligibility for each pensioner household on the

enforcement. Providing alternative livelihoods opportunities in itself
will not reduce poppy cultivation in Helmand. This requires an
integrated approach including assistance, law enforcement, better

Thomas:</b> Ensuring better regulation of the arms trade is
essential for conflict prevention and development. As a result, DFID
has worked very closely with the FCO and MOD to promote our commitment
to an Arms Trade Treaty (ATT). When the first committee of the UN
General Assembly meets this year, the UK will aim to secure a UN
resolution which will establish a formal UN-based ATT process.
Significant progress has already been made, notably the endorsement of
an ATT by the EU Council and Commonwealth Heads of Government and other
influential countries such as
Brazil.</p><p><a name="06060819000022">DFID has
contributed to a range of FCO-led initiatives, including the May 2005
meeting of experts at Lancaster House in London and a Geneva meeting of
representatives to the Conference on Disarmament in March 2006. DFID
and Whitehall partners have also developed a joint strategy to
encourage other countries and regional bodies to actively promote the
ATT. This focuses on building wider support for a first committee
resolution, and includes awareness raising events. DFID will use
ministerial visits and dialogue with partner countries, regional and
international organisations to generate support for a
resolution.</p><p><a name="06060819000023">In
parallel DFID is working closely with the FCO and MOD to strengthen
controls over the transfer of small arms and light weapons within the
existing UN Programme of Action (UN PoA). Small arms and light weapons
(SALW) pose a particular challenge for development because they are
widely available in developing countries and are the weapon of choice
in the majority of conflicts worldwide. We are working internationally
with a wide range of partners in advance of the UN PoA Review
Conference in June to build support for global guidelines for national
controls governing transfers of SALW.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060819000005">Child

The programme supports NGOs and other civil society groups to inform

Benn:</b> DFID has made a thorough
assessment of corruption in Kenya and its implications for our
assistance. I had frank and direct discussion with President Kibaki
about this when I visited Kenya in January. Since then, considerable
action, including the removal of three senior Ministers, has taken
place in response to public pressure following the release of the
Githongo dossier and the release of the Goldenberg Report. This is an
encouraging start but Kenyans are calling for more to demonstrate full
political accountability. When I met President Kibaki again recently, I
stressed the importance of continued progress in the
investigations.</p><p><a name="06060819000041">The
UK does not provide direct budget support to Kenya precisely because of
our concerns about corruption, and all DFID&#146;s projects have
rigorous safeguards to ensure that our assistance is not being
misdirected.</p><p><a name="06060819000042">For
example, all our projects work through special, earmarked and fully
audited accounts, independent financial management agents or are
provided directly to non-government organisations or other direct
service delivery. All projects over &#163;1 million are subject to
annual reviews and audits, and expenditure is closely tracked.
Accountable grants to non-governmental organisations are paid
retrospectively only once invoices have been checked and the spending
is accounted for. Occasional cases of fraud do still occur, but are
investigated immediately and swift and decisive action
taken.</p><p><a name="06060819000043">Despite recent
announcements that the Dutch Government has frozen any new commitments
to Kenya, I do not foresee the corruption allegations making a
significant impact on international assistance in the short term. Most
of the development agencies, including DFID, believe that just because
poor people live in a country where corruption is a major problem, it
does not mean that they do not deserve our assistance. In Kenya our
assistance is improving many lives. Our support will mean textbooks for
each of the 18,500 primary schools in Kenya and 12,000 new classrooms.
It will also deliver 11 million insecticide treated bednets, saving
167,000 children&#146;s lives. We have provided &#163;23.7 million
to drought affected regions of Kenya since December
2005.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060819000010">Maldives</h3><p><a name="06060819000044"><b><a name="06060819000078">Mr.

recovered very strongly following the tsunami. Economic growth is

the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland set up a NIO-led UK
Steering Group to lead the research programme into alternative policing
approaches towards the management of conflict. The development of the
Attenuating Energy Projectile (AEP), as an operational replacement for
the L21A1 baton round from 21 June 2005, formed only part of the

am advised that the cost breakdown in terms of testing, acquiring and
training police personnel in the use of AEP cannot be provided without
disproportionate cost. However, the total cost of replacing the L21Al
with the AEP for operational use was estimated to be &#163;291,000.
This figure is the only top-line cost available for the project and
PSNI cannot readily extrapolate testing, acquiring and training figures
for the following reasons: testing was conducted externally as well as
internally; acquisition costs would involve various aspects of the
procurement process; and training costs were incurred across many PSNI
departments.</p><br><notus-date day="6" month="6" year="2006" textMonth="Jun"></notus-date><b>6 Jun 2006 : Column 561W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="06060813000022">Police</h3><p><a name="06060813000394"><b><a name="06060813002776">Mr.

Ireland Office provided specific input in relation to the working of

comes from a study published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> in
July 2004. The study conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside,
suggested that ADRs account for one in 16 hospital admissions. This is
a similar estimate to a number of studies worldwide, including figures
from the United States. The study did not differentiate between
prescribed and unprescribed medicines; however, the majority of ADRs
were associated with prescribed
medicines.</p><p><a name="06060813001381">This
study highlights the importance of effective systems for monitoring and
responding to issues relating to the safety of medicines, a process
called pharmacovigilance. This study, which was funded by the Medicines
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), underlines the
MHRA&#146;s commitment to improving the evidence base for
pharmacovigilance in the UK. As part of this commitment to improving
pharmacovigilance, the MHRA is working to strengthen and widen access
to the yellow card scheme for reporting suspected ADRs. Access has
recently been widened to allow patients to report under a pilot
reporting scheme.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06060813000050">Assisted

Communication and Local Government, specific grants distributed by the
Department, revenue from council tax, income from fees and charges and
local decision
making.</p><p><a name="06060813001426">The greater
part of Government funding for adult social care is allocated to
councils without conditions. Local authorities have a significant
degree of flexibility to manage and direct their resources in
accordance with local priorities, and the needs of the communities to
which they are accountable. It is not therefore possible to identify
the proportion of allocated funding that is directly attributable to

)</sup>The methodology for producing average caseload per officer
figures was revised for 2002 data onwards. The court order figures in
2000 and 2001 include Community Rehabilitation Orders, Community
Punishment and Rehabilitation Orders, Suspended Sentence Orders and
Money Payment Supervision Orders. 2002 onwards additionally includes
Community Punishment Orders and Drug Treatment and Testing Orders. The
officer figures for 2000 and 2001 include whole-time equivalent of
maingrade probation officers and senior practitioners, excluding
temporary and trainee, on fieldwork duties. 2002 onwards additionally
includes senior probation officers on fieldwork duties, and all
probation services&#146; officers. The effect of the revised method
is to produce much lower average caseload figures, due to the expanded
number of staffing grades included in the calculation. 
<sup>(2)</sup> Court orders only are included in offender caseload, not
those supervised on licence following release from
prison.<br></td></tr></table><br>

Bradshaw</b><i> [holding answer 5 June 2006]: </i>The
frequency of bovine tuberculosis (bTB) herd testing is determined by EU
legislation but this does not establish the frequency of tests on
individual cattle. In Great Britain, cattle herds are tested every one,
two, three or four years depending on how widespread bTB is in their
respective regions; these frequencies are reviewed on an annual basis.
The percentage of herds and parishes being tested annually has
increased over the last few years; currently, about 25 per cent. of
herds are tested annually and another 14 per cent. are tested every two
years. In 2005, approximately 43,500 herd tests were carried out on
4.85 million
cattle.</p><p><a name="06060874000215">An analysis of

which had lived through the Foot and Mouth Disease outbreak when bTB
testing was severely
disrupted.</p><p><a name="06060874000216">Many of the
animals not being tested do not present a disease control risk. For
example, some animals in low risk herds are slaughtered prior to a herd
test becoming due. However, we accept that a small percentage of
animals missing a bTB test may present a disease risk. Defra is
supporting further work in this
