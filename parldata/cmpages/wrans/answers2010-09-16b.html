 The most recent estimate of the number of licensable houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) is from the Building Research Establishment report published by Communities and Local Government in January 2010. The report estimates that up to about 56,000 HMOs may be subject to mandatory licensing.</p>

 Fire incident records have only had the facility of a separate category for households in multiple occupation since the introduction of the Incident Recording System, which went live nationally on 1 April 2009. Fire incident data are currently available to the end of March 2010, hence the numbers of fatalities recorded by Fire and Rescue Service personnel to be in households in multiple occupation by licence status are shown in the table for 2009-10.</p>

The NDA was established to bring renewed vigour to decommissioning, using competitions for the management of its sites to drive efficiency and innovation. Together with maximising profits from its commercial operations, this ensures that the cost to the public purse of the mission is kept to the minimum necessary and delivers value for money.

 Neither the renewable energy directive (RED) nor fuel quality directive (FQD) explicitly require that fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) be included in gas oil. However, the directives do require an increase in use of biofuel and a reduction in lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions of fuels used in transport and non-road mobile machinery. The Department for Transport is carrying out research which will be looking in detail at the barriers associated with increased deployment of all types of biofuels, including infrastructure costs and vehicle capability issues.

<p><a name="stpa_362"><a name="100916w0002.htm_para31"><a name="10091640000300">We are exploring the practicality of an alternative national signposting service which would help practitioners find out whether a colleague elsewhere is working, or has previously worked, with the same vulnerable child. The approach would particularly take account of the needs of children who move between local authority areas or who access services in more than one local authority. Social workers in particular, and potentially other key services like the police or accident and emergency departments, may need this information very quickly and any new approach would seek to strengthen communication between these areas.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_363"><a name="100916w0002.htm_para32"><a name="10091640000301">Critical to the success of any new service must be that it provides a modern, effective tool that supports the frontline and supports the broader aims of Eileen Munro's review to improve child protection and social work practice. It is also important that we keep the information held on any new service to the minimum necessary to allow effective identification of the individuals involved. We would also seek to keep development and implementation costs to a minimum and deliver a service that can demonstrate greater value for money than ContactPoint. We will continue to draw on the views, experience and expertise of frontline staff and managers to assess the feasibility and affordability of such an approach.</p>

 Jurors with certain hearing aids may need the use of an induction loop system and each court will either have the system on site or have access to it by borrowing it from a neighbouring court. Courts can also, subject to cost, arrange for computer aided transcription for profoundly deaf jurors which allows the proceedings to be relayed simultaneously to the juror in written form while in the courtroom.

 In 2006 the Prison Service settled 197 claims from prisoners who claimed that their drug detoxification treatment was inadequate. The claims concerned medical practice in prisons dating back to the late 1990s. Legal advice was that the standard of care they received fell short of acceptable medical standards and the Prison Service's guidelines for dealing with opiate dependent prisoners. On the basis of strong legal advice it was decided to settle these cases out of court in order to minimise costs to the taxpayer. If the claims had proceeded to trial they would have resulted in considerably more expense to the public purse. Each case was settled for £3,807.10 (a total of £749,998.7).</p>

 The National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and the UK Border Agency work closely together to ensure that those foreign national prisoners who have no right to remain in the UK are removed at the earliest opportunity. In 2009 NOMS and UKBA concluded a Service Level Agreement aimed primarily at better managing the number of time-served foreign national prisoners (or immigration detainees) in prison and focused on improving the process for the management and removal of foreign national prisoners who met the criteria for deportation. A major element of this Service Level Agreement was the concentration of these prisoners within the male, category C estate. Foreign national prisoners with more than three months but less than three years to serve are allocated, where possible, to designated hub and spoke prisons.</p>

 The telephone calls of all prisoners are recorded and may be monitored, other than calls between prisoners and their legal advisers and the courts. Prisons refer to a range of guidance (as set out in the following list) when deciding whether to monitor the calls of a prisoner who has been convicted of a sexual offence. Some calls are monitored because of the offence the prisoner committed in order to protect the public. However, some telephone calls are monitored randomly or because of concerns about the risk that the prisoner poses to prison security. All of these situations may apply to a prisoner convicted of a sexual offence.</p>

<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV-for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>
<i> Key:</i><br>
* 0 ≤ CV&lt;5%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered precise<br>
** 5 ≤ CV &lt;10%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered reasonably precise<br>
*** 10 ≤ CV &lt;20%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered acceptable<br>
**** CV ≥ 20%-Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>
CV = Coefficient of Variation<br>

 The Government recognise that the use of security scanners may engage issues relevant to human rights. However, such rights are not absolute and the Government believe that the use of security scanners as an aviation security measure at UK airports is necessary, proportionate and legitimate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_538"><a name="100916w0004.htm_para59"><a name="10091646000223">Security scanners have been deployed in the interests of protecting national security, public safety and the prevention and detection of crime, and the Government believe that their use is consistent with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

The Government believe that this, by its nature, would be far more intrusive, and a much greater invasion of privacy, than the use of a security scanner. Such searches raise issues about the training, staff and resource burdens that carrying out such searches would impose on airport operators, and the impact on passenger throughput times at security checkpoints. However, this issue is being carefully considered in light of the public consultation before decisions are taken on the future use of security scanners.</p>

 The coalition Government place a high value on initiatives that promote equality and fairness. The Railways for All programme, launched by the previous Government, is currently installing level access routes at 148 priority stations across the railway network, and this is in addition to major programmes of investment and the commitments in rail franchises.

 The Department for Transport produced a post-consultation impact assessment on the European Commission's draft regulation concerning the rights of passengers in bus and coach transport in December 2009. Copies are available in the Libraries of the House. This indicated that the proposal would be likely to place a significant cost on the industry which could be passed on to passengers through higher fares.

 None of the current rail franchises require train operators to meet performance targets in relation to potential or former passengers, as distinct from current passengers.

<p><a name="stpa_589"><a name="100916w0005.htm_para30"><a name="10091646000798">The preliminary findings include that, in the areas covered by the 20 mph limits, recorded injury accident numbers have reduced from an average of 165 per year, during the three years before the speed limits were introduced, to 144 during the first year afterwards. This reduction of 13% is greater than the percentage fall in accident numbers nationally during the same period. A longer period after the introduction of the speed limits is likely to improve the robustness of the conclusions that can be drawn from the data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_590"><a name="100916w0005.htm_para31"><a name="10091646000799">The Department has more recently received accident information for the second year after the implementation of the 20 mph limits. This indicates that the annual average of the number of recorded personal injury accidents during the two years after the limits were introduced was about 21% less than the average during the three years beforehand. Again, nationally the number of accidents has fallen during that period, but by a smaller percentage.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_591"><a name="100916w0005.htm_para32"><a name="10091646000800">The Department has also assessed the reduction of actual speeds in the areas of Portsmouth covered by the 20 mph speed limits. On average the mean speeds have fallen by about 1.3 mph. Previous research has indicated that such falls in average speeds in urban areas are typically associated with reductions in the numbers of injury accidents of about 7% (5% per mph of average speed reduction), which is consistent with the accident numbers recorded in Portsmouth.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_592"><a name="100916w0005.htm_para33"><a name="10091646000801">Further findings about the Portsmouth scheme are likely to be published soon.</p>

 This Government have increased, not reduced, the number of university places available this year by 10,000 compared to the position set out in the December 2009 HEFCE Grant Letter. Because of the need for deficit reduction, we have also made a saving of £200 million in HE budgets. We have refocused the University Modernisation Fund, announced by the previous Government, because insufficient quality bids were received to fill the 20,000 places initially offered. We are also making efficiencies at university level. But the total funding we are making available to HEFCE for this year is still higher than that announced in the Council's Grant Letter of December 2009.</p>

 For the purpose of student support, a private higher education institution is any provider of higher education which is not publicly funded. Higher education courses provided by private institutions in the UK may be specifically designated to attract student support on an individual basis. They must all be accredited by a recognised UK awarding body such as a university, with the exception of the University of Buckingham which has its own degree-awarding powers. English-domiciled students attending these courses can apply for student support. The table which shows the number of approved student finance applications by English-domiciled applicants planning to study at private higher education institutions in academic year 2009/10 will be placed in the Library of the House.
