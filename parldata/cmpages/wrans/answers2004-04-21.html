as it relates to exposure to asbestos <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;now and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;by the time the legislation becomes legally binding in May.  [166749]</p>








<p><a name="40421w01.html_spnew2"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 As a result of a commitment given by the Government to the House of Lords in 2002, the Health and Safety Executive carried out a review of the progress being made towards compliance with the duty to manage asbestos in non-domestic premises. The review shows that between 50&nbsp;per cent. and 75&nbsp;per cent. of dutyholders are aware of the new regulation and that approximately 40&nbsp;per cent. were already complying with the duty six months before the regulation was due to come into force.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40421w01.html_para2">
Since the review was carried out the HSE has continued its campaign to raise awareness of the duty in order to continue to raise the level of compliance before the 21&nbsp;May when the duty comes into force.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what efforts the Department has made to raise awareness amongst small businesses and the self-employed of the duty to manage legislation as it relates to exposure to asbestos.  [166750]</p>








<p><a name="40421w01.html_spnew3"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 In 2001 the Health and Safety Commission embarked on a five-year campaign to raise awareness of the duty to manage and to encourage proportionate and effective compliance with the new regulation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40421w01.html_para3">
In addition to the development of comprehensive guidance, the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has gained the support of over 3,000 organisations to act as Partners in cascading HSE&#039;s campaign messages to a wide and varied audience, including small businesses and the self-employed. The partnership network includes the Federation of Small Businesses which has played a key role in the production of a free &#039;Duty to Manage&#039; leaflet geared towards the needs of their members. Over 400,000 of these leaflets have been distributed nation wide.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40421w01.html_para4">
HSE has also developed a &#039;duty to manage&#039; asbestos website, which includes good practice examples for new dutyholders, and has produced a range of written guidance.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what steps his Department has taken to provide everyone with a personal forecast of their complete pension position as proposed in &quot;A New Contract for Welfare: Partnership in Pensions&quot;, page 86.  [166247]</p>









<p><a name="40421w01.html_spnew6"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 Last year the Government began the process of issuing state pension forecasts to self- employed people and we anticipate that we will have sent 1.6&nbsp;million forecasts by the end of May this year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40421w01.html_para5">
We also continue to work in partnership with employers and pension providers to deliver 6.3&nbsp;million combined pension forecasts by the end of 2005&#150;06. To date over 700 employers and pension providers have expressed an interest in delivering these forecasts to their employees/scheme members.
</p>


<p>

The Government are keen to ensure that individuals who are not covered by the combined pension forecast arrangements do not lose out. We intend to issue to these people a regular forecast of their projected state pension entitlement.

[166232]</p>









<p><a name="40421w01.html_spnew7"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 We anticipate that the costs of establishing and running the web-based retirement planner are likely to be less than &#163;10&nbsp;million set-up costs and less than &#163;5&nbsp;million in annual running costs. However, these figures are high-level and indicative.

Home Front Recall is part of a special lottery programme called Veterans Reunited.

There will be funding for both local and national projects within the Home Front Recall scheme, but there is no fixed allocation for each type of project.

<p><a name="40421w16.html_spnew0"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The Government established the independent expert group on mobile phones (IEGMP) under the chairmanship of Sir William Stewart and the IEGMP report on mobile phones and health was published in May 2000. That report considered both thermal and non-thermal mechanisms of interaction of electromagnetic fields from mobile phones and evaluated a wide range of biological effects including cellular effects.

A further review of health effects was carried out by an independent advisory group on non-ionising radiation (AGNIR), entitled &quot;Health Effects from Radiofrequency (RF) Electromagnetic Fields&quot;, this is available at www.nrpb.org. This report was issued in 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Apr 2004 : Column 546W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p class "tabletext">&quot;Although there has been a wide range of diverse exposures and models investigated, no consistent pattern has emerged from the cellular studies of RF exposure. The balance of the findings on carcinogenesis is that there is little evidence and no known mechanism to support a direct or indirect effect of RF radiation on this process. Positive findings are not confirmed by other independent studies; apparently similar experiments fail to confirm each other and may even show contradictory results.&quot;</p>

The AGNIR will continue to review the scientific literature both national and international that is relevant to the issue of mobile telephony and health.

Further research is being undertaken by the mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme with funding of &#163;7.4&nbsp;million. This was set up to investigate areas of scientific uncertainty highlighted by the IEGMP report and areas identified as important by the MTHR programme management committee. A range of research projects have been funded by MTHR including studies on cells, brain physiology and the fundamental dielectric properties of biological tissues. A number of these projects are scheduled for completion over the next year.

 A wide range of legislation has already been introduced in Northern Ireland to protect all species of animals, including farm animals, from cruelty and neglect, to provide them with adequate housing and transport conditions. In addition, DARD officials are currently actively engaged in replacing the existing 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Apr 2004 : Column 560W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
range of advisory Welfare Codes for all the major species of farm animals with revised versions incorporating fresh developments in technology and our understanding of animal behaviours.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40421w20.html_para2">
The main general welfare provisions are laid down in the Welfare of Farmed Animals Regulations (NI) 2000 which consolidates and replaces previous legislation, implements four EU Council Directives and reflects the European Convention on the Protection of Animals kept for Farming Purposes. The regulations lay down a general principle that the owners and keepers of animals kept for farming purposes must take reasonable steps to ensure the welfare on animals in their care and prevent them experiencing any unnecessary pain, suffering or&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;injury. The requirements of the legislation are comprehensive, and DARD veterinary staff and meat hygiene officials actively enforce all of their provisions.

 The level of funding available to an area is not determined by the parliamentary constituency within which it is situated and the outcome of the Boundary Commission Review will have no impact on the level of funds available to Ballybeen Estate in Dundonald. However, if following the Boundary Commission&#039;s report Ballybeen is included in a new East Belfast constituency the Department for Social Development will review internal administrative boundaries and the regeneration of the area may fall to the Belfast Regeneration Office. This would be a purely administrative change that will have no impact on how Government funding is allocated.

 My Department has in place a Brucellosis control programme which aims to bring about a substantial reduction in disease levels and the eventual eradication of brucellosis from Northern Ireland. The control measures are based on a programme of testing, the slaughter of infected animals, the restriction of movements of animals to and from infected herds and surrounding herds, and the tracing of contact animals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40421w21.html_para0">
The implementation of the Brucellosis Policy Review recommendations, which I announced last June, will ensure further progress towards eradication of the disease. The process of extending annual Brucellosis testing throughout Northern Ireland got under way in November. The public consultation exercise on the subordinate legislation needed to implement further revised measures was launched on 30&nbsp;January 2004 and I hope to have the necessary subordinate legislation in place by mid 2004. Work is also under way on the feasibility of further measures that we hope to implement.

We are already seeing some effect from the control measures that have been implemented. During the year we have seen a reduction in the number of new herds restricted because of brucellosis. The number of new herds restricted during 2003 was 261. The comparable figure for 2002 was 361.

2004, <i>Official Report</i>, column 868W on Peace II Programme, under what measure number the money was awarded to the College of Agriculture, Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE); who authorised the approval to distribute the money to CAFRE; under whose name money was awarded to CAFRE; and what items of expenditure in addition to normal running costs of CAFRE the money funded.  [166831]</p>








<p><a name="40421w21.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Pearson: </b> 
 The money in respect of this project was awarded under Priority 1, Measure 6 (Training for Farmers) of the PEACE II Programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40421w21.html_para2">
Training through technology development and transfer is an on-going programme delivered through the College of Agriculture Food and Rural Enterprise (CAFRE) which has been operational since January 2000. During 2003 when the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development (DARD) was assessing how the PEACE II N+2 targets could be met, this programme was considered under the &quot;Innovative Actions&quot; strand of activities seeking to ensure expenditure targets could be achieved. Such innovative actions were approved by the PEACE II Monitoring Committee.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40421w21.html_para3">
The technology development and transfer programme was considered consistent with the terms of the PEACE II Programme and an application was submitted by CAFRE to Measure 1.6 for the project titled, Developing Agriculture through Technology Adoption (DATA). The application was considered in the normal manner by a three person Selection Panel against the Peace and Reconciliation and Measure Specific criteria and judged successful. The Selection Panel included a person independent of DARD. The success of this application enabled DARD to meet its N+2 targets and ensured no loss of PEACE II funding.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40421w21.html_para4">
The Letter of Offer in respect of the DATA project was issued by Pauline McCloy, Director of Rural Development, on behalf of DARD, and accepted on behalf of the College by Paul McGurnaghan, CAFRE Deputy Director and John Fay, CAFRE Director.

As the DATA project is a training programme the money allocated covers staff costs and other expenditure solely related to the delivery of the project such as set-up costs associated with demonstrations and publicity booklets for the programme.

 The rates charged to private residents by nursing homes are a matter for negotiation and agreement between both parties.

<p><a name="40421w22.html_spnew10"><b> Angela Smith: </b> 
 Nursing homes may charge individual residents different amounts based on the type and extent of care needed and the standard of facilities and accommodation provided. Nursing homes providing care for different classes of resident, i.e. elderly, mental health or other disablement, charge rates that are based on the level of care usually given to the specific class of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;resident the nursing home is authorised to accommodate. The four Health and Social Services Boards have set regional tariffs that Health and Social Services Trusts will normally pay for the appropriate standard placement for each class of resident. Trusts retain the authority to vary the amount payable where the resident is assessed to require additional services.

Enforcement action by Police Service of Northern Ireland will continue to be the key to tackling such attacks, and PSNI enforcement action will be accompanied by a range of actions by the Northern Ireland Office and the Northern Ireland Departments. As well as new legislative proposals, these will include measures on education, housing, health and social policy issues.

The Government&#039;s Community Safety Strategy, being implemented through the Community Safety Unit of the Northern Ireland Office, identified offences motivated by prejudice and hatred as a central theme in making Northern Ireland a safer place for all its citizens. Specifically, the Strategy seeks to reduce the levels of crime motivated by sectarianism, and to promote and enhance the safety of minority ethnic residents. Currently, the Unit is facilitating a working group of voluntary and statutory organisations which aims to establish a clear framework and operational system for the recording and monitoring of a number of hate crimes. These will include sectarian, racist and homophobic incidents. It is hoped to bring forward the consultation on such an agreed framework by the end of June, with implementation intended by October 2004. Within its Community Safety grant programme, the Challenge Competition, the Unit has also provided funding towards four projects which have a central theme of countering prejudice and hatred to a total value of &#163;273255.

I have also published for consultation, draft legislation for Northern Ireland aimed at tackling racially motivated offences.

I reiterate the acknowledgement in the Belfast Agreement of the unique opportunity that exists here to bring about a society which will recognise the full and equal legitimacy and worth of identities, senses of allegiance and ethos of all sections of the community in Northern Ireland.

Each Education and Library Board is responsible for Statements of Special Educational Needs for pupils resident in its area. The Board will meet the educational costs associated with the Statement in respect of pupils in maintained schools and in controlled schools (including controlled integrated schools). The cost of the educational provision in Statements for children in grant&#151;maintained integrated (GMI) schools is met by the Department because it has direct funding responsibility for these schools.
