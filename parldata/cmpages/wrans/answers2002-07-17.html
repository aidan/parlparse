To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what funding the UK will provide for the staff training course beginning in April 2003 at Liptovsky Mikulas Military Academy in Slovakia; how long the training will last; and if he will make a statement.  [70055]<P>

<P>
<a name="20717w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Junior Staff Officers' Course (JSOC) (Central and Eastern Europe (CEE)) project is a joint initiative between the United Kingdom and The Netherlands, together with the Slovak Republic as the host nation. Its purpose is to set up a Regional Training Centre in Central and Eastern Europe similar to the UK initiatives at Vyskov in Czech Republic and Bucharest in Romania. The division of costs, less personnel related funding, is UK 75 per cent. and The Netherlands 25 per cent. The Netherlands will provide and fund 25 per cent. of the personnel. The Slovak Republic will provide the infrastructure, food and accommodation and some locally employed staff.
<P>

<a name="20717w01.html_para0">The aim of the JSOC is to provide command and staff training in English, based upon British/NATO Defence Doctrine, for Senior Lieutenants, Captains and Majors from the Partnership for Peace partners. This will enable them to participate effectively within a multinational environment in training, exercises, military operations and 'operations other than war' (OOTW) operations. OOTW includes Peace Support, Humanitarian and Natural Disaster operations.
<P>

<a name="20717w01.html_para1">It is intended to run three courses per annum, each for up to 60 students, of approximately 12 weeks' duration. It is intended to begin the first course in late April or early May 2003.
<P>

<a name="20717w01.html_para2">The JSOC project is an initiative within the Outreach Programme, part of the Defence Diplomacy Mission. This programme of bilateral and multilateral defence co-operation in CEE contributes to international stability by assisting countries in the region to establish democratically accountable, cost effective armed formes capable of contributing both to national and regional security and, increasingly, to international security through participation in peach support operations.
<P>

<a name="20717w01.html_para3">The UK funding for this project will come from the Global Conflict Prevention Fund (GCPF)(GEE Strategy). The estimated cost to the UK in the Financial Year

<P><I>17 Jul 2002 : Column 276W</I><P>
2002&#150;2003, including personnel, is &#163;1.2 million as setting up costs. Running costs in subsequent years are estimated to be &#163;1.3-&#163;1.4 million.

<P>
<a name="20717w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Hunting Contract Services is now part of the Babcock group. We currently have two contracts with Babcock HCS in support of non-operational flying training. One contract covers support services at RAF Cranwell, including engineering support of Jetstream and Dominie aircraft, which are used for Multi-Engine Flying training and for Navigator/rearcrew training. This contract ends on 30 March 2004. A competition will be held for a replacement contract and the scope of the contract will be increased to include the provision of aircraft.
<P>

<a name="20717w01.html_para4">The other current contract provides aircraft and the majority of the instructors for the Joint Elementary Flying Training School's tasks. This contract ends on 7 July 2003 and following a competition Babcock HCS have been awarded the follow on contract.
<P>

<a name="20717w01.html_para5">For the longer term the future delivery of flying training is being considered by the United Kingdom Military Flying Training System project.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what plans he has for a review of armed forces personnel processes.  [71291]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A review of armed forces personnel processes is to be carried out this year. Preliminary work (Phase 1) has defined the scope of the study and identified the processes concerned. The aim of the review os to ensure that the outcome of the processes (providing the armed forces with the right number of people with the right skills in the right place at the right time) is achieved effectively and as efficiently as possible.




<P>
<P><I>17 Jul 2002 : Column 278W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20717w01.html_para7">The review will proceed in two further phases, under the sponsorship of the Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Personnel). Phase 2 will identify management, organisational, and structural options for improving the delivery of the personnel process outputs. The examination will include the business planning and performance management framework within which these processes operate. The sponsor expects to receive the report early in 2003. Phase 3, to be completed in mid-2003, will develop more detailed proposals for improvements in future performance and service delivery.
<P>

<a name="20717w01.html_para8">This process-based review, whose approach is supported by the Treasury and Cabinet Office, will replace planned quinquennial reviews of the Naval Recruiting and Training Agency (NRTA), the Army Training and Recruiting Agency (ATRA), and the RAF's Training Group Defence Agency (TGDA). Although the future of these agencies will be considered in detail, the review will focus on end-to-end processes, and not primarily on historical agency performance.
<P>

<a name="20717w01.html_para9">The review team will conduct wide consultation with representatives of stakeholders. However, the team would be interested to hear the views of other organisations or individuals (including people currently in the armed forces) who would like to make a contribution to the review. Those wishing to do so should send their contributions by Monday 16 September by post to:

 The information is not available in the form requested and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However the average age on entry at present is 23 years six months, a rise from 22 years six months as the age limit for entry was raised in 1999&#150;2000 from 25 to 29. The percentages of graduates shown are all British: we do not record whether foreign students were graduates.

 The Government's policy recognises that Gibraltar has been and continues to be an important overseas base for the British Armed Forces, and contains valuable support, logistic, communications and training facilities.

 Membership of the University Officers' Training Corps, by contingent, for each year since 1997, and a breakdown of the membership by sex, is shown in the table. I regret that statistics for age are not held. In light of the fact that most officer cadets are undergraduates, we would expect the majority to be in the 18 to 22 age bracket.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what environmental impact assessments were conducted at Akrotiri prior to antenna construction.  [69646]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 An assessment of the likely environmental impact of the project to build new antennas at Akrotiri was undertaken by a firm of consultants in 1997 and its results were reviewed by the company in 2001.
<P>

<a name="20717w03.html_para0">Last year the British and Cypriot Governments agreed that these environmental impact assessments should be reviewed by an independent panel of international environmental experts. This review was co-ordinated by the Institute of Environmental Management and Assessment. The panel found that there were significant deficiencies in the original assessments, when judged against today's best practice standards and that there was not sufficient information on which to base a decision to proceed with the second phase of the project. The Ministry of Defence therefore commissioned further studies to fill the information gaps identified by the panel and to address their criticisms of the approach to mitigating the potential environmental impact. The panel confirmed in May that this additional work satisfactorily addressed the deficiencies in the original assessments.

 At inception the Defence Munitions (DM) set a challenging strategic goal to reduce total operating costs by 20 per cent. by financial year (FY) 2003&#150;04 ie by 31 March 2004. By the end of FY 2001&#150;02 delivery towards the target stood at 9.3 per cent. The inclusions of Defence Munitions Rationalisation Study 2 reductions (including savings arising from the proposed closure of DM Dean Hill) will, if implemented, deliver operating cost reductions of 16.7 per cent. by the end of FY 2003&#150;04 with the full 20 per cent. being delivered in the course of the following year FY 2004&#150;05.

 For safety reasons the volume of explosives that can be stored at any particular location at any one time is very strictly controlled by licence. Defence Munitions (DM) has an obligation to operate within these licensed limits.

 The process of weapon design addresses, inter alia, the issue of transportation.

activity it is planned to work together with customers and stakeholders to ensure that the resultant distribution of munitions stock more readily lines up with the required outload points for the munitions themselves. Once this re-positioning is completed, the overall planning assumption is that there would be no increase in the volume of munitions carried by road or rail. Likewise there would be no increase in the length in transportation time for the munitions stockpile as a whole.

 The G8 Education Task Force Report made recommendations about the need for developing country commitment to Education for All (EFA), the response required from developed countries, and the need for better assessment of performance.

 HIV/AIDS is both a contributor to and a likely consequence of current food shortages in Southern Africa. The burden of disease has contributed to families' inability to grow enough food or earn the money to buy it; and shortage of food is leading women to trade sex for survival, to family separations and to reduced access to medical care. In assessing vulnerability NGOs and international organisations through whom we are working are taking account of the need to provide AIDS-affected families with appropriate rations and to design delivery mechanisms which will reach them; and to prevent widespread hunger leading to large scale population movement.

affordable drinking water. Storage is an important part of this, and we support initiatives ranging from the work of the World Commission on Dams to rainwater harvesting, and groundwater development. But we also emphasize the importance of other factors that affect sustainability, such as appropriate institutional structures, cost recovery for operation and maintenance, and the involvement of local communities to ensure that services respond to their needs.

 Good transport facilities help provide access to school and health care facilities, and improved access to agricultural inputs and markets. We have not made any specific studies of the impact of transportation on access to clean water. But improved transport facilities clearly improve access for construction materials, for spare parts and for maintenance of existing water systems. Intermediate transport, such as improved bicycles, donkey carts and handcarts all contribute to reducing the load carrying drudgery of the poor&#151;particularly women and children&#151;releasing time for other livelihood and household activities and to attend school.

 DFID is providing &#163;7.1 million for micro-finance institutions in Uganda for financial services to poor people, particularly in rural areas. These programmes are at very early stages and their first formal review is due later this year. However preliminary indications are that they are on track to meet the programme's targets.

 We are not aware of any review of DFID-supported microfinance institutions specific to Kenya.

<P>
<P>

 Where local banking laws permit, and practice varies from country to country, microfinance institutions are invariably keen to make available voluntary savings facilities. In eastern Africa, two-thirds of DFID- supported microfinance programmes make voluntary savings facilities available in some form. This proportion is likely to be reasonably representative of DFID-supported programmes elsewhere.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if pensioners who have entitlement to two Category B retirement pensions will continue to be able to claim and receive the higher one.  [71446]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 It has always been the intention to pay the higher Category B pension but because of the way the legislation was consolidated in 1992, the choice to take the higher amount was removed. This was unintentional. We will continue to pay the more beneficial rate as an extra statutory payment. We shall note the annual departmental resource account and will legislate to correct the position at the earliest opportunity.

 Imports into the United Kingdom of animal products are governed by Community legislation, which protects both animal and public health. Under these rules only third countries approved by the Commission on the advice of the Standing Committee on Food Chain and Animal Health may export into the Community, and only from establishments which meet Community hygiene standards. The lists of countries and establishments allowed to export particular products into the Community, are available on the Commission's website at the following address: http://forum.europa.eu.int/irc/sanco/ vets/info/data/listes/table0.html.

<P>

<a name="20717w07.html_para8">A final decision on the proposal will be taken after extensive consultation, including with the devolved Administrations.

<P>
<a name="20717w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In the United Kingdom, the outbreaks of classical swine fever that occurred in East Anglia during 2000 were caused by a strain of virus belonging to genotype 2.1 and the foot and mouth disease outbreak during 2001 was caused by the pan asia strain of type O virus.
<P>

<a name="20717w08.html_para0">Other than these outbreaks in the United Kingdom, the most comprehensive source of information of disease strains identified is on the OIE website. http://www.oie.int/ eng/info/hebdo/A&#151;DSUM.htm gives information of outbreaks of disease worldwide since 2001 and http:// www.oie.int/eng/press/a&#151;20000922a.htm gives information on strains of diseases found in outbreaks in Europe in 2000. Both of these sites give information on swine fever and foot and mouth disease.

 The Department has sponsored extensive research over a number of years with the British Trust for Ornithology, the RSPB, and other organisations to try to identify the causes of the decline in lapwing and other farmland birds. The Department works closely with these organisations on formulating remedial measures. The Department is already diverting money from agricultural subsidies in the UK to double the size of our agri-environment scheme over the seven years of the England Rural Development Programme. The schemes include valuable incentives to encourage farmland birds such as the lapwing.

 DEFRA provides guidance to the operating authorities (Environment Agency, internal drainage boards and local authorities) which prepare water level management plans (WLMPs). However, the Department does not approve the final plans and it is down to the operating authority to ensure that the plan is fit for its intended purpose.

 Various regulations must be put in place in order that land may be opened up for access under Part I of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000. I recently laid before Parliament regulations on the issue of provisional and conclusive maps of open country and registered common land, including appeals against provisional maps. This will enable the Countryside Agency to issue the first provisional map in England which will apply to the south-east. The table records the overall progress we have made towards consulting on these provisions and bringing them into force together with our current timetable for completing the process. The precise timing of each of the remaining intermediate stages may vary but we are firmly committed to meeting our Public Service Agreement target and I am currently considering whether the final stage can be implemented region by region ahead of the target date.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if the UK Government have applied for EU compensation under Article 20 of Council Regulation 2759/1975 for farmers who were subjected to movement restrictions during the recent foot and mouth crisis; and if she will make a statement.  [68916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Article 20 of Regulation (EEC) No. 2759/75 of the Council of 29 October 1975 on the common organisation of the market in pigmeat provides that exceptional measures may be taken to support any market affected by restrictions on free circulation imposed in consequence of measures to prevent the spread of animal disease.
<P>

<a name="20717w09.html_para1">Introduction of exceptional support measures is dependent on the member state being able to demonstrate that the restrictions due to a disease outbreak have caused severe market distortion. While the impact on those caught up in the control measures was severe, the UK pig market overall did not exhibit clear indications of distortion.
<P>

<a name="20717w09.html_para2">The cull sow market was most severely affected by the export restrictions linked to the foot and mouth outbreak, and officials explored the possibility of a market support based solution with the European Commission&#151;either exceptional market support under the CAP pigmeat regime and/or a cull sow disposal scheme. The Commission were not encouraging on either; although there are precedents for exceptional market support measures in animal disease situations, these have always been restricted to protection/surveillance zones. A scheme restricted in this way was not seen by the pig industry as being of any help to the cull sow market. A nationally funded cull sow disposal scheme was considered by the Commission to be income support; which is prohibited by state aid rules. Therefore no application for such support was made.

The proportion of parishes with a hall is 32 per cent. for those below 100 population, 77 per cent. for those with between 100 and 300 people, 92 per cent. for those between 300 and 500, 94 per cent. for those between 500 and 1,000, 95 per cent. for those between 1,000 and 2,000, 98 per cent. for those between 2,000 and 5,000, and 96 per cent. for those over 5,000.

<a name="20717w10.html_para0">Village halls can play a vital role in rural communities as multi-purpose community centres and hubs for village life. We are supporting the development of active local communities and parish and town councils in a variety of ways; the village hall as a hub for social activity and service provision fits in well with our policy objectives, and support of village halls and the activities that take place there is available from a range of public sector and other sources.

 The Government want the farming industry to succeed and become more competitive. That is one reason why we established the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food and why, following its report, we will launch a new strategy for sustainable food and farming in England in the autumn.
<P>

<a name="20717w11.html_para3">We have already demonstrated our commitment to helping food and farming business increase their competitiveness. For example, we plan to introduce a new Agriculture Development Scheme offering grants to help farmers improve their competitiveness through better marketing. The proposed priorities are developing and improving assurance schemes, encouraging co-operation/ collaboration, benefiting primary producers and benchmarking and spread of best practice.
<P>

<a name="20717w11.html_para4">Success is also dependent on changes at the international level. The Government are working to bring farmers closer to their markets by securing a more economically rational Common Agricultural Policy and further liberalisation of agricultural trade in the World Trade Organisation negotiations.

<a name="20717w12.html_para1">Most agricultural usage is exempt from non-domestic rates under paragraph 1 of schedule 5 to the Local Government Finance Act 1988. The types of agricultural land and buildings covered by this exemption are set out in paragraphs two to eight of that schedule.
<P>

<a name="20717w12.html_para2">In the White Paper "Strong Local Leadership&#151;Quality Public Services" we confirmed our intention to amend the agricultural exemption. First, we intend to ensure that the exemption applies to a range of flexible farming arrangements such as share farming, contract farming and machinery rings, which do not currently qualify for the exemption.
<P>

<a name="20717w12.html_para3">Second, we intend to ensure that the exemption is properly targeted on agricultural activities. Case law has determined that a body corporate can qualify for the agricultural exemption in respect of ancillary activities such as food processing and packaging operations, provided that the corporate body includes a member who occupies agricultural land. The Government are proposing to amend the legislation so that ancillary premises occupied in connection with agricultural land and buildings can become exempt only where the occupiers of the agricultural land have a controlling share in the body corporate that occupies the ancillary premises. A consultation paper on these proposals was published on 31 May 2002.
<P>

<a name="20717w12.html_para4">Provisions for both of these proposed amendments to the agricultural exemption are included in the draft Local Government Bill that was published for consultation purposes on 12 June.

 The Roads Liaison Group (RLG) was set up in 2001, by the then DTLR. Its membership includes DfT, the Local Government Association, and representatives of national and local highway authorities in England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland. It is charged with advising on technical, financial, and administrative policy on the construction and maintenance of highways in the United Kingdom, and with progressing initiatives to further those objectives. These initiatives include the introduction of a computerised system of highway management (UKPMS), a revised version of the street lighting code of practice, and the development of a computerised bridge database and management system.

<a name="20717w15.html_para5">An efficient management system in the highway maintenance field is one that delivers infrastructure fit for the needs of users while providing good value for the resources used.

 The project to procure a national radio communications system for the fire service is now under way. A prior indicative notice was published under EU procurement rules on 11 July, and the project team are taking forward work on the development of project plans and system specification. We expect to publish a formal notice in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities by the end of this year. The new national procurement strategy will deliver new radio systems to fire authorities, including the London Fire and Emergency Planning Authority, from 2005 up to December 2007&#151;but with higher levels of resilience and interoperability than planned under the previous regional procurement.

 Mobile phone mast development in residential areas is subject to the normal telecommunications planning arrangements in place throughout England, set out in Part 24 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (GPDO). These arrangements were significantly strengthened last year and include improved requirements for consulting local people about mast proposals.

<a name="20717w20.html_para5">However, the Environmental Protection Act 1990 places a duty on each waste collection authority to arrange for the collection of household waste in its area, except where the waste is situated at a place which, in the opinion of the authority, is so isolated or inaccessible that the cost of collecting it would be unreasonably high.

<a name="20717w20.html_para6">The Act also puts a duty on local authorities and statutory undertakers to keep their relevant land, including roads, clear of litter and refuse. However, this duty does not apply to unadopted roads as they are not 'relevant land' as specified under section 86 of the Act. The clearance of litter on these roads is therefore the responsibility of the residents on that road.

 The number of complaints about the erroneous transfer of gas supply received by Energywatch rose from 2,511&#151;one and a half per 1,000 transfers&#151;in January to June 2001 to 4,204&#151;two per 1,000 transfers&#151;in July to December 2001. In the same period, the number of complaints about the erroneous transfer of electricity supply rose from 2,905&#151;one per 1,000 transfers&#151;to 4,837&#151;one and a half per 1,000 transfers. Complaints about marketing for 2001 also include involuntary transfers that occurred as a result of the sales process. The number of gas marketing complaints rose from 1,201 in January to June 2001 to 1,753 in July to December 2001. In the same period, electricity marketing complaints rose from 1,776 to 3,116. Energywatch complaints figures will shortly incorporate erroneous transfers arising from both administrative or data error and mis-selling. Although involuntary transfers remain very low in relation to the level of transfer activity&#151;there were almost 1 million registrations in 2001&#151;the Government are concerned about the distress and inconvenience caused by erroneous transfer of energy supply. They welcomed the Erroneous Transfer Customer Charter, which came into force on 1 January 2002.

 The treatment of erroneous transfers is governed by the Erroneous Transfer Customer Charter, which was developed by the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM) and Energywatch. The charter, which is intended to improve co-operation between suppliers with a view to resolving problems quickly, with minimal involvement on the consumer's part, was agreed by the industry last year and came into force on 1 January 2002. OFGEM will review the industry's performance against the charter in October 2002, and has made clear that, if the industry's performance against the charter is inadequate, it will consider the modification of standard licence conditions or the introduction of guaranteed standards of performance, which carry an automatic right to compensation.

<P>
<a name="20717w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Government have been heavily involved in discussions&#151;both domestically and in Brussels&#151;on the proposed new public procurement directive which, among other things, clarifies the scope to take account of environmental issues in public procurement. My hon. Friend, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Competition, Consumers and Markets, signed up to a political agreement on the proposed directive at the Internal Market Council on 21 May. The proposed new directive will make it clear how environmental issues can be taken into account at all stages of the procurement process. This clarification, which is very much in line with UK objectives, should be particularly helpful in confirming the scope to take account of green production processes, eco-label criteria and environmental management systems.

<a name="20717w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Political agreement was reached on the proposals to simplify, clarify and update the existing public procurement directives at the Internal Market Council on 21 May. In the discussions leading up to this agreement, the UK strongly supported proposals to incorporate legitimate environmental considerations into the procurement process. The proposed new directive will, in particular, clarify the scope to use non-discriminatory specifications, which can include relevant eco-label criteria and green production processes. It will also confirm the scope to consider relevant elements of a company's environmental management systems in selecting tenderers, and to take account of whole life cost and quality issues, such as energy and disposal savings which benefit the contracting authority, at the award stage. This is all very much in line with UK objectives. Discussions are continuing on parallel proposals to amend the utilities directive, where it is expected that the scope to take account of environmental issues, under this directive, will be very similar to that for the public sector. It is not yet clear whether procurement will be a matter for the September Internal Market Council.

<P>
<a name="20717w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Each member state is responsible for its own public procurement policies within the framework set by the treaty and the EC public procurement directives. The Government have been very active&#151;both domestically and in Brussels&#151;in considering how environmental issues can be taken into account in public procurement within the EC legal framework and the Government's policy of achieving value for money for the taxpayer. The UK played a full part in the discussions in Brussels leading up to the publication of the Commission's interpretative communication on environmental issues and in the clarifications, in the proposed new public sector directive, of how environmental considerations can be taken into account at each stage of the procurement process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w23.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 July 2002]:</i> We currently receive around 700 new claims per week for vibration white finger (VWF) and around 900 per week for respiratory disease. It is therefore not possible to estimate how long it will take to process all claims.
<P>

<a name="20717w23.html_para2">In order to speed up the claims process, we are continuing to work closely with the contractors and the claimants' solicitors, and have systems in place such as national ministerial monitoring groups in order to monitor the process. We are therefore ensuring that all parties are able to work together to make sure that any delays are dealt with promptly.
<P>

<a name="20717w23.html_para3">The medical assessment processes for both respiratory disease and vibration white finger are detailed thoroughly in order to ensure that each claim is dealt with fairly and on an individual basis. They were agreed between the parties and there are no current plans to change them. The medical assessment is not a bottleneck causing delay in either scheme.
<P>

<a name="20717w23.html_para4">The handling agreement for compensation for VWF was formally signed on 22 January 1999, and the respiratory disease handling agreement was formally signed on 24 September 1999. Claims under either scheme could not have been settled before this date. The number of claimants who initiated their claim after the date of the agreement, but have died since registering their claim, is 9,071 for respiratory disease and 3,151 for VWF.

 We intend to establish a network of up to 300 advanced schools by 2006 and would want to see an initial group in operation from September 2003. Decisions about the location of these schools will be taken before next June. Advanced schools will be at the forefront of our drive to reform the education system and will provide opportunities for our best schools to lead the transformation of secondary education in their local areas.

 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2002]:</i> The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has established an annual testing programme to provide data on pupils' attainment and progress in Years 3, 4 and 5. The data, collected and analysed by the National Foundation for Educational Research (NfER), augment those already available through the national curriculum tests at Year 2 and Year 6 and is reported in Ofsted's annual evaluation reports on the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies. Ofsted's report on the third year of the National Literacy Strategy said that:

<a name="20717w27.html_para0">The Ontario Institute for Studies in Education, University of Toronto (OISE/UT) has also been commissioned to evaluate the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies. They will publish their final report early next year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what her policy is on recruiting teachers for work in the UK from third world countries which are the aimed beneficiaries of the Education for All initiative.  [69254]<P>

<P>
<a name="20717w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Government are committed to helping developing countries achieve the Millennium Development Goal of universal primary education by 2015. We recognise that in many countries this will mean a major increase in the supply and retention of well- trained teachers. The Government do not directly recruit teachers, either here or abroad. Neither do we actively encourage recruitment by others from developing countries. But suitable teachers choosing to come and work in England for a time are welcome. Some are likely to return to their home countries, taking with them valuable experience of initiatives such as the numeracy and literacy strategies. We are committed to making the experience of those overseas teachers who do choose to work here as productive and developmental as possible, not least to maximise the benefits to their home countries. We have introduced a Quality Mark scheme, which will badge agencies that demonstrate, among other things, good practice in the recruitment and induction of overseas teachers. And we have established a new Recruitment and Retention Unit in the Government office for London which will support London LEAs in improving the experience of overseas-trained teachers.

 The Government have no plans to legislate on the insurance of IT equipment owned by schools or LEAs.

 Departments are required to comply with the Government's general policy on insurance, which is set out in "Government Accounting", chapter 30, paragraph 30.2.5, which notes that Government does not need to purchase insurance to protect the viability of its business, and should consider insurance only where the value of claims met would exceed the cost of insurance premiums.

 EU and other western diplomatic missions in C&#244;te d'Ivoire, including our own, were in regular touch with the Ivorian Government and Independent Electoral Commission in the run-up to the elections. They made clear, among other things, the need to ensure that arrangements for voter identification were as comprehensive as possible. The Interior Minister gave an assurance that the distribution of identity cards would continue up to and including polling day itself.

 Mark Byford was appointed Director World Service and Global News in October 2001. As soon as the new division is formally established Mr. Byford's remuneration will initially be met two-thirds from the grant in aid and one third from BBC World. This would be subject to review after a year. Pending the creation of the new division, Mr. Byford's remuneration is met entirely from the grant in aid. His remuneration is set by the BBC Board of Governors, and is published in the BBC Annual Report and the BBC World Service Annual Review.

 <i>[holding answer 20 May 2002]:</i> Records are not maintained by the Home Department which enable ill health retirements to be separately identified as work-related. Our records indicate that for the Home Department the number of staff with a medical retirement certificate issued by the Civil Service pension scheme medical adviser for the period 1 January 2001&#150; 31 December 2001 was 505. Benefits provided on medical retirement are set out in the rules of the Principal Civil Service Pension Scheme and laid before Parliament, and provide for an immediate payment of enhanced pension and lump sum. Ill health retirement expenditure is met centrally from the Civil Superannuation Vote. For the year ending March 2002, provisional expenditure met from the vote was &#163;310 million in respect of all Civil Service cases for which an ill health pension has been awarded. These cases number approximately 67,000 and include those who have formally been ill health retired but who have now reached and exceeded the normal retirement age.

<a name="20717w34.html_para2">The work permit arrangements are designed to strike the right balance between enabling employers to recruit or transfer skilled people from abroad while safeguarding the interests of the resident labour force. The arrangements are labour market led.
<P>

<a name="20717w34.html_para3">Before a work permit can be issued the employer will normally be expected to demonstrate by advertising the post that there is no suitably qualified resident workers. However, this requirement is waived where the vacancy is in respect of an occupation included on Work Permits (UK) shortage occupation list. Such applications will nevertheless need to meet the other criteria of the work permit arrangements as to the skills, qualifications and experience of the employee and the terms and conditions of employment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w34.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 There are no estimates of the value of the United Kingdom (UK) domestic and international trade in the drugs specified in the question. However, a study by National Economic Research Associates (NERA) produced the following estimates of the value of the market in 1998&#150;99 for the following specific drugs: amphetamines &#163;257.7 million; cannabis 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jul 2002 : Column 397W</I><P>
&#163;1,577.9 million; cocaine &#163;352.8 million; crack &#163;1,817.4 million; ecstasy &#163;294.6 million; and heroin &#163;2,313.0 million. These figures should not be regarded as definitive since the purpose of the study "Sizing the UK market for illicit drugs" was to carry out research into different methodologies for assessing the size of illicit drug market. Her Majesty's Customs believe the cocaine (and probably ecstasy) figure from the NERA study is likely to significantly understate the true position by missing much recreational use. This work was in large part derived from the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring (NEW-ADAM) and therefore reflects drug users who have come to the attention of the criminal justice system&#151;which is more likely to be the case with heroin or crack users.
<P>

<a name="20717w34.html_para9">A United Nations study published in January 1998 reported that estimates of the turnover of the global illicit drug industry varied considerably from US$100 billion to US$1,000 billion a year, with the most frequently found figures in the literature in the range US$300 billion to US$500 billion a year.

<P>
<P>

 Departments are required to comply with the Government's general policy on insurance, which is set out in Government Accounting, Chapter 30, para 30.2.5, which notes that Government do not need to purchase insurance to protect the viability of its business, and should consider insurance only where the value of claims met would exceed the cost of insurance premiums.

 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2002]:</i> The Home Department undertakes a wide range of research activities that support the development of information-led policy, including scientific and engineering research, market and opinion research and social research. My Research, Development and Statistics Directorate (RDS) conducts social research supporting all seven Home Office aims. However, RDS do not collect statistics at parliamentary constituency level for a number of reasons. In particular, many of the statistics collected locally are based on administrative areas, such as local and police authorities, and these do not always share boundaries with parliamentary constituencies.
<P>

<a name="20717w35.html_para2">In the past, following each United Kingdom (UK) Parliamentary General Election a House of Commons Paper compiled by RDS was laid before Parliament in the form of a Return to an Address, and similarly, after each European Parliamentary Election a Home Office Statistical Bulletin was published by RDS. Each publication contained statistics of individual candidates' Election Expenses (except for the bulletin covering the 1999 European Parliamentary elections where, because of the voting system used, individual candidates did not have control over their expenses). Both publications also contained details, by UK Parliamentary or European Parliamentary constituency, of rejected ballot papers, postal and proxy votes, and votes polled. The responsibility for compiling and publishing these figures passed on 1 December 2000 to the Electoral Commission.

 Departments are required to comply with the Government's general policy on insurance, which is set out in Government Accounting, Chapter 30, paragraph 30.2.5, which notes that Government do not need to purchase insurance to protect the viability of its business and, should consider insurance only where the value of claims met would exceed the cost of insurance premiums. Commercial insurance of a building is acceptable in cases where (a) insurance is a condition of a lease, (b) the lessor will not accept a Government indemnity, (c) incurring the total cost of the accommodation in question, including the cost of the insurance, is more cost-effective than other accommodation options (Government Accounting, paragraph 30.2.11a).

<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w38.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Government's position is that the definition of basic care includes the offer of food and fluids. These should always be offered to patients who are capable of swallowing them. Where nutrition and hydration have to be provided by artificial means, their possible withdrawal is, in all cases, a matter of clinical judgment which is undertaken in accordance with professional advice provided by a responsible and recognised body of medical opinion and the general law. The current consultation paper, "Making Decisions: Helping People who have Difficulty Deciding for Themselves", reflects this position.

<a name="20717w40.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 2002]:</i> While other developed countries have broadly similar incidence of cancer, there is evidence to suggest that for many cancers, including colon cancer, survival rates for patients diagnosed a decade ago are lower in this country than in comparable European countries and the United States. Experts in the field suggest that the reason for the lower survival rates is due at least in part to patients in the United Kingdom having more advanced disease at the time of treatment.

 <i>[holding answer 3 July 2002]:</i> Cancer services in England are organised in 34 cancer networks. Cancer networks bring together primary, secondary, tertiary and voluntary service providers to plan and deliver specialist services across the patient pathway. Information on the number of participating institutions is not collected centrally.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health which authorities hold lead responsibility at local level for the preparation and delivery of teenage pregnancy strategies.  [63332]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w40.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Since April 2001, every top tier local authority in England has a local teenage pregnancy strategy and rolling three-year action plan, developed jointly by health and local authority partners and agreed by the Teenage Pregnancy Unit in the Department. Responsibility for the implementation of the local strategy is held jointly by the local authority and relevant primary care trusts (PCTs).
<P>

<a name="20717w40.html_para3">Since April 2002, funding to support implementation of agreed local strategies has been routed to local authorities through a teenage pregnancy local implementation grant. The local authority is the accountable body and must take decisions on the expenditure of the grant to ensure that it

<a name="20717w40.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the reasons why the Food Standards Agency are making representations to the Commission to ban the use of sheep intestines in sausages; and what scientific evidence his Department has collated on whether scrapie in sheep could mask the detection of BSE.  [63676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w40.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that the Agency's Board endorsed a report on bovine spongiform eucephalopathy (BSE) and sheep from a core group of stakeholders at its meeting in Armagh on 13 June. It contained a recommendation that the European Commission be requested to add sheep intestine to the current list of specified risk material for sheep as an additional precautionary measure. The Board agreed the recommendation on the basis that the measure, added to the current controls, could reduce potential infectivity entering the food chain by up to two-thirds if BSE were found in sheep. Current precautionary measures are estimated to reduce risk by approximately one-third.
<P>

<a name="20717w40.html_para4">There is a theoretical risk that BSE exists in the national flock as some consumed the same type of feed that is thought to have infected cattle. A sheep apparently suffering from scrapie could instead be suffering from BSE as it is currently not possible to differentiate between the symptoms of the two diseases. In an Opinion issued in February 2001, the Scientific Steering Committee (SSC) of the European Union stated: 'the agent causing scrapie, the expression of clinical disease in scrapie- affected sheep, cannot currently be distinguished from BSE by any means other than biological strain typing of the agent responsible.' Bioassays in mice take up to two years to complete. It has only been possible to test a small sample of brains from sheep thought to have scrapie to determine whether a BSE-like strain is present.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w40.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 No. The only risk to health identified from the use of toothpaste containing fluoride is dental fluorosis. I am satisfied that the instructions on use which manufacturers include on packets and tubes of toothpaste protects the public from this risk.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if disodium fluorosilicate and hexafluorosilicic acid are safe to use for the purpose of fluoridating drinking water.  [64465]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w40.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Yes. In dilute aqueous solution, sufficient to increase the naturally occurring fluoride concentration to one part per million, hexafluorosilicic acid yields fluoride ions, hydrogen ions and silica. Disodium hexafluorosilicate yields sodium ions in addition. All of these products occur 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jul 2002 : Column 418W</I><P>
naturally in water supplies. The only product whose concentration is significantly raised by fluoridation is the fluoride ion.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on his policy on water fluoridation.  [64471]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w40.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 We have asked the Medical Research Council for advice on how the research base on the safety and efficacy of water fluoridation in reducing tooth decay might be strengthened and their report is expected shortly. In the meantime our advice to health communities in areas of high dental decay is to consider consulting their local populations on whether they should have their water fluoridated.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w40.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Syms: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what restrictions there are on the concentration of fluoride permitted in water used to manufacture baby foods.  [64472]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w40.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The quality of drinking water is subject to The Water Supply (Water Quality) Regulations 1989 (SI 1147) as amended. This sets a maximum limit for fluoride at 1.5 mg per litre. Therefore, companies making baby food or infant formula using tap water would have less than 1.5 mg per litre for the water component of the feed, plus any other source of fluoride. As the limit for fluoride is the same for Private Water Supplies (The Private Water Supply Regulations 1991 SI 2790), manufacturers using such a supply would not be expected to produce baby food with a different level of fluoride.

 Changing to liquid based cytology (LBC) would be a major change to the way in which the national health service cervical screening programme is delivered.

I understand that NICE's guidance on human growth hormone in adults was due to be issued this month. However, since the final appraisal determination has been appealed against, the guidance will be issued at the earliest in October 2002, subject to the outcome of the appeal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w42.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Entitlement to national health service hospital treatment is based on residence in the United Kingdom. People who are not normally resident in the UK are subject to the provisions of the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) regulations, as amended in 1991 (SI No:438), 1994 (SI No:1535), 2000 (SI No: 602), 2000 (SI No:909). These regulations place a duty on hospitals and other NHS bodies to establish the residence qualification of all patients.
<P>

<a name="20717w42.html_para1">General practitioners are encouraged to consider residency before accepting a patient for NHS treatment but are not bound by the same regulations. Under the NHS (General Medical Services) Regulations 1992 a general practitioner does not have to accept any patient for NHS treatment unless specifically allocated by a primary care trust. The general practitioner's decision does not automatically exempt the patient from charges for hospital treatment they may subsequently need.

 The framework document for the new general medical services contract, which was agreed with the British Medical Association's general practitioners' (GP) committee in April, contains proposals for new ways of funding GP practices.

<P>

<a name="20717w42.html_para2">With regard to the reform of the present health funding system, a wide ranging review of the weighted capitation formula used to allocate resources to health authorities and primary care trusts in England is currently taking place. A key criterion of the new formula will be to contribute to the reduction of avoidable health inequalities. The intention is that, following the review, the new formula will be ready for 2003&#150;04 allocations.

 The Department has not carried out any risk assessment of wood pre-treated with copper/ chromium/arsenic (CCA) wood preservative, nor has the Department received any representation on this issue.
<P>

<a name="20717w43.html_para0">In the United Kingdom wood preservative products are regulated under the Control of Pesticide Regulations (1986) and the Health and Safety Executive lead on such non-agricultural pesticides. CCA is approved for use in products for pressure impregnation at industrial sites. This follows the advice to Ministers from the independent advisory committee on pesticides that such products do not present any risk to human health or the environment.
<P>

<a name="20717w43.html_para1">Recently an expert advisory committee to the European Commission, the scientific committee on toxicity, ecotoxicity and the environment has reviewed the safety of wood treated with this preservative and has concluded that there may be a risk to health of children from the use of such treated timber in playground equipment and also when treated wood is burnt or disposed.
<P>

<a name="20717w43.html_para2">The European Commission has drawn up proposals under the Marketing and Use Directive to prohibit the use of CCA wood preservatives but by way of a derogutim to continue to allow its use in a number of essential areas where human contact is limited. Draft proposals are currently being considered by member states.

<P>
<P>

 Podiatric surgery is a specialism within chiropody/podiatry. We do not plan numbers of podiatric surgeons centrally but would expect the national health service locally to consider how to develop the role of chiropodists as numbers expand.
<P>

<a name="20717w43.html_para3">Between 1999 and 2001 the number of chiropodists employed in the NHS has increased by 190 (5.5 per cent.) and our latest estimates, based on historic trends and planned increases in students entering training, suggest a further increase of 750 (20 per cent.) in the number of chiropodists working in the NHS by 2009.

<a name="20717w43.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> The information is not available in the form requested. In 'The UK Smoking Epidemic: Deaths in 1995' (published by the Health Education Authority, 1998) it was estimated that in the United Kingdom in 1995, smoking caused more than 120,000 deaths of people aged 35 years or more; one in five deaths at all ages. Men of 35 who smoke will, on average, die seven years earlier than men who have never been smokers. Similarly, women of 35 who smoke will, on average, die six years earlier than women who have never been smokers. As well as being the prime cause of cancer and heart disease, smoking also causes other fatal conditions and chronic illnesses among adults.
<P>

<a name="20717w43.html_para4">In 'Smoking Kills' published in 1998, the Government set out a comprehensive programme to tackle smoking. A key element of this programme has been the development of smoking cessation services which were launched in the health action zones in 1999&#150;2000, and were rolled out to all health authorities in England in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02.

<a name="20717w43.html_para5">Regional prevalence data shows how the burden of smoking has varied over the past five years. Table 1 shows a regional breakdown of the prevalence of smokers among adults aged 16 and over. Table 2 details by region the number of people who had successfully quit at the four week follow-up and rates per 100,000 population for April to December 2001. Table 3 illustrates the regional variations in coronary heart disease. Table 4 illustrates the regional variation in cancer mortality.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answers of 27 June 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1075W, and of 10 April 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 519W, if he will make a statement on the correlation between the irregular dispensation of pneumococcal vaccines and the number of pneumococcal meningitis cases over the last five years; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w44.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2002]:</i> Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine has been recommended for some years for people over the age of two years who are at particular risk from pneumococcal infection such as those people with chronic renal, heart or lung disease. It is not given annually and in most patients is given once only. Once at-risk groups have been targeted for immunisation, the number of people requiring vaccine the following year should fall. Conjugate vaccine, suitable for those under two, has only recently become available.
<P>

<a name="20717w44.html_para0">The number of notified cases of pneumococcal meningitis over the last five years has declined from 300 cases in 1997 to 201 cases in 2001.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20717w44.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2002]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) that as the risk of BSE in sheep is theoretical, there is no quantitative assessment of the risk of consuming sheepmeat. Current precautionary controls require the removal as specified risk material of the spleen from all animals and the skull (including brain and eyes), spinal cord and tonsils of sheep over one-year-old. A report on BSE and sheep compiled by a group of stakeholders was endorsed by the Board of the FSA on 13 June 2002. The assessments taken into account in this report indicate that animals over one year would represent a higher risk, if BSE were present. Removal of lamb brain from younger animals was

<P><I>17 Jul 2002 : Column 429W</I><P>
assessed to have a minimal impact on increasing the level of risk reduction compared with the current requirement to remove brains from sheep over one-year-old.

<P>
<a name="20717w44.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 July 2002]:</i> Natural sausage casings are not routinely included in the United Kingdom's surveillance programme for veterinary medicines, including antibiotics. Following recent reports that antibiotic residues have been found in natural sausage casings from China and hence might pose a risk to consumers, a European Commission Decision has been implemented whereby 20 per cent. of all consignments of casing from China are required to be sampled and tested for a range of chemical residues including antibiotics. No other countries have been implicated to date.

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> I have not received any scientific advice that imported frozen chicken could present a risk of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE). When the Food Standards Agency conducted a survey in 2001 it did not detect any deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of bovine origin in imported frozen chicken. A subsequent survey published by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland in May 2002 detected bovine DNA in some samples, which was associated with protein derived low risk materials such as hides and milk.

<P>
<a name="20717w44.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> Following an earlier survey in 2000, the Food Standards Agency found that some retail frozen chicken breast has excessive amounts of added water. Therefore in 2001, the Food Standards Agency and 22 local authorities conducted a joint survey investigating the composition and labelling of frozen chicken breast from catering suppliers. The survey found two samples tested positive for porcine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), but none of the samples tested positive for bovine DNA. The results of this survey were made public in December 2001.
<P>

<a name="20717w44.html_para4">The main finding of the survey was the problem of mislabelling of this type of product as to its description, its excessive water content, and the presence of undeclared hydrolysed chicken and pork protein.

<P>
<a name="20717w44.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> The monitoring and enforcement of labelling of all foods, including imported frozen chicken breasts, is the responsibility of local authorities. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) has also carried out two surveys on the accuracy of labelling of frozen chicken breast, one in 2000 on retail samples and a further joint survey with 22 local authorities of frozen chicken breast destined for the catering sector in 2001. Both surveys have been published on the FSA's website.

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> As a result of the Food Standards Agency's survey and subsequent work by the Food Safety Authority-Ireland, the agency has approached the authorities of the exporting countries to ensure correct labelling of these products. The agency is working with local authorities to follow up survey findings and take prosecutions where appropriate. The

 <i>[holding answer 11 July 2002]:</i> I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that no bovine deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) has been detected in agency surveys of imported frozen chicken.
<P>

<a name="20717w44.html_para7">A survey undertaken by the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, published on 21 May 2002, detected bovine DNA in the form of milk protein or collagen. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) infectivity has never been detected in milk, so milk protein is not considered to present a BSE risk. The European Commission Scientific Steering Committee concluded at its meeting of 10&#150;11 May 2001 that the parts of the hide used for the production of collagen do not present a risk with regard to BSE provided contamination with potentially infected material is avoided. In addition it is a requirement throughout the European Union that food or food products (including bovine proteins) must not be derived from either confirmed or suspected BSE cases, specified risk material, or animals slaughtered at over thirty months of age that have not tested negative for BSE.
