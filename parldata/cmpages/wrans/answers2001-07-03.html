The table also shows the number of applications that did not result in the loss of any areas larger than a sports pitch. In the case of all approved applications, any proceeds were used to provide new or improved sports or education facilities at maintained schools.

 The procedures to ensure the consistency of marking of AS levels within awarding bodies are contained in the GCSE and GCE A/AS Code of Practice. A copy of this document, published by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) and its counterparts in Wales and Northern Ireland, has been placed in the House of Commons Library. The QCA monitors compliance with this Code of Practice. It also looks at consistency between awarding bodies on a sample basis each year.

 Teachers delivering vocational GCSEs in maintained secondary schools will be required to have Qualified Teacher Status. While there will be no further statutory requirements concerning qualifications, headteachers will be expected to match teachers' backgrounds and experiences as closely as possible to the subjects on offer. A comprehensive training and support programme will be available to ensure teachers are well prepared for, and supported during, the delivery of courses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 We introduced a new admissions framework for all schools in the School Standards and Framework Act 1998. Its aim was to promote parental choice and make the admissions system fairer and easier for parents. A new statutory requirement was imposed on admission authorities requiring them to consult each other annually, before determining their admission arrangements. Where local agreement cannot be reached, admission authorities can object to an independent Schools Adjudicator or, where appropriate, to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="10703w02.html_para0">School admission arrangements are decided locally and admission authorities are free to choose what arrangements to use, although they must be clear, fair and objective and operated in a reasonable manner in line with guidance contained in the Code of Practice on School Admissions.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Pupil Referral Units (PRUs) can be established by local education authorities under section 19(2) of the Education Act 1996 to educate young people who are unable to attend school because of illness, exclusion or 



<P>
<P><I>3 Jul 2001 : Column: 85W</I><P>
otherwise. Education authorities must tell the Secretary of State whenever they set up or close a PRU, although there are no formal opening or closing procedures. However, before opening or closing a PRU there should be reasonable consultation locally, including with other PRUs in an area. The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1996 apply to PRUs with certain modifications. PRUs do not have to provide: a head teacher's room; playing fields; or staff accommodation for teachers to use for both work and social purposes. Education authorities may provide such accommodation, particularly for PRUs that offer full-time education on the premises. Education authorities must also ensure that PRU accommodation meets health, safety and fire regulations, and that it is suitable for education.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 There are good schools of all sizes. Delivery of a balanced curriculum depends on the organisation of the school and the skills and professionalism of the staff. We are supporting high standards in schools by effective inspection and targeted increased resources.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Following increases in the amount of education funding we have made available to schools and local education authorities since 1997, the average class size for primary pupils aged eight and over has fallen for the second consecutive year; it is now 26.7. We intend to continue to improve funding to schools and by 2003&#150;04 the average funding per pupil will have risen by &#163;750 in real terms since 1997&#150;98; schools may use this to reduce class sizes for junior pupils if they see that as a priority. In addition, we have announced that &#163;73 million is being made available this year specifically to ensure that infants transferring to junior class continue to benefit from small classes.

 Although rare, teachers can face redundancy and redeployment when the need for their work at a particular school ceases or diminishes. Nevertheless, they enjoy the same general employment rights under the law as employees in other occupations.

<P>
<a name="10703w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The issue of how best to value the export of energy to local electricity networks, including the specific issue of net metering, was examined by the Embedded Generation Working Group, who issued their final report recently. The Working Group concluded that further work on this issue was required and made a number of recommendations on how this might be progressed. We shall be making an announcement shortly on how the recommendations of the Embedded Generation Working Group will be taken forward.
<P>

<a name="10703w02.html_para3">In May, the then Energy Minister wrote to electricity suppliers and distribution network operators asking them to consider improving net metering terms for small scale domestic renewable energy generators, including electricity from photovoltaics. A number of responses have been received and the Department will be considering what further action can be taken in the light of the conclusions that emerge.

 The directive allows for flexible information and consultation procedures which can be adapted to meet the needs of individual employers. As such it will help foster partnership at work, thereby improving competitiveness.

 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> During the last Parliament the Government set out their comprehensive strategy for meeting the productivity challenge in "Productivity in the UK: The Evidence and the Government's Approach", which was published alongside the November 2000 pre-Budget Report. The Government have also published major White Papers on enterprise, skills development and on science and innovation policy.

To this end, the Government recently published "Productivity in the UK: Enterprise and the Productivity Challenge" which sets out measures to remove obstacles to innovation and competition and to create an enterprise culture, open to all. We are introducing measures to reform the competition regime, to encourage small businesses to start, innovate and grow, and to raise the quantity and quality of investment in the public and private sectors.

 Due to the foot and mouth restrictions no firings are currently taking place at the Kirkcudbright range in Scotland.

No changes are being made to the manufacturing process for the few, final batches and, based on advice from MOD's technical, safety and commercial experts, it has been agreed that the final firings can be waived. Further proof testing while the ammunition remains in service may be required, but this has yet to be confirmed.

The second relates to trials prior to the acceptance of a new charge for A1 climatic conditions (very hot and dry). These safety trails could require the firing of an estimated maximum of 120 rounds.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he expects the asylum support stakeholder group to meet; and if he will make a statement about its role.  [1123]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w06.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The aim of the group as originally constituted was to act as a consultative forum at the time the asylum support scheme to be administered by the national asylum support service (NASS) was being set up. The asylum support stakeholder group has not met since NASS went live on 3 April 2000.
<P>

<a name="10703w06.html_para3">Currently, responsibility for formation of stakeholder groups rests with individual local authority regional consortiums responsible for asylum support issues.

<P>
<a name="10703w06.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Information on the number of initial decisions to refuse refugee status from 1995 to 2000 is given in the table. Data on the number of refusals resulting from incorrectly completed applications are unavailable. However, such cases fall into the category of non- compliance, covering, for example, failure to provide further evidence as required, failure to respond to invitations to interview and failure to complete a statement of evidence form correctly or within the time allowed. Data on non-compliance are included in the table.
<P>

<a name="10703w06.html_para5">My hon. Friend may also be interested to know that in May 2001 79 per cent. of initial decisions were upheld on appeal.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if it remains his policy to end the use of prisons to hold asylum seekers by October.  [1466]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w06.html_spnew6"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Government remain committed to their long-term strategy of reducing the use of prison accommodation to hold immigration detainees. However, even in the long term, for reasons of geography, security and control, there will continue to be a need to hold some detainees in prisons. The use of the dedicated detention facilities managed by the Prison Service at Haslar, Rochester and Lindholme does not at present have a set duration. The temporary use of 500 additional places made available by the Prison Service in a number of local prisons is being reviewed and the timing of the withdrawal of immigration detainees from these prisons is the subject of discussions with the Prison Service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on reductions in the number of prison officers at HMP Garth and HMP Wymott.  [2022]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w06.html_spnew9"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 As part of the substantial settlements which the Prison Service received from the Treasury under the comprehensive spending review and spending review 2000, the service is required to deliver 1 per cent. cashable efficiency savings each year on its baselines. Following studies by the Prison Service's management consultancy service, the governors of Garth and Wymott are seeking to agree with the Prison Officers Association a package of efficiency measures including regrading and civilianisation. The proposed reduction at Wymott is 18 prison officer posts and at Garth 10 officer and two senior officer posts, to be partly offset by increases in civilian staff and operational support grades. The governors are satisfied that these changes can be introduced without endangering the safety of staff or prisoners or the security of the establishments.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will increase the monitoring of the running of HMP Garth and HMP Wymott.  [2024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w06.html_spnew10"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 All prison establishments are regularly monitored by area managers against over 40 key performance targets, and the deputy director general personally reviews performance monthly. Area managers visit every establishment at least eight times a year and therefore there are no plans to introduce monitoring for Garth and Wymott over and above the current level already provided.

 We continue to be deeply concerned by the suffering of all in the Sudan, regardless of religious or ethnic background. Christians do have specific concerns, which we take up with the Government of Sudan bilaterally and through the EU. In recent weeks, our ambassador in Khartoum has discussed our concerns with a number of leading Sudanese politicians, including the Vice-President, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister for Religious Affairs and the Governor of Khartoum State. He has also held a meeting with Archbishop Marona, the leader of the Episcopal Church of Sudan. This is part of a continuing dialogue on a key issue for human rights, and peace, in Sudan. Church issues are also an important part of the agenda of the EU/Sudan political dialogue. In London, my officials keep in close touch with representatives of the British Churches with an interest in Sudanese affairs.

The conference looked at a number of key interrelated areas in the illegal drugs economy, including factors influencing production of illegal drugs; middle markets and how best to attack them; and the wider corrosive impacts of the drugs trade internationally, including its impact on livelihoods, governance, environment, legitimate trade and conflict. The conference also addressed the relationship between the drugs trade and other areas of illegal economic activity.

He also assured me that the Colombian Government are aware of the need to strengthen the protection mechanisms for a civilian peace scheme in the region, and will adopt the measures necessary to protect vulnerable communities there. Also on 27 June, British embassy officials met members of the San Francisco peace community close to Cacarica, and experiencing similar serious problems, to listen to their concerns first hand.

 We believe that problems at work should be resolved by constructive negotiation; accordingly we are pleased that the RMT and almost all of the relevant train operators were able to avoid a dispute planned for Monday 25 June and tomorrow, 4 July, and that the recent dispute which led to industrial action on the London Underground has been resolved with the RMT and ASLEF. I will also be meeting representatives of employers and unions in other parts of the transport industry.

 The Local Government Act 1972 contains no provision for the abolition of parish councils. However, this legislation provides for the dissolution of parish councils where the population of a parish falls below 150. Dissolution in such circumstances is carried out by order of the district council. We have no record of any dissolution orders.

 Figures showing the level of empty council housing need to be seen in the context of local authorities' overall strategies for addressing deprived areas, and areas of low demand. In this respect an increase in properties awaiting demolition may be a relevant factor. It is clearly important that local authorities turn round empty properties which are available for letting, whether immediately or after minor repairs, as quickly as possible.

 At 1 April 2001 the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Central) (DETR (C)) employed 4,044 staff. We estimate that once restructuring is complete, the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions (Central) ((DTLR (C)) will employ approximately 3,400 staff subject to final decision on the number of support staff to transfer. This figure also takes account of staff movements between DTLR, Home Office and Department of Trade and Industry which follow from Machinery of Government changes made after the election.

 The number of households accepted by local housing authorities as unintentionally homeless and in priority need during the 12 months prior to March 2001 was 113,590. That is 2.5 per cent. higher than the number of households accepted during the 12 months prior to March 1997 110,810.

<a name="10703w12.html_para7">The underlying reason for the increase in acceptances is a shortage of affordable accommodation in some areas, especially London and the south-east. This shortage follows a significant cut in housing resources, when the

1992&#150;97 Government cut total capital investment in housing from &#163;3.9 billion in 1992&#150;93 to planned spending of only &#163;1.5 billion in 1997&#150;98. High property prices in a very buoyant housing market, particularly in these areas, may also have contributed to an increase in homeless acceptances by reducing the availability of low cost affordable accommodation.

<a name="10703w12.html_para8">The Government have substantially increased the resources available for housing investment to tackle the significant problems they inherited. The housing resources provided for the current year, of around &#163;3.3 billion, are twice the amount made available for 1997&#150;98, and further significant increases are planned for the next two years. As part of this, we have nearly doubled the Housing Corporation's Approved Development Programme with an additional &#163;872 million aimed at building more affordable social housing. Our target is to provide at least 100,000 new or improved homes for low-cost renting or ownership through the Approved Development Programme and other programmes between April 2001 and March 2004.

These do not include the use of market mechanisms for allocating slots, although the Commission has said that it intends to undertake research into the subject.

 Over 16,000 letters have been received during recent months on foot-and-mouth-related issues. It is not possible to say precisely how many of these concern the reopening of footpaths, although we estimate the number to be in the region of 1,000. Ministers have also met representatives of a range of interested parties, including users of footpaths, farmers and land managers; to discuss path reopening and the issue has been discussed at several meetings of the rural task force.
<P>

<a name="10703w14.html_para0">A range of representations concerning the reopening of footpaths have been received by letter and in meetings with a wide range of interested parties, including users of footpaths, farmers and land managers. This subject has been discussed at several meetings of the rural task force. In the immediate vicinity of cases of foot and mouth disease, the Government have taken a precautionary approach through the 3 km closure requirement and the power given to local authorities to impose a blanket ban on the use of footpaths in a specific area where that is considered appropriate. Many representatives have sought the lifting of such blanket bans where they are no longer needed and I have announced the intention to end this power except where a local authority can show it is needed in order to maintain the effectiveness of efforts to eradicate foot and mouth disease. I hope to make a further announcement shortly following the current consultation with local authorities.

<a name="10703w14.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 As part of our strategy for rural recovery, we want to see footpaths and other rights of way reopened wherever it is safe to do so. I refer the hon. Member to the statement by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State on 21 June 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 166&#150;86. My right hon. Friend also announced a significant relaxation of movement restrictions on livestock to help the farming industry by enabling more normal trade to take place. In both cases the action taken reflects an assessment of the disease risk involved in easing restrictions. While we are determined to do everything possible to eradicate foot and mouth disease, we also have to do all we can to enable rural businesses to return to normal working, and this must include an end to footpath closures where they are no longer needed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effects of foot and mouth disease on businesses in the United Kingdom and the adequacy of existing Government measures in responding to those effects.  [16]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w14.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 We have commissioned a series of regional surveys on the economic impact of foot and mouth disease, and we are planning further follow-up work including local area surveys. Members of the rural task force were briefed on the survey work and we will continue to keep them up to date. The general picture emerging from the surveys is very varied, with some areas and types of business displaying serious losses and others largely unaffected.
<P>

<a name="10703w14.html_para1">Many small rural businesses affected by foot and mouth disease are benefiting from the measures we have introduced. Over 11,000 affected businesses have now had cash benefits either through deferral of tax payments, hardship rate relief, or grants from the RDA business recovery fund. We are keeping the operation of each scheme under review in consultation with the rural task force.
<P>

<a name="10703w14.html_para2">A report on the impact on businesses in the west midlands, published last week, showed that 80 per cent. of the companies surveyed had not sought help or advice and 60 per cent. had made no change in their business and marketing. We will redouble our efforts to encourage all rural businesses to use the sources of advice and help which the Government are making available via regional development agencies and their local partners.

<P>
<a name="10703w14.html_spnew9"><B> Alun Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 July 2001]:</i> Part I of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 will require persons exercising a right of access under the Act to keep any dog on a short lead during the period March to July, and at any time in the vicinity of livestock. The Act also allows for further restrictions on dogs to be imposed in certain circumstances. However, the new right will not apply to any land with existing statutory rights of access (such as commons in former urban boroughs and districts), nor will it interfere with any use of land which takes place with the implied or explicit consent of the owner.

We are now considering the comments received and we expect to lay regulations during the summer recess. We expect to consult on a framework for regulations under part V of the Act relating to the establishment of local access forums with a view to laying regulations in the autumn.

<P>
<P>

 The UK already has policies in place which are consistent with its responsibilities under the United Nations framework convention on climate change to protect and enhance carbon sinks, such as forests. The Government continue to support the planting of new woodland. The total uptake by sinks from UK agriculture and forestry is projected to increase from around 1.7 per cent. of UK carbon dioxide emissions in 1990 to 



<P>

2 per cent. in 2010, although not all of this could be counted towards the UK's commitment under the Kyoto Protocol. If the present rate of increase in tree cover continues, afforestation since 1990 could save 0.6 MtC in 2010.

<a name="10703w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Environment Agency recently issued guidance clarifying that backing paper of labels should be treated as a packaging material. The Environment Agency has estimated that the cost in 2001 to the UK adhesive label manufacturing industry as a whole will be in the order of &#163;430,000. The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) should not place UK business at a competitive disadvantage in the domestic market given that imported packaging is equally obligated. Similarly, packaging which is exported from the UK is not obligated under the UK packaging Regulations.

 Our long-term aim is to make structural changes to Housing Benefit and its interaction with the tax system. The final design of Pension Credit and the new tax credits, and how they will interact with Housing Benefit, will be set out in due course.

 From April 2000, local authorities in England and Wales have been collecting data against best value performance indicators for the speed, accuracy, cost and security of their Housing Benefit services. Analogous performance indicators have been set by the Accounts Commission for Scottish authorities.
<P>

<a name="10703w16.html_para4">The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions expects to publish this summer unaudited and estimated data for 2000&#150;01 against all best value performance indicators in respect of English authorities. Final results will be published once this provisional data have been fully analysed.
<P>

<a name="10703w16.html_para5">Prior to the introduction of best value, the Audit Commission collected data for the last six months of 1999&#150;2000 on the average length of time taken by English and Welsh authorities to process new Housing Benefit claims. This information is set out in two reports: "Local Authority Performance Indicators 1999&#150;2000&#151;Council Services Compendium For England", published on 10 January 2001, a copy of which is in the Library; and "Local Authority Performance Indicators In Wales, 1999&#150;2000", published on 26 March 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions for what reason Working Families Tax Credit is taken into account in full when calculating Housing Benefit.  [1089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w16.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Housing Benefit (HB) is an income- related benefit and most types of income are generally taken fully into account when calculating entitlement. This applies equally to the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), which is intended to help meet ordinary living costs. To disregard WFTC when calculating HB entitlement would result in double provision from the Government for the same basic living costs.
<P>

<a name="10703w16.html_para6">However, limited situations exist where WFTC is partly disregarded in the assessment of HB. People who work 30 hours a week or more and who have children may get a partial disregard of WFTC if their earnings are very low. In addition, people with relevant child care costs which cannot be fully met from earnings can have the balance of those costs disregarded.

 There is a wealth of UK and European research which has tried to measure the effect of age discrimination, but it is difficult to give a robust statistical analysis of its extent and impact. Research is inevitably based on people's own perceptions of employment related age discrimination.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. It is likely that the increase in the appeal success rate between 1999 and 2000 (an increase from 32 per cent. to 36 per cent) results from the introduction of DMA in late 1999, together with the pressure of the recovery that followed during 2000. DMA introduced a number of changes to the decision-making process, including a move away from a mandatory review prior to the appeal going forward, to a reconsideration as part of the appeal procedure. Decisions appealed against are now routinely reconsidered, but we are aware that some decision-makers need time to become proficient in the new procedures following DMA implementation.<P>

2. The figures quoted in the reply relate only to refusals of DLA. It is worth noting that the total figure for all DLA appeals shows no significant change in overturn rate in the same period.<P>

 DCMS and DfES have been working closely together to deliver a significant amount of investment to allow greater opportunity for young people to spend more time on sport in and outside of schools. Work to date includes the school sport co-ordinators programme, NOF's opportunities for young people: PE and sport in schools initiative, space for sport and arts and the action points on education contained within the Government's plan for sport, published earlier this year. In June, my officials met colleagues at DfES to discuss the framework for enabling schools to offer two hours of high quality PE and school sport to their pupils, as set out by the Prime Minister on 11 January this year. We will continue to work together to bring about improvements in physical education and in the time spent by children in sport and other forms of physical activity.

The Government support the sport's UK governing bodies in working with the international football authorities towards a new transfer framework which fully protects the interests of smaller clubs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w18.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The new opportunities fund is currently developing a new grants programme for children's palliative care services. The programme, worth &#163;48 million in England, will fund community, respite and bereavement services. It will provide grants to support new activities and to sustain existing good quality services which require a specific and time limited intervention. Children's hospices may be providers of these services, as may statutory sector providers and partnerships.
<P>

<a name="10703w18.html_para0">The new opportunities fund is currently consulting on the best way to deliver the programme and is required to commit the resources to projects by 2004.
<P>

<a name="10703w18.html_para1">The fund is also developing palliative care programmes in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, although the split between services for children and services for adults has yet to be decided. The focus of the programme is currently the subject of consultation.

 The current system for dealing with clinical negligence claims is distressing, costly and time consuming, both for patients making claims against the National Health Service and for those defending claims, including doctors, nurses and other NHS staff involved. The need for reform&#151;to address the spiralling costs, the length of time taken to resolve claims and the proportion of costs taken up in legal charges&#151;is clear, and was reflected both in last year's NHS plan and in the Government's election Manifesto. We are currently considering how best to take this forward and will announce our plans in due course.

The table is annotated to identify which vaccines have been used or are used as part of the childhood immunisation schedule and have been centrally purchased by the Department of Health.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 26 June 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 75W, how much time will be allowed for public consultation following the publication of the Government's proposals for the future of the national cardiothoracic transplant service; and what period of time he estimates will be needed between a final decision on the location of the national transplant units and implementation in April 2002.  [1848]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 People and organisations will be allowed 12 weeks to comment on the document setting out our proposals for the future of the national cardiothoracic transplant service. Once the final decision on the site of the fourth centre has been taken, all reasonable steps will be taken to make the necessary changes to the service by April 2002.

 Health visitors will continue to be regulated as part of the nursing and midwifery professions. The draft legislation establishing the new Nursing and Midwifery Council recognises their special contribution to public health and contains several safeguards for health visiting. Health visitors will have a separate register, protection of their professional title and be guaranteed equal representation on the council with nurses and midwives, and from each United Kingdom country.

<P>
<a name="10703w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Officials undertook a review of support arrangements for National Health Service funded students last year. As a result Ministers considered a range of options for change to the existing arrangements, taking full account of representations received from students, their representative bodies and others. The 10.4 per cent. across-the-board increase in the basic rate of bursary, which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Health announced shortly after the Budget, was one of the outcomes of the review of student support. It is the biggest increase in bursaries since their introduction in the late 1980s and provides diploma level students (who make up the majority of the student nurse population) with an extra &#163;500 per year.

 The "Fit for the Future?" consultation exercise finished on 21 January 2000 and the finalised National Minimum Standards for Care Homes for Older People were published on 2 March this year. These standards were extensively consulted on and my hon. Friend the Minister of State met with providers and their representatives on several occasions to discuss the proposals, in addition to the meetings and correspondence dealt with by officials.
<P>

<a name="10703w21.html_para0">In setting these standards we listened to the concerns of providers and produced a sensible set of standards that give providers a reasonable time to adapt, and achieved the support of national organisations representing consumers and providers. We made a number of specific changes to the proposed standards in response to the concerns raised in the comments we received. I am confident that these decisions will ensure that any improvements in the quality of care homes necessary will be achieved smoothly, and that stability in the care homes sector and sufficient capacity is maintained while changes are made.

 Around 1,500 residential care homes for adults and 360 private nursing homes, hospitals and clinics in England closed during the period 1 April 1999 to 31 March 2000. However, it should be noted that during the same period, there were around 1,900 new registrations of residential care homes and 350 of nursing care homes. Information is not available centrally on the number of care places associated with closures or new registrations. Details of closures or new registrations by local and health authority area are available in the report entitled 'Activity, workload and resources of local authority, health authority and joint inspection units: summary results of a survey in England 1999&#150;2000' which was published on the internet at http://www.doh.gov.uk/public/regandinspect2.htm.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what progress has been made in improving hygiene in hospitals; and how many hospitals have been visited by the Commission for Health Improvement in 2001.  [2018]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10703w21.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The NHS Plan set out how we intended to improve standards of cleanliness and hygiene in National Health Service hospitals. A clean hospitals programme was launched in 2000, when &#163;31.9 million was allocated directly to NHS trusts to begin a series of sustainable improvements to hospital cleanliness and the broader patient environment. Patient environment action teams (PEAT) were established to assess NHS trusts against 19 elements which define the patient environment. These elements include entrances and reception areas, visitors' and ward toilets, and cleanliness and decoration throughout the hospital. PEAT teams made two assessment visits. The first was to "spot check" the quality of the patient environment and to assess what needed to be done to raise standards; the second was to evaluate the improvements made and to determine whether the hospital had been successful in bringing standards to a higher level.
<P>

<a name="10703w21.html_para1">The NHS has made substantial progress since the assessments were completed, and major improvements in levels of cleanliness have been made in a relatively short space of time. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced the results of the clean hospitals programme in a press release on 10 April 2001. The official report has now been published, showing that the percentage of hospitals now showing a good or acceptable standard of cleanliness is over 93 per cent. The tangible improvements that the NHS has achieved in the short-term are the basis for sustainable year-on-year improvements in the future. We will continue to support NHS trusts in raising standards further. A further allocation of &#163;30 million has been provided to allow NHS trusts to build upon the positive outcomes achieved to date, and ensure a clean hospital environment in the future.
<P>

<a name="10703w21.html_para2">The NHS Plan states that the Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) will monitor and report on standards of cleanliness in hospitals. CHI and NHS Estates are currently discussing how best to monitor progress and ensure that hospitals continue to maintain acceptable standards of cleanliness.
<P>

<a name="10703w21.html_para3">Trust chief executives are responsible for ensuring that there are high standards of cleanliness and hygiene in hospitals. From April 2001, all NHS trusts are required to comply with the new National Standards of Cleanliness for the NHS. These new standards form part of the Performance Assessment Framework and will ensure that higher standards are achieved and maintained in the future.

In June 2001, the CSM considered the available data, including recent research on the issue, and concluded that study data do not support an association between fluoxetine and suicidal behaviour. However, due to the anecdotal reports of suicidal behaviour associated with fluoxetine, the CSM recommended that the issue should be kept under review and doctors and patients should be warned to be vigilant for suicidal thoughts and behaviour in the early stages of treatment. Patient information for Prozac, and that of other medicines in this class has been amended to include wording to this effect.
