 In October 2005, the Thai Burma Border Consortium estimated that there were 540,000 displaced people in Eastern Burma. Of these, 340,000 were living in ceasefire areas; 108,000 were in State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) relocation sites; and 92,000 were hiding in conflict areas. DFID&#146;s approach to providing assistance to these IDPs has been to work inside Burma&#151;including assistance through local civil society groups (DFID has established effective relationships with a range of ethnic minority and other groups), through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), and by trying to improve access to displaced people to benefit from our project activities. These are not the only mechanisms through which donors can help (many, for example, fund cross-border teams operating from Thailand) but they enable access to IDPs who would not be reached by any other means, and through mechanisms which are much less-well supported by other donors.</p>

DFID has therefore done further research to produce a more detailed analysis of its water and sanitation expenditure. DFID does not allocate its multilateral aid by sector, but we have taken steps to estimate this for water and sanitation.

 Media expenditure reverted back to realistic levels in 2004-05, and 2005-06. Centralised media expenditure in 2003-04 was noticeably less than previous and recent years, and reflected an uncharacteristic dip in total communications expenditure for that year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the Department's policy is on whether doctors, veterinarians and farmers <i> (a)</i> are operators under the environmental liability directive and <i> (b)</i> would consequently be considered liable for the remediation costs of environmental harm if it arose from their use of genetically modified vaccines, crops or other organisms unless UK implementing regulations define the operator otherwise.

 The definition of operator in the environmental liability directive suggests that all occupational activities (including doctors, veterinarians and farmers) fall within the scope of the directive. The Government cannot amend the definition to exclude specific occupational activities. The extent to which the specific occupations referred to attract liability&#151;whether strict or fault&#151;under the directive will depend on the precise nature of the activities they undertake and the circumstances in which those activities are undertaken.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_49"><a name="60626w0003.htm_para11"><a name="0606267000156">In respect of strict liability, genetically modified organisms fall within the scope of the directive and genetically modified vaccines may do so by virtue of the provisions relating to dangerous substances. All genetically modified substances which do not fall within the strict liability provisions of the directive would in any case fall within the fault-based liability provisions in respect of damage to EU- protected biodiversity.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 June 2006]:</i> The most significant change has been the introduction of the single payment scheme which was introduced on 1 January 2005 and replaced at least 11 direct payment schemes, which had previously existed under the European Common Agricultural Policy. It has brought the benefit of a single annual application form instead of a series of claim forms with different rules, deadlines and, in some cases, claiming frequencies.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_61"><a name="60626w0005.htm_para6"><a name="0606267000170">The launch of Environmental Stewardship in March 2005 took forward two of Defra's flagship schemes, countryside stewardship and environmentally sensitive areas. Environmental Stewardship has three strands: entry level stewardship is open to all in farming, organic entry level stewardship is available to those wishing to farm organically, and higher level stewardship provides more resource in return for more specific environmental benefits in high priority situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_62"><a name="60626w0005.htm_para7"><a name="0606267000171">In addition, Defra has made a commitment to reduce administrative burdens on farm businesses by 25 per cent. and we are undertaking a number of projects to look at the scope to consolidate and reduce the number of forms that farmers have to complete.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_63"><a name="60626w0005.htm_para8"><a name="0606267000172">For example, the whole farm approach is expected to significantly reduce the bureaucracy farmers currently face.

 The Water Saving Group is currently working on an agreed action plan to encourage the efficient use of water in households, although it has not looked at rainwater harvesting specifically. However, the Government's Market Transformation Programme is looking at technologies that could potentially reduce overall water consumption by reusing rainwater and/or greywater (from baths/showers etc). A project has started this year to develop the necessary evidence, economic case, feasibility, performance standards, policy action plan and impact scenarios to determine the best use of rainwater and greywater technology.</p>

 The Government encourage the use of water butts as a sensible way to harvest rainwater for use in garden watering and car washing. As part of the duty to promote the efficient use of water by their customers, many water companies offer subsidised water butts, as well as other devices that can save water. Metered customers have a financial incentive to use water carefully and install water efficient fittings.</p>

The problem required the traction current to be switched off and when repairs were completed normal passenger services had ceased and engineering hours started on the line. Delays then occurred as due to safety procedures the current could not be switched back on to move the train until it was confirmed that no workers were on the line. Eventually passengers were taken off the train and walked back to Highbury and Islington station before 03.00 am.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the basis was for the Government's calculation in the Green Paper. &#147;A new deal for welfare&#148; that reaching an 80 per cent. employment rate would require getting one million people off incapacity benefit and one million more people over 50 years and 300,000 lone parents into work.

 As we set out in the Department's Five Year Strategy and in the Green Paper &#147;A new deal for welfare: empowering people to work&#148;, we have a long-term aim of reaching employment equivalent to 80 per cent. of the working age population. In order to achieve this we will reduce by one million the number on incapacity benefits, help 300,000 lone parents into work and increase by one million the number of older workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_99"><a name="60626w0008.htm_para1"><a name="06062622000336">Because 80 per cent. employment is relative to the size of the future population, the total required increase in employment is dependent on population projections, which are revised regularly. Using the  latest Government Actuary Department projections, employment would now need to increase by more than 2.5 million in order to achieve 80 per cent. in the long term. This is because the Government Actuary Department has increased their projection of the &#147;working age&#148; population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_100"><a name="60626w0008.htm_para2"><a name="06062622000337">We are currently considering the implications of this population change. However, our long-term aim of 80 per cent. employment is unaffected, and the commitments in the Green Paper to reduce by one million the number on incapacity benefits, help 300,000 lone parents into work and increase by one million the number of older workers will still be delivered.</p>

1. All figures are overpayments expressed as a proportion of expenditure for that benefit and are rounded to the nearest 0.1 per cent. They are based on sampling exercises and so are subject to sampling and other uncertainties. Sampling uncertainty is expressed in the form of confidence intervals; these have not been provided in these tables.<br>
2. Income support, jobseeker&#146;s allowance and pension credit figures come from the National Statistics report &#147;Fraud and error in Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance and Pension Credit from April 2004 to March 2005: Full report&#148;, published more recently than the 2004-05 DWP Resource Account.<br>
3. Disability living allowance fraud and error figures come from the National Statistics report &#147;Fraud, error and other incorrectness in Disability Living Allowance&#148; covering the period 2004-05. The &#145;customer error&#146; overpayment figure includes around &#163;580 million (7.9 per cent. of DLA expenditure) which was removed when reported in the Departmental Resource Account. These were cases where the change in customer&#146;s needs may have been so gradual that it would be unreasonable to expect them to know at which point their entitlement to DLA might have changed. These cases do not result in a recoverable overpayment as we cannot quantify or define when the customer&#146;s change occurred. Because legislation requires the Secretary of State to prove that entitlement to DLA is incorrect, rather than requiring the customer to inform us that their needs have changed, cases in this subcategory are legally correct.<br>
4. Incapacity benefit estimates from the 2004-05 DWP Resource Account. Fraud and customer error estimates from April 2000 to March 2001, official error from April 2003 to March 2004.<br>
5. Housing benefit estimates from the National Statistics report &#147;Fraud and Error in Housing Benefit April 2002 to March 2005&#148;. They are made up of reviews of around 85 per cent. of HB expenditure (used for measuring performance against the relevant PSA target to reduce fraud and error in HB) combined with more approximate estimates of error in the remaining 15 per cent. of expenditure. For further details on this, please see the relevant National Statistics reports.<br>
6. Council tax benefit estimates from the 2004-05 DWP Resource Account. Council tax benefit has not been measured by the Department and was assumed to have the same levels of fraud and error as the latest housing benefit estimates available at the time (October 2003 to September 2004).<br>
7. Child benefit is administered by HM Revenue and Customs and is a matter for HM Treasury.<br>

Funding will be allocated at a district level, to enable Jobcentre Plus District Managers to exercise greater discretion over how the funding should be utilised in their area. DMs will use their knowledge of the local labour market, coupled with evidence of &#145;what works&#146; to support the needs of local residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_127"><a name="60626w0010.htm_para12"><a name="06062622000488">Partnership working with local government is especially important to DWP in promoting the economic vitality of localities. Local area agreements (LAAs) have been devised to provide a common and simple framework that leads to central Government, local authorities and partners agreeing local outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_128"><a name="60626w0010.htm_para13"><a name="06062622000489">On 16 March 2005 the Chancellor announced the Local Enterprise Growth Initiative (LEGI). Its purpose is to release the economic and productivity potential of the most deprived local areas through enterprise and investment&#151;thereby boosting local incomes and employment opportunities and building sustainable communities. The proposed fund will distribute up to &#163;50 million per year for 2006-07 rising to &#163;150 million by 2008-09, and will be distributed through local area agreements (LAA).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_129"><a name="60626w0010.htm_para14"><a name="06062622000490">As proposed in the Green Paper, the creation of &#145;Cities&#146; pathfinders from 2007 will be charged with increasing employment and reducing social exclusion in our most deprived communities. In these areas, a consortium of local partners will be invited to join up and plan the delivery of their individual efforts and resources, with a strong focus on outcomes combined with greater opportunity for local flexibility and innovation. This approach will provide a real focus for local efforts to help people move back into work, so that the current patchwork of programmes and support, provided by a number of organisations, can be delivered in a more integrated, individually-focused and locally responsive way.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_130"><a name="60626w0010.htm_para15"><a name="06062622000491">The Deprived Areas Fund, along with our strategy for &#145;Cities&#146; and local area agreements will play a significant role in increasing local employment rates; ensuring those most disadvantaged in the labour market can receive the help and guidance they deserve.</p>

Recent evidence of constructive consultative relationships include: a three-year pay deal negotiated and agreed with the unions; a &#147;seeking to avoid compulsory redundancies&#148; agreement signed in November 2004 which has the confidence of all parties and has enabled us to make significant staffing reductions without dispute; and a re-launch of our attendance management policy in July 2005 with a joint statement with the unions.</p>

 The Government are committed to funding the full costs of the decommissioning and clean-up of the historic civil nuclear liabilities by the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA). The Consolidated Fund is the mechanism for funding this. Under the 2004 Spending Review the NDA received a budget of &#163;2.2 billion for 2005-06&#151;about half of which was to be raised by the NDA&#146;s commercial activities. Following the successful conclusion of the EC State Aid Review on 4 April 2006, financial responsibility for decommissioning BNFL sites has passed to the NDA under the Energy Act 2004. Until this point BNFL held nuclear funding assets of some &#163;17.3 billion on its balance sheet to fund future decommissioning costs. Following the transfer of the nuclear decommissioning liability to the NDA, these assets have been transferred back to the Government.</p>

<p><a name="0606271000278">There are separate arrangements for funding the decommissioning of British Energy nuclear sites. Since privatisation in 1996, British Energy has been making contributions into a segregated decommissioning fund. As a result of the restructuring, which completed in January 2005, British Energy will make enhanced contributions into the fund and Government will underwrite the fund to the extent that its liabilities outweigh its assets. On recent valuation, the assets of the segregated fund total some &#163;8.1 billion, the majority of which relates to the value attributed to  the fund&#146;s 64.6 per cent. convertible stake in British Energy.</p>

 The Government welcome the role of the credit union movement in helping to promote financial inclusion and contributing to choice and diversity in the financial services sector.

More recently and following consultation with the sector and consumer groups, the Government introduced legislation increasing the maximum permitted interest rate on loans, from 1 per cent. to 2 per cent. per month, in order to provide flexibility to lend to more people on low incomes. In addition, credit unions are now able to offer cash ISAs.</p>

 Car-sharing is one of a number of measures my Department encourages to enable staff to travel more sustainably. In general, we encourage staff, wherever possible, to use public transport or cycle to work especially those commuting to our London offices due to very limited car parking and traffic congestion.</p>

 Anyone concerned that a child may be a &#147;child in need&#148;, whether as a young carer or for any other reason, should refer the case to local children&#146;s services for an initial assessment. Children and their families are also able to make such contact direct.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_214"><a name="60626w0016.htm_para48"><a name="0606271000977">Section 1 of the Carers (Recognition and Services) Act 1995 provides that at the time a local authority assess a person&#146;s needs for community care services or assess the needs of a disabled child, an individual who provides or intends to provide a substantial amount of care on a regular basis for that person has the right to request an assessment of his ability to provide and continue to provide care. The authority must take that assessment into account when making any decision about services for the cared for person or to meet the needs of the child, as the case may be.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_215"><a name="60626w0016.htm_para49"><a name="0606271000978">The Carers (Equal Opportunities) Act 2004 (&#147;the 2004 Act&#148;) makes three principal changes to the law with the objective of providing further support for carers and helping to ensure that they are not placed at a disadvantage because of the care they provide. First, the Act requires local authorities to inform carers, in certain circumstances, that they may be entitled to an assessment. Second, when undertaking a carer&#146;s assessment, the local authority must consider whether the carer works, undertakes any form of education, training or leisure activity, or wishes to do any of those things. The effect of this is that the local authority will have to ask the carer about those activities during an assessment, and then take this into account when making the decision about whether the needs of the cared for person call for the provision of any services by them. Third, the Act provides for co-operation between local authorities and other bodies in relation to the planning and provision of services that are relevant to carers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_216"><a name="60626w0016.htm_para50"><a name="0606271000979">Guidance makes clear that children who are carers should routinely be assessed under the Children Act 1989. The Children Act 1989 already gives local authorities a duty under paragraph 1(2) of schedule 2 to publicise their services to families with children in need and to take steps to ensure that those who might benefit from the services receive the information.</p>

 By April 2007, neighbourhood policing will have been introduced to every community in England and Wales, and by April 2008 every area will have its own dedicated neighbourhood policing team. Neighbourhood policing puts local people's own concerns and priorities at the heart of local policing.  <br>

Neighbourhood policing teams will be highly visible, will engage with communities to understand their priorities, and will tackle these issues in partnership with local partners. Neighbourhood policing will be protected and supported by the proposed reorganisation of police forces by getting more resources to the front line and keeping them there. The creation of strategic forces to deal with major investigations or public order incidents will help safeguard local policing by reducing the need to abstract officers from neighbourhood policing teams.</p>

<i> [holding answer 21 June 2006]:</i> The overall allocation from the Youth Justice Board (YJB) to Youth Offending Teams (YOTs) for prevention programmes totals &#163;59 million, which includes existing Youth Inclusion Programme (YIP) funding of &#163;14 million, as well as the &#163;45 million of additional funding.

This formula weights each area's allocation according to the following elements: 10 to 17 population (40 per cent.); size of area (10 per cent.); and six deprivation indices, including income and employment (50 per cent.).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_240"><a name="60626w0016.htm_para74"><a name="0606271001182">For the 18 YOTs in Wales, the allocation was based on a new funding formula devised by the All Wales Youth Offending Strategy Group. The formula weights each YOT&#146;s allocation according to the following elements: 10 to 17 population (50 per cent.); sparsity (low population density, leading to difficulties accessing services and greater cost of providing them) (13.33 per cent.); five deprivation indices on income, employment, health, education and housing (26.66 per cent.); and caseload (10 per cent.)</p>

<p><a name="stpa_241"><a name="60626w0016.htm_para75"><a name="0606271001183">In some areas, YOTs were already receiving money for specific prevention programmes (YIPs) from an existing funding stream.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_242"><a name="60626w0016.htm_para76"><a name="0606271001184">When the new funding formula was applied, the effect in these areas would have been to reduce the overall funding allocated to prevention. To avoid this and to allow them to begin to develop additional prevention services, funding for the affected YOTs was adjusted so that they all received an amount of at least &#163;20,000 more than they were previously receiving.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_245"><a name="60626w0016.htm_para79"><a name="0606279000131">The information is not available in the form requested. The Coalfields Regeneration Trust, which operates throughout the English coalfields, is an independent grant giving body that seeks to spearhead the social and economic regeneration of the coalfields. Grants awarded by the trust range from small grants to local groups to larger awards that benefit coalfields more widely, sometimes at regional or national level. Grants are not constituency specific, with even small grants often benefiting areas outside of the constituency within which the group securing the grant is based. It is not therefore practicable to produce a list of constituencies which have received the highest level of funding. It should be noted that any list would change once a subsequent round of grants was released by the CRT, and therefore could significantly alter should a grant of considerable value be given to an organisation based in a constituency within a coalfield area.</p>

 Local authorities are required by law to report on a set of national performance indicators and standards set by Government. Best Value Performance Indicator 64 measures the number of private sector dwellings that are returned to occupation or demolished each year as a direct result of action by the local authority. Information, comprising local authorities' returns for Best Value Performance Indicator 64 for 2004-05 has been placed in the Library of the House. In the period 2004-05, the number of empty properties brought back into use or demolished by Luton council was 11. However, the variance in the overall size of the private sector housing stock, and the proportion of these houses which can be defined as empty, will differ between each local authority area and therefore, the indicator is not a straightforward reflection of individual councils' performance.</p>

The research study, a copy of which has been deposited in the Library, also described the reasons why transactions fail. For example, the report indicated that 43 per cent. of transaction failures were attributable to an unfavourable survey report and the remainder were due to a seller deciding to sell elsewhere, unacceptable delays, chain breakdown and the property being taken off the market. The key findings of the research study indicated that many of the problems associated with the current system are down to information emerging later in the process and that buyers, sellers and professionals all agreed that sellers should offer more information up front.</p>

<i> [holding answer 12 June 2006]: </i>The Government's guidance to planning authorities on development and flood risk is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note (PPG) 25. This advises that planning applications in flood risk areas are always accompanied by a flood risk assessment, and that the Environment Agency is consulted. Flood risk areas are those mapped by the Agency as being at risk from river and tidal flooding, but sites outside such areas can also be at risk due to local topography, for example at the foot of hills where storm-water runoff may overwhelm sewers. Flood risk assessments should address the source of flooding, its potential extent, depth and speed of inundation and its likely impact on the development during its lifetime, taking climate change into account. They should demonstrate how the risk will be managed and identify any residual risk (the risk remaining after flood defences have been taken into account). Proposals for the development of new properties with basements would have to demonstrate (to the satisfaction of the Environment Agency and the Local Planning Authority) that the residual risk to the development and its occupants was acceptable. In addition, the introduction of basement accommodation into a flood risk area should also not materially increase the flood risk to other properties or occupants. The new Planning Policy Statement (PPS) 25 that we intend to issue this autumn will strengthen this advice.</p>

 The Government have issued detailed planning guidance on planning and crime prevention in England. &#147;Planning Policy Statement 1: Delivering Sustainable Development&#148; (PPS1), published in 2005, places strong emphasis on the role of planning in helping to create safe and sustainable communities.

Members and have never failed to be heartened by the pleasure these badges are clearly giving to our veterans. From tomorrow applications will be accepted from those who served up to 31 December 1959 and will be extended further on a phased basis to all qualifying veterans as soon as practicable.

<i> [holding answer 19 June 2006]: </i>We assess that the Priory Group provides an excellent in-patient psychiatric service based on an individual's clinical needs. Service liaison officers routinely visit the Group's hospital units where we have in-patients to ensure that our arrangements are working effectively in terms of patient care and treatment, including attending ward rounds that involve service patients; the service liaison officer also acts as a &#147;service advocate&#148; for the patient. They also meet regularly with Priory representatives to discuss treatment and best practice. We assess the contractual elements of our agreement with the Priory Group at quarterly meetings held between the MOD and the Priory Group. Both the service liaison officer and contract meetings examine the Priory's performance against the particular performance indicators of the contract.

of the United Nations Human Rights Council on the UN's effectiveness in upholding human rights. [79434]</p>

<p><a name="st_420"><a name="0606279001819"><a name="0606279002344"><b>Dr. Howells:</b>
 The new UN Human Rights Council has the potential to improve on the work of its predecessor, the Commission on Human Rights, in addressing pressing human rights issues around the world today. The UN General Assembly resolution establishing the Council provides for some significant improvements, including: more frequent meetings each year, at least three meetings per year for at least 10 weeks in total, which should allow the Council to address human rights issues more systematically; a new system of universal periodic review, under which the human rights record of each UN member will be reviewed; a higher election threshold for election to the Council; a wider-ranging mandate; and a more central place within the UN system, better reflecting the importance of human rights. At the same time, we expect that it should preserve some of the strengths of the Commission, including proper provision for the participation of non-governmental organisations. But, much will depend on member states' commitment to making a success of the new Council, and it is the responsibility of all UN members to ensure that it can work more effectively than its predecessor.</p>

 The General Assembly resolution of 15 March establishing the new UN Human Rights Council raised the threshold for membership in comparison with the Council's predecessor body, the Commission on Human Rights. Candidates are now required to win a simple majority, at least 96 votes, in the General Assembly to be elected. Candidates for the first elections, in May 2006, were encouraged to make voluntary pledges and commitments on the protection and promotion of human rights, to be taken into consideration when membership was voted on. All candidates did so, although some commitments were much more substantive than others. Members are expected to uphold the highest human rights standards, to co-operate fully with the Council and to be among the first to submit themselves to the new Universal Periodic Review. Although some countries with weaker human rights records were still elected, we expect all members to take seriously the responsibilities of membership and will be looking to hold them to this.</p>

 We remain deeply concerned at the violence in Sri Lanka and, again, offer our condolences following last week&#146;s attack in Kebitigollawe. Such barbaric acts have no place in the search for a solution to the conflict. I issued a statement on 15 June condemning this attack unreservedly along with all forms of violence and intimidation. That statement is available on the Foreign and Commonwealth Office website at:</p>

Violence can never be an answer to Sri Lanka&#146;s problems; all sides need to understand this. It is vital that both sides, which were at the Geneva talks in February, live up to their commitments. This includes the Sri Lankan Government acting constructively to ensure that paramilitaries or others are not able to operate, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eeelam (LTTE) calling a halt to acts of violence against civilians, the security forces and police, and both sides ensuring that intimidation, acts of violence, abductions and killings cease. We continue to believe that dialogue is the only way to achieve a negotiated settlement to the conflict, which takes full account of the legitimate demands of all communities and promotes a democratic and stable Sri Lanka. All sides need to exercise restraint and act constructively.</p>

We welcome the recent statements of commitment to the Ceasefire Agreement by the Government of Sri Lanka and the LTTE and continue to do what we can to encourage both sides to return in good faith, to face-to-face talks. We make this clear in our regular contacts with the Sri Lankan Government, Members of Parliament, including representatives of Tamil political groups, and civil society. We also actively contribute to the EU&#146;s work, not least in its role as one of the Tokyo co-chairs to the Sri Lankan peace process.</p>

 The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland refers to the relevant Codes of Practice and Guidance available from the Commission when considering making recommendations to employers on whether to include in recruitment advertising the reference that specific groups of people would be particularly welcome to apply.

 My response to the hon. Gentleman of 11 May 2006 referred to road traffic collisions for which a police officer was responsible while on duty and covered the calendar years 2003-05. The following table is also based on these parameters and shows how many road traffic collisions there were during 2003-05 for which an on-duty police officer was responsible. None of these collisions resulted in disciplinary action being taken against the police officer involved.

 The Code of Practice on the Identification and Assessment of Special Educational Needs sets out a 5-stage approach to the process. At Stage 4 the Education and Library Board considers the need for a statutory assessment, following a request from the parents, the school or other agencies. If the Board considers that such an assessment is necessary, the parents will be notified and the assessment will be undertaken and if a statement of Special Educational Needs is considered appropriate, the Board has 18 weeks, subject to certain exceptions, to issue a draft statement.</p>

 The most recent estimate of the burden of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in the United Kingdom (UK) comes from a study published in the <i> British Medical Journal</i> in July 2004. The study conducted in two large hospitals in Merseyside, suggested that ADRs account for one in 16 hospital admissions. This is a similar estimate to a number of studies worldwide, including figures from the United States of America.</p>

The MHRA committee on safety of medicines publication &#147;Always read the leaflet&#148; proposed actions to improve risk communication, including development of a leaflet for patients published by the MHRA. The commission on human medicines has established a working group to examine ways to improve the provision of safety information accompanying medicines.</p>

The NSF also states the commissioners and services should be able to demonstrate multi-agency partnership working in the following areas: the provision of services to children and young people who may or may not have been harmed, as set out in &#147;Working Together to Safeguard Children&#148;; contributing to the assessment of complex child abuse cases; the assessment and provision of post-abuse therapeutic services; and services for looked-after and adopted children.</p>

 The National Audit Office have made clear in their report published on 16 June 2006 that the contracted costs of the national programme for information technology over 10 years is &#163;6.2 billion, and that this cost has not increased since the contracts were let in 2003 and 2004. The report also refers to central expenditure of &#163;1.9 billion over 10 years. That will not just be spent on running the national programme, but also covers the functions previously undertaken by the NHS Information Authority, which was closed in 2005, and, in its last year, cost &#163;219 million. It is clear therefore that the  &#163;1.9 billion is not additional funding but is in fact a reduction on what the central management of national health service information technology services cost before the national programme.</p>
