 Snatch Land Rovers continue to form an important part of the overall vehicle fleet available to our forces in Afghanistan. Commanders on the ground select the optimum vehicle type for a particular task, weighing up the need for force protection, capacity, mobility, fire power and profile.

 The retirement age for senior civil servants is decided centrally and is set at age 65. Determination of the retirement age for grades below the senior civil service is delegated to employing Departments and was set by the Ministry of Defence at 65 with effect from 1 April 2006. Departmental regulations reflect the right to request to work beyond the normal retirement age and for such requests to be given proper consideration. UK Defence statistics include detailed breakdowns of the civilian workforce. These show that, against a reducing overall headcount, the numbers of MOD civil servants aged 65 and over have increased as follows:</p>

 Future Gazelle flying activity has been reviewed in successive departmental planning rounds. Under current planning assumptions the out of service date for the Gazelle is 2012; however there will be a significant reduction in Gazelle flying by 2010. The Gazelle is an older aircraft type with limited capability and is not deployed on combat roles. This decision will therefore have no impact on deployed military capability.   <br>

 We do not hold the information in the form requested. Low flying is recorded in terms of the number of hours flown rather than the number of sorties, broken down by fixed or rotary winged aircraft rather than fast jets specifically; and the information is held for the low flying area in which the activity is booked. The Angus constituency lies within Low Flying Area 14, which covers the whole of Scotland north of the Forth-Clyde region.

 Available figures indicate that around 360 members of the Territorial Army have been mobilised three or more times since 1999. Given the safeguards built in to the Reserve Forces Act 1996, which limits the time for which reservists may be mobilised, it is very likely that the majority of these soldiers were mobilised for periods of less than the normal operational tour of six months. It is common for medical reservists to be mobilised for operational tours of three months or less, enabling them to be mobilised several times without exceeding the limits placed in the Reserve Forces Act.</p>

 The regional development agencies (RDAs) have been responsible for managing the delivery of the social and economic elements of the Rural Development Programme for England since the programme was formally launched at the beginning of 2008. DEFRA has agreed with RDAs that delivery of the socio-economic measures of the RDPE will take a more strategic approach and will include a significant element of procured or commissioned activity, rather than solely being delivered by an individual application led approach. In addition, some RDPE investment will be through the bottom-up Leader approach.

 This report, commissioned from the Rural Advocate by the Prime Minister, demonstrates the huge contribution made by businesses in rural areas to the national economy. It highlights the relevance of activity across all levels of Government and by the private sector. The recommendations within the report are, therefore, very broadly targeted. DEFRA is working with others across Government to reflect upon the report and how best to respond to its recommendations.</p>

 The right of Governments to issue permits for the killing of whales for scientific purposes is enshrined in Article VIII of the 1946 International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW), the parent treaty of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). We doubt that the authors of the ICRW envisaged that parties would seek to conduct research on the scale now practised by Japan, but whether Japan's activities in this regard can be said to constitute an abuse of the rights granted by Article VIII of the ICRW is a matter which only the courts could determine&#151;were anyone prepared to stand the cost of asking.</p>

We have participated in a number of high level diplomatic protests in recent years and on 8 January this year I called in officials from the Japanese embassy in London to express the UK's outrage over Japan's whaling activities. At this year's IWC meeting in June the UK Commissioner to the IWC made it clear that we saw no justification for lethal scientific research on whales and called for Special Permit whaling to be brought within IWC control and phased out as quickly as possible.</p>

I have had meetings with Lord Crisp, my DH counterpart Dawn Primarolo, and the Tropical Health and Education Trust (THET), a key stakeholder.

DFID and DH also commissioned an independent evaluation of links programmes between UK and developing country health organisations to identify what has worked well and good practice lessons. This will help inform the design of (i) a new funding scheme for links, and (ii) a Links Centre, which will include information for individuals wishing to volunteer for humanitarian work.</p>

 We have previously estimated that there are around 400,000 to 450,000 electronic and paper records of unresolved asylum applications that are not being considered under the New Asylum Model, although this is difficult to assess accurately as many case records are dependants, duplicates or errors. This figure does not therefore equate to numbers of asylum applicants. At the end of November 2007, our total conclusions stand at around 52,000 cases. We have made good progress and remain committed and on track to conclude these cases by summer 2011. Lin Homer will shortly update the Home Affairs Select Committee on performance over the last six months.</p>

 To analyse the whole pool for this information would incur disproportionate costs. Further, it would be difficult to provide an accurate estimate given the errors present in the database.

<i> [holding answer 30 June 2008]:</i> The points-based system will rationalise and simplify our existing system for controlling immigration by migrants who wish to work or study in the UK, so that only the migrants we need are allowed to come to Britain.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_263"><a name="80707w0024.htm_para6"><a name="08070741000827">The new system will not cover immigration routes that are unrelated to work or study. Thus it will not apply to visitors or to those applying as the family members of people settled in the UK, such as spouses. It will not apply to people seeking asylum or humanitarian protection here, or to those applying to stay into the UK after service with HM forces.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_264"><a name="80707w0024.htm_para7"><a name="08070741000828">Finally, there are several routes on which consultation is ongoing outside the PBS.

 The UK Border Agency currently operates four control points at the Eurostar terminal at Brussels Gare du Midi and six control points at the terminal at Paris Gare du Nord. In view of increasing passenger numbers the Gare du Nord is currently being redeveloped to provide eight control points.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_265"><a name="80707w0024.htm_para8"><a name="08070741000831">The efficiency of passenger clearance at the UK border is kept under review, and changes are made where they are considered to benefit passenger throughput, without having an adverse impact upon border security. The majority of passengers travelling to the UK on Eurostar services from Brussels and Paris are nationals of EU countries and all passengers, including those who are non-EU nationals, can be dealt with quickly without any segregation. There is consequently no dedicated EU channel at either station and currently no plan to introduce such a channel.</p>

 Staffing requirements for all ports, including Heathrow, are calculated using a workforce planning methodology which takes into account information provided by port operators on scheduling, predicted passenger loads and nationalities, and estimates of transaction times. Therefore every shift size is calculated individually.</p>

The directive also requires that supervisory bodies must have adequate resources to undertake the task. HM Treasury officials assessed the applications of potential supervisors against these requirements, taking into account a range of criteria, such as a body&#146;s experience of standard setting, compliance monitoring, and disciplining members; as well as their membership size, resource capacity, public interest objectives and relationships with other relevant bodies. Both the previous Economic Secretary to the Treasury, the hon. Member for Normanton (Ed Balls), and I approved the final supervisory arrangements.

 The availability of VAT reduced rates is governed by the European VAT agreements, signed by successive Governments. The Government are currently making the case at EU level for wider application of reduced VAT rates to energy-saving and energy efficient products. In March 2008 the European Council invited the Commission to examine areas where economic instruments, including VAT rates, can have a role to play to increase the use of energy-efficient goods and energy-saving materials. This work is currently under way and we expect it to be discussed by member states later in the year. Decisions on the scope of any new reduced VAT rate would be a matter for unanimous agreement of all member states.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Justice how many men convicted of domestic violence offences have been released under the end of custody licence scheme; what risk assessment or accommodation check was carried out in each case; what records he holds on whether any such offenders have re-offended; whether any such offenders have been recalled to prison; and if he will make a statement.

 Domestic violence is not a specific offence. Offenders who commit domestic violence are charged with a generic offence of assault. It would not be possible to identify the number of prisoners convicted of domestic violence related offences without examining individual case files which would incur disproportionate cost. Similarly, it is also not possible to identify prisoners convicted of domestic violence related offences who have gone on to reoffend or who have been recalled to custody.</p>

Prisoners serving a sentence for a serious violent offence are excluded from ECL. All prisoners released on ECL would have been released at their statutory release date a maximum of 18 days later. It is for this reason that ECL operates according to precise fixed criteria. All release arrangements that would otherwise have taken place 18 days later are brought forward to the ECL release date and any licence conditions that would apply at the statutory release date are included on the ECL licence.</p>

That information should be provided to the police and, where appropriate, submitted to the multi-agency public protection panel, in line with routine risk management arrangements. In such cases, release on ECL should not take place until measures to address the risk have been put in place.</p>

A further internal report has been prepared into an assessment of alternative methods of advancing hose from a bridgehead during high-rise firefighting.

Military service personnel who would otherwise be liable for council tax are not relieved of that liability by virtue of returning early from a tour of duty due to injury. Where any person is in hospital for such a long period that the hospital in which they are receiving care or treatment has become their sole or main residence, a dwelling that they have left empty is exempt from council tax if it was previously their sole or main residence.</p>

 Housing associations have a statutory duty to assist local authorities in meeting housing need and to provide good quality, responsive services; these are requirements of the Housing Corporation&#146;s Regulatory Code and guidance.

Where associations fail to meet these requirements, the Housing Corporation has powers to take a range of actions. These may include reassessing an association&#146;s risk rating, which could have an impact on its relationships with stakeholders, including local authorities and lenders.

They are not comparable with 2005-06 figures quoted above because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_558"><a name="80707w0048.htm_para18"><a name="0807087001396">The 2005-06 figures quoted in the first table are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS) which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. The DSG is based on planned spend. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage to EFS, which comprises a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through CLG's (formerly DCLG) Local Government Finance Settlement but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>

As the DSG is a mechanism for distributing funding a primary/secondary split is not available. The figures are for all funded pupils aged 3 to 19 and are in cash terms.</p>

 The Government recognise the importance of modern foreign language skills to employers to improve their competitiveness in the global economy. The approach taken by the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) in the light of the decline in adult participation rates in these subjects recognises the key role providers have in reversing this trend by stimulating demand and revitalising the curriculum to equip more adults and young people with modern language skills. To this end each local area is expected to have a core adult learning offer that reflects and responds to the spectrum of individual adult and employer needs.</p>

 The Student Loans Company&#146;s (SLC) best estimate of the number of borrowers it has continued to collect repayments from although their loan has been paid off for each year since 2001 is shown in the following table. The estimated 20,900 borrowers with income contingent repayment (ICR) loans who made overpayments in 2006-07 represented just 1.9 per cent. of the total number of borrowers who were eligible to make repayments had their earning passed the &#163;15,000 earnings threshold. Over-repayments from borrowers with mortgage style loans are not included because any over-repayments once their loan has been cleared will only arise where the borrower has failed to cancel repayment arrangements with their bank.</p>

1998, so in the early years covered by the answer, relatively few borrowers were making repayments. For student loan borrowers with ICR loans, repayments are predominately made through the tax system. Due to the time lag in the SLC receiving information from HM Revenue and Customs, it is possible for borrowers to overpay before the SLC becomes aware that their repayments should stop.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_599"><a name="80707w0054.htm_para1"><a name="08070840001157">Where the pattern of payments shows that repayment will be completed during the coming year, the SLC invites borrowers to get in touch to discuss when repayments should stop. Borrowers are then able to make manual repayments. If they do not respond promptly to the SLC, or ignore the invitation, they will probably overpay.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_600"><a name="80707w0054.htm_para2"><a name="08070840001158">The SLC has recently introduced a new website facility specifically for repaying customers. This will give borrowers the ability to view their most current statement and it will also give them the chance to calculate their balance based on what they can see in their payslips.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_601"><a name="80707w0054.htm_para3"><a name="08070840001159">The SLC is working on further improving the loan end process and has been asked to put in place arrangements which will reduce the number of borrowers over-repaying at the end of repayment. Those arrangements, which are likely to be voluntary, are expected to be in place towards the end of next year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_665"><a name="80707w0062.htm_para0"><a name="08070840003314">The figures shown in the following table are taken from the Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) which was introduced in April 2006. They are not comparable with the 2000-01 to 2005-06 figures quoted because the introduction of the DSG in 2006-07 fundamentally changed how local authorities are funded. This change does not affect the comparability of the other non-DSG grants identified above, although there are some year-on-year changes in terms of what grants were provided.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_666"><a name="80707w0062.htm_para1"><a name="08070840003315">The 2000-01 to 2005-06 figures quoted above are based on Education Formula Spending (EFS), which formed the education part of the Local Government Finance Settlement, plus various grants. The DSG is based on planned spend. In addition, the DSG has a different coverage from EFS, which comprises a schools block and an LEA block (to cover LEA central functions) whereas DSG only covers the school block. LEA block items are still funded through DCLG's Local Government Finance Settlement, but education items cannot be separately identified. Consequently, there is a break in the Department's time series as the two sets of data are not comparable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_667"><a name="80707w0062.htm_para2"><a name="08070840003316">To provide a comparison for 2006-07 DSG, the Department has isolated the schools block equivalent funding in 2005-06. This is the basis for the 2005-06 baseline figure quoted; as described this does not represent the totality of 'education' funding in that year. The grants associated with the 2005-06 DSG baseline are the same as those given with the EFS figure above: Standards Fund, Budget Support Grant, Transitional Support Grant, School Standards Grant and LSC funding.</p>
