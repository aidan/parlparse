<a name="90617w01.htm_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the agenda of the planned Intergovernmental Conference of Spring 2000.  [87307]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90617w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Cologne European Council took decisions about the timing, scope and preparation of the next Intergovernmental Conference. These are set out in the Presidency conclusions, which have been placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="90617w01.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister if the Government received prior communication from Russian sources of an intent to occupy areas of strategic importance in Kosovo independently of NATO.  [87300]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90617w01.htm_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 We and NATO have long made clear that we looked forward to a substantial Russian contribution to KFOR, the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Kosovo. Russia did not notify NATO in advance that it intended to deploy a small unit to Pristina airfield but, as the commander of KFOR has explained, this Russian unit had not affected either the deployment of NATO forces or the implementation of the Kosovo peace agreement. NATO is working with Russia on detailed command and control arrangements for Russian forces in KFOR.

The confidential annexe to the report has been excluded from that copy in accordance with section 8(8) of the 1985 Act and in accordance with the Commissioner's recommendations. I am grateful to the Commissioner for his work in reviewing the issue of warrants during the year. I note in particular the Commissioner's view that interception of both postal communications and telecommunications remains an effective and an essential operation in the interests of national security and the economic well-being of the United Kingdom, and the prevention and detection of serious crime.

<P>
<a name="90617w01.htm_wqn10"><B> Dr. Tonge: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if she will make a statement on the current humanitarian situation in southern Sudan. [87114]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90617w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Southern Sudan has some of the worst malnutrition and mortality rates in the world. While the situation in the south this year is significantly better than in 1998, it is essential that a long term and just peace is achieved in Sudan. Until it is, crises on the scale of last year are liable to reoccur at any time.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90617w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The best estimates available indicate that total productive efforts, that is from fishing and livestock as well as the last harvest production, should be sufficient to meet about 90 per cent. of needs in southern Sudan this year. The actual ability of the rural population in southern Sudan to meet their own needs remains dependent on external factors such as the level of insecurity and internal displacement.

<a name="90617w02.htm_wqn1"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if another member state of the European Union were to license the commercial planting of genetically modified crops by a company there would be any bar to that company proceeding with commercial planting in the United Kingdom.  [86135]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90617w02.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 June 1999]:</i> Commercial growing of a genetically modified crop can be approved only at community level, not by an individual member state. The relevant legislation is Council Directive 90/220/EEC on the deliberate release into the environment of genetically modified organisms (GMOs). Under Part C of this Directive, applications for consent for placing on the market products containing or consisting of GMOs must be considered and cleared by all member states at the Community level. Once a GM crop has Part C (marketing) consent under the Directive, it applies across all member states, including, of course, the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="90617w02.htm_para0">However, before any new variety of a crop, including GM varieties, can be grown commercially, it also has to have passed the necessary tests and be placed either on the UK national list of seeds or the EU common catalogue. If the crop is herbicide tolerant, the use of that herbicide on the GM crop may also require specific approval under the pesticides legislation.
<P>

<a name="90617w02.htm_para1">Specific conditions may be attached to consents issued under the Directive, for example to limit the geographical area in which the GM crop is grown or used. But in absence of any such restrictions and subject to the other necessary approvals for any crop being in place, there is no bar to commercial planting in the UK.
<P>

<a name="90617w02.htm_para2">A safeguard clause, Article 16, in the Directive allows a member state provisionally to restrict or prohibit the use and/or sale on its territory of a GMO that has been given consent if there are justifiable reasons to consider that the product constitutes a risk to human health or the environment. In such circumstances a decision on whether or not to uphold the consent is subsequently taken at Community level after consideration of the new evidence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what advice he has obtained about the use of antibiotic marker genes in genetically modified plants which provide raw materials for the production of cosmetics and perfumes.  [86316]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90617w02.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 All releases of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are governed by the Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) Regulations 1992 as amended. Under the Regulations, the possible effects of using antibiotic marker genes in a GM plant on human health or the environment are considered as part of the approvals process. However, once any GM plant material had been processed for use in products such as cosmetics and perfumes, it would not come under the scope of these Regulations because it is no longer a living organism, i.e. not capable of replication or of transferring genetic material. The products would, however, be 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jun 1999 : Column: 200</I><P>
assessed under the Cosmetic Products (Safety) Regulations 1996 to ensure that they are not harmful to human health.
<P>

<a name="90617w02.htm_para3">The Government welcome the European Commission's plan to develop harmonised guidelines for GMO risk assessments for cosmetic products and will push in Europe for their adoption.

[86651]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90617w02.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Government are determined to apply further necessary restrictions to the importation, marketing and use of white asbestos. I have received advice from the Health and Safety Commission about those new restrictions in the form of draft regulations. I will act on that advice as soon as the European Commission has ratified the vote of their technical committee on 4 May to adapt to technical progress Council Directive 76/769/EEC. Under European law, it would be illegal for new domestic restrictions to be introduced before this has happened. I am hopeful that the European Commission will ratify the adaptation directive this month. The UK continues to encourage the European Commission to act swiftly on this vitally important measure.

<a name="90617w02.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have read with interest the initial findings of the research undertaken by Age Concern and RADAR. We are currently consulting on "You and Your Services", a draft charter for long-term care, and would encourage Age Concern and RADAR in their response to consider how that charter could be used as a basis for setting targets for performance on housing adaptations. My Department is addressing other issues of local authority performance in this area in the work we are doing to develop the Best Value regime, and in our guidance to local authorities on the Housing Investment Programme. We will consider these issues further in the light of our consideration of the recent report by the Royal Commission on Long Term Care.

<a name="90617w02.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My Department has no plans to update the Circular. It was replaced in December 1996 by a new Circular, Department of the Environment Circular 17/96, which contained guidance on changes made by the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996 to local housing authorities' responsibilities. The parts of Circular 17/96 which updated Circular 10/90 were written in consultation with the Department of Health, and that Circular was sent to all local authorities, including those responsible for the provision of social services.

 <i>[holding answer 14 June 1999]:</i> Before reaching our decision to legislate for a new statutory right of access to open countryside, we consulted a wide range of organisations, including English Nature. In addition to that, I have regular quarterly meetings with English Nature, where we have exchanged views on the Government's access proposals.
<P>

<a name="90617w02.htm_para4">Access on foot is generally compatible with the conservation of wildlife. Indeed, many sites protected under national and international legislation are already open to public access. However, we recognise that restrictions on access may, in some cases, be necessary to protect particular wildlife interests. We shall, therefore, be looking to English Nature to provide advice on the need for closures and restrictions on conservation grounds.

<P><I>17 Jun 1999 : Column: 202</I><P>
set by the Director General for each company for each year. The price limits governing South West Water in 1999-2000 are those determined on appeal in 1995 by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (RPI + 1% on average).
<P>

<a name="90617w03.htm_para0">The Director General is currently conducting his periodic review of prices for the period 2000 to 2005. The Government have given guidance to the Director General on the environmental and water quality improvements to be delivered by 2005. We believe that these can be secured while offering reductions of around 10 per cent. in average water and sewerage bills. The Director General expects to announce draft price limits for each undertaker in July.

<a name="90617w03.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 The Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) inherited the main part of their staff and programmes on 1 April 1999, so it is too early for a formal assessment of their impact. However, early indications are that the RDAs are making good progress on building partnerships with regional stakeholders. They are also on target for producing draft regional strategies for consultation over the summer.

 Match funding will continue to be the responsibility of the grant applicant. This ensures local ownership and commitment to the projects. There are numerous possible sources for match funding including local authorities, TECs, government schemes, the voluntary sector and also the private sector. Organisations such as the European Investment Bank can make loans to local authorities for use as match funding. In some areas innovative loan and equity funds such as the Merseyside Special Investment fund have been set up to draw in resources from commercial banks.

<a name="90617w05.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 May 1999]:</i> The make-up of the team investigating Rosemary Nelson's murder is a matter for Deputy Chief Constable, Colin Port. He is leading the investigation. The Chief Constable of the Royal Ulster Constabulary has given him authority to draw together whatever team he requires. The number of officers making up the inquiry team varies as the needs of the investigation dictate. Officers from up to nine police forces, other than the Royal Ulster Constabulary, have been involved in this investigation.

The preliminary research results are disappointing, in view of the Government's objectives of saving saveable marriages and encouraging the mediated settlement of disputes.

The most extensive training exercise in the history of the Department commenced in February 1999 and was completed on 3 June 1999 with all lawyers in the Department receiving three days training on the European Convention on Human Rights, the Scotland Act and the Human Rights Act. Further practical workshops and training for support staff will take place during the summer of 1999 and the Human Rights Act will, in future, form part of the core training of all prosecutors in Scotland.

<P>
<a name="90617w06.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 I represented the United Kingdom at a meeting of the European Union Agriculture Council in Luxembourg on 14-15 June.
<P>

<a name="90617w06.htm_para7">Concluding a negotiation launched under the UK Presidency last year, the Council reached a unanimous landmark agreement (Spain abstaining) on battery cages for laying hens, the farming system which is most heavily criticised on grounds of animal welfare. From 1 January 2003, any new battery cages must meet new and more welfare-friendly standards. Conventional battery cages will be banned altogether after the end of 2011.
<P>

<a name="90617w06.htm_para8">One of my aims was to accommodate non-cage systems of the kind which many UK producers have voluntarily adopted out of concern for animal welfare, and I am pleased to have secured terms which will allow producers who have such systems to keep them, without significant change also until 31 December 2011.
<P>

<a name="90617w06.htm_para9">I regard it as important that, as we raise standards of animal welfare in the European Union, our producers should not be undermined by producers in third countries operating on lower standards. This week's agreement 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jun 1999 : Column: 216</I><P>
includes a firm undertaking from the Commission to seek wider international agreement on animal welfare standards in the next round of World Trade Organisation negotiations which starts early next year.
<P>

<a name="90617w06.htm_para10">The Council also reached unanimous agreement on standards for organic livestock, ending nearly three years' discussion. Consumers and producers will benefit from knowing that all livestock products sold as organic must in future conform to a minimum set of requirements applicable throughout the EU. It remains open to each member state to set stricter (but not less strict) standards for its own producers. I intend that there should be early discussion between Government and UK organic farming organisations about the implementation of the new rules.
<P>

<a name="90617w06.htm_para11">In the light of the problem of dioxin contamination in Belgium, the Council agreed on the urgent need to improve the monitoring and control of foodstuffs, and in particular invited the Commission to carry out a thorough review of feedingstuffs legislation and labelling.
<P>

<a name="90617w06.htm_para12">The Council also agreed the 1999 CAP price proposals by qualified majority, Italy voting against. This largely prolongs the status quo for the 1999-2000 marketing year, in advance of the Agenda 2000 price cuts beginning next year. As part of the deal, I secured an important Commission commitment to allow member states to apply more flexible set-aside rules where this brought environmental benefits, as well as their agreement to correct an anomaly which prevented fruit and vegetable producer groups including non-grower members on their Boards.

<a name="90617w07.htm_para1">Information on discards is not collected on a comparable stock by stock basis. From research work involving observers on fishing vessels, scientists estimate that the level of discarding varies according to number and age of fish available, season, mesh size used and anticipated market conditions as perceived by fishermen. We understand that discarding tends to be very low for pelagic species and for some demersal fish such as sole but can be significantly higher for gadoids such as cod, haddock and whiting.
<P>

<a name="90617w07.htm_para2">MAFF is contributing funds to an international project to study the economic causes of discarding at sea and to consider alternative management measures to reduce discarding in EU fisheries. The majority of fish discarded is undersize or considered uneconomic.

<P>
<a name="90617w07.htm_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 I remain concerned to ensure that an appropriate Total Allowable Catch is established each year for sandeels. I am also concerned to ensure that effective conservation measures are put in place to ensure that sandeels are available to those sea birds that depend on them at certain times of the year.
<P>

<a name="90617w07.htm_para3">Figures for estimated total sandeel stocks in UK waters are not available. The main sandeel fishery off the UK is in the North Sea. In October 1998 the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea advised that the North sea spawning stock biomass of this short lived species stood at 1.8 million tonnes. On this advice the Council of Ministers set a Total Allowable Catch of 1 million tonnes. A further 7,000 tonnes may be taken in the tightly regulated local fishery at Shetland.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and I have today published a report 'Regulating Communications: The Way Ahead', setting out the way forward on the regulation of the converging industries.
<P>

<P>

<a name="90617w07.htm_para5">The new statement makes clear the Government's determination to ensure that the UK can take advantage of the opportunities convergence of telecommunications, broadcasting and information technology will bring. It shows how the Government are adapting the UK's regulatory framework to take account of changes in markets and technology, notably through modernisation and strengthening of competition law and deepening co-operation between OFTEL, the ITC and the Office of Fair Trading.
<P>

<a name="90617w07.htm_para6">Changes in these fast moving markets will eventually amount to a transformation and so demand new approaches to regulation to achieve policy goals. But the pattern and timing are far from clear. Our rejection of a big bang approach to reforming communications regulation in favour of the evolutionary approach outlined in last year's Convergence Green Paper has received widespread support. Most of those who commented supported this approach, recognising the uncertainties about the pace and direction of change. We believe that the changes we have made and continue to make will ensure that consumers and businesses alike are well served by flexible and effective regulation.

 I have discussed this issue with my right hon. Friend the Scottish First Minister.

I fully support the conclusions reached on this by the Scottish Executive, as set out in the First Minister's statement to the Scottish Parliament on 9 June 1999, <i>Official Report of the Scottish Parliament</i>, columns 358-60, in which he said:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"The Sexual Offences (Amendment) Bill is a United Kingdom measure designed to equalise the age of consent for homosexuals and heterosexuals, and to introduce a new offence of abuse of trust. It was introduced to the Westminster Parliament in December last year and defeated in the House of Lords in April this year. The United Kingdom Government is likely to reintroduce the Bill, making use of the Parliament Acts to ensure its passage. That means that the Bill that is re-introduced would have to be identical to the one that was defeated. Therefore, even if it were thought desirable, it will not be possible to remove Scotland from the Bill's scope if the Parliament Acts are invoked.

 Following the judgment of the European Court in the First National Bank of Chicago case, policy is that all foreign exchange transactions are supplies of services. Where these transactions take place within the EU, the services are exempt from VAT and therefore taxpayers are not able to recover the VAT incurred on related costs. Where the transaction is with a party belonging outside the EU, however, the VAT incurred is recoverable. The recoverable amount is determined on a basis agreed between the taxpayer and Customs.

 Customs continue to work with industry representatives on estimating the scale of tobacco smuggling and finding new ways to tackle the problem. Several retail trade associations contributed to the review of alcohol and tobacco fraud and smuggling published in July last year. The Government accepted the review findings and Customs are now progressing the recommendations in partnership with the trade.

Furthermore, we work closely with our current catering providers and encourage them to offer fair trade products as an option to customers in staff restaurants. Discussions are taking place to ensure that fair trade products are considered for inclusion in product specification sent out for tender.

Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is not specified as one of these benefits, as it is not an income replacement benefit. Accordingly, this means that anyone receiving only DLA, and no other benefits, will not be required to participate in an interview. Claimants of DLA only will continue to claim directly via the regional Disability Benefits Centre.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90617w10.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Judaism, along with Christianity and Zoroastrianism are recognised religions under the Iranian constitution. The Jewish community are represented in the Iranian Parliament (Majles) by a Jewish MP who represents the community as a whole rather than a constituency and whose seat is reserved by the constitution. The Iranian authorities have frequently stated that they recognise Judaism but not Zionism, a position also adopted by the Iranian Jewish community. The Jewish community in Iran has shrunk to approximately 27,000 from around 100,000 since the revolution in 1979. Those remaining do so through choice and have experienced occasional problems mainly related to the clash of cultures between Judaism and Islam (Jewish shopkeepers wishing to open on the Islamic weekend and other similar incidents). We welcome President Khatami's statement following the recent arrests of members of the Jewish communities that he is responsible for individuals of very religious persuasion in Iran.

 We and our EU partners regularly raise with the Iranian authorities our concerns over the plight of the Baha'i community in Iran. I most recently raise the issue with the Iranian Ambassador on 24 May. Last October our then Charge (now Ambassador), with partners in the EU Troika, spoke to the Iranian Ministry of Foreign Affairs about two Baha'is under sentence of death. So far that action appears to have been effective in preventing those executions. He and his EU colleagues regularly report on human rights issues including the Baha'is. I discussed these issues with Barnabas Leith, the Secretary General of the Baha'i Community of the United Kingdom, when we met on 14 June.
