Several changes to the service have been made since the original contract was signed in February 2000. These comprise enhancements to resilience and fallback arrangements, plus an extension of the service to include coverage within the London Underground. The testing and release for operational use of the 125 underground stations is due to be completed by 30 March 2009. I hope to be able to provide an update on this in the near future.</p>

1. The 2007 dairy farm type was calculated using data taken from the cattle tracing system and is therefore not directly comparable to previous year&#146;s results. Prior to 2007, the farm type was based on June survey data. As the annual June survey is based on a sample, estimates have been made for holdings not surveyed.<br>
2. Figures prior to 2001 are not directly comparable with later results as they cover main (commercial) holdings only and also because of a register improvement exercise in 2001 which impacted on the labour figures.<br>

 The Ombudsman found against this particular local authority on the basis that it had made insufficient effort to assess whether requiring the householder to have only one bin for the size of the household, was reasonable.</p>

 The waste oil directive requires member states to ensure the collection and correct management of waste oil and to take measures to give priority to the regeneration of waste oil above combustion.

 DEFRA does not hold statistics relating to the waste produced specifically by supermarkets. However, in July 2008, the Food and Drink Federation (FDF) and DEFRA published the results of a survey of food and packaging waste arising across FDF member companies during 2006. The results show that of the 835,000 tonnes of food and packaging waste produced at 236 FDF member production sites in 2006, 686,000 tonnes were recycled or recovered in some way.

 The 24 hour, seven days a week operational nature of the Ministry&#146;s work in various sectors of the justice service necessitates a large number of our staff to regularly provide out of hours work. This flexible additional work is required in order to better protect the public and meet the needs of a modern service.</p>

The majority of overtime paid in the Ministry of Justice relates to work done in Her Majesty&#146;s Prison Service. Within Her Majesty&#146;s Court Service examples of such work include provision of out of hours legal advice to judges on issues such as Emergency Protection Orders or Extradition matters, or the provision of Saturday court sittings. The Ministry of Justice is also responsible for overtime payments made to probation staff in the National Offender Management Service.</p>

 The number of persons found guilty at all courts for firearm possession offences in England and Wales, by police force area for the years 1997 to 2006 can be viewed in the following table.</p>

The figures given in the table on court proceedings relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offence for which they were dealt with. When a defendant has been found guilty of two or more offences, the offence selected is the one for which the heaviest penalty is imposed. Where the same disposal is imposed for two or more offences, the offence selected is the offence for which the statutory maximum penalty is the most severe.</p>

 All primary care trusts have been asked to commission an additional general practitioner-led health centre, and have been given additional funding to commission those services. The Department has not received specific requests from primary care trusts to use existing health centres. PCTs have been guided by the principle that these should be new procurements, but that they could count any planned health centres as long as they had not already been put out to tender before the publication of &#147;Our NHS, Our Future: The NHS Next Stage Review Interim Report&#148; in October 2007, and met the core criteria. These are centres that must be open 8am to 8pm 365 days a year and be situated in easily accessible locations, with bookable and walk-in appointments for both registered and non-registered patients.</p>

1. Assignment of episodes to years: Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br>
2. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
3. Cause code&#151;stab wounds<sup>(1)</sup>: The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. HES has used the following ICD-10 external cause codes when referring to stab wounds.<br>
Stab wounds<sup>(1)</sup>:<br>
W26&#151;Contact with knife, sword or dagger.<br>
X99&#151;Assault by sharp object.<br>
4. Data quality: Hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS Trusts and Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
5. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
6. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
7. Low numbers: Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 1 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk).<br>
8. Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality: PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of Treatment and SHA of Treatment is poor in 1996-97,1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of GP practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

 The Department introduced a new working capital loans system in 2006-07. Instead of relying on brokerage as a source of funding or planned support, trust working capital requirements must now be financed by loans agreed with the Department and recorded in individual accounts. Organisations now have to address financial problems head-on and take steps to ensure that they live within their means. Deficits remain where they occur, and are transparent in final accounts at the year-end.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_226"><a name="81020w0018.htm_para1"><a name="08102037003562">As a result of introducing the new loans system, there were 17 NHS trusts where the financial challenges are such that the Department either could not give a loan because the trust could not afford to meet the repayments, or where a loan was agreed, but the amount could be repaid only over a very extended timescale. Instead these trusts were advanced money as a short-term measure to cover their running costs while a rigorous review was conducted on their finances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_227"><a name="81020w0018.htm_para2"><a name="08102037003563">In the 2007/08 Quarter 4 edition of The Quarter (a copy of which has been placed in the Library), the Department announced that 10 of the original 17 trusts were no longer classified as financially challenged. This was a result of the trusts working extremely hard in conjunction with their strategic health authorities (SHA) and primary care trusts (PCT) to improve their underlying financial position. As a result they are now trading in balance and are able to produce sufficient surpluses going forward to operate as a sustainable organisation, both financially and in the provision of health care. All 10 of these organisations will have repaid their debt within five years</p>

<p><a name="stpa_228"><a name="81020w0018.htm_para3"><a name="08102037003564">The remaining seven NHS organisations currently deemed as financially challenged trusts, and their forecast cumulative deficit for the end of the 2008-09 financial year, as a total and as a percentage of their forecasted 2008-09 turnover are given in the following table:</p>

 Information about waiting times for physiotherapy is not collected centrally. It is for primary care trusts in partnership with local stakeholders, including practice-based commissioners, local government and the public to determine how best to use their funds to meet national and local priorities for improving health and to commission services accordingly. This process provides the means for addressing local needs within the health community including access to physiotherapy.</p>

 Subject to parliamentary approval, the new arrangements for tribunals, including the special educational needs and disability tribunal (SENDIST), will begin on 3 November. The Tribunals Service at the Ministry of Justice has consulted on the Rules for the new Health, Education and Social Care Chamber, of which SENDIST will become a part, and the Tribunals Procedures Committee has amended the Rules in the light of consultation responses from those with an interest in SEN. SENDIST has also established a special user group, on which the parent-led Independent Panel for Special Education Advice (IPSEA) is represented, to advise it on what is practical and appropriate for users in the new arrangements. The overriding principle informing the drafting of the Rules has been that they must be able to deal with all cases justly and fairly.</p>

 This Government remain fully committed to widening access to higher education for people from disadvantaged backgrounds. Widening access requires long-term investment and change across the higher education system. We have reformed student finance, reintroducing grants and raising the income threshold at which repayments start. No one is required to pay a contribution to their higher education up-front. These reforms, together with Aimhigher, have been instrumental in bringing about progress. The proportion of UK domiciled, young, full time, first degree entrants to English higher education institutions who were from lower socio-economic groups rose from 27.9 per cent. in 2002-03 to 29.8 per cent. in 2006-07.</p>

From September 2001, 26,000 such bursaries were made available at a total cost of &#163;37 million. With the wider reintroduction of grants in 2006, the Opportunity Bursary scheme was withdrawn.<br>
<sup>(3)</sup> Funded by HEFCE.<br>
<sup>(4)</sup> Includes student loans RAB charge, fee loans, student support grants, Maintenance Grant, HE Grant, grants for vulnerable students, tuition fee grants, grants for part-time students and access funds and bursaries. The student loans RAB charge estimates the future cost to Government of subsidising and writing off the student loans issued in that year; it does not represent the amount of cash lent to students, which has risen each year since the introduction of student loans. Figures for 1997-2007 are outturn; those for 2007-08 is estimated outturn; and those for 2008-11 are plans.<br>
<sup>(5)</sup> These figures also include the allocations for improving the retention of non-traditional students, and to widen access and improve provision for disabled students. The figure for 2008-09 is provisional.<br>
<sup>(6)</sup> The Office for Fair Access forecasts that around &#163;300 million annually will be spent by higher education providers on bursaries and scholarships benefiting students from tow-income and other under-represented groups by the academic year 2008-09.<br>
<sup>(7)</sup> Not yet confirmed.<br>
<sup>(8)</sup> Not yet available.<br>
<i> Note</i>:<br>
In 2001-04, Aimhigher contributed &#163;10 million a year towards the widening participation allocation. The figure given as the total for each of these years is therefore less than the sum of the parts to avoid double counting.<br>

In the Afghan theatre, force levels and the capabilities required are regularly reviewed and AH training is constantly scrutinised to ensure it is fit for purpose.</p>

We aim to increase flying hours by a further 25 per cent. by early next year, by deploying additional helicopters, and we are building the logistic support required in terms of spare parts and personnel, particularly engineering manpower, to enable this.</p>

The majority of the blood held in-theatre by the Defence Medical Services (DMS) is supplied by the UK National Blood Services (NBS), which does not routinely carry out PI on its blood products. However, we understand that the Advisory Committee on the Safety of Blood, Tissues and Organs (SaBTO, an independent non-departmental public body) will be undertaking a comprehensive review of pathogen inactivation for blood products in 2009, which will inform decisions on its use in the UK. It would not be practical for the DMS to introduce its own discrete in-theatre PI capability, in view of the complexity of the current technology and the infrequency with which it would be required.</p>

 The data available in respect of the Birmingham group of hospitals (Selly Oak, Queen Elizabeth, Heartlands, City and Royal Orthopaedic), which have been collated in consultation with the relevant NHS authorities, relate to military in-patients returning from service in Afghanistan or Iraq over the period January 2003 to January 2008.

 Co-operation between armed forces recruitment staffs and local schools remains at a high level. Armed forces presentation teams and careers advisers visit about 1,000 state and public schools across the UK each year, but only at the specific invitation of the schools/colleges themselves. Their aims are to raise the students&#146; awareness of the armed forces in a democratic society, support schools&#146; careers programmes, facilitate participative learning exercises with students, and offer advice on service careers. The teams do not go into schools to recruit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_346"><a name="81020w0030.htm_para1"><a name="08102044001618">We are proud of the work the single-service presentation teams do with schools and colleges to inform young people about the tremendous work undertaken and careers on offer in the armed forces and which can provide fantastic opportunities to a wide range of people from all sectors of society. Young people should be shown all available career options; the more information they receive about life in the Armed Forces, covering all points good and bad, the better informed they will be.</p>

 The armed forces and MOD civilian recruiting organisations employ a wide range of measures to ascertain the effectiveness of their recruitment advertising campaigns. For example, the MOD uses regular independent pre and post-advertising tracking research which explores the attitudes and behaviour of the target audience towards the campaigns, and the awareness of each burst of advertising to inform what percentage of the target audience has been reached. These are then set against advertising expenditure to assess the cost effectiveness of the various media channels and tools used compared with each other, across government and with industry averages.</p>

BT remains the service provider with the largest market share. Many other landline service providers do not charge for these calls, but this cannot be guaranteed by the Department as the contract is between the customer and his service provider and can be subject to change. Customers contacting us by their personal mobiles will be alerted that charges will apply if they proceed with the call and if the customer advises us that they are concerned about these charges we will call them back.

 Since October 2002 carers aged 65 or over have been able to qualify for carer's allowance on the same basis as younger carers. The general principle is that if a claimant qualifies for more than one non-means-tested income replacement benefit the higher benefit is paid. Therefore, if a carer is receiving a state pension they would not be paid a carer's allowance unless their state pension was less than the rate of carer's allowance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="81020w0034.htm_para15"><a name="08102044002144">Over 400,000 carers receive income-related benefits including income support, jobseeker's allowance, housing benefit, council tax benefit and pension credit which are paid at a higher rate because they are entitled to carer's allowance. The higher rate is paid even if the carer satisfies the qualifying rules for carer's allowance but receives a state pension at a higher rate and as a result cannot be paid carer's allowance.</p>

Households with a member aged 60 to 79 will receive an additional &#163;50 and households with a member aged 80 or over will receive an additional &#163;100. This makes the winter fuel payment &#163;250 and &#163;400 respectively for winter 2008-09 which provides a significant contribution towards an older person's winter fuel bill.</p>

And for winter 2008-09 cold weather payments will increase in value from &#163;8.50 to &#163;25.00. Cold weather payments are made to vulnerable people in receipt of qualifying benefits, including pension credit, if there is a period of very cold weather in their area.</p>

The number of pensioners in relative poverty in the UK has fallen from 2.9 million in 1998-99 to 2.1 million in 2006-07. Once housing costs are accounted for, pensioners are less likely to be in poverty than the population as a whole.</p>

It makes a difference to the income of millions of older people. Since pension credit was introduced in 2003 the number of pensioners in relative poverty has fallen by around 500,000.</p>

1. 99 per cent. of approved nationwide applications currently have an accurate postcode. Applications where postcodes could not be matched to the Office of National Statistics database are excluded from this data-set.<br>
 2. Figures based on employers address and the date the application is approved, rather than the date on the application form as used in the Accession Monitoring Report.<br>
 3. Figures are rounded to nearest five.<br>
 4. Because of rounding, figures may not add up to total shown.<br>
 5. The table presents a gross (cumulative) figure for the number of workers applying to the WRS. The figures are not current, an individual who has registered to work and who leaves employment is not required to de-register, so some of those counted will have left the employment for which they registered and indeed some are likely to have left the UK.<br>
