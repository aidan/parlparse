<P>
<P>
<a name="00717w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The trade in quota has been initiated by fishermen themselves. Transfers of quota between groups with quota management responsibilities must be conducted in accordance with the rules on quota management drawn up by the Fisheries Departments in the UK. These rules are the subject of regular consultation with the fishing industry and those affecting the trade in quota are currently under review by a working group comprising representatives of industry and the Fisheries Departments. A report on possible modifications to the quota management rules, including arrangements for adjusting the fixed quota allocation units attached to fishing vessel licences to take account of transfers between fishermen, is expected shortly.

<a name="00717w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No. We do not believe that setting arbitrary targets for the area of land in organic farming or for the consumption of organic food is sensible. But we do wish to see organic farming succeed and we have made available considerable sums of money in support for farmers converting to organic farming through the Organic Farming Scheme. We will make a further &#163;140 million available in support for organic conversion when the European Commission has approved the England Rural Development Programme later this year.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of the cost to the UK in terms of lost compensation from the EU if the target for the disposal of over-30-months scheme cattle is not met.  [129651]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00717w02.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Compensation from the EU is not dependent upon disposal targets being met. It is dependant upon the remains of all purchased cattle being destroyed by incineration. Where such cattle have initially been disposed of by rendering, 80 per cent. of the available compensation is claimed at that point. Once an equivalent amount of the resultant meat, bonemeal and tallow produced from the rendering process has been incinerated, the balance of the compensation can be claimed.

 <i>[holding answer 6 July 2000]:</i> As part of the "Action Plan for Farming", agreed at the Prime Minister's 30 March meeting with industry leaders, the Government decided to introduce a Pig Industry Restructuring Scheme (PIRS). &#163;26 million was made available to the scheme in its first year and bids have been made for funding in subsequent years. Under state aid rules, the European Commission must approve the scheme before it can be introduced. To begin that process, the scheme was formally notified to the Commission on 30 March. The Commission has since carried out its studies of the scheme and raised a number of questions which have been addressed. The outgoers element of the scheme has just ended its consultation period and will be introduced as soon as possible following Commission clearance. This part of the scheme will operate in order to reduce UK pig production capacity by 16 per cent. from 1 June 1998 total, using a sealed bid system.

<P>
<a name="00717w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 There are no plans to change the practices under which we procure naval vessels. It remains our policy that where possible orders are placed following competitive tendering (either direct by the Ministry of Defence or by the Prime Contractor), and that warships and major naval auxiliary ships are built in the United Kingdom. For other vessels, where we are bound by EC treaty obligations and World Trade Organisation rules which will not permit discrimination in favour of United Kingdom industry, every effort is made to ensure that United Kingdom yards have the opportunity to tender for the build of such vessels on an equal basis.
<P>

<a name="00717w03.html_para6">The Department has no policy to spread future shipbuilding work between specific shipyards. Such a policy would not deliver value for money or an efficient, effective industrial base. We seek, nevertheless, to ensure that our forward shipbuilding programme is capable of sustaining a competitive industrial base. For example we have required the T45 Prime Contractor to involve both Vosper Thornycroft and BAE Systems Marine in the design and construction of the initial contract for three T45 destroyers, announced on 11 July, to ensure a more effective competition for subsequent follow-on vessels.

 One soldier (of the Royal Irish Regiment) has died during a training exercise since 1974. The death occurred in Wainwright, Canada on 13 June 2000. The soldier was stationed in Drumadd Barracks, Armagh and was on attachment to 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards for the duration of the exercise. The incident is currently the subject of a Board of Inquiry and the findings will not be known for some time. A small number of deaths arising from natural causes while soldiers have been on annual camp exercise with their own units have not been included.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will estimate the cost savings for <i>(a)</i> his Department as a whole and <i>(b)</i> embassies and high commissions, of the use of IT, including e-mail, in the past year.  [130123]<P>

<P>
<a name="00717w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 July 2000]:</i> In the past year the benefit to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office resulting from prior investment in IT is estimated at <i>(a)</i> &#163;20 million for whole Department, of which <i>(b)</i> over &#163;11 million was overseas.
<P>

<a name="00717w07.html_para0">These figures include new cost savings last year of &#163;0.5 million in the UK messenger service, resulting in part from the use of e-mail. They do not include savings which will accrue once our new Information and Communications Technology infrastructure is in place.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how many British nationals were in prison overseas on 1 July; and if he will list the country and the offence committed in each case.  [130526]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00717w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 As of 1 July, we were aware of 2,750 British nationals in prison overseas. Around 40 per cent. of these prisoners were convicted of drugs related offences.
<P>

<a name="00717w07.html_para1">To list the countries and offences for which each prisoner was convicted would incur disproportionate costs.

<a name="00717w07.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. O'Hara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what plans he has to increase the Government grant to the British Council.  [131058]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00717w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The British Council has a good case for increased funding. In the current Spending Review my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has been pressing for a significant increase in funding for the Council, as for the BBC World Service and the FCO as a whole.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00717w07.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. O'Hara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how much the Government grant-in-aid was to the British Council in Greece in <i>(a)</i> 1995-96 and <i>(b)</i> the latest year for which figures are available, together with the percentage change in the grant-in-aid to the British Council in Greece in real terms over the same period.  [131055]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00717w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office provides the British Council with grant-in-aid funding for its activities world-wide; the Council decides on its distribution, in consultation with this Department. In 1995-96 the Council allocated &#163;1.9 million of the grant-in-aid to Greece; in 1999-2000 the figure is &#163;1.4 million. This represents a decrease in real terms of 37 per cent. The total British Council budget in Greece in recent years has been boosted by substantial revenue- earning activity, chiefly in administering examinations and teaching English.

 Mr. Williams underwent spirometry testing, the first stage of the assessment process, at home on 1 December last year.

IRISC, the Department's claim handling agents, subsequently forwarded the necessary forms to Mr. Williams' solicitor. The forms have been returned and once Mr. Williams' medical records have been collected an appointment will be made for a respiratory specialist to attend his home to carry out the assessment.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make it a requirement that the alleged father of a child in disputed paternity cases should be required by the CSA to take a second blood test if the mother requests it.  [129341]<P>

<a name="00717w09.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The CSA cannot require non-resident parents to take a blood test and we have no plans to enable them to do so. In the new child support scheme, alleged parents who refuse to take a DNA test will be presumed to be the parents of the child. If the parent with care refuses to accept the outcome of a DNA test she can apply to court for a declaration of parentage that will be binding on the CSA.

So we are also implementing a wide-ranging programme of action including raising standards in schools, improving children's health, and regenerating local areas. We will report on progress on all fronts in our second annual report on poverty and social exclusion, due to be published later this year.

 We intend to reform Housing Benefit to improve customer service through a modernised, streamlined system, to tackle fraud and error, and to reduce the barriers to work.
<P>

<a name="00717w09.html_para0">The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate is conducting an on-going programme of inspections of local authorities, encouraging them to develop action plans to improve administration and tackle fraud and error. Best practice guidance, developed through this programme, has been made available to all local authorities. The current round of inspections focuses on the 30 local authorities with the highest Housing Benefit expenditure. We have made it abundantly clear to all council Chief Executives that where the inspectorate finds evidence of persistent 



<P>
<P><I>17 Jul 2000 : Column: 33W</I><P>
failings, we will use our powers to direct the authority on the standards it is to meet and the timescales for achieving them.
<P>

<a name="00717w09.html_para1">We have set Best Value performance indicators from this April designed to ensure that authorities provide their communities with a faster, more accurate Housing Benefit service which is more secure against fraud, and which provides value for money and takes account of the views and needs of clients. Authorities are required to set challenging targets against these indicators and demonstrate that they are achieving year on year improvements in the standard of service they provide. And we are making better use of IT to speed up administration and reduce the scope for fraud and error. By this autumn, nearly all of the 20 million forms currently sent by the Benefits Agency to local authorities through the post will be sent electronically, significantly reducing the time taken just to transfer information.

 Withdrawal of benefit in these situations is based on the principle, established since the beginning of the Social Security system in 1948, that funding to meet a specific need should not be provided from more than one public source at the same time.

However, SEAC advised that the practice of spreading rendering condensate on land should be discontinued because of the presence of detectable levels of ruminant protein in samples, which could pose a risk to animal health. My right hon. Friend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is considering how to take forward the SEAC advice and hopes to consult on proposals shortly.

<P>
<a name="00717w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Government recognise that transport provision is particularly important to people in rural areas because jobs and services are more widely dispersed than in urban areas. Within the 10 Year Plan for transport, we are developing a package of measures to improve public transport in rural areas and we shall be developing our ideas further in the forthcoming Rural White Paper.
<P>

<a name="00717w12.html_para12">We recognise that the car will remain central to rural life, and any substantial increase in motoring costs may have adverse impact on the rural economy. We are therefore carefully monitoring the recent increases in petrol prices. These recent increases have been primarily due to a sharp increase in international gasoline prices caused by the combination of higher crude oil prices and gasoline supply problems, especially in the United States, not the Government's tax policies.

 Under the proposed public-private partnership for National Air Traffic Services, NATS' charges will be regulated using an RPI-X formula. The Economic Regulation Group of the Civil Aviation Authority has the task of advising the Secretary of State about the initial value of X. The CAA is carrying out a consultation process designed to help it prepare that advice. The consultation paper issued by ERG on 26 April, and NATS' response of 26 May, are part of that process.

 The Government do not make forecasts for NATS' capital expenditure. NATS has recently produced its first 10-year investment plan and is currently consulting with its customers on this document. The form, timing and appropriateness of the plan will also be reviewed by the CAA. NATS' estimate is that capital expenditure over the next decade will be of the order of &#163;1.4 billion (in current prices).

 I place very high priority on improving, with the help of the Health and Safety Commission and Executive (HSC\E), standards of health and safety. I am particularly keen that the procedures to reach those standards should be carried through in the most open, transparent and accountable manner feasible.
<P>

<a name="00717w14.html_para1">The Government will be looking to HSE to deliver improvements in health and safety not only through their Public Service Agreement targets, but also through meeting the challenging targets set out in the Revitalising Health and Safety Strategy Statement.
<P>

<a name="00717w14.html_para2">Since coming to office this Government have significantly increased the resources available to health and safety--additional resources of some &#163;63 million were made available to the Health and Safety Commission and Executive (HSC\E) in the three year Comprehensive Spending Review in 1998. These additional resources are enabling HSE to recruit and train more inspectors. As a result of the additional funding the HSE has agreed to increase the number of its regulatory contacts with employers and duty holders (including inspections) to 200,000 by 2001-02. The number of prosecutions for health and safety offences has been rising each year, as have the number of investigations into complaints from employees and members of the public. We have also been arguing strongly for extra resources through the SR2000 process.

 In the two years from 1 April 1998 to 31 March 2000 there were 39,233 preventive inspection contacts made to construction sites out of a total number of construction site contacts of 64,142. Details of other site contacts are shown in the attached table. The figures shown are provisional. It is not possible to distinguish between those contacts dealing only with safety, as opposed to health and welfare issues: the vast majority of inspections will cover all three matters.

<a name="00717w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions has a range of powers to make regulations on waste under Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990; and some limited powers either to direct or to issue statutory guidance to the Environment Agency.
<P>

<a name="00717w14.html_para3">Section 33 of the 1990 Act requires that waste from construction sites must be treated and disposed of in accordance with the conditions of a waste management licence, or within the terms of a licensing exemption, and in a way which does not cause pollution of the environment or harm to human health. Section 34 of the 1990 Act imposes a duty of care on those who produce, carry, keep, treat or dispose of construction waste. Contravention of these controls is a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="00717w14.html_para4">We are currently reviewing two of the licensing exemptions which allow the use of construction waste and which have been the subject of allegations of abuse. The aim of the revised controls under consideration is to enable the Environment Agency to supervise more effectively the use of construction waste at exempt sites.

 The European Commission, rather than the UK Government, is responsible for ensuring that member states meet their obligations under community law. As far as the CITES Convention itself is concerned, following pressure from the CITES Standing Committee (then under UK Chairmanship), Greece announced a series of improvements in February last year which led to the withdrawal of CITES trade sanctions imposed for unsatisfactory implementation of the Convention in September 1998. It will be for the Convention and the Commission to assess whether these improvements have been implemented.

<a name="00717w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Disabled facilities grants are mandatory in all cases set out under section 23(1) of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, and local authorities must follow the provisions of that Act in giving them. The grants are subject to a test of the applicant's resources to ensure that they are directed at those who are unable to afford the cost of adaptations on their own. In addition to their statutory duties, local authorities have powers to approve grants for the welfare, accommodation and employment of disabled people, and to pay grant above the &#163;20,000 limit for the mandatory grant. These discretionary provisions enable local authorities to respond sensitively to individual cases without weakening the statutory entitlement of disabled people to a grant. We have no plans to change these arrangements.

<P>
<a name="00717w14.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Earlier this year, my Department reviewed the arrangements for disabled facilities grants in relation to the needs of disabled children and young people. In the light of that review, we introduced changes to the test of resources for the grant in April this year, to reflect the higher housing costs incurred by parents of disabled children. We have no plants to make further changes to the arrangements governing the treatment of disabled children and young people, which are consistent with those for other housing-related benefits.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what measures he is taking to meet the aim published in the UK Biodiversity Habitat Action Plan for Lowland Raised Bogs, of achieving 90 per cent. replacement of the total market requirement for peat with alternatives by 2010.  [130681]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00717w15.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The preliminary target in the Lowland Raised Bogs Action Plan is for 40 per cent. of the total market requirement for soil conditioners and growing media to be met by peat alternatives by 2005. The plan also indicates the promotion of research and development of sustainable alternatives to peat to speed up reduction of peat used in both amateur and professional markets, with the longer-term aim of 90 per cent. peat-free by 2010. We are closely monitoring the UK markets for peat and alternatives. In 1998, peat alternatives accounted for 32 per cent. of the total market. The provisional results for 1999, which will be published later this year, indicate continued progress towards the published target.
<P>

<a name="00717w15.html_para1">We wish to maintain a competitive UK horticultural industry, and the quality of products available to the amateur gardener, and recognise that unless the sustainable alternatives are acceptable to the consumer they will not be taken up. The report of the Peat Working Group, published in November 1999, identified possible courses of action to increase further the use of alternatives in the longer term, including the dilution of peat based products, and the development of quality standards for growing media. We are now looking at means of taking these ideas forward.

 Provisional outturn figures for 1999-2000 indicate that local authorities have spent &#163;4.0 billion on the management and maintenance of their dwellings. This compares with total allowances of &#163;3.1 billion included within the calculation of the Housing Revenue Account Subsidy. These allowances are just one component of the subsidy calculation, which also takes into account expenditure on debt charges and assumed income from rents. It is for local authorities to decide how best to balance their various sources of income and expenditure so as to meet the needs of their tenants.

The Franchising Director is entitled to take into account the past performances of operators when considering the award of franchises. The Franchising Director has set no specific dates for the award of any replacement franchise, as to do so may prejudice his negotiating position.

 The Secretary of State has no plans to discuss with Virgin Trains the criteria for making APEX tickets available. APEX fares represent a substantial discount over the regulated fares and are offered in return for corresponding reduction in flexibility. They are not regulated by the Franchising Director and the criteria and conditions applied to them by Virgin Trains, or any other Train Operating Company (TOC), are entirely commercial matters for the TOC concerned.

 <i>[Pursuant to the answer of 29 June 2000, c. 603W]:</i> Under section 59 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities are not under a duty to collect waste which is fly-tipped. Section 59(1) provides that a collection authority may serve a notice requiring the occupier of the land to remove fly-tipped waste.

 The National Asylum Support Service is not yet responsible for providing support to destitute asylum seekers who were living in London at the time of their application for asylum. Some of those applying for asylum at ports of entry may have been placed in emergency accommodation in the Greater London area while their application for support was being considered. From 3 April until 30 June, a total of 3,212 asylum seekers, including dependants, had been dispersed under the national asylum support scheme.

changes day by day as providers notify NASS of properties. Equally, the number of asylum seekers provided with accommodation by NASS changes daily. In order to ensure that adequate numbers of accommodation units are available to satisfy current demand, and make provision for the forthcoming roll-out of the scheme, NASS has to maintain a stock of available property. The total stock currently standing empty represents approximately three weeks of accommodation needed when the NASS scheme has been fully rolled out.

<P>
<a name="00717w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 We have no plans at present to extend the fixed penalty system in the way proposed. Speeding is an endorsable offence which, under the fixed penalty system, puts three penalty points on an offender's licence. The courts can endorse only licences issued under the Road Traffic Act 1988 and foreign licences do not have the space for recording such endorsements. But we are in discussion with the European Union about mutual recognition issues on road traffic offences.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many cases of sickness resulting from the consumption of fresh meat emanating from British abattoirs were recorded in 1999.  [126189]

<P>
<a name="00717w19.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Most cases of infectious intestinal disease are not part of recognised outbreaks (i.e. they are sporadic cases). It is very difficult to obtain scientific information implicating a specific food as the cause of infection for these sporadic cases and, as such, it is not possible to provide data on specific foods associated with sporadic infection.
<P>

<a name="00717w19.html_para0">However, meat and meat products are an important vehicle of foodborne illness. There was at least one large outbreak in 1999 which was attributable to meat from a British abattoir.

 Part III of the Children's Homes Regulations 1991 requires the authority responsible for children's homes to draw up written procedures to be followed when children go missing from children's homes.
<P>

<a name="00717w20.html_para0">In order to improve practice in this area, in January 1998 the Local Government Association and the Association of Chief Police Officers issued guidance to local authorities on procedures and good practice when children go missing from care. Social services and police forces were advised to develop locally agreed protocols to cover the circumstances in which initial reports should be made to the police and to act on any report of a child going missing from care immediately. The Department was represented on the working party which produced this guidance. We intend to publish further good practice guidance later this year aimed at helping statutory and voluntary sector staff identify potential runaways and will suggest preventative measures which they can take. The guidance will reiterate the need for inter-agency planning and provision of services for runaways.

 The Children's Homes Regulations 1991, made under the Children Act 1989, provide that children's homes should have appropriate facilities for children to meet privately with parents, relatives, friends and others, and for children to be able to make and receive phone calls in private.

 I refer the hon. Member to the statement made by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Wales on 15 February 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 784-87, when he presented Sir Ronald Waterhouse's report "Lost in Care" to Parliament. Our response to "Lost in Care", published on 29 June 2000, acknowledges that the awful events in North Wales are not unique and that the abuse of children in the public care system across the United Kingdom has been a source of shame for all.
<P>

<a name="00717w20.html_para2">Anyone who has been the victim of a criminal act is entitled to seek compensation. For victims of child abuse, we realise that this can be a particularly difficult process to see through. However, it must be for individual people to decide if they wish to seek redress through the Courts or the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. Each case will need to be judged on its own merits.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00717w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Data supplied by local authorities show that during the period 1 April 1992 to 31 March 1999 there were an estimated 1,700 occasions when children being looked after in children's homes in England absconded for more than one week. In 1,500 of these

cases, the child concerned subsequently had a further period of care with the same local authority. Where no further period of care with the same authority is recorded these children may have been traced but not subsequently looked after or the responsibility for the care may have transferred to another authority.

The Department is also working with voluntary organisations to develop training packages for professionals working with young people at risk of abusing volatile substances.

 The Department does not hold this information. The admissions framework we have established aims to ensure that local admission arrangements accommodate parental preference wherever possible, but there have always been cases where this cannot be met. Our infant class size initiative, which is being pursued in such a way that popular schools are able to expand, enables more parents to obtain a place for their child at their preferred school. A net gain of 12,000 places at popular schools is being provided as a result of the policy.

<a name="00717w22.html_para2">In the Suffolk local education authority area, the number of pupils in key stage 1 classes of 31 or more pupils was 1,850 in January 2000, compared with 2,590 a year earlier. This means that less than 10 per cent. of these pupils remain in classes of over 30 pupils.
<P>

<a name="00717w22.html_para3">The number of pupils in key stage 1 classes in England of over 30 pupils has already fallen by 300,000 and the Government are well on target to deliver their infant class size pledge in England. Some &#163;620 million is available to support the pledge and allocations so far to Suffolk LEA amount to some &#163;3 million. This has helped reduce the average size of key stage 1 classes in the parliamentary constituency of Bury St. Edmunds from 25 in January 1997, to 24 in January 2000. Over the same period, the average size of key stage 2 classes in the constituency has fallen from 27 to 26.
<P>

<a name="00717w22.html_para4">The size of the average secondary class in Suffolk has risen slightly over this period, but at 21.8 this is still four fewer than in primary schools. Secondary classes nationally have been rising steadily for the last 12 years. In 1988 the figure was 19.9. In the budget, secondary headteachers received between &#163;30,000 and &#163;50,000 each to spend as they choose. If they spent it on teachers, they could reduce the secondary pupil:teacher ratio by 0.4.

Class sizes in secondary schools have been rising steadily since 1988, when the figure was 19.9. The pupil/teacher ratio in secondary schools is 17.1--more than six lower than in primary schools. In the budget earlier this year, secondary heads each received between &#163;30,000 and &#163;50,000. It remains for heads to decide how to use this money, but if spent on teachers, the secondary pupil/teacher ratio could be reduced by 0.4.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what assessment he has made of the impact of the New Deal for Young People on levels of long-term unemployment among young people in Glasgow, Pollok.  [130296]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00717w23.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The New Deal for Young People is aimed at people aged 18-24 who have been claiming unemployment benefits for six months or more.
<P>

<a name="00717w23.html_para0">Claimant unemployment among this group has fallen by 70 per cent. in the three years since April 1997 and by 56 per cent. since April 1998 when the New Deal was introduced. Part of this fall is due to the delivery of a strong and stable economy, but the New Deal for Young People has helped unemployment to fall even faster. The fall of 56 per cent. since the New Deal was introduced compares with a fall of 18 per cent. in total unemployment, 23 per cent. in total youth (18-24) unemployment and 26 per cent. in the total number unemployed for six months or more. The effect of the New Deal is confirmed by independent research from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research.

<a name="00717w23.html_para1">It is not possible to measure the New Deal effect exactly in each constituency. However, in Glasgow, Pollok the falls in unemployment among the New Deal client group have also been substantially faster than for other groups. In Glasgow, Pollok constituency in the two years since April 1998 claimant unemployment among those aged 18-24, unemployed for six months or more, has fallen by 68 per cent. from 315 to 101. This compares with a fall of 18 per cent. in total unemployment, 28 per cent. in total youth (18-24) unemployment, and 32 per cent. in the total number unemployed for six months or more.

 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2000]:</i> We have made up to &#163;1 billion available to support the cost of our teaching reforms in England until March 2002. Most of this extra money will be spent on the new teachers' pay system. The total cost of administering the pay reforms will be dependent upon the number of school visits carried out and this will not be known until later in 2000.

 <i>[holding answer 12 July 2000]:</i> Snapshot figures for November 1999 show that adult learners funded by the Further Education Council (FEFC) declined by 1.9 per cent. on 1998 while numbers of 16-18 year olds rose by 2.5 per cent. in the same period. The decline in adult learners reflects our squeezing out of the inappropriate franchising by some colleges allowed by the previous Government. The measures announced by the FEFC this year will help ensure that recruitment rises in line with Government projections for 2000-01 and 2001-02.

 There has been a &#163;1.1 billion increase in education through Standard Spending Assessment (SSAs) in 2000-01. Through this, money is made available to all local education authorities (LEAs).

 Although residential care establishments are able to access and use the National Curriculum if they are undertaking education within their establishments, only maintained schools are obligated to do so.

<a name="00717w24.html_para1">The Government expects and is committed to providing mainstream education including access to the full National Curriculum for all children of school age, wherever this is suitable. The recently published joint Department for Education and Employment and Department of Health "Guidance On The Education of Children and Young People in Public Care" stipulates that: "The Government expects local authorities to set a maximum time limit of twenty school days within which they must secure an education placement for any pupil in public care. It will be a full-time place in a local mainstream school unless the circumstances of the child make full-time or local or mainstream provision unsuitable". This is supported by statutory guidance in Circular LAC(2000)13.

 The UK welcomes Nigeria's new democratic government and its determination to push ahead with economic reform. As Nigeria's largest creditor we have been working to help Nigeria resolve its debt burden within the context of IMF support so that freed-up resources can be devoted to poverty eradication. The Chancellor has taken a two-stage approach: first, a generous debt rescheduling at the Paris Club once an IMF programme has been agreed; and then, once Nigeria has built a track record of reform, the UK has made clear that it would be willing to consider partial debt cancellation subject to a debt sustainability analysis.
