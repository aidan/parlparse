<a name="80126w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners what was the annual cost of running and maintaining Lambeth Palace in each of the last three years. [25204]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 Lambeth Palace is the base for the Archbishop of Canterbury's ministry and a listed historic building. The cost of running and maintaining the fabric of Lambeth Palace, which includes not only domestic accommodation but a chapel, meeting rooms and office accommodation, was &#163;440,000 in 1996, the last year for which figures are currently available. The figure includes expenditure on repairs and decorations, other outgoings such as insurance and water rates, garden upkeep and extra provision for security and takes account of rental income from leased accommodation.
<P>

<a name="80126w01.html_para0">The costs in 1994 and 1995 were &#163;410,000 in each year. Expenditure each year varies depending on the incidence of major repairs.

<P>
<a name="80126w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, pursuant to his oral answer of 12 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column 18, what plans he has to reduce the &#163;124,545 spent on average per bishop per year. [25203]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 In 1996 the Commissioners spent 10 per cent. of their total expenditure on supporting episcopal ministry. The Commissioners endeavour to provide the level of support for bishops necessary to enable them to undertake their ministry to the Church efficiently and economically.
<P>

<a name="80126w01.html_para1">Spending on episcopal housing, staff salaries and expenses is subject to close budgetary control. Repairs to buildings are limited to the minimum which the Commissioners feel is consistent with the proper maintenance of those properties in their care. The Commissioners are engaged in a review of the suitability of diocesan bishops' houses and in many cases steps have been taken to reduce long-term running costs.

To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners how many people work for the Church Commissioners; and what was their total cost in 1996. [24830]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The Commissioners' administrative costs in 1996 (inclusive of salaries, staff pensions and office running costs) were &#163;10.6 million, down 8 per cent. in real terms since 1993. &#163;5.2 million were asset

management costs; &#163;5.4 million was the cost of central Church functions for which the Commissioners are responsible. Two hundred and forty-seven staff worked for the Commissioners as at 31 December 1996, down 12 per cent. over the previous three years. I direct the hon. Member to page 22 of the Commissioners' Report and Accounts, a copy of which is in the Library. This shows the Commissioners' efficient cost management record over the last ten years.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps he plans to take to strengthen the principle of local justice dispensed through magistrates courts. [25032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 My hon. Friend will be aware that on 29 October 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 901-05, I made a statement to the House setting out in some detail the Government's plan for the future structure of the magistrates courts service. As part of that statement, I made clear my commitment to the concept of local justice dispensed through a locally administered magistrates courts service. We will shortly be embarking upon a joint working group with the service and local authorities which will examine the financial and legal relationship between them, define their relative responsibilities and enable the close local relationship which is already in evidence to develop further.

<P>
<a name="80126w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I am pleased to confirm the answer I gave to the question of the hon. Member for Hendon on 19 January that the preparations for implementation of the civil justice reforms in April 1999 are indeed progressing as planned. For example, draft rules for the fast and multi-tracks, revised in the light of responses to the consultation paper issued last year, will be considered by the Rule Committee this month. A similar exercise will follow the closure of consultation on the small claims procedures at the end of this month. Further details can be obtained from the Department's bulletin, "Implementing the Civil Justice Reforms", a copy of which has been placed in the Library.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department on what date his Department's proposals to introduce the legal aid changes announced by the Lord Chancellor on 18 October 1997 will come into effect. [25340]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 When my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor announced on 18 October 1997 the Government's proposals for reform of the legal aid system, he indicated his determination to consult widely before reaching any final decisions. We have received a large number of representations, each of which is being carefully considered. We intend to complete this consultation before implementing any changes.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 Guidance to local planning authorities in respect of the provision of permanent sites for gipsies in their development plans is set out in Welsh Office Circular 2/94 and in Planning Guidance (Wales) Planning Policy. Local authorities no longer have a statutory duty to provide sites for gipsies, but should have regard to gipsies' accommodation needs in drawing up their development plans. The definition of "gipsies" is contained in Welsh Officer Circular 76/94 and excludes those persons who move from place to place without any connection between their movement and their means of livelihood.

 My appointment of my hon.

I am committed to fostering an integrated approach so that there is improved co-ordination across the wide-range of agricultural, environmental and economic policies which affect the interests and well-being of rural communities. I have also initiated discussions with both farming unions in Wales to discuss these matters.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate he has made of the number of deaths caused in each of the last 10 years by drivers who had consumed at least one alcoholic drink in the 12 hours prior to an accident but who had a blood alcohol limit lower than the legal limit at the time of accident. [22821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 This information is not available in the form requested.
<P>

<a name="80126w02.html_para2">When drivers are breath-tested and found to be within the legal limit their precise breath or blood alcohol content is not normally measured, so no information about their alcohol consumption, if any, is available. It is known that some drivers with blood alcohol below the legal limit, including drivers who cause a death, are prosecuted and convicted of "under the influence" drinking-driving offences, but no estimate can be made of the number of fatalities.
<P>

<a name="80126w02.html_para3">Where a driver has been killed in a road accident the driver's blood alcohol level may be taken in post mortem examinations on behalf of Coroners and Procurators Fiscal. Figures based on these reports are given in the table. They have been adjusted for under-reporting and include the estimated number of persons other than the driver to have been killed in the accidents concerned. 1995 is the latest year for which sufficient information is currently available.
<P>

<a name="80126w02.html_para4">These figures do not show when alcohol was last consumed by the drivers in these accidents, nor whether the presence of alcohol played any role in causing or aggravating the accidents. Other things being equal, the lower the concentration of alcohol, the less likely it is the alcohol was the cause of the accident.
<P>

<a name="80126w02.html_para5">Accidents where the driver had a blood alcohol concentration below 10mg/100ml are not included in this table because below that level, measurement is unreliable and may indicate natural fermentation rather than consumption of alcohol.

 It will generally be for local authorities to decide how to reflect environmental sustainability in their performance targets for the different services under the proposed best value regime, following consultation with the local community and in the light of their progress in drawing up Local Agenda 21 strategies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w03.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The effectiveness of the "home zone" signs used in some EU member states depends on drivers observing very low speed limits (and being conditioned to give way to pedestrians). My Department has been working with local authorities on schemes and studies to reduce vehicle speeds in residential streets and shopping areas. Our experience in this country so far has been that signs by themselves do not reduce vehicle speeds to 20mph or below, and that other self-enforcing measures are needed. We have no plans at present to change primary legislation to introduce home zones but we think there is scope within the current legislation for further speed reducing measures to be applied.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Kyoto Protocol set a legally-binding target for the European Union of an 8 per cent. overall reduction in the emissions of six greenhouse gases between 2008 and 2012, compared with 1990. Under our Presidency of the European Union we aim to share out this target between Member States, and to take forward proposals for common and co-ordinated policies and measures. Our priority within the UK will then be to ensure that we achieve our legally binding target.
<P>

<a name="80126w03.html_para1">We have already taken action to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Chancellor announced in the July Budget, that the real increase in fuel duty would be raised to 6 per cent., a year. Later this year we will be consulting on a programme of policies and measures to meet our legally binding target and launch a national debate on moving towards our domestic aim of a 20 per cent. cut in emissions.

 None. Following very careful consideration of all the relevant issues considered by the Inspector to the UDP Inquiry, the Secretary of State decided not to object to the proposals to delete land from the Green Belt for the Northern Development Area. I understand that Newcastle City Council resolved to adopt their plan on 21 January.
<P>

<a name="80126w03.html_para2">Key factors which were taken into account in reaching this decision included the City Council's proposal to accommodate 76 per cent. of its housing requirements within the existing built up area and the fact that the Inspector accepted that further development in the built up area would lead to town cramming. In addition, the Inspector found that a continuation of population dispersal from Newcastle to Northumberland and North Tyneside would be less sustainable than the proposed development which lies less than 5km from the city centre and can be readily linked to the public transport network.

<P>
<a name="80126w03.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 It would not be appropriate for the Secretary of State to do so in view of his quasi-judicial role in the planning system. However, there are well-established procedures in place which allow individuals and organisations to make full representations on development proposals at all stages of the planning process. I understand that the issues of the effect of the proposed Northern Development Area on development elsewhere in the local authority area have already been examined in public before an independent planning inspector in the context of Newcastle upon Tyne Unitary Development Plan Public Inquiry.

 In 1997-98, we estimate that &#163;1,228.6 million of notional Housing Revenue Account surpluses will be used to meet the cost of rent rebates granted by housing authorities in England. In the same year, we estimate that 1,038,873 council tenants will not be granted rent rebates, and will therefore pay full rent.

<a name="80126w04.html_para2">The full amount of a tenant's rent, irrespective of whether he or she is granted a rebate, is a credit to the Housing Revenue Account and contributes towards any notional rental surplus.

 Central door locking has appreciably reduced the risk of accidents caused by passengers boarding and alighting from trains when it would be unsafe to do so.

 Aircraft used for parachuting are subject to the same noise certification requirements as comparable aircraft used for other purposes. Depending on local airspace constraints and the location of drop zones, the need for the aircraft to climb over a limited area can be a source of nuisance to those below. Aerodromes and aircraft operators should plan their routes, procedures and activities so as to minimise noise nuisance; subject always to the overriding requirements of safety.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked me as Chief Executive of the Training and Employment Agency to reply to your questions about the New Deal and the recent consultation on long term unemployment in Northern Ireland.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>No 22735</i><i></i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Northern Ireland has been allocated &#163;140 million from the &#163;3.5 billion being raised from the Windfall levy to fund the New Deals for young people and the long term unemployed. We estimate that 13,000 young people will enter the Gateway in the first full year of operation beginning in April this year, of which 7,000 are likely to take up one of the four New Deal options. Provision is also being made for a further 3,000 young people in the New Deal age category who would otherwise have benefited from existing training and employment programmes. Resource transfers for the latter will be made from existing programmes during 1998/99. In addition we estimate that approximately 3,000 people aged over 25 and unemployed for more than 2 years will be eligible for subsided employment.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The allocation for the New Deal for the disabled has yet to be apportioned. The allocation for Lone Parents is mentioned below.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>No. 22743</i><i></i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Work on the review of long-term unemployment was temporarily overtaken during the Autumn by the overriding priority of the New Deal. We have been examining how existing programmes for the long term unemployed could be best aligned with the New Deal while taking account of the outcome of last year's consultation exercise. I expect an announcement will be made shortly on the future shape of existing programmes and services.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>No. 22744</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An additional &#163;9 million has been allocated to Northern Ireland to fund the New Deal for Lone Parents. From April this year, Lone Parents making a first-time claim for Income Support and whose youngest child is of school age will be offered advice and support to overcome the barriers preventing them from taking up employment. All other Lone Parents will be able to avail of this opportunity from October 1998. Personal Advisers will help Lone Parents to identify suitable after-school childcare services, advise them on in-work benefits and where appropriate, arrange pre-employment training as well as providing an in-work support service to ease the transition from Welfare to Work. Similar opportunities for the sick and disabled who are able to take up employment will mirror the arrangements in Great Britain. We will ensure that the launch of this initiative in Northern Ireland will coincide with national implementation.

<a name="80126w07.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Godman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland when she expects to respond to the recommendations of the Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights report on Fair Employment and Equality Review; and if she will make a statement. [22738]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Worthington: </B> 
 The Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights has provided a major report on employment equality which includes over 160 recommendations. Following consultation with those who would be directly affected by SACHR's recommendations, the Government's consideration of the recommendations is well advanced and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has already indicated certain recommendations on which the Government propose to take action--clarification of the law on direct recruitment of the long-term unemployed and firmer powers against persistent discriminators. The Government will give a response to the full range of SACHR's proposals in a paper to be published early this year. Those recommendations which are accepted by the Government will be implemented as appropriate.

<P>
<a name="80126w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B>

<P>
<a name="80126w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The original requirement for Trident was drawn up at the height of the Cold War based on 16 Trident C4 missiles on each submarine capable of carrying a total of 128 warheads. The previous Government announced in 1994 that they would not deploy more than 96 warheads on each Trident submarine. We are considering future warhead requirements in the Strategic Defence Review.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 The Trident missile system is inherently more accurate than Polaris reflecting technological advances in missile system design. The greater accuracy of Trident has allowed us to plan on our Trident force also undertaking the sub-strategic role allowing the withdrawal of our air delivered WE-177 nuclear bombs without replacement. Details of the performance of Trident are covered by exemption 1 of the code of practice on access to government information relating to defence, security and international relations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the relative capability of the anti-missile defence technology employed in the Trident D5 missile system against that of Polaris/ Chevaline. [24597]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Chevaline and Trident utilised different technologies to overcome anti-ballistic missile systems precluding direct comparisons. We are satisfied that Trident could meet any foreseeable requirements against such systems.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will make a statement on the range of the Trident D5 missile system as deployed by the United Kingdom relative to that of the Polaris system. [24595]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w08.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Polaris missiles had a range of up to 2,500 miles. The maximum range of the Trident D5 missile is in the region of 6,000 miles. The additional range of the Trident missile ensures that our strategic submarines can operate within a wider area and are therefore less vulnerable to detection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 Assessments of our deterrence requirements take into account a range of factors that might affect the destructive effect that would result from the use of a nuclear weapon, including the explosive yield.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 By the end of the 1960s, we assess the Russian strategic ballistic missile force comprised (approximately) 1,050 single warhead Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) with a total yield of 1,380 megatonnes (Mt), and 215 single warhead Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missiles (SLBMs) with a total yield of 395 Mt. The total explosive yield of both was 1,775 Mt.
<P>

<a name="80126w09.html_para0">By contrast, in 1997, the Russian strategic ballistic missile force comprised (approximately) 755 ICBMs with single and multiple (3,580) warheads giving a total yield of 2,330 Mt, and 524 SLBMs with multiple (2,314) warheads giving a total yield of 670 Mt.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the aims of Club of Three; what was the United Kingdom's financial contribution to the meeting of September last, and what arrangements have been made for the projected London meeting of mid-1998.

<a name="80126w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 The Club of Three is an informal private gathering, not a governmental or intergovernmental organisation. It would not therefore be appropriate for me to make a statement on its aims. We did not make a financial contribution to the meeting in September 1997. The arrangements for meetings are a matter for the organisers.

 As my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 11 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i> column <i>636</i>, the Government have considered the five-year television licence fee formula announced by the previous Government in December 1996, and have concluded that it remains appropriate. The formula, based on advice from independent consultants, provides for cumulative fee increases of just below RPI for the five years from April 1997. The RPI-linkage in individual

<a name="80126w10.html_para1">The Government's Agreement with the BBC provides for a review of the arrangements for funding the BBC after 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w10.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Fisher: </B> 
 Departments are responsible for their own building programmes and will recognise that good design brings hard economic benefits in better use of space and in low energy and maintenance costs. Well-designed buildings contribute to the public realm and improve the quality of our lives. The main commissioning bodies meet in the Government Construction Clients Panel to share their experience on all aspects of becoming better clients. My colleagues have agreed that this and other review bodies must take account of design quality as a factor in achieving value for money.

 The Government have made it clear in the White Paper "The People's Lottery" that they intend that Lottery money should be used increasingly to focus on people--and in the arts on revenue support for the art and artists--rather than buildings and capital developments.

 If HMS Cavalier were to be exported from the UK it would first require an export licence from the Department of Trade and Industry.

It is not yet clear whether the vessel requires an export licence from my Department since there is no firm value for the ship. Whether or not licences have been applied for is commercially

<a name="80126w11.html_para3">It is difficult to be precise about the extent to which rising figures may be partly due to the increasing willingness among ethnic minority communities to report these incidents and an increasing confidence that the police take these matters seriously. Police forces are also taking steps to increase the reporting rate of racial incidents taking place and to discover when and where they are taking place and on whom. Such developments are also likely to be influencing both public confidence and the number of offenders reported.

<a name="80126w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Information on the assessment of severity is provided in the Guidance on the Operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, sections 4.4 to 4.20. Section 4.11 states that:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Procedures will be regarded as being of substantial severity if they result in a major departure from the animals' usual state of health or well-being. These are likely to include acute toxicity procedures where significant morbidity or death is an endpoint; some efficacy tests of antimicrobial agents and vaccines; some models of disease and major surgery where significant post-operative suffering may result".</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="80126w11.html_para5">The assessment of severity is a complex matter, as it involves not only the type of procedure involved but the effect of any measures that can be taken to reduce suffering--the use of analgesics or anaesthesia, for example.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what has been the total paid out to date in compensation under the terms of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 compensation scheme; what are the projections for future expenditure; and what additional compensation will be given to those whose payments have been delayed. [24511]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 As at 16 January, &#163;30.3 million had been paid. The estimate for the total cost of the compensation schemes under the two 1997 Acts, including administration costs, is &#163;166 million. No payments have been "delayed". It has been made clear from the start that the size and complexity of the compensation arrangements would make this a long process and this Government, like the previous Government, argued in the debates that no guarantees could be given that payments would be made within a particular timescale. The House accepted that position, and accordingly there are no arrangements in the schemes for the payment of additional sums if claims are not settled within a given time.
Everything possible is being done to process claims in the shortest possible time. Weekend overtime is being worked, casual staff have been appointed and data processing staff have been introduced to enter the payment details on to the computer system, allowing the trained examiners more time to spend on processing the claims.
We can understand the impatience of those awaiting settlement of their claims, but the position is not helped by the volume of inquiries pressing for early payment, which simply divert staff from their primary task of processing claims, thereby hampering the efforts to reduce turn-round times.

Arrangements for the surrender of small-calibre pistols during February are well advanced and by now most certificate holders and dealers will have received details about where and when to hand in their firearms. There are no plans to defer the surrender period. There is no reason to do so and it would cause massive confusion for the police, for shooters and for the general public.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the role of special constables. [24583]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Special constables are unpaid volunteers who serve as police officers in their spare time. They are fully trained and have the same powers as a regular constable.
<P>

<a name="80126w12.html_para0">The Special Constabulary exist to assist the work of regular officers, not to replace them. They are an additional resource, which also encourage the public to get involved in tackling crime. Special constables are principally deployed on foot patrol, providing a higher visibility on the streets, but they also undertake a wide variety of policing duties.
<P>

<a name="80126w12.html_para1">The Government fully value the contribution made by these men and women who give up their free time for the benefit of their communities. They play an important role in the partnership between the police and the public in the fight against crime. Building on that partnership is fundamental to the Government's proposals for joint action by police and local authorities in reducing crime and disorder. We are taking forward the recommendations of the Special Constabulary Working Group to improve conditions of service, training and the equipment of special constables.
<P>

<a name="80126w12.html_para2">12-19 January was also dedicated as "Specials Week" and I visited police forces around the country raising the profile of special constables and encouraging people to volunteer. During "Specials Week", I visited projects in South Yorkshire, Cleveland, Hampshire, Essex, Northamptonshire, Greater Manchester, Gloucestershire and South Wales. I also took part in a recruitment seminar held by Cumbria Constabulary via video link. This launched a three-month long advertising campaign to promote the Special Constabulary. At each event, I was impressed by the demeanour of the Special Constabulary and the very positive relationship they enjoy with regular police officers.

 The Institute of Criminology at Cambridge has been carrying out an assessment of the experimental regime at Colchester YOI. Preliminary results show that the regime can have a positive effect upon the attitudes of young offenders but do not prove that it deters young offenders from reoffending. However, the test of the effectiveness of the regime will not be known until the recidivism rate on all those who have been released from Colchester is known and cannot be fully known until a considerable period of time has elapsed.

<a name="80126w15.html_para1">Inward investment activities were not the principal purpose of my visit, the first visit by a cabinet minister to China since the handover of Hong Kong last June. At the invitation of the Chinese government, I chaired a meeting of the Joint Economic Commission with the Chinese Minister for Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation. I also met with other senior Chinese ministers including Premier Li Peng and launched a major new initiative, "Britain in China 1998", which will raise awareness of what Britain can offer China. I was accompanied on the visit by a team of senior business people from UK power, aerospace and chemical sectors.

<a name="80126w15.html_para2">During my recent visit to China I also addressed audiences at inward investment seminars held in Beijing and Shanghai. Both seminars were chaired by Adair Turner of the CBI. These events, organised by the Invest in Britain Bureau (IBB) with the full support and encouragement of the Chinese government, form part of IBB's annual overseas promotional programme to promote the advantages of a UK location for manufacturing investment. The seminars in China, a new market for IBB, are a long term initiative aimed at raising awareness of the opportunities which the UK offers as an investment location as and when business in China looks to increase its investment overseas.

<a name="80126w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1998]:</i> The work of the Nautical Almanac Office is carried out by the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) under contract to the Ministry of Defence. The Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) has confirmed that all the current contracts held by the RGO will be honoured. PPARC is discussing the future of this work with the Ministry of Defence, and with other potential suppliers of the service to the MoD.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w15.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1998]:</i> I have asked the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council (PPARC) to explore every avenue for keeping the institution of the Royal Greenwich Observatory (RGO) alive. PPARC has declared itself satisfied that feasible options exist for a viable future for the RGO and is in the midst of detailed negotiations with interested parties over these options. These negotiations also cover the future of the current RGO staff, building and other assets.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will commission an independent assessment of the proposal made by the Royal Greenwich Observatory to the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council for its continuation as a company limited by guarantee. [24305]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 January 1998]:</i> At its meeting on 12 December 1997, the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council concluded that given the costs, uncertainties and associated risks it could not support the proposal to establish a Company Limited by Guarantee as a vehicle for continuing some of the current functions of the Royal Greenwich Observatory and developing a commercial business of telescope design and manufacture. The decision was taken on the basis of the advice offered by PPARC's Implementation Oversight Committee, members of an Audit Group (which included members of its Audit Committee), and its independent financial advisers and does not consider that any further assessment is necessary.

To ask the President of the Board of Trade what assessment she has made of the loss of protection afforded by law to copyright holders by computer developments with particular reference to digital copying and Internet Jukebox. [24805]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ian McCartney: </B> 
 United Kingdom copyright law, the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988, already gives copyright owners protection for uses of their works based on new technology. In particular, the rights to authorise reproduction conferred by the Act apply to digital copying as to other kinds, and the Act also grants rights enabling control over transmissions of music and sound recordings to members of the public on request, as are involved in "Internet jukebox" services. We do not consider, therefore, that recent developments in technology have led to a loss of protection for copyright owners in the UK. Comparable standards of protection overseas also need to be established, however, especially in view of the global nature of the Internet, and accordingly we support EU and international initiatives aimed at achieving this.

<P>
<a name="80126w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Provision of electricity from renewable sources is primarily supported through the Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO), funded by a fossil fuel levy placed on electricity consumers. At 31 December 1997, 221 NFFO renewable energy projects in England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland were operational, comprising 507 MW of electricity generating capacity. My policy proposals for a fifth (NFFO-5) Renewals Order for England and Wales were announced in November last year and I expect to make a NFFO-5 Order towards the end of 1998.

 <i>[holding answer 22 January 1998]:</i> Human biotechnology research promises many benefits but can also raise questions of safety and ethics, as can other new technologies. The Government have in place a thorough system of controls to maintain human biotechnology research, including that involving genetic modification, within acceptable boundaries. A framework of expert committees, such as the Gene Therapy Advisory Committee, the UK Xenotransplantation Interim Regulatory Authority, and the Human Genetics Advisory Commission (HGAC), consider implications of new research.

 <i>[holding answer 22 January 1998]:</i> On 1 January this year, legislation came into force which liberalised telecommunicatins services within the European Union. Our experience on international routes where competition is already allowed has shown that prices can fall considerably--for example between the UK and US, consumers are now being offered calls at as little as 5p a minute. On that basis if there is effective competition and regulation throughout Europe, there is every reason to believe that it should be little or no more expensive to call the rest of Europe than to make a local call in the UK today.

 The repairs and refurbishment of No. 11 Downing Street are part of a continuing programme of work to Nos. 10 and 11, covering the domestic accommodation, the offices and the public rooms. Both buildings are Grade 1 listed and, given their historic role, have to be kept at standards appropriate to such buildings, as laid down by the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, in consultation with Westminster City Council and English Heritage as appropriate.

<a name="80126w18.html_para5">Over the past five years, the total expenditure on No. 10 and No. 11 combined has been respectively &#163;118,000 in 1993-94; &#163;108,000 in 1994-95; &#163;381,000 in 1995-96; &#163;190,000 in 1996-97; and &#163;126,000 in 1997-98. Over this period &#163;155,000 has been spent on the flat in No. 10 and &#163;105,000 on the flat in No. 11. This has included the reconstruction of kitchens in No. 10 and No. 11, redecoration of parts of the flats as part of the rolling programme of refurbishment, rewiring, scaffolding costs, the cost of removing debris, and additional security costs. Both work schedules have been designed to refurbish parts of Nos. 10 and 11, some of which had remained untouched for over 30 years, and in the case of No. 11 to accommodate the fact that previously unused rooms are now used as family bedrooms.
<P>

<a name="80126w18.html_para6">In every case proper tendering procedures were followed. For security reasons it has not been the practice to name companies who work in Downing Street, but there has been no recent change to the existing list of approved contractors employed on the accommodation work in Nos. 10 and 11.

<a name="80126w18.html_para7">No country of origin for materials, fixtures or fittings was specified in the contracts awarded. The only requirement placed on contractors is that all materials, fixtures and fittings should meet current regulations and the performance specifications.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate he has made of the total cost of the Government's care in the community programme for 1998-99; and if he will make a statement. [25345]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is for health authorities to determine the resources that they allocate to care in the community provision from their overall allocation, in the light of the priority accorded to mental health services in the National Health Service Priorities and Planning Guidance 1998/99 and local circumstances. Similarly, it is for local authorities to determine the level of funding they allocate to services for mentally ill people from their total resources.
<P>

<a name="80126w20.html_para0">In recognition of the importance which the Government place on mental health, we have increased the Mental Illness Specific Grant by 9 per cent. to &#163;73.3 million for 1998-99.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w20.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The policy of care in the community has failed to realise the benefits held out to all at the time of its introduction. The majority of people with mental illness have benefited but for a significant number the necessary level of support has not been delivered. This has threatened both the safety of those vulnerable individuals and, on occasions, the public. We want to ensure that the full range of services are available to provide a balanced range of mental health services. This includes an appropriate mix of both hospital places and community support, including more 24 hour nursed care. Mentally ill people must be cared for in safety and security and we must rebuild public trust and confidence in mental health services.
<P>

<a name="80126w20.html_para2">We have set up an Independent Reference Group to advise us. Its first task is to consider long stay psychiatric hospital closure plans to ensure that no more hospitals are closed without proper and credible alternative services being in place.

If no income was raised from fares then all existing operating costs would have to be met by subsidy. In the longer term, the provision of ferry services free of charge to customers could be expected to lead to a substantial increase in demand, with the consequential problems of capacity

 No such general guidelines have been issued.

<a name="80126w21.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 Scottish Hospitals appreciate that professional education and training, including that of orthoptists, provided by Scottish universities is of the highest standard and so would wish to recruit graduates trained in Scotland. But it is for the Council for the Professions Supplementary to Medicine to ensure that orthoptists working in the United Kingdom are competent to practice whereever they train. Also, while it would seem probable that graduates from Scottish universities are more likely to seek initial employment within rather than outwith Scotland, many students who have studied in Scottish universities but who are not domiciled in Scotland return home on graduation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will publish the criteria which he applies for the purpose of establishing whether or not agriculture enterprises are separate businesses to determine their eligibility for assistance under IACS. [25420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. MacDonald: </B> 
 The criteria used by The Scottish Office are as follows.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>IACS Separate Businesses: Criteria for Separateness
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Background</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>1. The Scottish Office Agriculture, Environment and Fisheries Department and other UK Departments have to be able to demonstrate to the European Commission and other auditors that all the IACS rules are being followed. This is a matter of complying with Community law and non-compliance can lead to costly expenditure disallowance penalties.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>2. The criteria for determining whether businesses are separate for IACS purposes have been developed on the basis of the definitions of "farmer" and "holding" contained in Article 1(4) of Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3508/92. In effect, an applicant under any of the main agricultural schemes, who may be an individual or a legal person, or a group of individuals or legal persons (regardless of the legal status of the group and its members), must submit a single Area Aid Application (AAA) for all the production units managed by <i>him</i> and within the UK. In other words, all land managed as one business, whatever the legal structure of the business, should be covered by one AAA. The criteria for 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>26 Jan 1998 : Column: 80</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>establishing whether one business is separate from another have been published in the annual IACS explanatory booklets which have been distributed to farmers each year since 1993.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>3. In order to form an assessment the practice is to consider four aspects of the way the business is run, namely--legal status, economic structure/organisation, commercial management and operational management. As indicated by the IACS explanatory booklets, no single aspect is paramount and it is the balance of factors which counts. Each case is therefore examined on its own merits to form a balanced judgement. The EC have subsequently endorsed the criteria.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Legal Status</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>4. If two or more businesses are to qualify as separate for IACS purposes, it will normally be required that each should have a distinct legal status, e.g. sole trader, partnership company etc. However, satisfying this requirement is not in itself sufficient to establish separateness, since businesses which are legally separate may still be regarded as operating together as a group (see paragraph 2 above). Similarly failing to meet this requirement is not in itself sufficient to be deemed to be one. Whether or not this is so can only be determined on consideration of the other three criteria.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Economic Structure</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5. In considering the economic structure of a number of legally separate businesses in which certain individuals (or legal persons) have an interest, it is necessary to take account of:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5.1 the share holding or the partnership interest or voting rights of the directors, shareholders, partners, individuals (or legal persons) involved in the businesses;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5.2 who benefits from the profits/suffers any losses relating to the businesses.;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>5.3 who has ultimate responsibility for making the longer term policy decisions that affect the profitability of each business.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="80126w22.html_para0">
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where necessary documentary evidence of the above will be sought e.g. partnership agreements. Where the same individuals (or legal persons)--
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) have a large majority shareholding or interest in, or
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(b) benefit from the profits or suffer the losses of,
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the business concerned, this may indicate that the businesses should be considered as economically one business for IACS purposes. However, the commercial and operational structure will still be carefully examined and taken into account.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where no particular individuals (or legal persons) are dominant in these respects throughout the businesses concerned, then it is likely that the businesses would be considered separate for IACS purposes. Again, however, the commercial and operational structure will be taken into account before a determination is made.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Commercial Structure</i><i></i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6. In considering the commercial structure of the businesses, which, though legally separate, may fall to be treated as one, it is necessary to ascertain:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6.1 whether those with day-to-day management responsibility have complete discretion to buy or sell, whenever they choose;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6.2 who has day-to-day management responsibility for running each business, and, in some cases, the extent of their authority;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6.3 whether there are transactions for goods or services between the business and whether they are carried out at commercial rates (evidence of sales invoices/contracts may be required);
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6.4 whether there is any evidence of cross subsidisation between the businesses;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>6.5 whether the businesses have separate accounts, sales contracts, tax and VAT status.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Business are unlikely to be commercially separate for IACS purposes where:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there is an overlap in the way in which the businesses are managed;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>those who have responsibility for running the businesses on day-to-day basis, lack of commercial independence;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>26 Jan 1998 : Column: 81</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>transactions of goods between the businesses are not accounted for in a way which would be expected from independent businesses;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there is a lack of sound financial arrangements, which an independent agricultural business would be expected to have in place--e.g. itemised invoicing, and arrangements for invoicing and payment in good time;
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>there is a lack of basic structures, which would be expected in running free-standing agricultural businesses--e.g. proper accounts, separate herd marks, separate land etc.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Operational Structure</i>
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>7. It is necessary to consider the degree of operational separateness of cropping, stocking, machinery, labour, buildings and livestock housing, whether each legally separate enterprise has such things as its own supplies of food, fertiliser and land for grazing, livestock records, farm plans, registration and herd marks.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Where businesses have very closely linked operational arrangements i.e.:
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>regular movement of stock almost exclusively between the farms comprised in the business, and the dependence of one farm on another for overwintering or grazing, beyond what would be common elsewhere in the locality;

Please note that it is a requirement in particular under Article 2(2) of Commission Regulation (EEC) No 3887/92 to ensure that the conversion of existing holdings or the creation of holdings after 30 June 1992 does not lead to the patently improper avoidance of the provisions relating to individuals' limits on eligibility for premiums or land set-aside requirements imposed under the main agricultural schemes.</FONT></UL>

 The residence eligibility criteria under the new student support arrangements will remain the same as under the existing schemes. The responsible award making body is determined primarily by a student's place of ordinary residence on 30 June of the year in which he or she starts the course. A period of residence wholly or mainly for the purpose of full-time education is not regarded as ordinary residence. Where a student changes to a different course of higher education during the academic year, or in the immediately following academic year, the responsibility for considering assistance for the new course remains with the original award making body.

<a name="80126w22.html_para1">The British Government and other United Kingdom organisations provide a number of scholarships and awards to help international students to study in the UK. The main schemes are described in a booklet produced in 1997 by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, UKCOSA (The Council for International Education) and The British Council called, "Studying in the UK, Sources of funding for international students" a copy of which has been placed in the Library. In particular, the Commonwealth Scholarship and Fellowship Plan, funded by the Department for International Development (DfID) and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), assists academically able students from Commonwealth countries to study in the UK. DfID also supports students from developing countries attending UK universities under Technical Co-operation Training arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w23.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Humanities Research Board's (HRB's) policy is to allocate postgraduate awards through an annual competition. It does not allocate quotas of awards to specific institutions, courses, age groups or subjects. Rather, all applications are assessed and graded, and awards made down a list of rank order candidates until available funds are exhausted.
<P>

<a name="80126w23.html_para1">Applications are submitted on students' behalf by the institutions at which they intend to study and are assessed by panels of senior academic staff in the relevant subject areas. Panel members are drawn from universities across the country and serve for a term of three years. In assessing applications, they take account of candidates' performance in examinations at first degree level; candidates' statements about their intended programme of study or research and their reasons for undertaking it; referees' reports and, where appropriate, reports on candidates' performance on postgraduate-level courses; and information provided by institutions about supervision arrangements, and the training and support it will provide. The Board's expectation is that applicants should normally have completed an initial year of postgraduate study before embarking on a three-year programme of doctoral research.
<P>

<a name="80126w23.html_para2">With regard to mature students, the HRB monitors only those applicants who are aged 40 or over at the date of application. The percentage of awards offered to such applicants is shown in the table.

 Students who hold mandatory awards for a sandwich course are not normally eligible for maintenance support during their placements.

Where students have unpaid placements in many parts of the public service they exceptionally continue to be eligible for means-tested maintenance support as part of their award in substitution for payment by the employer. Students in either category who are unable to find placements are not eligible for maintenance support unless their institution is able to make suitable alternative provision for them.
<P>

<a name="80126w24.html_para0">Students on sandwich courses can apply for the appropriate rate of loan in any year in which there is a placement where the student and the course are eligible for loans.

 Although primarily designed for young people without N/SVQ 2 or equivalent level qualifications, the Full-Time Education and Training option of the New Deal for 18 to 24 year olds also allows some young people to study towards a Level 3 qualification, where there is a clear link between achievement of the qualification and increased employability. The cost will depend on the bids by education and training providers.

 We are making a major investment to help young people move off welfare and find sustained employment, and to avoid as far as possible (for example through a follow-through strategy for people who return to JSA shortly after completing an option) the circumstances described. Any young person who found themselves in this position would of course have the right to further help from the New Deal.

 We have made provision for at least 10,000 additional opportunities, over the lifetime of this Parliament, for those aged 25 years or over, unemployed for two years or more, to undertake courses of full-time employment-related education and training for up to a year while receiving Jobseeker's Allowance.

<P>
<a name="80126w24.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will normally consider further education corporation mergers on the basis of a formal proposal from the Further Education Funding Council for England and following a statutory consultation process. He will consider each case on its merits. The Council assesses proposals against criteria which include educational and financial benefits, the likely success of the proposed reorganisation and the extent of consultation and the consideration given to alternative proposals. There are opportunities for the involvement of staff and local communities during preliminary consultations conducted locally and then following the formal issue of statutory notices by the Council prior to the submission of the proposal to my right hon. Friend for a final decision.

<P>
<a name="80126w25.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 From 1998-99, new students on full-time higher education courses in veterinary and architecture studies will make a contribution to tuition fees of up to &#163;1,000, depending on income, for every year of their course. There is no equivalent to the Department of Health scheme for meeting tuition fee contributions of medical and dental students after the first four years of their course. This is because the Government cannot take responsibility for the supply of professionals such as vets and architects who are employed predominantly in the private sector. The student contribution to fees in any year is a small proportion of the total cost of tuition, the rest being met in England from the Department for Education and Employment grant to the Higher Education Funding Council.

<P>
<a name="80126w25.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 As at 2 November 1997 there were 111,900 people in training on Modern Apprenticeships, 58 per cent. of these were men and 42 per cent. were women.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w25.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Students who were unable to enter higher education in 1997 because their results were inadequate, but who have had those results upgraded on appeal and who will now be able to enter in 1998, will be treated as 1997 entrants for student support purposes. This means that they will have their tuition fees met for the duration of their course, and receive the current 50:50 grants and loans maintenance support.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w25.html_wqn7"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how university students' fees will be applied in the case of those students who were required to engage in a year's vocational work after A level, prior to consideration for entry to university, who were for that reason unable to secure admission offers for 1997-98. [23957]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w25.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Students who agreed a deferred entry place for autumn 1998 with their chosen university before 1 August 1997 prior to undertaking the required vocational work will not have to pay tuition fees for the duration of their course and will be subject to the existing grant and loan arrangements. Those applying after 1 August 1997 for places to start in autumn 1998 or later will be subject to the new tuition fee and maintenance arrangements being introduced in 1998.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if local authorities in England will be liable to pay fourth-year tuition fees for EU migrant workers resident within the boundaries of the local authority area, should they apply to a Scottish university; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government are firmly committed to promoting the local sourcing of food produce, particularly through their grant aid scheme for the establishment of regional groups of speciality producers and the practical assistance provided to these and other groups by Food From Britain.
<P>

<a name="80126w26.html_para0">I myself will shortly be opening the Food and Drink Expo 98 exhibition in Birmingham which will have a dedicated British speciality foods sector which is directly sponsored by FFB and MAFF. We have also ensured that food served in the VIP suite reflects regional foods.
<P>

<a name="80126w26.html_para1">Further, as part of his personal commitment to this sector, my noble Friend Lord Donoughue of Ashton has recently announced that he will refuse to stay at hotels which do not serve locally produced food and drink and has challenged other business travellers to do the same.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government objectives for the Common Agriculture Policy, as established under Articles 38-46 of the Treaty of Rome, are for reforms which provide a market oriented policy with less costly farm support decoupled from agricultural production; and more emphasis placed on targeted environmental and rural development objectives. Achieving these objectives does not require Treaty amendment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 It is Government policy to minimise the use of pesticides to that required for effective pest and disease control. This policy is pursued in a number of ways including a rigorous pesticide product approvals

process, a wide ranging R&D programme, and surveillance monitoring of pesticide residues in food. In addition, the Statutory Code of Practice for the Safe Use of Pesticides on Farms and Holdings, laid before this House on 12 January, will be published in March.
<P>

<a name="80126w26.html_para2">The Government are also reviewing the role that economic instruments such as charges or taxes might play in reducing the impact of pesticides and aims to give organic farming a higher priority.
<P>

<a name="80126w26.html_para3">Finally, the Government have given their full support to the recently established Pesticides Forum which, last August, published an Action Plan for encouraging responsible pesticide use, including plans to improve arrangements for technology transfer and promote techniques, such as integrated crop management, designed to minimise pesticide use.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment his Department has made of the presence of traces of DDT in <i>(a)</i> milk and <i>(b)</i> other dairy products imported from New Zealand. [24451]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Milk is not normally imported into the United Kingdom from New Zealand. However, in 1993 and 1996 the surveillance programme of the Working Party on Pesticide Residues included butter imported from New Zealand. Residues of DDT at very low levels were detected on both occasions, but there was no cause for concern from these findings and no exceedance of maximum residue levels (MRLs).
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w26.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Martyn Jones: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what research his Department has evaluated into the long-term effects of pesticide residues in food; and if he will make a statement. [24452]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 It is standard practice for the possible effects of each active ingredient used in pesticides and its residues in food to be assessed before products containing that active ingredient are approved for sale. This assessment is undertaken on the basis of extensive testing of the active ingredient in animals, including long-term testing at much higher doses than would occur in the food supply.
<P>

<a name="80126w26.html_para4">The results of assessments by Government scientists are reviewed by the independent Advisory Committee on Pesticides who advise Ministers in six UK Government Departments on the approval of pesticides. The Working Party on Pesticide Residues undertakes an annual surveillance programme to ensure that residues in food remain at acceptable levels.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to ensure that those farmers who have been excluded from requiring a certificate of competence before using pesticides now have such certificates; and if he will make a statement. [24454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 I propose to remove the age exemption to ensure that all users of agricultural pesticides are properly trained. This will require amendments to the Control of Pesticide Regulations 1986 (as amended) and the Plant Protection Products (Basic Conditions) Regulations 1997.
<P>

<a name="80126w26.html_para5">We shall be consulting interested parties on this and related matters.

<P>
<a name="80126w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B>

 The controls in place to prevent animals from entering the channel tunnel, which include fencing, video recording, routine surveillance by service personnel, deterrent lighting, and routine baiting for small animals are considered to be very effective anti-rabies precautions. No rabies susceptible animal has ever succeeded in passing through the tunnel. There have however been considerable operational problems with the electrified grids within the tunnel. We are pressing Eurotunnel to get the grids back in operation which is a legal requirement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Council Decision 97/413/EC concerning objectives and detailed rules for MAGP IV covers the period from 1 January 1997 to 31 December 2001. Article 9 provides for the European Commission to present a report by 30 March 1999 at the latest on the state and evolution of fish stocks and an assessment of the effects of structural, conservation, control and other policy measures on the state of the resources and on the sector. In the light of this the Council has until 30 December 1999 to decide on any necessary adjustments to the targets for fishing effort in the period from 1 January 2000 to 31 December 2001. Consideration of the position after 31 December 2001 has not yet been provided for.

 Concordats cannot be finalised until after the Scottish Parliament is elected in 1999. However, our officials and those of the Scottish Office are engaging in preparatory work on some of the possible administrative working arrangements that might apply in the agriculture, fisheries and food areas after devolution. The White Paper, "Scotland's Parliament", makes clear the Government's commitment to the development of mutual understandings covering the exchange of information, advance notification and joint working to facilitate good communication after devolution.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many non-United Kingdom nationals are currently practising in the United Kingdom as official veterinarians in abattoirs; what assessment he has made of their level of competence in the English language; and what tests are used to ensure that the level of language competence is adequate. [22829]<P>

<P>
<a name="80126w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) is responsible for Official Veterinary Surgeons (OVSs) working in abattoirs in Great Britain. Nine of the OVSs directly employed by the MHS are non-United Kingdom nationals. The Department of Agriculture is responsible for OVSs working in abattoirs in Northern Ireland. Three of its OVSs are non-United Kingdom nationals. In both cases, the selection process includes a formal interview during which communication skills must be demonstrated.
<P>

<a name="80126w27.html_para0">The MHS also contracts out OVS services to veterinary agencies and practices. Seventy-eight (out of 486) are non-United Kingdom nationals.
<P>

<a name="80126w27.html_para1">In liaison with the University of Bristol, the MHS is responsible for the management of the OVS training courses. The MHS has introduced an assessment for non-United Kingdom nationals to assess their ability to understand and communicate in English.

 The Government's new unilateral controls to ensure that certain food and feed products do not contain and were not derived from specified risk material (SRM) require products to be certified as such in their country of origin by national veterinary services. Products produced before 1 January and products derived from animals born, reared and slaughtered in Australia or New Zealand, provided they are certified as such, are not subject to the SRM-freedom requirements. All consignments imported into the UK from third countries are checked at designated Border Inspection Posts. EU Single Market rules permit random spot-checks only at destination. Consistent with those rules, a daily sample of randomly selected consignments from EU member states are checked for conformity with the new unilateral controls.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security by how much he estimates lone parents will be better off in work than on benefits following reform of their benefit entitlement. [23084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w29.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The latest independent research by the Policy Studies Institute suggest that the average additional income for lone parents already in work and on Family Credit is over &#163;50 a week above the estimate of their out-of-work income. No estimate is currently available for the likely impact on this figure of the changes to the Family Premium in the income-related benefits; changes to Child Benefit for lone parents; or the increase in the help available through the Childcare Disregard in the in-work benefits.

<P>
34. <a name="80126w29.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Chisholm: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what assessment she has made of the effect of lone-parent benefit reductions on the New Deal for Lone Parents. [23085]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The evaluation of the New Deal for Lone Parents will identify any points which have affected the programme's success. We need to keep these benefit changes in perspective.

gain, which the New Deal for Lone Parents can provide. The Government do not believe that the benefit changes will stop lone parents from moving into work.
<P>

<a name="80126w29.html_para1">The changes will apply only to lone parents making new benefit claims. In order to preserve work incentives for most current claimants, lone parents who are receiving Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance with the lone parent rate of family premium will be able to claim the lone parent rate of Child Benefit when they move into work.
<P>

<a name="80126w29.html_para2">We are addressing the real barriers to work with the New Deal for Lone Parents and the National Childcare Strategy.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w29.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Rooney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if the lone parent premium of an income support claimant will be protected if the claimant participates in a waged option of the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds and then returns to benefit at the end of the option. [25556]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Lone parents can choose whether to claim Income Support or Jobseeker's Allowance. Those claiming Jobseeker's Allowance will have access to the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds. No specific protection has been built in to address these particular circumstances.
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w29.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Ballard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if she will list the numbers claiming lone parent benefits by <i>(a)</i> constituency and <i>(b)</i> benefit agency district office. [23525]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The administration of Social Security benefits is a matter for Peter Mathison, Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency. He will write to the hon. Member.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question asking for the numbers claiming lone parent benefits for your constituency and Benefit Agency (BA) District Office.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The information requested is not available in the format requested. The BA collates Income Support (IS) statistics by BA District Offices. These Districts do not correspond to constituency boundaries or specific geographical areas.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>From April 1997 the IS lone parent premium was replaced by the higher rate of family premium for lone parents. The available information is shown in the table. This information is the latest available, it is provisional and maybe subject to change. It does not include those lone parent customers who are pensioners nor those registered sick who qualify for a higher rate premium such as a pensioner or disability premium.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The data comes from the Department's Households Below Average Income (HBAI) series, based on the Family Resources Survey (FRS) for the 1995-96 financial year and covering Great Britain. The FRS data was used to achieve a large enough sample size to provide more robust information. All results are subject to sampling error.<P>

2. The income measure used in the answer is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income. The definition of income used follows that in the published HBAI series for FRS based results; figures are given both before and after housing costs in line with usual HBAI practice.<P>

3. The measure of income used covers household income. A household can include more than one benefit unit, for example, a household containing a pensioner and their grown-up child or two single unrelated people sharing a household. The estimates assume that all of the people within a household have the same standard of living.<P>

<P>
<a name="80126w30.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Disability benefits are included in the Department's Comprehensive Spending Review, which was announced on 11 June last year. The review is a first step in our plan to modernise and improve the Social Security system, so that it helps people to work as far as they are able; provides appropriate support to those who cannot work; and makes the most effective use of the resources available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w30.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are committed to modernising the Social Security system so that it helps people to work as far as they are able; provides appropriate support to those who cannot work; and makes the most effective use of resources available. We want to encourage people who are disabled, or who have long-term health problems, to play a full part in society and to help them to help themselves wherever that is possible. This means being positive about people's abilities and their capacity rather than negative about their disabilities and incapacity.

 It is estimated that 1 per cent. of Incapacity Benefit recipients undertake paid work on the grounds that it is therapeutic. Guidance to Benefits Agency offices about therapeutic work was last updated in April 1997. We are currently reviewing the information collected on benefit recipients undertaking therapeutic work and considering how this might be improved to provide a better picture of the effectiveness of current provisions.

<P>
<a name="80126w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government believe that work is the best form of welfare for people of working age, and have set aside &#163;195 million to fund a programme improving opportunities for people with disabilities or long-term illness who want to work. Disabled people who are entitled to Disability Living Allowance can receive the benefit and participate in a welfare-to-work scheme, or undertake other work, without affecting their entitlement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w30.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The vast majority of Disability Living Allowance appeals are heard by Disability Appeal Tribunals. In July 1997, the average time from date of appeal to date of decision-issue in an appeal heard by a Disability Appeal Tribunal was 30 weeks based on information provided by the Independent Tribunal Service. There are a few cases, however, which are heard by Social Security Appeal Tribunals and the average clearance time for these was 37.3 weeks for the quarter ending 30 September 1997 according to data provided from Departmental statistics. There are some difficulties with the robustness of the base data used for both sets of statistics. This is the best estimate available.
<P>

<a name="80126w30.html_para0">It is not possible to distinguish from available data whether the appeals are from applicants who have been refused Disability Living Allowance or are on other grounds such as the rate of benefit awarded.

<P>
<a name="80126w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Field: </B> 
 One of our key aims is to rebuild integrity in, and public support for, the Social Security system and the way in which public money is spent. Benefits should go to those who are properly entitled to benefit. This is why we have continued with the Benefit Integrity Project.
<P>

<a name="80126w30.html_para1">The latest estimated total cost of the benefit integrity project is nearly &#163;24 million over two years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80126w30.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are determined to make the benefit system more secure and to penalise those who set out to defraud the taxpayer. As a result we are re-examining the policy and objectives with regard to enforcement. For too long defrauding the benefit system has been seen as a low risk, low punishment option and very often the only punishment suffered by fraudsters was to have to repay the overpayment they had fraudulently obtained.
<P>

<a name="80126w30.html_para2">To ensure that more fraudsters face up to the consequences of their actions we have from 18 December 1997, under provisions in the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997, introduced administrative penalties. In future persons who fraudulently obtain benefit by deliberately falsifying or omitting information, may be offered the opportunity in addition to repayment of the overpayment, to pay a penalty set at 30 per cent. of the amount overpaid as an alternative to being prosecuted.
<P>

<a name="80126w30.html_para3">We will continue to prosecute cases through the criminal courts where serious or persistent fraud is involved, or where a penalty offer is declined.

2. The national earnings distribution is from the Labour Force Survey Spring 1996, with a lower quartile of &#163;70 per week, a median of &#163;149 per week and an upper quartile of &#163;240 per week. This is the earnings distribution at a point in time, and is not the distribution of earnings at the time of the individual's pregnancy.<P>

3. Figures are for Great Britain and are rounded to the nearest thousand.<P>

4. Weekly earnings are estimated from the amount of SMP during the tax year. This estimate is based on the SMP being paid for six weeks at 90 per cent. of pay and for 12 further weeks at the flat rate of SMP, and the whole period of SMP falling in one tax year.<P>

<a name="80126w31.html_para6">In the Council of Ministers we want to work with our EU partners to reach agreement on Social Security measures which will improve the mobility of the European Union's workers and support the Single Market. The proposed directive on supplementary pensions which is before the Council offers sensible measures to protect pension rights for employed and self-employed people who move within the EU to take up a job in another Member State. We will also be working towards agreement on ways to modernise and improve the long-standing rules that co-ordinate the interaction of member states' statutory Social Security schemes in support of the free movement of workers.
<P>

<a name="80126w31.html_para7">The theme of employability is central to the UK presidency and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security and Minister for Women will therefore be chairing a meeting of EU Ministers for Women to be held in Belfast on 5-6 May to specifically look at issues which affect Women's Employability. This puts women at the heart of the plans for the UK presidency. The theme will be "Employability and Women--the importance of Childcare" and the meeting will also consider the importance of family friendly employment. We look forward to being able to share with Member States the initiatives that we are taking forward here on family-friendly employment as well as the National Childcare Strategy. We also expect to gain new insights and ideas from other participating members. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security and my hon. Friend the Minister for Women will also address the Women's Rights Committee of the European Parliament on 2 February.

 The Department's Agencies are currently developing work programmes for 1998-99 which will support the Government's agenda for modernising service delivery by developing a more integrated and simple service across the range of benefits the Social Security system provides.

 The proposed changes to the rebates for Contracted-out money Purchase (COMP) schemes are designed to protect the National Insurance Fund (NIF) from occupational schemes switching their method of contracting-out solely to take advantage of the higher overall rebate available to COMP schemes. This switching means that more is paid out in rebates from the NIF than was originally intended. The changes will reduce that loss.
