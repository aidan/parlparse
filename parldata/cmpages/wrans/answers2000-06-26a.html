<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what recent representations he has received concerning the level of remuneration received by authors through public lending right.  [127824]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 I have seen the case for increased funding produced by the Public Lending Right Advisory Committee; I have also received around 160 letters, mainly from authors via their MPs. I am considering these representations carefully as part of the Department's current spending review.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what was the value of his Department's funding of public lending right in <i>(a)</i> 1983 and <i>(b)</i> 2000 in (i) cash and (ii) real terms.  [127828]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 Public Lending Right (PLR) received grant-in-aid funding of &#163;2 million in 1983-84, which would equal &#163;3.921 million in real terms. My Department provided funding of &#163;5.15 million for PLR in 2000-01.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proportion of library book withdrawals is represented by children's books; and if he will make a statement.  [127826]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 Information about the number of book withdrawals is not collected centrally. The annual CIPFA Public Library Statistics, which are held in the House Library and are likely to be available in the larger public library reference libraries, provide information about the total bookstock, including children's books, at 31 March each year. At 31 March 1999, children's bookstock was 19.3 million compared with 19.2 million at 31 March 1998.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what proportion of his departmental budget was spent on Public Lending Right in <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1998, <i>(c)</i> 1999 and <i>(d)</i> 2000.  [127827]<P>

<a name="00626w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how much Public Lending Right money was paid to authors of children's books in the last year for which figures are available; and what proportion this represented of total spending on Public Lending Right.  [127825]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 The Public Lending Right (PLR) computer system does not break down payments to authors by the type of book that they write. However, children's books represented 28 per cent. of registered books borrowed last year, an increase of 30 per cent. in the last ten years. It is therefore estimated that 28 per cent. of payments went to children's writers, which in the last payment round would have amounted to &#163;1.2 million--23 per cent. of the whole PLR fund.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what recent discussions he has had with the Chancellor of the Exchequer regarding the level of funding available for Public Lending Right payments.  [127823]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 We have no scope at present to raise further the allocation to Public Lending Right (PLR) beyond the increases already announced as part of PLR's current three-year funding agreement. However, we have agreed to consider the case for an increase in funding as part of our current Spending Review which will deal with funding for the next three years.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 To date, the Government have provided approximately &#163;450 million on export credit debt relief to the following countries, which are classified as Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC):

<a name="00626w01.html_para2">These countries, along with the rest of the HIPC countries, will have the majority of their debt cancelled when they qualify under the revised HIPC framework.

<a name="00626w01.html_para3">So far, Bolivia, Mauritania, Mozambique, Tanzania and Uganda have reached Decision Point, the first milestone under the enhanced HIPC framework at which debt relief starts to flow. Between them, these countries still owe the Export Credits Guarantee Department some &#163;140 million. This will be cancelled when they complete the HIPC process.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, pursuant to her answer of 23 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 408W, on sexual and reproductive health projects, what proportion of the UK bilateral aid contributions for reproductive health care for the years <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1998 and <i>(c)</i> 1999 were for (i) HIV/AIDS and (ii) family planning and reproductive health.  [127214]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 In many cases it is not practical to distinguish between the sexual and the reproductive health/family planning elements. There is also often no clear distinction between assisting with work in HIV/AIDS and in other sexual health issues. However, the following is an approximate breakdown of my Department's bilateral contributions to health/family planning and HIV/AIDS in 1997-99:

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how he identified the two million men aged 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jun 2000 : Column: 348W</I><P>
between 60 and 64 years whom he deemed likely to be newly eligible for winter fuel payments resulting from the European Court ruling.  [126875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w01.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We do not hold up to date records for all of those who do not receive any pension or benefit at the moment--especially men aged 60-64 who have no need to contact the Department. Therefore, to ensure that the right money is paid to the right person in respect of each year a Winter Fuel Payment is due, it was necessary to develop a claims process.
<P>

<a name="00626w01.html_para5">We wrote to around 24,000 people in April who had already registered their details with the Department, enclosing a claim form for completion. During May and early June we also wrote to around 1.7 million newly eligible people who we could identify through the departmental central index. Again, in each case we enclosed a claim form and invited a claim.
<P>

<a name="00626w01.html_para6">For those who we are not able to identify, our information and advertising campaign will continue to help ensure that they are fully aware of how to claim. In addition, people can download claim forms from the Department's own website www.dss.gov.uk or they can obtain claim forms on request from the Winter Fuel Payment helpline.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures, which are in 1999 earnings terms, are rounded to the nearest &#163; and may not sum as a result.<P>

2. The estimates are based on average earnings of (i) all full-time employees; (ii) all male full-time employees; and (iii) all female full-time employees (whose average earnings are 74 per cent. of the average earnings of male employees).<P>

3. The estimates are based on a person beginning work at 16 and working for 49 years until age 65.<P>

4. The estimates for stakeholder pension schemes are based on the amount of state scheme pension foregone, which determines the level of at which the National Insurance rebates are set by the 



Government Actuary's Department. However, when the State Second Pension becomes a flat-rate scheme for those who remain in it, the rebates will continue to be earnings-related, and so will be based on the state scheme pension which would be foregone if the scheme were fully earnings-related.<P>

5. The final amount from a funded stakeholder pension will depend on investment returns, market performance and annuity rates oat pensionable age, together with the value of any voluntary contributions. (Annuity rates for a rebate-only stakeholder pension will be the same for both men and women).<P>

6. The estimates are based on the Department's Lifepen model and the following assumptions:<P>

Stakeholder pensions state April 2001; State Second Pension starts April 2002; State Second Pension becomes flat-rate from April 2006; earnings grow 1.5 per cent. a year faster than prices; basic State pension is uprated in line with prices. <P>

 The Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe considered Recommendation 71 (1999), "Model Agreements on Transfrontier Co-operation in the Field of Nuclear Safety", at its meeting on 3 May. It concluded that nuclear power-related issues did not fall within the competence of the Council of Europe and that Model Agreements in this field should therefore not be appended to the European Outline Convention on Transfrontier Co-operation between Territorial Communities or Authorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if he will list the measures the Telecommunications Regulator has taken to reduce the cost of internet access.  [127630]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w02.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government believe that the best way to ensure sustainable lower costs for internet access is through promoting competition. Through measures such as the introduction of an effective Calls & Access product and Carrier Pre-Selection Oftel is promoting competition to drive down general call charges. For narrow band internet access Oftel has promoted greater flexibility in internet tariffing through the introduction of the Number Translation Service (NTS) formula that allowed the call origination charged to be shared with other operators who also carry the call. Oftel has recently made a determination that requires BT to provide a flat rate internet interconnection product to competing operators. Oftel has negotiated a range of schemes offering reduced price internet access for schools.
<P>

<a name="00626w02.html_para6">For broadband access, Oftel is requiring BT to open up its local loop to other operators so that they can compete in the provision of broadband access. Also, once BT has installed ADSL on local lines, it will be required to give other operators access to its upgraded system on non- discriminatory terms. A recent study produced for Oftel showed that of the five large markets studied the UK had on average the lowest prices for residential access at both peak and off-peak times.

 OIML publishes documents which mainly take the form of International Recommendations which cover many aspects of measurement of hydrocarbon oil bulk volume, and in particular Recommendation R117 covers Measuring Systems for Liquids other than Water. They do not lay down requirements for standard temperature measurement. They do (as appropriate to the context) specify provisions for conversion devices for temperature compensation. However, these are for optional application, as OIML member states may decide. They have not been made a requirement of weights and measures legislation in the UK.

 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2000]:</i> Expenditure on health per head of population for England from 1995-96 to 1998-99, and for each health authority area in England from 1996-97 to 1998-99, expressed in real terms, is shown in the tables. Information relating to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland is a matter for the devolved Administrations.
<P>

<a name="00626w04.html_para0">Information on a comparable basis is not available for England in 1979 and 1990 and by health authority area for 1979, 1990 and 1995-96.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what steps the Government are taking to increase the number of NHS dentists <i>(a)</i> nationally and <i>(b)</i> in the North-West; and if he will make a statement.  [127069]<P>

 There are currently 17,821 dentists working in the General Dental Services in England and 2,261 in the north west region, more than ever before. Problems have arisen because more dentists are devoting more time to private dental work, working part-time and there are some areas where dentists seem reluctant to practice. We have accepted the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body

recommendation for a commitment scheme rewarding loyalty to the National Health Service. The scheme will cost &#163;17 million per annum for England. The personal dental services pilot scheme, including dental access centres, is encouraging health authorities to be locally responsive and contribute to make NHS dentistry more widely available. Investing in dentistry saw &#163;10 million in grants given to NHS dentists in return for promises of up to 900,000 new NHS registrations. Further measures will be contained in our dental strategy, due to be published this summer.

 The Children Act 1989 was implemented in October 1991. However, although the Children Act 1989 changed the private and public functions of the civil law relating to the welfare of children, it did not change the criminal law in respect of offences against children.

However, "Child Protection: Messages from Research" (Department of Health, 1995) indicates that there are about 160,000 cases referred to social services departments per annum.

 For health care to be effective National Health Service commissioners will need to ensure that there are clear pathways to provide a continuity of care taking patients from childhood, into adolescence and beyond. This is particularly important in chronic conditions such as cystic fibrosis which have benefited from advances in medical science and where patients now survive into adulthood.

 Patients with cystic fibrosis and conditions resulting from cystic fibrosis have access to an extensive range of diagnostic and remedial resources both in hospitals and in primary care. For some treatments patients may need access to specialist skills or equipment that are best provided in a smaller number of centres where clinicians can regularly see a large number of patients. In these circumstances patients may need to travel to gain access to that expertise. The Hospital Travel Costs Scheme, which is part of the National Health Service Low Income Scheme, is available to assist those who are in receipt of a qualifying benefit.

 The information given by Advanta, at their meeting with officials from my Department and MAFF, on 17 April was extremely sketchy.

They did not at that stage know for sure whether a GM had been involved, or which GM it was, or which seed batches had been affected, to which countries those seed batches had been dispatched, or in which years. Advanta informed my Department at that time that they were initiating urgent inquires. However, it took until 10 May to obtain sufficient information, particularly on which GM was involved to be able to provide ACRE with a basis for their decision, and in some respects the investigation is still going on.

 The Government's draft climate change programme includes a new policy statement on HFCs because they are powerful greenhouse gases and are included in the basket of gases controlled under the Kyoto Protocol.

 My Department compiles and publishes an annual inventory of UK greenhouse gas emissions by sources and removals by sinks to fulfil international reporting requirements of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the European Union Monitoring Mechanism. Separate greenhouse gas inventories are also published for England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. The inventories are produced according to guidelines published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and conform to internationally agreed good practice.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for <i>(a)</i> Scotland, <i>(b)</i> England and Wales and <i>(c)</i> the UK the changes in the levels of production of the six greenhouse gases in each year since 1990; and what the forecast reduction is for the following 10 years.  [127148]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 UK emissions of the "basket" of six greenhouse gases, weighted by their global warming potential (GWP), fell by 8.7 per cent. between 1990 and 1998. UK emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, fell by 7 per cent. over the same period. The changes in the levels of emissions of the six greenhouse gases in each year from 1990 to 1998 for the UK are given in Table 1. 1998 is the latest year for which we have complete data. Disaggregated data are only available for the years 1990 and 1995 for Scotland and England and Wales at present (Table 2) but data for 1998 will be available later this year.
<P>

<a name="00626w08.html_para0">Table 3 shows projected changes in UK emissions of the six greenhouse gases between 1990 (the baseline year for our climate change targets) and 2010, before the impact of the measures set out in the UK's draft climate change programme, published in March. There are currently no disaggregated projections for England and Wales and Scotland although my Department is funding a research contract to provide disaggregated projections of the non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases which will be available later this year.

 None. However, in 1998 my Department's Property Advisory Group published a report "Sustainable Development and Buildings" commending the use of all-inclusive occupation agreements in commercial buildings as a means of reducing energy consumption. Under such arrangements, the landlord provides a comprehensive range of services besides letting the property--for example, energy, insurance, repairs and maintenance--for an all-inclusive charge. The Property Advisory Group saw these as giving landlord and tenant a mutual interest in reducing occupation costs, including energy costs.

We want to protect and conserve the waterways as an important part of the country's national heritage while, at the same time, encouraging their best and, where appropriate, innovative use, maximising the opportunities they offer for leisure and recreation; as a catalyst for urban and rural regeneration; for education; and for freight transport.

 In researching cluster areas and deciding where asylum seekers might best be dispersed, the National Asylum Support Service has drawn on a number of sources for information about towns and cities across the United Kingdom. This includes census information and population data. Ethnic minority population and communities are taken into account in decisions on cluster areas, although there is no requirement to take account of a population of less than 1 per cent. specifically. The availability of accommodation is clearly a prime factor in the development of cluster areas. This may be either public housing or private housing.

Nationally, these amount to a 25 per cent. reduction by March 2005.

<a name="00626w11.html_para2">Under the Reducing Burglary Initiative (part of our &#163;400 million Crime Reduction Programme), we plan to invest over &#163;50 million by 2002 in projects covering over two million households in high crime areas, with the aim of preventing 15,000 burglaries by March 2002 and 25,000 in the longer term.

There is agreement to set up a body, with industry participation, to advise on the technical, functional and procedural implementation of Clause 12 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill. Depending on detailed discussions in that group and outside, and bearing in mind the need for equity across the entire communications industry, the Government will take a view on what contribution from internet service providers will be appropriate for capital costs. That process will also inform decisions on recruitment costs.

 Our estimate of the total costs to communication service providers, not currently classified as public telecommunications operators, of establishing an intercept capability under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill is that it will not exceed &#163;20 million in aggregate over the first three years. I have published a report on the Home Office website detailing some cost and technical implications of interception on the internet. My officials have been in contact with The Alliance for Electronic Business and the Internet Service Providers Association over the establishment of an advisory board to consider further the technical, functional and procedural implementation of Clause 12 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill.

(18) Funding for 1999-2000 is not directly comparable with 2000-01 and previous years since with effect from 1 April 2000 the territory of the Metropolitan Police Service was redrawn to increase the Greater London Area only. Responsibility for policing about one third of Surrey and smaller parts of Hertfordshire and Essex has now been transferred to the respective county forces. Taking account of these, funding has increased in real terms by 1.4 per cent. in 2000-01. Excluding &#163;8.5 million for the CFF and &#163;4 million for PNC charges, funding for 2000-01 would be &#163;1,832 million. This is the equivalent of a 3 per cent cash increase/1 per cent. real terms increase of 1999-2000 after allowing for the boundary changes (and 1.9 per cent in cash terms over funding and the use of reserves in 1999-2000). Percentage changes in real terms have been calculated at 1998-99 prices using GDP deflators (March 2000). <P>

<a name="00626w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 No assessment has been made of the withdrawal of rent or housing allowances on the recruitment and retention of officers. Outside the Metropolitan Police Service, very few forces report a recruitment problem. Average total wastage in the police service in 1998-99 was seven per cent., which is low by standards outside the police service.
<P>

<a name="00626w13.html_para0">Rent allowance was replaced by housing allowance on 1 April 1990, although some officers still receive transitional rent allowance. Following the recommendations of the Sheehy Inquiry, housing allowance was abolished for new recruits and frozen for serving officers from 1 September 1994, because police officers were no longer required to live in a particular location. Entitlement to provided accommodation also ceased and the structure of starting salaries changed.
<P>

<a name="00626w13.html_para1">Under the Police Act 1996, the Police Negotiating Board (PNB) considers issues relating to police pay and allowances. There are no plans to reinstate rent or housing allowances but the PNB has recommended an increase in London Allowance of &#163;3,327, from 1 July 2000, for those officers appointed on or after 1 September 1994 and not in receipt of housing allowance. On 23 June my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced that he has accepted this recommendation.
<P>

<a name="00626w13.html_para2">It is not possible to provide a meaningful average reduction in serving police officers' remuneration following the abolition of housing allowance. Allowances paid vary between rank and force. The tables show the rates payable for housing allowance and transitional rent allowance.

<a name="00626w14.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the estimated average time required is for a police officer to complete the formal documentation of criminal evidence following an arrest for <i>(a)</i> burglary, <i>(b)</i> car theft and <i>(c)</i> criminal damage; and what steps he has taken to monitor the time spent on procedural rather than operational tasks and to reduce it.  [127344]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Manual of Guidance for the preparation, processing and submission of files, which is issued by the Trials Issues Group, sets out what information the police must supply to the Crown Prosecution Service (CRS) to ensure a successful prosecution. The number of documents required depends on the nature of the individual case, as does the time it 



<P>
<P><I>26 Jun 2000 : Column: 394W</I><P>
takes to complete them; an average time would not be meaningful and has not been estimated. In straightforward cases in which a guilty plea is expected (which accounted for more than half the cases in the pilot last year of the Narey measures for reducing delay) it is sufficient to prepare an 'expedited file' consisting of no more than five or six forms. The national introduction of those measures in November 1999 is expected to reduce the volume of cases requiring full files, and should also lead to an improvement in the timely delivery of case files to the CPS. Getting the file right first time, and on time, significantly reduces administrative burdens.
<P>

<a name="00626w14.html_para0">The Home Office is committed to looking at ways of reducing administrative burdens on the police where it is possible to do so consistently with the interests of justice, and will continue to collaborate with forces to that end.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w14.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Paragraph 3 of Schedule 8 to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Bill imposes limits on campaign expenditure by registered political parties in the 365 days prior to the date of a general election. The maximum amount a party may spend is determined by the number of constituencies contested. A party receives an allowance of &#163;30,000 for each constituency contested, subject to a minimum threshold. A party contesting every constituency in the United Kingdom would therefore be subject to a limit on campaign expenditure of &#163;19.77 million during the normal 365-day period. In the event that Schedule 8 is brought into force less than 365 days prior to the date of the next general election, clause 151(5) of the Bill provides that the relevant commencement order may specify a lower limit to apply during the shortened campaign period. We have undertaken to consult the main political parties before any such order is made.

 The Commission for the Management of Strategic Resources, National Reconstruction and Development was created to help the Government of Sierra Leone exercise full control of the exploitation of gold, diamonds and other resources for the benefit of the people of Sierra Leone. The Lome Peace Agreement provided that the funds derived from resources managed by the Commission would be paid into a special account at the Sierra Leone Treasury, to be sued for the benefit of the people of Sierra Leone.

<a name="00626w15.html_para7">Despite international support for this objective, by the end of April, the Commission and its associated mechanisms had not been fully established.

The UK implements this requirement by means of an amendment to the Open General Import Licence. The UK has tabled a draft Security Council resolution which would impose a similar prohibition with respect to Sierra Leonean diamonds. The Government welcome the establishment of a UN expert panel which will investigate the links between exploitation of mineral resources and conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo and will consider the panel's recommendations for action.

<P>
<a name="00626w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 When the Government deploy observers to elections overseas, they usually participate as members of international missions. On such missions, UK observers follow the procedures laid down for the larger group. For example the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe both have codes of conduct which apply to their election observation missions. In both cases, observers are expected to consider a wide range of factors when assessing the validity of an election, including: the degree of freedom of political parties and candidates to organise and express their views; fairness of access to state resources made available for the election; fairness of access to the media; registration of voters without discrimination on the basis of gender, racial or ethnic origin; and the conduct of polling and counting.

 Our policy is to promote British interests and pursue British values by supporting democracy and human rights, wherever we can, however we can. That means responding to human rights challenges in the way most likely to help the people whose freedoms are being restricted. It would be irresponsible for any government to apply the same "one-size-fits-all" approach. We need to weigh factors such as relevant international standards, the policies of the government in the country concerned, and the extent to which our actions can have a real impact on the ground.

 At this year's UN Commission on Human Rights, the EU sponsored a resolution on the Sudan which set out its concerns about violations of human rights. We have also taken up many of these concerns bilaterally and through the recently renewed EU/Sudan dialogue.

<a name="00626w17.html_para0">While we still have many concerns, we do believe that some progress has been made. Some examples would be the release of many prisoners, the agreement to review some legislation such as the Public Order Law, and the setting up of the Committee for the Eradication of the Abduction of Women and Children which is working in close co-operation with UNICEF and Save the Children Fund (UK).

 We are well aware of concerns that revenues from the oil industry in the Sudan could be used to fund the ongoing war in the Sudan. We have raised these concerns with the Government of Sudan, pressing them to use the revenues for development projects and to show transparency in the oil account. Public assurances have been made to that effect and we shall look to the Government to honour these assurances as evidence becomes available.

 The 1996 Moscow Nuclear Summit tasked the G8 Non-Proliferation Experts Group (NPEG) to take forward international cooperation on the safe and permanent disposal of ex-weapons plutonium, focusing on the huge Russian and American stockpiles. Technical experts agreed that the most promising options for disposal were conversion (of both plutonium and uranium) into mixed-oxide fuel (MOX) for use in civil nuclear reactors, and vitrification (in glass or ceramic form). The UK has actively contributed to work: as G8 President in 1998 we held a major conference of governmental and industrial experts which examined options for implementing the programme and ways of financing it. The US and Russia have recently concluded a Framework Agreement on how they will deal with disposition of weapons grade plutonium. We look forward to further discussion at the forthcoming G8 summit in Okinawa.

 <i>[holding answer 17 May 2000]:</i> In addition to combat vehicles, the Ministry of Defence operates a wide range of support vehicles procured or leased from over 130 different manufacturers. While details are not held centrally, it is assessed that the number of non-combat support vehicles (including long-term leased vehicles) is as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what estimate he has made of the impact on morale of the standard of family accommodation available to service personnel;  [126507]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w18.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence understands that Service personnel and their families expect Service family accommodation to be of good quality, and that poor quality accommodation can affect retention. Accommodation standards are set according to factors such as energy efficiency, double glazing and modern bathroom facilities. Currently around 60 per cent. of accommodation is Standard Two or above.
<P>

<a name="00626w18.html_para1">We are working hard to bring all family accommodation in Great Britain to Standard One. The Upgrade Programme to achieve this started in 1996. It is a significant investment programme and considerable progress has been made. We originally planned that most of the estate would be upgraded by November 2003 but the 1998 Stock Condition Survey revealed that the programme would involve more work than we predicted at the outset. As a consequence, we were forced to extend the target completion date to November 2005.
<P>

<a name="00626w18.html_para2">The Continuous Attitude Surveys, conducted among both serving personnel and their spouses, give objective evidence of morale and show that personnel are generally satisfied with the overall standard of Service families accommodation. Independent housing surveys conducted for the Defence Housing Executive also show that 82 per cent. of Service families are content with the standard of family accommodation.

 The Technology Readiness and Risk Assessment Programme is a three-year programme begun in July 1998. &#163;12.5 million has been allocated for the overall programme, the work for which is being shared between the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) and four UK defence contractors. The wide-ranging and consultative nature of the programme means that it is not possible to provide precise details of staffing levels, but the core team comprises 25-30 staff.

<a name="00626w18.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The secondment of the former Deputy Chief Executive of the Defence Procurement Agency to the UK headquarters of Thomson-CSF arose out of discussions between Ministry of Defence officials and the company's senior management and is part of the Ministry of Defence's wider interchange programme. As with all top level civil service appointments, it was approved by the Permanent Secretary. There is no additional cost to the Department as salary and associated costs will be reimbursed by the company for the duration of the secondment.

 <i>[holding answer 21 June 2000]:</i> As of 21 June 2000, a total of 48 confirmed cases of malaria and one suspected case have been recorded among Service personnel deployed to Sierra Leone. According to the Ministry of Defence data on hospital admissions, which includes admissions to RAF medical centres for more than 48 hours and to sick bays in RN ships, 47 Service personnel were diagnosed as suffering from malaria between 1 January 1995 and 17 January 2000. (This is the latest date for which records are immediately available, other than for the Sierra Leone deployment). Those personnel had served overseas in a total of 40 countries (as listed) prior to their diagnosis. Some personnel are likely to have contracted malaria while on holiday overseas.

For 1998-99 the value was stated against a PFI consultancy contract and involved an overpayment, since recovered, arising from genuine error by the contractor.

 The Ministry of Defence, together with other Government Departments has been assisting with Diving Associations' plans for self regulation through the development of a Code of Practice for diving on wrecks.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para1">The aim of the Code is to re-educate divers to adopt best practices when diving on all wrecks. Current training and other publications, issued by the diving organisations, will be reviewed to take account of the legal and moral responsibilities of those who dive on wrecks. In addition a new "Wreck Diving Law Course" is being piloted by the British SubAqua Club (BSAC). Information and guidance on "Respecting Our Wrecks" already appears on the Diving Associations' websites.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para2">Mechanisms for enforcement of the Code of Practice and other initiatives, which could result in expulsion from the organisation, are already in place in the Associations' constitution. Any member behaving in a way calculated to be prejudicial to the interests of the club could be expelled. The diving organisations are fully committed to change the way a small minority abuse the wrecks they dive on.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para3">It is expected that this Code will be introduced by the Diving Associations shortly. The Government will assess compliance with the Code and review policy accordingly in the light of subsequent developments.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para4">In addition, my Department has given full support to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency proposed Wreck Amnesty. The aim of the Amnesty is to encourage finders of wreck material raised in the past, but not reported under (s)236 of the 1995 Merchant Shipping Act, to come forward and report past finds. These finds could include light munitions or other potentially dangerous materials; items of historical importance as well as items capable of being returned to the rightful owner. This along with other initiatives supported by the Ministry of Defence is aimed at heightening divers' and other sea users' awareness of their legal and moral responsibilities.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para5">My Department has produced guidance notes for sport divers when diving in the vicinity of wrecked military vessels, these are publicly available.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para6">Along with other Government Departments we continue to encourage safe, responsible and legal diving practices.

 Legally a "war grave" is a burial maintained by the Commonwealth War Grave Commission. Since a sunken vessel is not a "burial" a sunken warship is simply a derelict in Admiralty law and has no greater or special legal status.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para7">I am unaware of any other legislation specially drafted for the protection of underwater human remains. The fact that a vessel has not been designated does not mean that a person can remove items from a vessel with impunity. Other laws may apply.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para8">The Protection of Wrecks Act 1973, provides protection of wreck sites that are of archaeological or historical significance or are dangerous. The Merchant Shipping Act 1995, which incorporates the International Salvage Convention 1989, provides for the rights of both owners and finders of wreck.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para9">If there is a breach of the law then the appropriate enforcement authorities will enforce the law.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para10">My Department is unaware of any international legislation for the protection of underwater military human remains. The United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea does, however, cover archaeological and historical objects found at sea which could include human remains.

<P>
<a name="00626w20.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 There is no centrally held list of wrecked military vessels that lie in UK territorial water, international waters or the territorial waters of other countries and no one single source of reference which identifies all vessels lost in the service of the Admiralty or on Government Service since 1914.
<P>

<a name="00626w20.html_para11">The returns to Parliament following the end of both world wars, Navy Losses and Merchant Shipping Losses, list some 12,000 vessels. They list for WWI: the total number of warship losses 254; Auxiliary vessels 815, Merchant 2,479, Fishing vessels 675. WWII: Warships and Auxiliary vessels 1,503, Landing craft 1,308 and Merchant vessels 4,786. No distinction is made between those vessels in Government Service or Mercantile vessels. Only one List identifies vessels where lives were lost. These records have not been updated in the intervening years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what plans he has to ensure that computers and software used in schools under the Government's IT initiative, are upgraded to reflect technical change; and what criteria are used to determine when equipment is obsolete and in need of replacement.  [119745]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00626w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The Government are supporting &#163;657 million of investment in schools' information and communications technology (ICT) provision up to 2002 as part of the National Grid for Learning Initiative. This funding may be used to install new equipment and software and to replace or upgrade older infrastructure. It is a matter for schools themselves in the light of their own particular needs to decide when equipment and software has come to the end of its useful life. Regular competitions held by the British Educational Communications and Technology Agency to certify NGfL Managed Service suppliers set standards which ensure that the networks, equipment and services available to schools and other learning institutions keep pace with technical and other changes.

 There were about 15,000 teachers employed directly by local authorities in England in 1998, of which it is estimated that 75 per cent. were eligible to apply for the threshold this year. When we published the threshold application forms and guidance materials on 24 March 2000 we encouraged all eligible teachers to apply. We did not make any estimate on the numbers of eligible teachers employed directly by local authorities. We will be announcing details about the numbers of teachers that have applied to cross the threshold this year shortly.

 Activity began in pilots in April this year. This will continue for at least 12 months, but with the phased introduction of Connexions from April 2001, it may be necessary to extend the life of some of the pilots, so as to ensure continued testing until the service is in place throughout the country. Decisions on this will be taken when we know the areas that will launch the Connexions Service from April 2001. Where pilots are focusing on themes that we already know need longer testing, we have agreed extended contracts for this purpose (e.g. for Huntercombe Young Offenders Institution).
<P>

<a name="00626w22.html_para2">We have introduced a process of action based research, which will ensure the lessons learned from these pilots are communicated very quickly to the pilots themselves, to policy and planning officials and to the wider community who have an interest in these developments. We have already scheduled the first of a series of pilot conferences for the 4 and 5 July 2000, which will bring people together to learn from early piloting experience. In addition, we are developing other means to ensure wide circulation of information, including development of websites and use of existing publications.
