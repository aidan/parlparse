               <a name="11050915000095"> Under the Animal Welfare Act 2006 it is an offence to cause any unnecessary suffering to an animal that is under the control of man or for an owner or keeper to fail to provide for an animal’s welfare needs. Ultimately it would be for a court to decide, but it is realistic to assume that sending a tortoise through the post without taking appropriate care to secure the health and welfare of the animal, would be an offence under the 2006 Act. The maximum penalty under the 2006 Act for causing unnecessary suffering is a fine of £20,000, or six months imprisonment, or both.</p>

Many courier companies that do their own hand deliveries also operate a total ban on the transport of live animals. Any postal operator or courier that does transport live animals needs to comply with EU welfare during transport legislation (Council Regulation (EC) No. 1/2005). The regulation is implemented in England by the Welfare of Animals (Transport) (England) Order 2006 (WATEO) and by parallel legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.</p>

Animals must be transported in a receptacle or means of transport that has appropriate space, ventilation, temperature, security, liquid and oxygen for the species concerned. Primary responsibility for enforcement of welfare during transport legislation rests with local authorities. Transporters found to be in breach of Regulation 1/2005 or WATEO could be subject to enforcement action.</p>

 The oil and gas sector has benefited from significantly higher prices than anticipated by the industry. Pre-tax profits in 2011 are forecast to be £24 billion, and up 50% in two years, so it is fair that companies make an extra contribution at this time. The tax will fall in a staged and affordable way if the oil price falls below a pre-set trigger price on a sustained basis. We will continue to discuss measures with the industry, including field allowances to encourage ongoing investment in more marginal fields. Overall, we do not expect this change to have a significant impact on investment or production in the coming years. Average post-tax profits per barrel will be higher in the next five years than the last five.</p>

 To ask the Attorney-General how many times the Official Solicitor has been appointed to act as litigation friend of last resort for a person who lacks litigation capacity, in appeals against their detention, authorised under the deprivation of liberty safeguards, brought under section 21A of the Mental Capacity Act 2005; in how many of all section 21A appeals the Official Solicitor has acted in the deprivation of liberty authorisation was terminated by the court; how many of those section 21A appeals in which the Official Solicitor was appointed to act were brought by the detainee themselves; and how many section 21A appeals in which the Official Solicitor was appointed to act were initially brought by the detainee themselves, but were discontinued by the Official Solicitor on the basis that there was little prospect of success.

 The Department for Education does not routinely publish all correspondence between the Department and schools that are becoming academies, and has never done so. The Expression of Interest for Abraham Guest High School to become a sponsored academy is currently being worked up by the sponsor and the local authority. Once complete, it will come to Ministers for approval.</p>

 The School Admissions Code already places some requirements on admission authorities to help ensure that children of service personnel are not disadvantaged as a consequence of their mobility. As announced in the Schools White Paper, “The Importance of Teaching”, we are currently reviewing the code in order to simplify its requirements, and will be consulting on a revised code shortly. It will continue to ensure that the needs of the children of service personnel are taken into account.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 26 April 2011]:</i> The contract for the operational management and delivery of the Playing for Success (PfS) programme ran for a three-year period beginning in April 2008. It expired at the end of March 2011. Central funding to support Playing for Success study centres in England, therefore, came to an end at the same time.</p>

               <a name="11050934000245"> The level of funding made available to support Playing for Success in each of the three years of the last spending review period was approximately £14.5 million, including the contract and support to individual centres.</p>

               <a name="11050934000246"> Four independent national evaluations were carried out over the course of the Playing for Success programme, all of which focused on the impact on academic achievement. There has been no assessment of the effectiveness of the programme in increasing attendance at school or in reducing offending by participants. The evaluations have all found improvements in literacy and numeracy levels, information and communication technology (ICT) skills, attitudes to learning, and self-esteem. The evaluation in May 2007 looked at the long-term impact of PfS in terms of pupils' performance in national curriculum assessments (NCAs) and found a more mixed picture. While there appeared to be a positive impact on under-achieving pupils, which was the programme's target group, it concluded that PfS is not an inoculation against underperformance, and continued progress should be a shared responsibility.</p>

The non-statutory framework for personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education includes teaching young people at primary school level about basic emergency procedures and where to get help; and at secondary school level, to develop the skills to cope with emergency situations that require basic first aid procedures, including, at key stage 4 (ages 15-16), resuscitation techniques.</p>

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office's (FCO) Command Paper on Human Rights and Democracy published in March covers 26 countries of concern. These are among the countries where we have the most serious, wide-ranging human rights concerns and where the UK Government are engaged in promoting and protecting human rights. They are (in alphabetical order): Afghanistan, Belarus, Burma, Chad, China, Colombia, Cuba, Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Democratic Republic of Congo, Eritrea, Iran, Iraq, Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territories, Libya, Pakistan, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Syria, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Vietnam, Yemen and Zimbabwe.</p>

The Vienna convention requires the Qadhafi regime to protect diplomatic missions in Tripoli.

 The information is not available as new, more detailed details on the disabling condition were only added in 2008 and have not been applied retrospectively to the entire case load. Therefore, it is not yet possible to produce an estimate of the total number of people claiming disability living allowance with a main disabling condition of "autism". Such information as is available is in the following table.</p>

1. The preferred statistics on benefits are now derived from 100% data sources. However, the 5% sample data still provide some detail not yet available from the 100% data sources, in particular, more complete information on the disabling, condition of DLA claimants. DWP recommends that, where the detail is only available on the 5% sample data, or disabling condition (DLA) is required, the proportions derived should be scaled up to the overall 100% total for the benefit. This has been done here.
2. Case load figures are rounded to the nearest hundred.
3. Case load totals show the number of people in receipt of an allowance and exclude those with, entitlement where the payment has been suspended, for example if they are in hospital.
4. Learning difficulties includes the following disabling conditions: 'F86'—'Down's Syndrome', 'F87’—'Fragile X syndrome', 'F90'—'Other Learning Disability', 'F91'—'Autism', 'F92'—'Asperger Syndrome', 'F94'—'Retts Disorder'.

We believe it is right for the assessment to look at disabled people as individuals and not just label them by their health condition or impairment. That is why it is being designed to consider an individual's personal circumstances and the support they need, rather than basing eligibility on any medical condition. I can assure the hon. Member that we want to get this right and before finalising the assessment criteria we will be testing them and assessing their likely impact.</p>

 The annual cost of administering personal independence payment will depend on the detail of how the benefit is delivered and the design of the new assessment. Costs will be refined as further detail on the reform is developed. Approximate high level delivery costs (both one off investment and DEL) have been estimated to be £675 million (net present value) over the period 2011-12 to 2015-16. These include provision for making changes to the IT systems, training DWP staff, the administrative effort required to manage the transition of existing recipients to the new system and the cost of trained independent assessors undertaking the new assessment.</p>

 Support in personal independence payment will be on those who face the greatest challenges in living independent lives. The assessment is being developed and at this stage, therefore, an assessment is not available of the impact changes could have on future recipients or Government expenditure. We are working with disabled people, and organisations that represent them on the detailed design and delivery of personal independence payment. The outcomes from this work will be reflected in updates to the impact assessment for this change. We have already announced that personal independence payment will be a non taxable, non means-tested benefit payable to people in and out of work.</p>

Actual 2011-12 rates are calculated by adding CPI (3.1%) to 2010-11 rates. These in turn were 1.5% higher than 2009-10 rates. Under the previous policy, in order to recover the 1.5% advance in 2010/11 (when the RPI figure driving uprating was negative), 2011-12 rates would have been 2009-10 rates plus RPI (4.6%), yielding a slightly lower figure.

1. Case load figures are rounded to the nearest 10.
2. Totals may not sum due to rounding.
3. Incapacity benefit was replaced by employment support allowance (ESA) from October 2008.
4. Although in general incapacity benefits apply to people of working age, a small number of claimants are over state pension age.

 We have announced that support for child care costs will be provided in universal credit by an additional element, and that we aim to extend support to those working fewer than 16 hours. We have also announced during the Commons Committee stage of the Welfare Reform Bill that we intend to discuss with stakeholders the options for delivering this within the existing financial envelope for child care costs in the current tax credit and benefit system. The maximum allowable child care costs under different options will be a key factor in those discussions, which will take place over the coming weeks.</p>

 Significant steps have been taken in reducing costs and improving efficiency between Departments since the coalition Government came to office just under a year ago. The Emergency Budget set immediate cost reductions of £6.2 billion across Departments, which has been achieved with close to £3 billion directly attributed to Cabinet Office initiatives through reducing spend on consultants, re-negotiating contracts with major suppliers, the ICT and Estates Moratoriums and review and in some cases stopping of major programmes. New strategies have recently been approved on ICT, centralised procurement and major programmes which will see greater efficiency and collaboration across Departments to help support the £83 billion cost reductions required over the CSR period.</p>

 The Electoral Commission has led work with police forces, political parties and returning officers to raise awareness of integrity issues and strengthen systems to ensure that fraud is detected and prosecuted and to draw attention to existing good practice. There is evidence of effective working between returning officers and local police at recent elections with the police engaged on election issues and committed to the detection of electoral fraud which is reflected in the findings of the joint report by the Association of Chief Police Officers and Electoral Commission on the May 2010 elections, ‘Analysis of cases of alleged electoral malpractice in 2010’. This approach was continued for the polls that took place on 5 May 2011. The Government will wish to consider carefully the planned reports by the Electoral Commission on those polls, and any recommendations made by the Electoral Commission, and will continue to keep procedures under review to ensure that the electoral process is secure for the elections in 2012.</p>

The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seek to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. The A and E HES publications addresses some of the key data quality and coverage issues. These are available on HESonline at:

 In the United Kingdom, blood donation is based on the principle of altruism, where donors give blood for no reward other than to help patients. Indeed, the Blood Safety and Quality Regulations 2005, as amended, require the UK blood services, which includes NHS Blood and Transplant (NHSBT), to encourage voluntary and unpaid blood donations. There are no plans to change this.</p>

BPL historically used plasma from the UK blood services and was therefore directly affected by the change in policy. BPL's fractionated products are used in the UK, and are also sold abroad. A cost estimate for importing the plasma that is used to manufacture BPL products that are used in the UK is not readily available, but I will place an estimate in the Library by the end of June 2011.</p>

 There have been three cases of clinical variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) and one case of infection (without development of clinical disease) presumed to be associated with blood transfusion. These have occurred in people who have received blood transfusions from donors who themselves went on to develop clinical vCJD after they had made the blood donation. None of these patients were transfused since 1999. The vCJD infection in these four recipients only came to light in 2003 and later because of the incubation period of vCJD.</p>

 The public health White Paper, ‘Healthy Lives, Healthy People’, set out that “Directors of Public Health will work with NHS colleagues locally in advising on how to ensure equal access and equity of outcome across the population”. One of the three domains of public health is improving services, which the Faculty of Public Health defines as including equity. Directors of Public Health will advise national health service commissioners to assist them in commissioning services in such a way as to promote equal access for all and so that the design of services acts to improve outcomes, aiming to ensure that outcomes are just, fair and ultimately equally good for the whole population. This will act to reduce health inequalities, which is a key aim of the Government's proposals.</p>

We propose to place a duty on consortia of continuous quality improvement in terms of health outcomes. The NHS Commissioning Board, supported by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, will develop a Commissioning Outcomes Framework so that there is clear, publicly available information on the quality of health care services commissioned by consortia. Measures from the Commissioning Outcomes Framework will be used by the board to hold commissioning consortia to account for the quality of services they commission and the health outcomes they achieve for patients.</p>

 Guidance from the General Medical Council (GMC) makes clear that all doctors are responsible for ensuring that patients have sufficient information to make an informed decision about the treatments offered to them. This is particularly important in the case of treatments carried out for purely cosmetic reasons, that is to say where there is no underlying health need.

 The regulation of cosmetic surgery has already been tightened up since the fieldwork carried out by the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death. Since October 2011 all cosmetic surgery providers, whether in the national health service or in the independent sector, have been subject to regulation by the Care Quality Commission against requirements set out in regulations. The Commission has tough enforcement powers and can take prompt actions where providers fail to comply with the safety and quality requirements.</p>
