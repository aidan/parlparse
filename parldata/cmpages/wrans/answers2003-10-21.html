<P>
14. <a name="31021w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what assessment he has made of proposals by train operating companies to install television in railway carriages.  [132973]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Television may be installed in railway carriages for either onboard entertainment or security purposes. The first is a commercial matter for operators. CCTV for security purposes has already been installed by some operators and the Department is working with the Strategic Rail Authority to continue to improve security on trains.

15. <a name="31021w01.html_wqn1"><B> Jonathan Shaw: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport was assessment he has made of the possibility of Channel Tunnel Rail Link domestic service trains stopping in the Medway towns.  [132974]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority yesterday launched a further public consultation on Channel Tunnel Rail Link domestic services, building on one carried out earlier this year. A particular issue for the consultation will be whether CTRL domestic services should run to the Medway Towns.

<P>
16. <a name="31021w01.html_wqn2"><B> Norman Lamb: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent steps his Department has taken to disseminate best practice within the bus industry.  [132975]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department will shortly be publishing two good practice guides, one drawing on experience with Rural Bus Grant and Rural Challenge, and one on tendering of bus subsidy contracts. The Bus Partnership Forum has produced a report on Understanding Customer Needs and a code of conduct on Service Stability. Guidance on Quality Bus Partnerships was published in 2001.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent discussions he has had with other Government Departments on the relationship between home to school transport and children's health.  [132976]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 My Department works closely with the Department of Health on all aspects of school travel policy. We are keen to encourage walking and cycling to school.

<P>
18. <a name="31021w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Stringer: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what studies he has undertaken to assess the impact of bus deregulation in metropolitan areas.  [132977]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty </B> 
: The impact of bus deregulation was studied in the years following 1986. No recent studies have been undertaken but we continue to publish statistical data on kilometres operated, the cost of services, passenger satisfaction etc. We are in constant touch with the Passenger Transport Executives and major bus operators about local developments. Later today I shall be meeting representatives from Greater Manchester about bus regulation issues.

<a name="31021w01.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>Transport Provision</H3>


<P>
19. <a name="31021w01.html_wqn5"><B> Nick Harvey: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, if he will make a statement on the relationship between transport provision and access to public services.  [132978]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Social Exclusion Unit's February 2003 report "Making the Connections" showed that provision of good local transport and provision of public services in accessible places are both essential to enable people to access the services they need when they need them. The increased funding for local transport we have already provided, and inclusion of accessibility planning in local authorities' next transport plans, will help authorities deliver real improvements in accessibility for their communities.

<a name="31021w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Air Travel (Compensation)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Chope: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what measures the Government will put in place to ensure that the proposed regulation establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights is proportionate and workable; and if he will make a statement;  [133568]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will publish a regulatory impact assessment in respect of the proposed EU regulation establishing common rules on compensation and assistance to passengers in the event of denied boarding and of cancellation or long delay of flights.  [133569]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The UK is supportive of the basic aim of this regulation, which is to protect passengers who are denied boarding or are the victims of commercial cancellations. However, we also believe a balance should be struck between the rights of passengers and the additional costs to airlines, which may ultimately be passed through to the consumer. Accordingly, we have been working hard to improve the original text, to try to make it more balanced and workable. Once the regulation comes into force it will be binding in its entirety and directly applicable in member states, who will be required to designate a body responsible for its enforcement and ensure that sanctions laid down for infringements are effective, proportionate and dissuasive.




<P>
<P><I>21 Oct 2003 : Column 477W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31021w01.html_para0">When the text of the regulation has been finalised we will be in a position to complete our Regulatory Impact Assessment, which will appear on the Department for Transport website in due course.

<a name="31021w01.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>Driving Licences</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Dhanda: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will require drivers to be retested for their driving licence on a regular basis.  [133540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government do not consider that the regular retesting of all drivers would be a proportionate measure to deliver road safety benefits. Courts already have powers to require those drivers who offend to undergo a driving test. Where a driver is guilty of a serious offence, this involves an extended length driving test.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Brady: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what the average waiting time was for a driver aged over 70 between applying for a licence renewal and the issue of the licence in each of the last three years.  [133590]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) aims to return licences 15 working days following receipt of a valid application (i.e. one complete in all respects). This can take longer where further inquiries are required into an individual's health or personal details. This is published in the DVLA's literature that supports application forms. Apart from a courtesy reminder system there are no separate arrangements specifically for processing applications from drivers aged over 70.

<a name="31021w01.html_sbhd8"><H3 align=center>Flight Paths (Walthamstow)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gerrard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what altitude restrictions apply to aircraft on flight paths above Walthamstow; and how these have changed in the last five years.  [131582]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty </B> 
 <i>[pursuant to his answer, 14 October 2003, Official Report, c. 168&#150;69W]:</i> The airspace over all of Walthamstow above 2,500 ft has been classified as 'controlled' for many years. Over the southernmost quarter of the Walthamstow constituency the airspace has been controlled to ground level since the opening of London City Airport. Aircraft using Heathrow and City operate within this controlled airspace. Aircraft inbound to Heathrow will normally be above 5,000 ft.
<P>

<a name="31021w01.html_para1">Over the remainder of my hon. Friend's constituency below 2,500 ft, helicopters and general aviation aircraft from smaller aerodromes can determine routes and altitudes according to their particular requirements. Such flights are subject to the Rules of the Air Regulations, notably Rule 5, which means most will be above 1,500 ft.
<P>

<a name="31021w01.html_para2">There have been no changes to the airspace over Walthamstow in the last five years.

<a name="31021w01.html_sbhd9"><H3 align=center>Grosvenor Square (Street Closure)</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, what the costs to his Department were of the <i>(a)</i> closure of Grosvenor Square and <i>(b)</i> policing of the private event held there on 11 September.  [131411]




<P>
<P><I>21 Oct 2003 : Column 478W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The event was organised by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, and was policed by officers from the Home Department.
<P>

<a name="31021w01.html_para3">The closure of Grosvenor Square incurred no costs to the Department for Transport. The cost of the ad hoc policing arrangements to Government was approximately &#163;7,000.

<a name="31021w01.html_sbhd10"><H3 align=center>Light Rail Schemes</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what assessment his Department has made of the risk factors associated with light rail schemes <i>(a)</i> where there is a pre-existing light rail passenger base and <i>(b)</i> that rely on projections of passenger growth; and how this is reflected in his Department's costs and other assessments of such schemes;  [131924]
<P>
<UL>(2) what risk assessment his Department has made of the Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramway renewal proposals;  [131925]
<P>
(3) what account his Department took of the <i>(a)</i> extent and <i>(b)</i> costs of Disability Discrimination Act 1995 compliance in 2004 in its assessment of the costs and value for money of the minimal option of works to keep the Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramway operational;  [131927]
<P>
(4) whether his Department has included regeneration benefits from the upgrade of the Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramway in its assessment of its value for money and cost-benefit ratios;  [131928]
<P>
(5) what assessment his Department has made of the success of <i>(a)</i> light rail and <i>(b)</i> bus schemes in attracting users to public transport;  [131963]
<P>
(6) what his Department's policy is on the upgrade of existing light rail networks;  [131964]
<P>
(7) what research his Department has undertaken of the <i>(a)</i> benefits and <i>(b)</i> costs of (i) upgrading existing and (ii) building new light rail systems;  [131965]
<P>
(8) what <i>(a)</i> assessment his Department has made of the cost-benefit ratios and <i>(b)</i> value for money of the options for the renewal of the Blackpool and Fleetwood Tramway.  [131966]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department is nearing completion of its assessment of the proposals by Blackpool borough council and Lancashire county council to upgrade the Blackpool Tramway. In common with all transport projects considered by the Department, it is being assessed using the New Approach To Appraisal (NATA) framework, which pays attention both to those impacts which can readily be monetarised (such as time savings) and to others of policy significance (such as environmental impacts) which can only be considered qualitatively.
<P>

<a name="31021w01.html_para4">The NATA framework also requires the preparation of an Economic Impact Report on the possible regeneration impact of the scheme and a thorough quantified risk assessment, both of which the Council has provided. My right hon. Friend will take into account the findings of the appraisal in the light of all the other pressures on his programmes in deciding whether to fund the scheme.




<P>
<P><I>21 Oct 2003 : Column 479W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31021w01.html_para5">Lower-cost alternatives to the full scheme have also been appraised, taking account of the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act.
<P>

<a name="31021w01.html_para6">A crucial, and difficult, part of the assessment of any light rail project is the forecasting of patronage. The uncertainties are always considerable, though greater in the case of proposals for an entirely new system than for an upgrading of a long-established line. Different scenarios, including optimistic and pessimistic, are examined to help capture the inherent uncertainty in forecasting future demand.
<P>

<a name="31021w01.html_para7">There has been no research on the relative costs and benefits of upgrading existing tram systems and of building new systems, since the circumstances and characteristics of individual schemes vary too greatly for such a comparison to be useful. For the same reason, the Department does not have any general policy as regards tram upgrades. Each proposed major local transport scheme is considered on its individual merits.
<P>

<a name="31021w01.html_para8">Evaluation Studies have been completed for new light rail systems, such as Croydon Supertram and Manchester Metrolink, which suggest that around 15 per cent. to 20 per cent. of passenger journeys on these systems would otherwise have taken place by car, and that generated trips can increase demand by up to 15 per cent. in the off-peak. However, there is also evidence that investment in buses can be successful in increasing public transport use. There is as yet only very limited experience in this country of guided bus schemes, which are the nearest bus-based equivalent to tram systems, and assessments of their relative attractiveness are therefore uncertain.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on progress with light rapid transit schemes in South Hampshire.  [132963]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The South Hampshire Rapid Transit scheme was approved for funding in March 2001. Unfortunately the cost estimates now exceed the threshold figure agreed at the time and my right hon. Friend is reviewing the options for its future.

<a name="31021w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Simmonds: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport whether the Motor Insurers Bureau receives Government funding.  [133730]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Motor Insurers' Bureau (MIB) is a Company which was set up and is managed by the

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Oaten: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make it his policy to take into account minimising noise disruption to schools as part of the criteria for resurfacing motorways; and if he will make a statement.  [132567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Government policy is that lower noise surfaces should now be used, except for practical reasons, when any trunk road is resurfaced and it is currently anticipated that over 60 per cent. of the strategic road network will have been surfaced with lower noise materials by 2011. The phasing of resurfacing is usually based on the need to keep the road in optimum condition without causing excessive delays to traffic. Noise mitigation measures on roads built after 1988 take into consideration the need to reduce their impact on noise sensitive facilities such as schools, as well as residential properties.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how much money has been granted to <i>(a)</i> Railtrack in Administration and <i>(b)</i> to Network Rail (i) by way of grant and (ii) in loan guarantees since the appointment of the Administrator.  [133667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w02.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Network grants paid to Railtrack in Administration and Network Rail are as set out in the Rail Regulator's Periodic Review Final Conclusions of October 2000, as amended by agreements between Railtrack and the Department for Transport in April 2001 and between Network Rail and the Strategic Rail Authority in June 2002.
<P>

<a name="31021w02.html_para0">Railtrack in Administration received network grants of &#163;654 million. The Secretary of State guaranteed loans and other liabilities of Railtrack in Administration up to &#163;4.5 billion. To date, Network Rail has received network grants of &#163;1.8 billion. The SRA has made available standby credit facilities of up to &#163;21 billion to support Network Rail's borrowing.

 The routing for the first four ships within the contract will be through the English Channel, observing mandatory IMO traffic separation schemes, and up the east coast of the UK. Generally, international rights of freedom of navigation apply, although upon entry into UK waters the tows could be directed by the Secretary of State's Representative to change routing or to leave UK waters if he believed it necessary for safety reasons or to prevent pollution or to conduct salvage operations.

 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) must be satisfied that the ships can make the passage without undue risk to the marine environment or safety. The MCA has had a number of meetings with both the US Coast Guard and the US Maritime Administration. MCA marine surveyors have accompanied Coast Guard surveyors during inspections of the ships. The US authorities refused to allow the vessels to sail until the MCA confirmed it was satisfied with all arrangements. The MCA did so only when it

 The Financial Services Authority (FSA) tell me that as at 30 September 2003 of the 4,047 firms that are required to hold professional indemnity insurance (PII) cover, 749 have yet to notify the FSA that they have obtained cover. At that same date, 82 firms have been granted a waiver from the requirement to hold PII and are, in effect, self-insuring. Under current market conditions, there can be a time lag of three months or more for a firm to obtain suitable cover and notify FSA of that fact.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how much was allocated to small firms using the research and development tax credit in financial years <i>(a)</i> 2001&#150;02 and <i>(b)</i> 2002&#150;03; and if he will make a statement.  [132884]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 It is not possible to separately identify small firms from our data. However, it is possible to identify Small or Medium Enterprises (SMEs). Latest estimates of the total cost, on an accruals basis, of the research and development tax credit for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 are available on the Inland Revenue's website at http://www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/tax expenditures/g t05 1.htm. For 2002&#150;03, the first year that large companies were eligible to claim R&D tax credits, the estimated cost of support for companies which are defined as SMEs for the purposes of the tax credit is &#163;200 million.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer for what reasons the Government imposes vehicle excise duty on vehicle ownership; and if he will make a statement.  [132902]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) helps ensure that all motorists contribute to the costs of maintaining and policing the road network. The VED system is also important in helping the enforcement of vehicle insurance and registration rules, and it enables discounts to be offered to help disabled drivers. The graduation of VED from March 2001 in relation to the carbon dioxide emissions and the pollution of cars has been important in helping to strengthen the signals for environmentally responsible behaviour by motorists.

<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what assessment he has made of the impact on emissions of carcinogens from road vehicles of <i>(a)</i> company car tax, <i>(b)</i> other vehicle taxation and <i>(c)</i> fuel tax;.  [132836]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_spnew3"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government has incorporated tax differentials into the company car tax, vehicle excise duty and fuel duty regimes to facilitate the use of alternative fuels and cleaner technologies to improve air quality.
<P>

<a name="31021w05.html_para1">Much of the reduction in pollution from road transport results from tougher emissions standards for new vehicles. The tax system provides some incentives for the earlier take-up of cleaner vehicles, as well as incentives for switching to less-polluting fuels and technologies.
<P>

<a name="31021w05.html_para2">Transport taxation is also intended to encourage the use of more fuel-efficient cars with lower carbon dioxide emissions.
<P>

<a name="31021w05.html_para3">Key air pollutants, including carcinogens, have reduced by around 50 per cent. over the last decade and are forecast to fall by a further 30 per cent. over the next decade. The specific information requested is not available; although further details of emissions of all pollutants from road transport are available from the National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (www.naei.org.uk).

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_spnew4"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 A list of consultation documents issued since January 2001 can be found on the HM Treasury website at http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/consultations and legislation/. In 2001, a third of consultation documents met Criterion 5. In 2002 and to date in 2003, more than three-quarters have done so. Most of the consultations that did not meet Criterion 5 related to market-sensitive financial service areas. In those cases where the consultation period is due to be shorter than normal, the reasons for this are now routinely set out in the text of the document.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Department's advice on fox control will remain unchanged if the Hunting Bill receives Royal Assent (assuming that it does so in its current form).
<P>

<a name="31021w05.html_para4">At present, shooting is the recommended method of fox control in rural areas. Snaring, which is also an effective technique when used by experienced personnel, may have advantages over shooting in certain situations.
<P>

<a name="31021w05.html_para5">Lethal control is not generally recommended in urban areas. Killing or relocating foxes usually only provides transient relief from the problems foxes cause, as vacant territories are rapidly reoccupied once the control measures cease. In addition, shooting and snaring are unlikely to be appropriate control methods for reasons of safety, and in the case of shooting, public disturbance. Advice on alternative strategies for preventing problems is given in the Department's "Urban Fox" leaflet (code WM08) which is available from the Defra website (www.defra.gov.uk/wildlife-countryside/vertebrates).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has for the development of comparative risk assessment for high-risk chemicals; what the timescale is for each of the steps envisaged; and if she will list the chemicals to which it is intended to apply this system.  [132454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_spnew6"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 When putting in place measures to reduce the risks of high-risk substances we consider the availability of substitutes and their hazards to ensure that the best option is taken. This is done following guidance set out by the EU and we currently have no plans to further develop this. The full examination to reduce risks&#151;which includes this comparison&#151;is divided into a five-stage process and generally takes between six and nine months. This process is applied

<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_wqn7"><B> Norman Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment has been made of the costs of the safe disposal from farms of stocks of those pesticides which have been withdrawn from the market this year as a result of the review taking place under EU Agricultural Pesticides Directive 91/414; and if she will list the cost to <i>(a)</i> the Government, <i>(b)</i> farmers and <i>(c)</i> the pesticide industry arising from the review.  [133108]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Pesticides are regularly withdrawn from the market as a result of regulatory reviews or commercial decisions taken by crop protection companies. However, when there are not over-riding safety concerns a 'use up' period is provided. The purpose of this period is to allow the pesticide industry and farmers to use up existing stocks of the pesticide products concerned and thus avoid significant disposal costs. We believe that this is the best environmental option as well as minimising the costs for all parties.
<P>

<a name="31021w05.html_para6">The withdrawals of products under the EC review programme has been taking place progressively since 1995 although the largest batch of withdrawals is taking place this year. In all cases a use-up period has been provided. In anticipation of this years withdrawals the department undertook special publicity campaigns, both this year and last, supported by the crop protection industry and farmers organisations. These were designed to ensure that those affected used their stocks by the end of this year thus minimising the need for disposals.
<P>

<a name="31021w05.html_para7">Because of this costs would only arise at the end of this year for farmers or pesticide companies if they have failed to take advantage of the use up period and we do not envisage that there will be additional costs to Government.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the information contained on the Pesticides Safety Directorate website on the mixing of individual compounds after sale in relation to Regulation 4 of the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 and Regulation 4 of the Plant Protection Regulations 1997.  [133502]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31021w05.html_spnew8"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The information on the Pesticide Safety Directorate's website describing the mixing of individual pesticides after sale refers to the published 'Guidelines on the Provision of Pesticide Mixing Services and Sale of Twin Packs and Kits'.

The mixing service guidelines stipulate that these services must be provided only after sale has taken place, that mixing must be carried out only in accordance with any restrictions placed on the individual pesticides used, and that mixed product should be used promptly.

 Government's underlying commitment is the same as it was last year. Up until restructuring, we have made the credit facility (currently &#163;200 million) available to British Energy, which has been approved by the European Commission. That will be repaid by the company under the terms of the restructuring plan at no cost to the taxpayer. Post restructuring we will take financial responsibility for British Energy's historic spent fuel liabilities, with an average cost to Government of &#163;150 to &#163;200 million per annum for the next 10 years, falling thereafter. We will also underwrite British Energy's arrangements for funding decommissioning and uncontracted liabilities to the extent that British Energy's contributions are insufficient.

The creation of the post of Minister for Children in June 2003 brought together within the DfES a number of key responsibilities including some from other Government Departments in order to improve the co-ordination of policy on children, young people and families. From September 2003, the title of this post was changed to Minister for Children, Young People and Families.

 The Department does not keep statistics on how many children fail to gain a place at the school of their choice at primary, secondary and special schools. Individual local education authorities may have information. Collecting reliable data is difficult, because many parents apply for places at more than one school and it may not be clear which is their first preference. Research published by the Department in June 2001 suggested that, nationally, 96 per cent. of parents receive an offer of a place at one, at least, of the schools for which they express a preference.

 The Education Act 1996 sets out the local education authorities (LEAs) responsibilities in providing free transport to school for pupils of compulsory school age. Section 509(1) requires LEAs to make arrangements for the provision of transport as they consider necessary, so that pupils can attend school. This transport must be free. Section 509(3) enables authorities to pay the whole of part of a pupil's travelling expenses.
<P>

<a name="31021w08.html_para8">LEAs must provide free transport to denominational schools, where pupils live beyond the statutory walking distances, where they are the nearest suitable school that pupils can attend. Where pupils live closer to a non-denominational school, LEAs will provide free transport to a denominational school of their choice if they consider that transport is necessary, and they may otherwise provide assistance with travel costs. This is an area where LEAs exercise local discretion, taking into account the religious beliefs of parents and local circumstances.

The building work was planned, as far as was practicable, on the basis of the revised arrangements in order to cause minimum disruption. It is impossible to determine with any accuracy what the actual costs of alternative contracts might have been, but it is estimated that some &#163;90,000 of additional House of Commons works-related expenditure was incurred directly by the change to the recess period, out of a total forecast spend of around &#163;24 million. In addition, it is estimated that the income from public tours was about &#163;40,000 less as the result of moving them to later in September.

 The UK bilateral contribution to demining in Bosnia since 1997 is &#163;1 million which was paid in 2000&#150;01 into the International Trust Fund (ITF) for demining. The ITF is an international body of which the UN is a partner. These funds were used to support demining operations in the Kupres region of the country with priority being given to agricultural areas and areas being used for refugee return.

 The UK is a shareholder in a number of multilateral Development Banks which provide loans and loan guarantees for fossil fuel projects. The Government's policy is to ensure that these institutions comply with their own policies and procedures in all projects for which they provide finance. In considering whether to provide loans or loan guarantees this should include an assessment of the possible social and environmental impacts. In addition, our policy is to fully understand the developmental implications of fossil fuel projects. We are particularly concerned that the management of revenues from such projects occurs transparently and with a positive developmental impact.

also encompasses the services for family planning, contraception and childbearing that make an important contribution to increasing women's choice and opportunity and to preventing unplanned or unwanted pregnancy. Family planning services also provide an important opportunity to improve sexual health and in particular to increase women's access to methods that help prevent HIV infection. DFID's total expenditure cannot therefore be apportioned between HIV/AIDS and Family Planning, as many reproductive health programmes and projects contribute to both objectives (for example through the provision of information on family planning and HIV/AIDS prevention or the provision of condoms).

 The Open Health Institute is a Russian non-governmental organisation which works to resolve the most pressing health problems facing the Russian population. It was established in January 2003 as an independent NGO and previously was part of the Open Society Institute (Soros Foundation) in Russia. It continues to have a close affiliation with the Open Society Institute, from which it currently receives core funding. DFID is providing &#163;4.2 million to OSI/OHI for three years from September 2001 for a project which aims to reduce the transmission of HIV among injecting drug users and commercial sex workers in a network of over 40 harm reduction sites in Russia.

This work will be completed by the Design Authority Alvis Vickers Ltd. The approved cost for the Bowman project is &#163;2.073 billion (resource cost, VAT inclusive, for the Demonstration and Manufacture phases) and the approved cost for the Combat Infrastructure and Platform BISA (CIP) project is &#163;410 million (P BISA is an integral part of the CIP project).

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what estimate the Government have made of the number of people whose sight will be affected following the Government's decision to delay implementation of NICE's guidelines to make photo-dynamic therapy available to those suffering from age-related macular degeneration.

 <i>[holding answer 20 October 2003]</i>: We are not delaying implementation of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidance on photo-dynamic therapy (PDT).

 Building on the work of the existing Milton Keynes and South Midlands Steering Group, the proposed Milton Keynes and South Midlands Inter Regional Board will seek long-term commitment to delivery through high level executive membership from relevant agencies. The board, to be chaired by my right hon. Friend the Lord Rooker, would include representatives of areas of infrastructure delivery including: environment, industry, housing, water, transport, education, health, Regional Development Agencies and Regional Planning Bodies, relevant local authorities and delivery vehicles. Some other organisations will also be invited on specific topics. The board is expected to meet two to three times a year and, for the first time in its new role by the end of 2003.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the possible biological effects of terrestrial trunked/radio pulsing rates emanating from <i>(a)</i> handsets and <i>(b)</i> masts; what scientific research he collated to make this assessment; and how his Department's code of best practice applies the findings in respect of siting masts close to schools.  [131942]<P>

<P>
<a name="31021w19.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In 2001, the National Radiological Protection's Board independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) published a report on "Possible health effects from Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA)". The report concluded that it was unlikely that the specific features of TETRA handsets and repeaters could pose a risk to health.
<P>

<a name="31021w19.html_para6">The AGNIR report also concluded that signals from TETRA masts are not pulsed and confirmed that TETRA masts are similar to other mobile phone masts in terms of health and safety. There are no plans to issue specific guidance on the siting of TETRA masts close to schools.
<P>

<a name="31021w19.html_para7">The AGNIR experts' recommendations for further research were taken forward by the Home Office. Recent results from the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory show that signals from TETRA handsets have no effect on calcium exchanges in cells&#151;the main concern about TETRA technology. Further information on TETRA health and safety issues is available at www.homeoffice.gov.uk/docs/tetra.html

<a name="31021w19.html_para8">The SU published its interim analysis on 19 September and it is available on the unit's website www.strategy.gov.uk. The final report, which will set out the cross-governmental alcohol harm reduction strategy for England, is due for publication later in the year. Implementation of the strategy will begin according to timetable in 2004.

That legislation is still under consideration, and it is expected that we will be making a further statement about this matter in due course.

 In case ordering and priority ranking, a distinction is drawn between applications for a case review for those in custody and those who are at liberty or dead. Cases are generally reviewed in date order of receipt, with in-custody cases generally being assigned one year of priority over at-liberty cases. In-custody applicants requesting reviews of their sentences will generally be assigned priority over those applying for reviews of their convictions. Factors such as age and ill

<P>

<a name="31021w20.html_para0">However, I can confirm that the average turnaround times for Standard and Enhanced Disclosures across all business sectors is 24 days. Service turnaround times for Standard and Enhanced continue to exceed the CRB target of 90 per cent. of Standard Disclosures within two weeks and 90 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures within four weeks. The CRB expects to process the checks for new care home workers within this service standard. In July 2003, the average turnaround was 93.1 per cent. for Standard Disclosures and 93.5 per cent. for Enhanced Disclosures. Over the last four weeks, output has exceeded intake: 142,932 applications have been received and 145,117 have been issued. Since 11 March 2002, the CRB has issued over 2,364,312 Disclosures.

<P>

 The Prison Service has policies in place to try to ensure that deaf, and indeed all, disabled prisoners are able to participate fully in prison life and that their needs in terms of rehabilitation, maintaining family ties, and support generally, are met. Ensuring staff awareness of the needs of deaf prisoners remains a high priority for the Prison Service: disability and deaf awareness and communication skills for staff are included within diversity training across the Service.
<P>

<a name="31021w20.html_para1">Prisons are encouraged to employ British Sign Language (BSL) interpreters where necessary, for example, in adjudication hearings and in parole interviews. Although it is recognised that not all deaf and hard of hearing people use BSL, more staff in prisons are being trained in basic BSL skills and a small number of staff are more highly qualified and experienced signers.
<P>

<a name="31021w20.html_para2">Staff and managers in prisons are also becoming more aware of the need to ensure that deaf prisoners are able to access offending behaviour programmes, and are starting to explore alternative ways of delivering these programmes.

<a name="31021w20.html_para3">Great importance is placed on the maintenance of family ties for all prisoners; it is recognised that for deaf prisoners, this requires adjustments such as provision of textphones, and quiet areas and induction loops in visits halls to enhance the quality of visits. Wherever possible, prisons develop links with community groups, some of which support and visit deaf prisoners.

 The effectiveness of using UK freight searching equipment in France has been clear for some time.

Locally collated management information (which may be subject to revision and correction) indicates a fall of 72 per cent. in monthly detections by SED, from 975 in September 2002 to 270 in June 2003.

 The Government are committed to providing a firm, fast and fair asylum and immigration system. The reforms we introduced through the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum (NIA) Act 2002 have helped to deliver a significantly faster and more efficient system, which benefits both the taxpayer and those seeking legal entry or asylum in the United Kingdom. However, the Government believe that there are still too many examples of asylum applicants lodging groundless appeals to frustrate the asylum process and delay removal. Therefore, as my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary stated on 22 May 2003, we are drawing up further legislative measures to limit the scope for making unfounded appeals, including the possibility of moving to a single tier of appeal.

 The National Policing Plan, due for publication in November, will confirm the levels of improvement in performance required, by individual police forces and authorities, to deliver the existing Public Service Agreement targets (which cover the period April 2003&#151;March 2006; published in Cm 5571). It will be for individual police forces and authorities to ensure that these requirements are reflected in their local strategic and annual policing plans.

 The Prison Service has a statutory obligation to encourage and assist prisoners to maintain outside contacts. In recognition of the important role that visits can play in achieving this, as well as the benefits for prisoners' successful resettlement, all prisons have permanent visiting areas. Over 90 establishments provide additional facilities such as visitors' centres.
<P>

<a name="31021w22.html_para2">Prison Governors are required to comply with the duty under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to provide adequate facilities for people with disabilities and to make 'reasonable adjustments' to existing facilities. In particular, visitors to prison must be able to access all visits facilities. All establishments are currently assessing their facilities, but there is no central record of work conducted. Over 80 prisons provide play areas for children and an increasing number also offer extended day visits. Our policy is to encourage establishments to provide such facilities wherever possible, subject to individual operational and resource considerations.
<P>

<a name="31021w22.html_para3">Individual governors initiate refurbishments to prisons costing less than &#163;50,000 and the expenditure is incurred from their local budgets. Information on where such refurbishments have taken place and the costs involved are not held centrally. All newly built and contracted-out prisons are required to have a visitors' centre, distinct from visits halls, under the terms of their contract and the costs of building these range from around &#163;25,000 to &#163;200,000.
<P>

<a name="31021w22.html_para4">Prison Service policy is to provide adequate facilities and these are under constant review. However, as most improvements are not centrally resourced, there is no comprehensive record of work carried out, or of the associated costs.

 Detailed figures for the whole of last year are not available. I understand, however, from Merseyside Police that they estimate there were, over the summer months, around 1,000 complaints relating to the misuse of quad bikes in the force area. These resulted in about 100 prosecutions and cautions.
<P>

<a name="31021w22.html_para5">Over the summer months Merseyside Police undertook a specific operation against quad bike riders causing a nuisance. This operation specifically led to 17 prosecutions and 16 vehicles being seized under the provisions of section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002.

It has been sorted in descending order, according to the disparity between the two. There are a number of reasons, which I have outlined below, why these counts can vary so greatly and why some constituencies have more registered voters than the Census counted resident adults. Therefore, the data has been sorted, with the constituency showing the greatest number of adults not on the electoral register at the top, and the constituency showing the greatest number of adults registered to vote but not resident in that constituency according to the Census at the bottom.</FONT></UL>

 This information is not collected by my Department. The independent Electoral Commission is planning to undertake and complete early next year research building upon reports it has published in the past year, including "Making an Impact", in order to promote best practice guidance on tackling under-registration. The Government will consider carefully this research which we understand is intended to lead to the establishment of a national framework for the continued monitoring of electoral registration rates. The Electoral Commission is responsible for offering advice and guidance to electoral registration officers on these and other matters and will continue to encourage registration through various promotional activities.

The independent Electoral Commission, set up in 2000 with a remit to keep under review electoral law and practice, has carried out such research since then publishing reports examining the local promotion of electoral registration and voter engagement among black and minority ethnic communities. Arising from its more recent report, "the Electoral Registration Process" the Commission is planning to undertake and complete early next year a further research project to identify the extent and nature of under-registration in particular communities in Britain as well as reviewing the operation and impact of rolling registration. The Government welcomes this proposal and will give due consideration to any further recommendations the Commission may make as it does to all of the Commission's recommendations concerning electoral registration arrangements.
