 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what estimate her Department has made of the number of people in receipt of carer's allowance who may have recourse to national insurance contribution credits in accordance with the provisions of the National Insurance Contribution Credits (Transfer of Functions) Order 2009; and what estimate she has made of the monetary value of such credits in 2009-10.

<i> [holding answer 29 June 2009]:</i> Since 1976, people receiving carer's allowance (formerly invalid care allowance) have normally been awarded National Insurance credits for weeks for which the allowance is paid unless they have a valid married women's election. The National Insurance Contributions Credits (Transfer of Functions) Order 2009 is an enabling instrument which allows HMRC to award and administer National Insurance credits on behalf of the Secretary of State. It does not provide for any new credits. However, it is anticipated that regulations will be introduced shortly which will extend the range of credits available for certain people engaged in caring from April 2010. These credits will have no monetary value in 2009-10 since they will not be available before 6 April 2010.</p>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the average waiting time for a caller to each of HM Revenue and Customs 0845 telephone numbers was in each of the last 12 months; how much the average call to such an 0845 number cost the caller in each of those months; and how many callers received a recorded message telling them to call back later after having been put on hold in each of those months.

<i> [holding answer 18 June 2009]:</i> HMRC has in excess of 200 different 0845 numbers and cannot therefore provide waiting times for each of these numbers. The majority of calls to HMRC are centrally managed through contact centres and the performance data for these calls are aggregated by each tax/head of duty. In the last 12 months, customers calling the main lines of business waited, on average, the following minutes and seconds before their call was answered by an adviser.</p>

The increase in expenditure has occurred because it was recognised that, in the transition from the Department of Constitutional Affairs to the Ministry of Justice, the Press Office function needed to be enhanced to satisfactorily meet the demands placed upon it from all forms of media. As a major Department of state, the Ministry touches the lives of all citizens, and it is important that the public understands how taxpayers money is being used and the services that it provides. The Ministry&#146;s support and administrative staff working in press office are an integral part of the team, helping with daily operations and smooth running of the area.</p>

Probation staff were selected for the posts generated by the restructure through established secondment arrangements. It is not possible for probation staff to apply for permanent positions in the civil service other than through open competition where the post is advertised externally. Probation staff are employees of probation areas and secondment arrangements ensure that an appropriate level of integration takes place.</p>

 The available data are shown in the following table. The data show the number of offenders sentenced to immediate custody for child neglect and sexual abuse of children in the last year for which figures are available. The term &#147;child abuse&#148; has no specific recognised definition but includes a range of sexual and physical offences against children, such as it describes harm caused to a child arising from physical, sexual abuse or neglect caused by a parent, guardian, carer, or stranger. A number of other offences such as offences against the person including physical assault may frequently be used by the police to charge offenders but where the age of the victim is not known. This data are based on the principal offence. Where an offender has been sentenced for more than one offence it is the one for which the heaviest sentence was imposed, where the same sentence has been imposed for more than one offence the principal offence is the one for which the statutory maximum is most severe.</p>

A Use of Force Report Form is completed by each member of staff involved in its use, to explain the circumstances in which force was used. Establishments are required to examine this information on a regular basis to determine if there any particular problems in relation to use of force or any resulting injuries. To obtain information on the number of injuries sustained during use of restraint would require contacting each young offender establishment and asking them to analyse their forms for every single use of force for the past five years.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="90701w0007.htm_para2"><a name="09070169000451">The information is subject to important qualifications. The NOMS Incident Reporting System processes high volumes of data which are constantly being updated. The numbers provide a good indication of overall numbers but should not be interpreted as absolute. Rises or falls in reported numbers from one year to the next are not a good indicator of an underlying trend for a particular prison. Additionally there have been improvements in reporting over the years, and this is reflected in the tables.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="90701w0007.htm_para3"><a name="09070169000452">Assault data are complex and the numbers need to be interpreted with caution. Information recorded as assault incidents may involve one or many prisoners as some assault incidents may involve more than one assailant or more than one victim. Additionally in a proportion of incidents only the victim is known.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="90701w0007.htm_para4"><a name="09070169000453">Reducing violence in prisons is a priority for Ministers, NOMS and the Prison Officers Association and they are collectively committed to working towards a zero tolerance approach to prison violence. Since 2004, a national strategy has directed every public sector prison to have in place a local violence reduction strategy and since mid 2007 this has been applied to the public and contracted out estate. A whole prison approach is encouraged, engaging all staff, all disciplines and prisoners in challenging unacceptable behaviour, problem-solving and personal safety.</p>

 Any death in prison custody is a tragic event. The Government, Ministry of Justice and the National Offender Management Service, (NOMS) is committed to learning from such events and reducing the number of self-inflicted deaths in prison custody. NOMS has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses a wide spectrum of Prison and Department of Health work around such issues as mental health, substance misuse and resettlement. Any prisoner identified as at risk of suicide or self-harm is cared for using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) procedures. ACCT is the prisoner-centred flexible care-planning system introduced across the prisons estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005-07.</p>

The length of time Onset data might be retained will depend on local authorities&#146; own data retention policies and on issues such as whether the young person goes on to offend, the nature of the offence and the disposal applied.</p>

 We are deeply concerned about the situation in Karen State and reports of renewed fighting between the Karen National Union and the Democratic Karen Buddhist army, who are supported by the Burmese army. Attacks carried out by the Burmese army and their Karen client organisations on civilians in Karen State have been particularly intense over the past two years.

Most recently at meetings between our ambassador and Burmese Ministers on 18 and 19 June 2009. In response to the recent upsurge in violence and reports of large numbers of civilians fleeing over the Thai border, the Czech presidency of the EU, with our strong support, issued a statement on 11 June 2009 calling for an end to the hostilities. It expressed particular concern about the humanitarian impact of the ongoing conflict. We fully support this call and our embassy in Rangoon continues to monitor the situation closely.</p>

 The key economic criteria for the EU&#146;s free-trade agreement partners should be market potential (economic size and growth) and the level of protection against EU export interests (tariffs and non-tariff barriers).

 The property price cap for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme is not set at one national value; the cap varies regionally to reflect the differing level of property prices. These regional property price caps for the Mortgage Rescue Scheme have been set with reference to Q4 2008 lower quartile property prices, reflecting the aim of the scheme to provide targeted support for vulnerable households at risk of homelessness. The level of the caps was increased on 1 May and is now at least 150 per cent. of lower quartile property prices in each region which are comparable to average house prices in all English regions. We have no plans to increase the caps further. Housing Associations already have flexibility to exceed the cap if appropriate depending on households&#146; individual circumstances.</p>

For example, next generation broadband services such as two-way video conferencing may lead to lower road congestion and pollution because they encourage greater use of tele-working which reduces the need to travel. This is because more people find it convenient to work from home or use tele-conferencing instead of physical meetings with their suppliers and customers. Evidence from Australia reveals that in 2006, over a third of SMEs introduced tele-working and that broadband was an influential factor in the decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_575"><a name="90701w0019.htm_para3"><a name="09070179000429">The Digital Britain action plan will support this by facilitating the rollout of new networks including shared networks and networks which use existing infrastructure. Laying down the necessary fibre network may increase carbon emissions and an increasing use of applications which require higher bandwidth (e.g. video conferencing) may lead to increased power consumption. The Government are seeking to minimise the energy demands and waste created by new technology and infrastructure by building in a sustainability element to the Digital Inclusion Champion&#146;s role, and by including sustainability  <br>

 1. Includes activity in English NHS hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
 2. Alcohol-related admissions<br>
 The number of alcohol-related admissions is based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory. Figures for under 16s only include admissions where one or more of the following alcohol-specific conditions were listed:<br>
 Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (I42.6)<br>
 Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
 Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br>
 Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
 Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
 Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing&#146;s syndrome (E24.4)<br>
 Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br>
 Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
 Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
 Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
 Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
 Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
 Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br>
 3. Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-related primary or secondary diagnosis<br>
 These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-related diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-related diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
 4. Ungrossed data<br>
 Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
 5. Finished admission episodes<br>
 A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
 6. Data quality<br>
 HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
 7. Assessing growth through time<br>
 HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
 Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
 8. Assignment of Episodes to Years<br>
 Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient&#146;s hospital stay.<br>

<i> Finished Consultant Episode (FCE)</i><br>
A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a continuous period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider, FCEs are counted against the year in which they end. The figures do not represent the number of different patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the same stay in hospital or in different stays in the same year.<br>
<i> Selected strategic health authorities (SHAs)</i><br>
<sup>(1)</sup> Counts for SHAs include patients whose SHA of residence was Northumberland, Tyne and Wear Strategic HA and County Durham and Tees Valley Strategic HA for each year between 1998-99 and 2005-06.<br>
<sup>(2)</sup> Counts for SHAs include patients whose SHA of residence was North East Strategic HA for each year between 2006-07 and 2007-08.<br>
<i> Primary care trust (PCT)/SHA data quality</i><br>
PCT and SHA data was added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 national health service trusts and PCTs in England. Data are also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English national health service. The National Health Service Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the national health service have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in national health service practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>

A copy of the relevant section has been placed in the Library.
