 As part of the celebrations for International Women's Day, the Women and Equality Unit launched an excellent pack for young people&#151;"Does Sex Make a Difference", and I opened the International Women's Day adjournment debate in the House of Commons, and launched a special 50p coin to commemorate the hundredth anniversary of the formation of the Women's Social and Political Union.

 To ask the Minister for Women what consultations the Minister has had with the Minister for Lifelong Learning and Higher Education regarding the different level of difficulty men and women have in repaying student debts.  [103904]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt </B>

 To ask the Minister for Women what steps she is taking to support the development of child care as a business.  [103906]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Child care businesses, particularly micro-businesses and social enterprises, need support and skills training in order to be sustainable. We are working with DfES and DWP to improve links and support between Business Link Operators and child care business support officers to this end. A specific targeted programme of support, including provision of good practice, workshops, resource packs, a helpline and a website, is scheduled to start in May and run until March 2004.

 To ask the Minister for Women what plans she has to propose legislation against sex discrimination against women in private members' clubs.  [103907]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
: I welcome the Sex Discrimination (Clubs and Other Associations) Bill, introduced by my hon. Friend the Member for Gloucester (Mr. Dhanda) on 4 February 2003. There is no question that the 



<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2003 : Column 864W</I><P>
inequalities which persist in some mixed-sex clubs are out of date and contrary to this Government's principles of opportunity for all.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para0">While I can make no commitment on parliamentary time, this is a matter which we will keep under review.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps she is taking to ensure that small businesses are encouraged to bid for public sector contracts.  [103890]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_spnew4"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 Small firms make a vital contribution to the public sector. A survey of selected departments and agencies shows 50 per cent. of our contracts go to SMEs with a value of &#163;730 million.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para1">We have cut the requirement to provide three years accounts, to two years and I now want the requirement abolished to encourage start-ups and fledgling businesses.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para2">And this new booklet "Smaller supplier&#151;better value" supports our new web portal for small firms seeking Government contracts.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para3">But there is much much more we can and must do.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 Since the beginning of November 2002 I have received 2,078 representations indicating a desire to see tighter controls on fireworks. These comprise 1,588 letters from the general public, 476 letters from MPs, eight Petitions, and six meetings with representatives from various organisations interested in improving fireworks legislation.

 The Government held a public consultation on the proposed directive from 10 July 2002 to 18 November 2002. A summary of responses to the public consultation has been placed in the Library of the house, along with an Explanatory Memorandum and a Regulatory Impact Assessment.

<a name="30320w01.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>World Trade</H3>


<P>
14. <a name="30320w01.html_wqn7"><B> Norman Lamb: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on current negotiations regarding TRIPS.  [103894]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government are disappointed that the WTO did not reach agreement on TRIPS and Public Health by the deadline of December last year.

<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para4">The US was the only member of the WTO who could not accept the proposal on the table.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para5">We will continue to work with all WTO members to resolve this issue as soon as possible.

<P>
18. <a name="30320w01.html_wqn8"><B> David Taylor: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action she is taking to achieve a world trade agreement in the interests of developing countries.  [103898]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 We are committed to ensuring that the Doha Development Agenda delivers substantial benefits to all WTO members, especially developing countries.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para6">In particular this means making substantial progress on agricultural liberalisation, TRIPS and Public Health and Special and Differential Treatment.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para7">Halving protectionism, according to EU figures, would increase developing countries income by an estimated $150 billion per year&#151;more than three times the world's current aid budgets.

 Following parliamentary approval in October, the programme is going ahead in accordance with the code of practice agreed with Postwatch. I met with Postwatch yesterday to assess their role in reviewing each urban sub-post office closure proposal.

<P>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps she is taking to ensure that British industry plays a substantial role in reconstruction following a possible conflict in Iraq.  [103897]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 We wish to see UK companies play a substantial role in the humanitarian and reconstruction process in Iraq. British firms have a wealth of experience in the Middle East. We have made this clear to USAID and will continue to discuss with British business how they can best contribute to the development of Iraq for the benefit of the Iraqi people.

<P>
19. <a name="30320w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what steps she is taking to increase child care provision by employers.  [103899]




<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2003 : Column 866W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_spnew12"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 We recognise that employers play an important role in providing access to good quality, affordable child care. The Paymaster General launched a consultation in February on proposals to extend the tax and national insurance exemptions on employer supported child care. The tax and national insurance proposals aim to provide a better incentive for more employers to support a wider range of formal child care for all working parents, helping the growth and sustainability of child care provision.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para8">In addition we will be looking at the results of the Work-Life Balance survey of employers to see what other support is needed to provide more child care provision by employers.

<a name="30320w01.html_sbhd12"><H3 align=center>Ambition Construction Programme</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_wqn13"><B> Matthew Green: </B>

[102659]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w01.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para9">In 2001, we launched the Ambition initiative to help unemployed and disadvantaged people gain the right skills to meet the needs of employers in key sectors such as construction.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para10">Ambition: Construction has been operational since June 2002 with pilots currently running in six locations. Training is provided across the full range of building skills, including bricklaying, roofing, plastering, joinery, glazing and painting and decorating. The aim of this training is to provide participants with the skills they need for a wide variety of jobs in the construction industry, including house building.
<P>

<a name="30320w01.html_para11">By the end of February 2003, 420 people had started training on the programme. Most of the training courses on this programme last 26 weeks and so only 64 people have so far completed training. However, 54 of these have already started work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when the most recent internal phone directory for the Department was published; how often it is updated; and if he will place a copy in the Library.  [101786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The internal phone directory for my Department is published electronically in the form of an online database known as people@dti. Keeping their

<P>

<a name="30320w02.html_para0">My Department is in the process of developing an offline version of the directory for those in government who do not have access to the online version. When this is available, and staff have been informed in accordance with the provisions of the Data Protection Act 1998,1 will place a copy in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="30320w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
: I understand that National Grid Transco are considering, with Statnett, the Norwegian grid operator, the construction of an interconnector between the UK and Norway that will enable the import of electricity from Norway&#151;and exports to Norway. While this is a commercial project, and not directly a matter for my Department, I nonetheless welcome it as increased interconnection provides greater flexibility and security.
<P>

<a name="30320w02.html_para2">I am aware that a high proportion of Norwegian electricity is generated by hydro-power, although from time to time, and especially in periods of low rainfall. Norway is a net importer of electricity, which may be from fossil sources.

Advertising is used by Departments when they judge it is the most cost effective way of delivering the publicity necessary to support a policy or proposal. These figures represent the advertising commissioned on behalf of Departments and Agencies by the Central Office of Information. The figures for the total publicity spend of Government Departments is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The responsibility for ensuring that the guidance. on propriety is observed and that value for money is being achieved rests with Ministers and Heads of Departments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In order to protect the British poultry industry from avian influenza (AI) the Department has taken the following steps.
<P>

<a name="30320w03.html_para1">On 21 February 2003 and 3 March 2003 Defra and the Devolved Administrations issued Declarations under Regulation 27 of the Animals and Animal Products (Import and Export) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 (and equivalent legislation in the devolved territories) introducing a ban on the import of live poultry and hatching eggs into the UK from Hong Kong and the Netherlands respectively following outbreaks of avian influenza in these countries. These Declarations make it a criminal offence to import live poultry and hatching eggs into the UK from both Hong Kong and the Netherlands. Following a suspicion of AI in Belgium, a further Declaration was issued on 12 March 2003 prohibiting the import of live poultry and hatching eggs from Belgium.
<P>

<a name="30320w03.html_para2">In addition to the above, on 14 March 2003 Defra also banned the import of racing/show pigeons into England from the Netherlands and Belgium under domestic 



<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2003 : Column 872W</I><P>
legislation due to the disease risk they presented. Similar Declarations are being introduced in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30320w03.html_para3">In normal circumstances, all birds (poultry or captive birds) entering the UK must be accompanied by an EU model health certificate stating that premises and area of origin are free from AI. In addition, captive bird imports into the UK from Third Countries are subject to a 30 days quarantine during which birds must be laboratory tested for avian influenza.
<P>

<a name="30320w03.html_para4">Defra has reminded egg and poultry producers in the UK about the need for stringent biosecurity measures at all times. To minimise the introduction of AI into their flocks by means of faecal contamination, poultry producers should ensure that their boots, clothing, equipment and vehicles are disinfected. Access by wild birds should be minimised, for instance by clearing up feed spillages. Officials have asked poultry producers in the UK to be vigilant for any signs of respiratory disease in birds and contact their local veterinary office immediately if they have any concerns.
<P>

<a name="30320w03.html_para5">The Department is monitoring the AI situation in the Netherlands and Belgium, and should there be any significant change the risk assessment for the UK will be reviewed.

<P>

<a name="30320w03.html_para6">The UK has used satellite surveillance on a trial basis, with the Coastguard Maritime Rescue and Coordination Centre acting as the focal point. The experience was positive, and my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Transport is keen to develop the facility further. The UK already shares satellite information with other Contracting Parties to the Bonn Agreement, and we are working with those Parties and with the EC Management Committee on Marine Pollution with a view to establishing an international monitoring programme.

<a name="30320w04.html_para5">Since publication of Waste Strategy 2000, which set national targets for the recycling or composting of at least 25 per cent. of household waste by 2005 and 30 per cent. by 2010, we have set statutory recycling and composing targets for all local authorities to achieve these goals. We have also introduced the Waste Minimisation and Recycling Fund to support local authority investment in appropriate infrastructure. We have also set up the Waste Resources Action Plan (WRAP) to help create stable and efficient markets for recycled materials and to remove market barriers to waste minimisation, reuse and recycling. And the Waste Emissions and Trading Bill will, by setting reducing ceilings on the amount of biodegradable municipal waste going to landfill, provide an indirect incentive to increase recycling.

 The United Kingdom's bilateral relations with France, Germany and Russia remain close.

There are areas of policy on which we do not agree on tactics e.g. Iraq.

Our consular staff will attend the next court hearing on 10 April and will continue to keep the family fully informed of developments. I do not consider that a meeting with my hon.

 The Ministry of Defence reviewed its employment policies in accordance with the Government's Code of Practice for Age Diversity in Employment and took steps to integrate age into its equal opportunities policies through implementation of the Performance and Innovation Unit's report "Winning the Generation Game". This made specific recommendations for the civil service to ensure that policies are age-proofed in preparation for the legislation to be introduced in 2006. The review was concluded in May 2002. It included consideration of raising the retirement age to allow those staff who currently have a retirement age of 60 the option to stay on to the age of 65. The conclusion was that there should be no change to the retirement policy at this stage, but that it should be kept under review in light of the emerging legislation. The Ministry of Defence is committed to ensuring that its employment policies do not discriminate unfairly on grounds of age or for any other reason.

 Air transport is the normal method of movement for Service Personnel and their families travelling to and from the United Kingdom.

The booking of seats on civilian commercial flights to destinations not served by air trooping services, or to which service flights are not available at the time required, is permissible but only with the prior approval of the appropriate budget holder.

 Four companies (Electronic Data Systems, ASI, and Cap Gemini Ernst and Young, with IBM acting in a project integration role) were contracted to provide elements of the Defence Stores Management Solution (DSMS). The programme was suspended in January 2002 on grounds of affordability, and the Department is currently reviewing its requirements for an advanced inventory management capability that takes account of developments in software technology and in the light of independent external advice from McKinsey and Co.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what Royal Navy training exercises and planned deployments have been cancelled as a result of Operation Fresco.  [103997]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The majority of personnel providing fire cover for Operation Fresco have been taken from ships and submarines undergoing periods of refit or maintenance, or which had returned from operational deployments and were not programmed to undergo further deployments. Only two of the ships from which personnel were taken for fire-fighting duties were prevented from undertaking operational tasks: HMS Manchester was withdrawn from NATO's Standing Force Atlantic, and HMS Lancaster from Atlantic Patrol (South). As a result, HMS Lancaster was withdrawn from the Chilean-hosted exercise Teamwork South 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government estimate that there are currently approximately 100 filling stations retailing biodiesel in the UK, with the distribution of outlets largely skewed towards the north of the country. The number and regional availability of these sites is expected to continue to increase as the market develops further, driven by the 20 pence per litre duty incentive, introduced in July 2002, and positive customer reaction to the fuel.
<P>

<a name="30320w08.html_para1">Biofuels are one of the many ways in which companies and individuals can reduce the impact on the environment of their transport decisions. In order to give consumers better access to information on biofuels, the Government have commissioned the Energy Saving Trust to develop its TransportEnergy website (www.TransportEnergy.co.uk) to include helpful advice on biofuels, including the location of UK retailing sites. This information should be on-line shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The Office of Fair Trading examined the UK market for retail pharmacy services in order to consider whether consumers are best served by the current statutory controls under which pharmacies can dispense NHS prescriptions. The OFT conclusion was that they are not and their report therefore recommended abolition of these controls in order to improve competition; reduce prices for over the counter medicines; and improve both access to, and the quality of, pharmaceutical services.
<P>

<a name="30320w09.html_para0">Competition and consumer matters are reserved to the United Kingdom Government in Westminster and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is responsible for co-ordinating the response across Government to the report. However, Health Service pharmacy policy is a devolved matter and the regulations imposing controls on pharmacies are a matter for Ministers in each country. The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry is therefore working closely with Health Departments and other Government Departments to make sure that Government's response to the report takes account not only of competition and consumer interests, but widerpublic policy objectives. It is not considered that the report will affect current prescription charge arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30320w09.html_para1">No decisions have been reached on the OFT recommendation and, as yet, there are no proposals for changes to the legislation. We have invited views from a wide range of stakeholders and are considering these carefully. This includes responses from political representatives, the pharmaceutical profession, the Health Service, patient representative bodies and the general public.

<P>

<a name="30320w10.html_para7">Under most circumstances, we would expect Connexions Partnerships to enter into a contract with each of their service providers, including voluntary and community organisations. However, in some cases the need for a contract may present a barrier to an organisation's involvement, particularly in the case of some small voluntary or community groups. In such circumstances, Partnerships can allocate up to &#163;30,000 to an organisation as a grant award in any 12-month period. The total amount awarded in this way is subject to an overriding limit of 5 per cent. of the Partnership's DfES grant allocation, although this may be exceeded with the agreement of the local Government Office. While Partnerships are strongly encouraged to make use of this facility, priorities and structures inevitably vary between and within areas, and it is for this reason that we do not set targets.

 The Department does not specifically fund either fire prevention measures or the installation of water sprinklers in schools and FE colleges. If the assessment of risks to particular premises identify specific fire prevention measures, including water sprinklers, as necessary then the expenditure would come from normal school, local education authority or FE college budgets, drawing on capital allocations made available to them by the Department.

<P>
<P>

 Yes. Where a LEA is the admission authority for a school it decides on the school's admission arrangements, which must include criteria for deciding which pupils should get places if there are more applicants than places. Proximity to the school is a lawful and acceptable criterion.

 <i>[holding answer 17 March 2003]</i>: We do not hold complete information in the form requested. However, in 1997&#150;98 the Government introduced New Deal for Schools (NDS) as a new additional programme targeted specifically at addressing the backlog of urgent repairs in school buildings that had built up after eighteen years of under-funding under the previous administration. This programme was bid-based and was in addition to other capital funds made available to Warrington local education authority (Cheshire local education authority prior to local government reorganisation in 1998&#150;99). NDS ran through four phases from 1997&#150;98 to 2000&#150;01. Table A shows the schools in the Warrington, North constituency which benefited from investment through the original NDS programme for these purposes. From 2001&#150;02 most capital funding available for building improvements in schools has been allocated to local authorities and schools by needs-related formulae. It is for local authorities and schools to decide how their capital allocations are invested and prioritised between projects, in line with their local asset management planning. Also, from 2000&#150;01 every school has received direct capital allocations to address their highest priorities. In addition, each year authorities have been able to bid for Basic Need funding for the provision of new pupil places. Table B shows all capital funding for school buildings allocated to Warrington local education authority (including voluntary aided schools) since 1998&#150;99.

 The Government has earmarked almost &#163;300 million in funds for the new Higher Education Grant. The Grant will be phased in, cohort by cohort, starting in autumn 2004, and therefore, during this spending review period, the costs will gradually build up towards that level of expenditure.

<a name="30320w12.html_para2">The Pensions Green Paper, "Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement" was published for consultation in December of last year and includes a proposal that the age at which unreduced pensions should be payable to members of Public Service Pension Schemes should be raised from age 60 to 65, to reflect increasing longevity and common practice in the private sector. The paper acknowledges that some occupations require a recognised physical capacity which justifies payment of pension at a lower age and the Armed Forces pay an immediate pension as early as age 37. However, for those members who leave before reaching such an age, their pensions benefits accrued through future service from a date to be decided would also be deferred to age 65. The Ministry of Defence will be offering its comments on this and other proposals put forward in the Green Paper shortly.

For the remainder of the 2000&#150;2001 financial year, there were 234 calls to the Hotline. In the 2001&#150;2002 financial year there were 418

calls. Between April 2002 and early March 2003, there have been 314 calls. Advisers on the Hotline also carry out a range of other customer service duties, and so it is not possible to isolate the cost of the Hotlines.

<P>
<a name="30320w12.html_spnew11"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The new tax credits&#151;Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit&#151;are introduced in April. A high-profile publicity campaign has been running since last autumn to alert people to their entitlement and to encourage them to claim. The campaign has so far included national television advertising, national and local radio advertising, adverts in the national press as well as on-line publicity. Treasury ministers led a series of roadshows across the United Kingdom in September and October. Leaflets and posters have been produced and are being made widely available. The Inland Revenue is also piloting new ways of working with local community groups to maximise take-up. At the same time Jobcentre Plus offices are making sure their clients are aware of the help they can get, through the Working Tax Credit, as they move into work.

 None. Whether reasons are given is a matter for the Court. The Court has ceased to write explanatory letters in these circumstances as part of its attempts to streamline its procedures in order to deal with its backlog of cases (35,000, and rising at the rate of 1,000 per month). Cases declared inadmissible by a Committee of three judges are often vexatious and clear-cut.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what steps he is taking to ensure that financial advice is available to those persuaded to open bank accounts for the first time by the changes in benefit and pension distribution through the Post Office.  [101438]<P>

 Government Departments and the Post Office will provide customers with full factual information about their banking options but are not qualified to and must not advise customers on which account is most suitable. It is for customers to choose which account best meets their needs and circumstances. Customers who are having difficulty deciding which account is best for them can seek advice from independent organisations.

<a name="30320w15.html_para1">Both Agencies treat all post and claim forms as confidential items taking all necessary action resulting from that post, both promptly and accurately. If a customer reports that an item of post has not been actioned, Agency staff will check to ensure that it has not been misplaced within the office. If a claim to benefit is delayed because the Agencies have lost forms or papers they will make every effort to ensure that the customer does not suffer unduly by rectifying the situation as quickly as possible. In a case of maladministration where a customer suffers financial loss, stress or is put to additional inconvenience, the Agencies can, in addition, make financial redress through our special payments schemes.

 Provided that the Home Office is satisfied that a marriage has broken down due to domestic violence, it can apply a concession to the immigration rules (during the probationary one-year period), giving the victim indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom. This provision allows victims of domestic violence to claim social security benefits.

 Expenditure on the minimum income guarantee for 2002&#150;03 is expected to be around &#163;4.5 billion. This reflects the current number of MIG recipients recorded in administrative data and any fluctuations expected throughout the financial year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w16.html_wqn3"><B> Jane Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if her Department will make contingency plans in the case of a shortfall in an occupational pension scheme to prevent a UK subsidiary of an overseas group abandoning the scheme and not meeting any funding shortfall.  [103393]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Provisions already exist to prevent companies from abandoning and not meeting any funding shortfall in occupational pension schemes. If a salary-related pension scheme is operating with tax approval, and is subject to the Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR), then a wide range of requirements under the Pensions Act 1995 apply to that scheme. This includes the funding of the scheme as determined by the MFR, and the requirement to maintain a schedule of contributions. The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) has the power to sanction scheme managers or trustees who fail to take reasonable steps to comply with these requirements.
<P>

<a name="30320w16.html_para5">Also, legislation provides that when a salary-related scheme winds up, or a sponsoring employer becomes insolvent, any deficiency in the pension fund becomes a debt on the employer. This provides a mechanism for the trustees to be able to take action to pursue the debt.




<P>
<P><I>20 Mar 2003 : Column 927W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30320w16.html_para6">The pensions Green Paper, ' Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement', Cm 5677, published on 17 December, discusses two options (the full buy-out option and the partial buy-out option) for changes to the debt on the employer provisions that might result in more funds being put into a scheme when a solvent employer chooses to wind it up. This would strengthen protection for scheme members, however this needs to be balanced against the costs on employers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what guidance he gives on protection for members of occupational pension schemes operated by companies whose parent company is listed overseas.  [103396]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) produces guides to help pension scheme trustees understand some of the legal and technical issues involving pensions law. It also provides fact sheets for members of occupational pension schemes.
<P>

<a name="30320w16.html_para7">If a salary-related pension scheme is operating with tax approval, and is subject to the Minimum Funding Requirement (MFR), then a wide range of requirements under the Pensions Act 1995 apply to that scheme. This includes the funding of the scheme as determined by the MFR, the requirement to maintain a schedule of contributions and, when a salary-related scheme winds up, or a sponsoring employer becomes insolvent, any deficiency in the pension fund becomes a debt on the employer. That fact that the parent company of the principal employer sponsoring the pension scheme may be listed overseas is therefore not directly relevant.
<P>

<a name="30320w16.html_para8">The protection that people receive if their pension scheme is wound up is important, and we need to do more to protect the rights of scheme members. That is why we are consulting on proposals within the pensions Green Paper 'Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement', published on 17 December, aimed at improving protection for scheme members on wind up. This includes proposals to share out scheme assets more fairly, introduce some form of insurance and strengthen protection for members whose solvent employer chooses to wind up its scheme.
<P>

<a name="30320w16.html_para9">We are consulting on our Green Paper, 'Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement', Cm 5677 at the moment, and the consultation period runs until 28 March 2003.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister pursuant to his answer of 6 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1202W, on the local government grant settlement, if he will list the specific and special grants to which he refers; which of them are ringfenced; what amount in cash terms is available for distribution to <i>(a)</i> local authorities and <i>(b)</i> other organisations for each; when he plans for bids to be submitted to him for a share of each grant; and if he will make a statement.  [103323]<P>

<a name="30320w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The following table gives up-to-date details of specific and special grants announced for 2003&#150;04. Some grants are bid for and successful bids

receive allocations. The majority are allocated to all qualifying authorities by a formula or on an agreed basis. The definition of ring-fencing was updated last year to reflect the types of grant which now exist. Some grants previously classified as ring-fenced are not now classified in this way. The key distinction made remains that ring-fenced grants are those which restrict local authority spending. For completeness the following list includes all special grants inside Aggregate External Finance. Further details of classifications are in an annex to the freedoms and flexibilities announcement of 26 November. Under the terms of the freedoms and flexibilities announcement, from 2003&#150;04, the majority of the grants in the following table are unfenced for excellent performers. Exceptions include those grants which must be passed to schools, and the supporting people grant, where in view of the legislative requirements, different arrangements are in place for removing ring-fencing for excellent performers.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister for what reason his Department did not communicate directly with local authorities likely to be affected by the decision to abolish local authority social housing grant from 1 April, prior to the publication of the ministerial statement on 5 March.  [102754]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister consulted local authorities on the principle of abolishing local authority social housing grant last autumn. In the light of work on the communities plan, we decided to make this reform quickly&#151;provided transitional arrangements were in place to ensure that well-advanced, good quality schemes were able to go ahead.
<P>

<a name="30320w19.html_para3">In addition to two letters circulated to all local authorities in England outlining our decision, officials of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister held three face-to-face meetings with local authority representatives in February to discuss transitional funding.

<P>
<a name="30320w19.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hammond: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of the number of social housing schemes which will not proceed as a result of the abolition of the local authority social housing grant.  [103263]<P>

<P>
<a name="30320w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 In my statement of 5 March I announced increased provision for transitional arrangements for local authority social housing grant (LASHG). Transitional funding will now support investment in social housing of up to &#163;550 million&#151;&#163;50 million more than we provided in 2002&#150;03 from LASHG, and higher than in any previous year. The number of affordable homes to be built in 2003&#150;04 using this funding will not be known until after 30 June 2003, which is the deadline for both with-debt and debt-free authorities to submit new schemes for 2003&#150;04 to the Housing Corporation.

 The Immigration Service does not routinely collect the information requested.

 The authorised operational capacity of Ashfield young offender institution is 400 (303 juveniles (15 to 17 years' of age) and 97 over 18-year-olds). It is currently operating within a reduced capacity of 212 places. On the night of 16&#150;17 March 2003, there were 192 juveniles. There are no prisoners over 18-years-old at the institution. The Youth Justice Board (YJB) has not yet specifically transferred any prisoner out of Ashfield and is seeking alternative accommodation within the Prison Service with the view to fully withdrawing from Ashfield during 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="30320w19.html_para4">An agreed timetabled action plan has been put in place in response to the recommendations of the recent report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons on Ashfield. Some points from this action plan come into effect in April 2003 and monitoring of the plan will then start.
<P>

<a name="30320w19.html_para5">Offending behaviour programmes available to young people at Ashfield include: anger management; prevention of car crime; and Motivating Offenders to Rethink Everything (MORE). A new programme, Strength and Survival (SAS), is due to start in April. This programme focuses on confidence building and assertiveness for offenders.
<P>

<a name="30320w19.html_para6">Staffing levels at Ashfield are now up to complement and are adequate. Stringent monitoring arrangements are in place to ensure the contractor maintains these levels. Additional new staff are being recruited and trained, and experienced staff from other establishments are offering support. Reception staff are trained in suicide prevention measures and this is a core part of the initial training for all new custody officers.
<P>

<a name="30320w19.html_para7">Cells are allocated on the basis of risk assessments. Once allocated, the status of young people in both shared and single cells is reviewed regularly. There is an anti-bullying strategy in place at Ashfield. The strategy was audited by a team from the Area Office for juveniles in February 2003 and was judged to be compliant with national standards.
<P>

<a name="30320w19.html_para8">Purposeful activity levels are carefully monitored and will continue to be monitored. The delivery of purposeful activity has improved significantly in recent months, resulting in an average of 34 hours per week delivery since January 2003. The YJB specifies 30 hours per week. The appropriate contractual action will be taken should levels fall below 30 hours per week.
<P>

<a name="30320w19.html_para9">Ashfield has a written drug strategy in place which is monitored by the establishment's drug strategy group. Ashfield has also received a substantial amount of funding to enable them to increase their delivery of drug/substance misuse intervention programmes through an enhanced Counselling, Assessment, Referral, Advice and Throughcare (CARAT) service. All juvenile establishments have a written drug policy. The juvenile drug strategy is being reviewed by the Prison Service and the YJB and will result in the implementation of a new substance misuse strategy for young people. No cost has been incurred by the Prison Service in raising standards at Ashfield to meet the requirements of PS04950.

 The United Kingdom is committed to tackling the trafficking of children for sexual exploitation. Our strategy on trafficking is set out in the White Paper "Secure Border Safe Haven" and focuses on strengthening the law through new offences covering trafficking; providing appropriate support to victims of trafficking in the UK; tackling the criminals through intelligence and enforcement operations through the Reflex taskforce; European Union co-operation and prevention in source and transit countries in partnership with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Department for International Development.

<a name="30320w20.html_para0">The new Sexual Offences Bill sets out new wide-ranging offences covering trafficking for sexual exploitation to replace the stop-gap offence of trafficking for the purpose of prostitution, introduced in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. The offence of trafficking for sexual exploitation carries a tough maximum penalty of 14 years. In addition to this, the Bill also introduces a new offence of Commercial Sexual Exploitation of a child, which will protect children up to 18. It covers a range of offences, including buying the sexual services of a child, (for which the penalty ranges from seven years to life depending on the age of the child); and causing, facilitating or controlling the commercial sexual exploitation of a child in prostitution or pornography, for which the maximum penalty will be 14 years' imprisonment.
<P>

<a name="30320w20.html_para1">Child victims of trafficking are referred to social services to receive advice and support based on their particular needs. Under the Children Act 1989, local authorities have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those children's needs or, where appropriate, by arranging for the provision of services from other agencies. We are working with Department of Health on examples of good practice on how this commitment is delivered.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the level of service provided by the Criminal Records Bureau; and how many applications are waiting to be processed and what the average time taken is, broken down by employment sectors.  [103310]<P>

<P>
<a name="30320w20.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Since 11 March 2002 the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) has received 1,537,968 Disclosure applications and has issued 1,341,679 Disclosures. There are less than 44,000 applications currently outside our three week service standard. This figure has reduced from its peak of 109,000 during the summer of 2002 as a direct consequence of the targeted work that is being done to clear the oldest applications from the system. The current average time taken to process a Disclosure application stands at five weeks.
<P>

<a name="30320w20.html_para3">For the last four months the CRB has issued on average more Disclosures each week than it has received applications for, thereby reducing the number of outstanding cases. The CRB is issuing around 42,000 Disclosures per week, which is over double the weekly output issued by the police under the previous arrangements. There are no IT Procedures at present to extract information from the CRB database by employment sector. It is expected that this functionality will become available in subsequent system releases. No distinction is made in relation to the profession of an applicant as all applications are subject to the same level of service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what criteria he takes into account when assessing ex gratia payments for persons whose convictions have been quashed as a result of a miscarriage of justice; and if he will make a statement.  [103961]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30320w21.html_spnew1"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 While the Home Secretary decides whether an applicant qualifies for compensation, the assessment of the amount of compensation is undertaken by an Assessor appointed by the Home Secretary under the Criminal Justice Act 1988, currently the Lord Brennan QC. In statutory cases the amount of an award is wholly a matter for the Assessor and the Home Secretary has no power to influence or vary his determination. In ex gratia cases the Assessor's role is to advise the Home Secretary but successive Home Secretaries have agreed to be bound by the Assessor's advice.
<P>

<a name="30320w21.html_para1">In calculating the amount of compensation to be awarded to victims of miscarriages of justice, the Assessor applies principles analogous to those governing the assessment of damages for civil wrongs. The level of compensation is calculated in the same way whether the applicant qualified for compensation under the statutory scheme or the ex gratia scheme. The basis on which compensation is assessed is given in statute (section 133(4A) of the Criminal Justice Act 1988), in the Home Office "Compensation for Miscarriages of Justice&#151;Note for Successful Applicants" (copies of which have already been placed in the Library) and in individual assessments.

The main route of entry into the UK for economic purposes is the work permit scheme, which has recently been modernised, and which requires employees to submit applications on behalf of employees. There are a number of other labour-related entry routes such as the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme and Innovator categories. Other routes such as visitors, students, working holidaymakers and those that exist for family reunion and humanitarian protection, all place restrictions on the applicants ability to work in the UK.

3. Annual financial returns of primary care trusts.<P>

In December an agreement was awarded to 72 agencies for the supply of agency nurses, midwives, health visitors and health care assistants to the acute and primary care sectors of the NHS across London.<P>

This agreement will introduce new quality standards both in terms of the agency workers and also the services to be offered by the agencies. Furthermore it is anticipated that the cost of these agency workers will be reduced by between &#163;9 million and &#163;18 million across London during 2003&#150;04.<P>
