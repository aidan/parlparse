<p><a name="40712w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Tony Clarke: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what steps his Department is taking to encourage developing countries to use revenues from exports of energy supplies to support programmes combating poverty in Africa.  [183203]</p>








<p><a name="40712w01.html_spnew0"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID is promoting the transparency of payments and revenues from extractive industries in those countries where such industries contribute the major portion of government revenues. The Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, launched by the Prime Minister in 2002, is gaining support from several African countries including Nigeria, with discussions taking place in several others. What governments do with the revenues from the export of energy (in particular oil) is another issue. DFID is working with developing countries to assist them develop and implement their poverty reduction strategies, including the relative importance of forestry and other natural assets.

<p><a name="40712w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Hancock: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development if Her Majesty&#039;s Government will agree to earmark part of their financial contributions to the UN High Commission for Refugees specifically for North Korean refugees in China.  [182557]</p>









<p><a name="40712w01.html_spnew1"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID normally funds the UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) through un-earmarked funding&#151;ie UNHRC decide how to use resources based on their needs assessment process. DFID contributes &#163;17 million core un-earmarked funding per year under a bilateral Institutional Strategy Agreement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para0">
Un-earmarked funding allows UNHCR to prioritise their work based on humanitarian principles. Earmarking funds can contribute to inequitable and sometimes disproportionate resource allocation between crises.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para1">
This approach is part of wider international initiative on &#039;Good Humanitarian Donorship&#039;, which aims to improve humanitarian response through greater effectiveness, accountability and coordination between the key humanitarian organisations, including UNHCR to identify and agree prioritisation of need and hence equitable resource allocation. The UK is a strong supporter of good humanitarian donorship and has made commitments to take this forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para2">
DFID understands that the UNHCR do not have a funding problem in China hence there is no apparent need to vary DFID&#039;s normal approach.

<a name="40712w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Zambia</h3>





<p><a name="40712w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Caton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what representations his Department has received from non-governmental organisations about <i>(a)</i> trade liberalisation, <i>(b)</i> privatisation and <i>(c)</i> investment deregulation in Zambia; and if he will make a statement.  [182329]</p>








<p><a name="40712w01.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The reforms of the 1990s which dismantled pervasive government controls of Zambia&#039;s economy to establish a market based system have generated a vigorous and on-going debate in Zambia. The World Development Movement recently produced a report&#151;&quot;Zambia: Condemned to Debt&quot;&#151;adopting a largely critical view of these reforms. The evidence suggests a more positive view is justified.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para4">
Zambia&#039;s long run of economic decline is showing signs of reversal. Economic growth, which had been near zero from the mid 1970s to mid 1990s, has averaged 3.4 per cent. per annum since 1995. Zambia has experienced its longest period of sustained growth for three decades with the fifth successive year of positive growth in 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para5">
The pace of liberalisation and deregulation in the early 1990s was rapid. The impact of reform has varied across sectors. People working in urban manufacturing suffered from the removal of protection before alternative employment opportunities were available. The improved growth since 1995 has been insufficient to boost overall employment, although there have been new jobs in service sectors. A new and significant commercial agriculture sector has also emerged. This has provided most of the impressive growth in non-copper exports, which have expanded from US$100 million in the early 1990s to US$405 million in 2003. It has also improved livelihoods. Since the privatisation of the cotton sector the number of small farmers in out-grower schemes has risen from 50,000 to 250,000. However, people who lack commercial opportunities and those hardest hit by food insecurity and HIV/AIDS remain very vulnerable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para6">
The impact of privatisation has also been mixed. The reforms led to job losses during the 1990s, although this often reflected the struggling position of state enterprises before privatisation. The economic performance of these enterprises has improved, with 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Jul 2004 : Column 865W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
239 of 254 entities privatised still operating, but growth has been insufficient to provide significant new employment. Privatisation has also ended a major drain on government resources. For example Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines ran losses of US$15&#150;20 million per month in the two years prior to privatisation. This was equivalent to 69 per cent. of the entire health and education budgets during those years. Privatisation in this case has freed up significant resources for poverty reduction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para7">
The Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) believe that stronger diversification and private sector development, rather than continued dependence on copper and state industries, must be the basis for Zambia&#039;s long run growth and poverty reduction. The Department for International Development continues to provide significant support to Zambia as the Government seek to improve macroeconomic stability and the business environment in its efforts to achieve the 6&#150;8 per cent. growth required to reach the Millennium Development Goals.


</p>







<p><a name="40712w01.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Caton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what discussions <i>(a)</i> he and <i>(b)</i> his Department&#039;s officials have had with representatives of non-governmental organisations concerning the situation in Zambia.  [182330]</p>








<p><a name="40712w01.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Department for International Development (DFID) maintains a regular dialogue with non-governmental organisations in Zambia.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para8">
DFID works closely with Civil Society for Poverty Reduction (CSPR), whose members include major non-governmental organisations such as the Jesuit Centre for Theological Reflection, the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace and Oxfam. CSPR plays a significant role in contributing to the Government of the Republic of Zambia&#039;s Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) and in arguing for debt cancellation. The effectiveness of development assistance in the implementation of the PRS, and the need to look beyond the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Completion Point are regular themes of discussions with CSPR representatives. DFID agrees with CSPR that a new approach to aid delivery combined with sound budget and domestic debt management is required to ensure government is effective in delivering services for long term poverty reduction.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para9">
DFID has drawn on its dialogue with CSPR members and other non-governmental organisations to help identify key areas of vulnerability for the poor. This helped inform DFID&#039;s new Country Assistance Plan in highlighting food insecurity and HIV/AIDS as the most critical risks facing poor people in Zambia. DFID has recently agreed a Programme Partnership Agreement with CARE Zambia to enable the poorest to better manage social risk associated with food security, destitution and HIV/AIDS.


</p>







<p><a name="40712w01.html_wqn5"><b> Mr. Caton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what plans his Department 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Jul 2004 : Column 866W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
has <i>(a)</i> drawn up and <i>(b)</i> implemented to help reduce the number of people affected by HIV/AIDS in Zambia.  [182331]</p>








<p><a name="40712w01.html_spnew5"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Zambia has endured high HIV infection rates for many years. Currently the HIV prevalence rate among adults is 16 per cent. In June 2003, DFID Zambia began implementing a &#163;20 million five-year programme to tackle HIV/AIDS. Its main elements are:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">strengthening the National Aids Council (NAC);</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">providing public sector services such as drugs for treating sexually transmitted infections, education materials for use in schools, condoms, and supporting the prevention of mother to child transmission;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">funding civil society organisations that work on behaviour change, care and support of those infected and affected, and protecting human rights, particularly of women and girls; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">supporting HIV/AIDS private sector workplace interventions.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para10">
In addition, DFID&#039;s &#163;20 million Zambia Health Programme (2001&#150;05) is strengthening health systems in Zambia. A new &#163;10 million Programme Partnership Agreement with CARE International, Zambia, includes &#163;2 million toward supporting positive living for those infected with HIV/AIDS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para11">
All the programmes that DFID supports in the social, economic and services sectors in Zambia have an HIV/AIDS component. DFID is planning to expand our support in these areas.


</p>







<p><a name="40712w01.html_wqn6"><b> Mr. Caton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment his Department has made of the humanitarian implications of the level of external debt in Zambia.  [182332]</p>








<p><a name="40712w01.html_spnew6"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Zambia&#039;s external debt poses severe problems both in terms of the stock of debt and the particularly high level of debt service in the 2001&#150;05 period. Zambia&#039;s scheduled external debt service averages US$570 million per year during 2001&#150;05. This is equivalent to approximately 80 per cent. of total government domestic revenues. However, under the Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, Zambia&#039;s actual external debt service has averaged US$122 million per year in the three years since Decision Point in December 2000. This has been essential in enabling the Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) to maintain and improve vital public services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para12">
During this period GRZ&#039;s expenditure on health has averaged US$161 million per year, an increase of 63 per cent. on the three previous years. Expenditure on education has averaged US$182 million per year, an increase of 53 per cent. on the three previous years.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para13">
The Department for International Development (DFID) supports GRZ in its objective of reaching HIPC Completion Point at the earliest opportunity. The recent approval of a new Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility with the International Monetary Fund is a major milestone towards this. DFID is also engaging in dialogue with GRZ and other donors to ensure that development assistance is effectively delivered in support of GRZ&#039;s Poverty Reduction Strategy after Completion Point.

<p><a name="40712w01.html_wqn7"><b> Mr. Caton: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment his Department has made of the impact of <i>(a)</i> International Monetary Fund and <i>(b)</i> World Bank policies in Zambia.  [182333]</p>









<p><a name="40712w01.html_spnew7"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Government of the Republic of Zambia (GRZ) embarked on a comprehensive programme of economic reforms during the 1990s, with the support of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and other development agencies, including the Department for International Development (DFID).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para14">
There is evidence that the reforms have started to reverse Zambia&#039;s long run of economic decline. Economic growth, which had been near zero from the mid 1970s to mid 1990s, has averaged 3.4 per cent. per annum since 1995. 2003 marked the fifth successive year of positive growth for Zambia under an IMF macro-economic programme.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para15">
While this improved economic performance is welcome. Other aspects of reform have had mixed results. Closure of urban manufacturing and state owned enterprises before alternative employment opportunities were available, affected people working in those sectors. The emergence of commercial agriculture and stemming the drain on the budget from nationalised industry losses, have not fully offset the negative impact on urban poverty or benefited remote rural areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w01.html_para16">
The Zambian Government&#039;s public sector reform programme, largely implemented with World Bank assistance, has made very slow progress since its launch in 1993. The current reform agenda, with a focus on public financial management and financial sector reforms is making better progress. It has been developed with a clear sense of leadership by GRZ and support from a wider group of development agencies.

 Bovine tuberculosis is confirmed either by finding visible lesions during slaughterhouse examination, or by the subsequent successful laboratory culture of samples for <i>Mycobacterium bovis</i> (the causative organism for bovine tuberculosis). Failure to confirm the disease does not mean that TB was not present, or that the animal had not been in contact with <i>M. bovis</i>. It is important to remember that the intention is to confirm disease in a herd, not each individual animal, so that the testing regime for the herd can be tailored accordingly. Once disease has been confirmed in a herd, it is not necessary to refer samples for laboratory culture in every case.

Note:<br>

In 2001, the TB testing and control programme was largely suspended due to the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak. Since testing resumed in 2002, resources have been concentrated on herds with overdue TB tests which would have had a longer period in which to contract the disease. Also the proportion of high risk herds being tested post-FMD is greater than that prior to the outbreak. As a result, the number of TB reactors identified and slaughtered since 2002 is not comparable to those identified and slaughtered in previous years.<br>

<p><a name="40712w05.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Tuberculosis (England and Wales) Order 1984 (as amended) defines an &quot;affected animal&quot; as &quot;a cow which is affected by tuberculosis of the udder or is giving tuberculous milk, or a bovine animal which is affected with tuberculous emaciation, or is excreting or discharging tuberculous material, or is affected with a chronic cough and shows clinical signs of tuberculosis, and includes a reactor&quot;. It then states that a &quot;suspected animal&quot; shall be construed accordingly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w05.html_para3">
In practice, clinical signs are not very specific, and clinical TB is not common nowadays because of the testing programme. This means that, in most cases, suspected cases in non-reactor cattle are notified by veterinary surgeons, usually after being summoned to a &quot;poorly&quot; animal by the owner.

[180375]</p>








<p><a name="40712w05.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The current strategy for controlling bovine TB in Great Britain consists of five points, based upon the recommendations of the Krebs Report (1997):

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">1. Protecting Public Health</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">2. Developing an effective vaccine</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">3. Research into how the disease is spread</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">4. Cattle Testing and Controls</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">5. The Randomised Badger Culling Trial</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w05.html_para4">
This policy is successful in that the risk to human health remains low. However, the long term trend has been an increase in the incidence and the geographical spread of TB in cattle. The costs to industry and the taxpayer are also increasing. We need to apply to bovine TB the principles agreed in the Animal Health and Welfare Strategy&#151;establishing targets against which we can measure our performance and formal agreements for working in partnership with the farming industry.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w05.html_para5">
Evidence from other countries shows that, in the apparent absence of a significant wildlife reservoir, cattle controls along the lines of those used in Great Britain can be effective at controlling and eventually eradicating the disease according to the criteria defined in Council Directive 64/432/EEC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w05.html_para6">
Defra completed a consultation on 4 June on both short-term measures to control the geographical spread of the disease, and a revised long-term TB Strategy for England (parallel consultations took place in Wales and Scotland). We are currently analysing the responses.

 When equidae (including donkeys) are sent from another EU member state into Great Britain, Community law requires the Veterinary Authorities of that member state to enter the details of the movement into a Community-wide computerised messaging system, so that the member state of receipt is made aware of the movement. Community law provides for random checks by the authorities in the receiving member state at places of destination, but not at the point of import unless non-compliance is suspected. In GB these checks are carried out by the State Veterinary Service (SVS).

Vaccination would be considered from the outset of an outbreak in addition to the culling of all susceptible animals on infected premises and those that have been exposed to infection, as required by EU law. We are engaging with operational partners and with stakeholders to ensure they are aware of their responsibilities and the measures that would be taken in an outbreak. Plans are also in place in the event of an outbreak to enable a rapid increase in staff resources and the implementation of contingency contracts including that for vaccination. We have revised the instructions for staff and are ensuring that they are trained and equipped to deal with an outbreak of disease.

Except in limited circumstances outlined as follows, no compensation is payable to those affected by flooding or erosion, including cases where it is decided not to defend a particular area, or to undertake managed realignment. This approach, adopted by successive governments, is justified by current legislation which provides operating authorities with permissive powers to undertake flood and coastal defence works. Save for the specific requirements of the Habitats Directive there is no general obligation to build or maintain defences at all or to a particular standard. Consonant with this approach, the legislation also makes no provision for compensation from public funds to persons whose property or land is affected by erosion or flooding.

<p>
<a name="40712w07.html_para2">
Payment is possible where quantifiable beneficial use arises. Thus land may be acquired for the construction or maintenance of defences and compensation paid for damage arising expressly from such operations. Also, in some circumstances, where land seaward of justifiable new defences can be shown to contribute to effective defence, landowners may be eligible for payment for depreciation or loss of land. Finally, if a defence is realigned landward, land currently in agricultural use may be considered for payments under agri-environment schemes if a long-term return to inter- tidal habitat fulfils the relevant objectives.

<p><a name="40712w07.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Any requirement for compensatory habitat arising from the maintenance or improvement of sea walls will depend on whether there would be an adverse effect on a site designated under the European Birds or Habitats Directives. Detailed guidance on the appraisal of plans and projects which are likely to have a significant effect on such European sites and guidance under which compensatory measures are required, is provided in &quot;Managing Natura 2000 sites&quot;: the provisions of Article 6 of the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC&quot; published by the European Communities in 2000. Where the maintenance or improvement of sea walls would not have an adverse effect on a European site, there would be no requirement for compensatory measures.
</p>


<p>

There is a more general requirement on Member States under the Birds Directive to &quot;take requisite measures to preserve, maintain or re-establish a sufficient diversity and area of habitats for all the species of birds referred to in Article 1&quot; of the Directive.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans her Department has to establish control on populations of grey squirrels; what regulations are in place on the permitted methods of despatch by landowners; and if she will make a statement.  [178085]</p>








<p><a name="40712w08.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Bradshaw </b> 
<i>[holding answer 10 June 2004]:</i> Grey squirrels are very difficult animals to control particularly on a wide scale and it is not practical to eradicate them totally. The Forestry Commission is engaged in the preparation of a policy statement on grey squirrels. This is one of the commitments made in the response to the recommendations contained in the &quot;Sustaining England&#039;s Woodlands&quot; review. It will recommend appropriate strategies for managing grey squirrels in England.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w08.html_para0">
The UK red squirrel Biodiversity Action Plan Steering Group (UKRSG) has identified those areas of the UK where action to maintain red squirrels is most likely to be effective in the long-term. In northern England, these priorities are being translated into management plans for key forest areas, where it is believed a combination of large-scale habitat management in forests and buffer areas allied to surveillance and targeted grey squirrel control gives the red squirrel the best chance of survival.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w08.html_para1">
The Forestry Commission provides current Best Practice guidance on the control of grey squirrel populations. The methods currently available are the use of Warfarin poison for protection against bark stripping damage to woodlands, where there are no red squirrels or pine martens. This is regulated under &#039;The Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986&#039;. The use of Warfarin for plant protection is currently under review by the Plant Protection Directorate of the EU, and there is a risk that it may not be available for use in the future.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w08.html_para2">
Cage trapping is as effective as poisoning at removing squirrels but more costly in terms of labour. Failing to check traps regularly may be an offence under the &#039;Protection of Animals Act 1911&#039;, and the &#039;Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996&#039; .
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w08.html_para3">
Spring traps (tunnel traps) may be used to take squirrels, but there is an increased risk to non-target species. The use of Spring traps is regulated under the Pests Act 1954, and only traps approved under the &#039;Spring Traps (Approval) Order may be used.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w08.html_para4">
Shooting is generally ineffective at reducing numbers sufficiently to prevent bark-stripping damage, but can be effective for removal of nuisance squirrels, for example in amenity areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w08.html_para5">
The regulations on the permitted methods of dispatch include the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, which lists prohibited methods. Under Schedule 9, Section 14 of the Act it is an offence to release grey squirrels into the wild.

<p><a name="40712w08.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The Department does not routinely collate data on the levels of urban fox populations, but commissions research into the subject from time to time. There have been a number of fox population estimates, the most generally accepted being that produced by Harris &quot;et al&quot; (1995), who estimated that in Britain there are 240,000 adult foxes at the start of the breeding season, and that these produce around 425,000 cubs each spring. Of these, 33,000 adult foxes (14 per cent.) live in urban areas. The total pre-breeding population in England is 195,000 adults, 22,000 in Wales and 23,000 in Scotland.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w08.html_para7">
The paucity of population data for this species in rural habitats makes it particularly difficult to produce a population estimate. The fox population estimate for urban areas, in contrast, is based on more extensive data, and Harris &quot;et al&quot; (1995) considered it to be more reliable than that for rural areas.

 All income taxpayers benefit from the 10p starting rate. The Survey of Personal Incomes (SPI) estimates that there are around 7,000 and 8,000 state retirement pension age taxpayers in the Warrington, North constituency in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 respectively.

<p class="tabletext">Estimates of the number of British nationals migrating to another EU member state for work-related reasons are shown in the attached table.

<p class="tabletext">The IPS measures people&#039;s intentions at the time of arrival or departure. These intentions may or may not be realised.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The IPS asks the respondent their main reason for travel. The data includes those who said that their main reason for travel was business or work (where they had a definite job to go to), and that they intended to remain abroad for a period of at least a year. The estimates do not include people travelling for holiday work, business meetings or short- term contracts; they also do not include those stating they are travelling abroad to look for work. The IPS does not record whether a person is taking up permanent employment abroad.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The estimates do not include migration from the UK to the Irish Republic. The definition of the EU used for all years is that prior to expansion on the 1st May 2004 excluding the Irish Republic, i.e. the destination countries covered are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain and Sweden.</p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The attached table shows estimates for the above countries as a group for successive two-year periods from 1991&#150;2 through to 2001&#150;2. The IPS samples approximately 0.2 per cent. of all travellers using the principal air, sea and Channel Tunnel routes from the UK. This sample size is not large enough to allow reliable estimates to be made of the number of British nationals emigrating for work-related reasons by either destination country or by single year.</p>

<p><a name="40712w16.html_spnew2"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 Information on waiting times for fitting hearing aids is not collected locally or centrally. Waiting times in audiology, including those for digital hearing aids, are likely to have increased in some areas because of the modernising hearing aid services (MHAS) project. The Modernisation Agency&#039;s action on audiology team is working to help national health service organisations improve their own procedures locally in order to reduce waiting times. Information on national average waiting times for audiology is not available.

MHAS has improved the quality of life of those people who have received digital hearing aids. It has modernised services to make sure that deaf people receive the most advanced hearing aids available, rather than rely on outdated technology from the 1970s.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what arrangements he has in place for monitoring statistics concerning the <i>(a)</i> numbers and <i>(b)</i> needs of disabled people; and if he will make a statement;  [182882]

<p><a name="40712w16.html_spnew3"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Government is committed to improving the position of disabled people in society and believes that public bodies should take the lead in promoting equal opportunities. That is why the draft Disability Discrimination Bill extends the Disability Discrimination Act (1995) to the functions of public bodies and introduces a duty on public bodies to promote equality for disabled people.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w16.html_para4">
Accordingly, the Department keeps the efficacy and efficiency of services provided to disabled people under constant review. The Department does not directly provide services for disabled people. Health service provision is the responsibility of the national health service; its quality and effectiveness of service is monitored by the Healthcare Commission. Social service provision is provided by local authorities, with their performance assessed by the Commission for Social Care Inspection (CSCI).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w16.html_para5">
Themed inspections are carried out by the CSCI (formerly the Social Services Inspectorate), such as a series of inspection reports of services for people with learning disabilities produced in 2003. It also carries out more general inspections, such as on adult services, which also cover disability. The Healthcare Commission has produced a number of reports covering disability and mental health. It will be collecting data on disability status in future national patient surveys; this will enable the analysis of data on patient satisfaction levels by disability status and will further enhance our ability to compare variations in patient experience of different groups in the population.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w16.html_para6">
The Department is committed to building equality into its work and will be taking forward a project to improve the evidence base on equality to support improved policy making.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w16.html_para7">
The Department for Work and Pensions is responsible for monitoring statistics concerning the number of disabled people and it currently estimates that there are around 10 million adults in Great Britain who are covered by the Disability Discrimination Act (1995) (source, FRS 2002/3).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w16.html_para8">
The Department does not collect data on numbers of disabled people, but on users of social services. The referrals, assessments and packages of care (RAP) return collects annual information on the number of adults aged 18 and over receiving a community care assessment and the outcome of the assessment by client group. It also collects information on the number of adults receiving social services during the year and the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 Jul 2004 : Column 928W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
type of services they receive. The client groups include people with physical and/or sensory disabilities, people with learning disabilities and those with mental health needs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w16.html_para9">
In 2002&#150;03, 1.7 million adults aged 18 and over received social services in England, of whom 1.4 million received community based services. Community based services include day care, meals, direct payments, equipment and transport, as well as home care.

<p><a name="40712w16.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 None. Pharmaceutical companies are required by law to submit all research data to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in support of any application for a marketing authorisation for a medicinal product. These data are submitted to the MHRA in confidence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w16.html_para10">
The Department encourages the pharmaceutical industry to make the findings of research publicly available. The Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry does so on behalf of the industry as a whole in the form of a clinical trials database. The database, at www.cmrinteract.com/clintrial, is a voluntary register containing details of clinical trials relating to newly licensed medicines and of trials to be conducted, after licensing approval, among national health service patients.

This recommenced in 2004&#150;05 when the Department provided Action on Elder Abuse with core funding of &#163;104,000, part of which is to ensure that the helpline continues to offer information, advice, support and advocacy to older people, carers, members of the public and practitioners.

<p><a name="40712w16.html_spnew6"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The information requested is not collected centrally. However, the Government is investing significantly in training provision in the

national health service. From 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06 an extra &#163;96 million is being made available to ensure that all health professionals, including nurses, have the right knowledge and skills, such as those required for elder care, to meet the changing and specific healthcare needs of all patients. The Department is working with work force development confederations and strategic health authorities to ensure that optimum use is gained from this investment and good practice is disseminated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w16.html_para12">
For nurses and midwives, it is for local employers to determine their employers training needs linked to local service plans. Access to training is affected by whether funding is available, staff can be released, training interventions are appropriate, flexible and convenient and mentors/assessors are available. It would not be practical for the centre to be prescriptive on this.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfall.<br>

3. The operations count of episode represent a count of finished admission episodes where the procedure was mentioned in any of the 12 (four prior to 2002&#150;03) operation fields in a Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) record. A record is only included once in each count, even if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field of the record.<br>

4. Strategic health authority (SHA) data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on SHA of treatment is poor in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (7 prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the Hospital Episodes Statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

2. A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

3. Figures are grossed for coverage, except for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what measures his Department plans to increase the recruitment of paramedics.  [177890]</p>








<p><a name="40712w19.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Hutton </b> 
<i>[holding answer 14 June 2004]:</i> The number of paramedics employed in the national health service is increasing. As at September 2003, there were 7,094 paramedics employed in the NHS, an increase of 730 or 11 per cent., since 1997. The March 2003 national vacancy rate for ambulance staff was 0.7 per cent., indicating that local and national recruitment and retention initiatives are working. These include improving pay and conditions, encouraging the NHS to become a better, more flexible and diverse employer, increasing training, investing in child care and continuing professional development and running national and local recruitment campaigns. NHS Careers, in association with the Ambulance Service Association, has published a new brochure specifically to showcase careers in the ambulance services. Copies are available in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w19.html_para0">
In addition to the traditional paramedic training routes for ambulance technicians, the development of degree courses in paramedic science and foundation degrees with flexible entry and exit points, combined with career development in supervisory skills, team leadership and management, will help to encourage further new entrants into the profession. Other developments within ambulance services, such as expanding the role of paramedics to provide more out of hospital care, thus enabling faster treatment, and the development of new ways of working such as the first responder schemes, will continue to ensure there are attractive and rewarding careers for all ambulance staff, including paramedics.

1. Finished in-year admissions<br>

A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Local authority of residence<br>

This is the local authority district using the latest available boundaries for the data year, where postcodes were known.<br>

3. Specialty<br>

Care is needed when analysing HES data by specialty, or by groups of specialties (such as acute). Trusts have different ways of managing specialties and attributing codes so it is better to analyse by specific diagnoses, operations or other recorded information.<br>

4. Grossing<br>

Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

3. Strategic Health Authority (SHA) data quality&#151;SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on SHA of treatment is poor in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

<p><a name="40712w21.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 requires the provision of treatment services using fresh donated sperm to be regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. This ensures that the recipients of the sperm are afforded protection. Private arrangements involving the supply of fresh donated sperm for home insemination purposes, that do not involve the provision of treatment services, do not come within the remit of the Act.

The Department will also be considering the regulation of arrangements that involve fresh sperm in the review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 that I announced in January 2004. The European Union Directive on Tissues and Cells (Directive 2004/23/EC ), due to come into force in April 2006, will also set safety and quality standards for the donation, procurement, testing, processing, preservation, storage and distribution of tissues and cells for human application, including donated sperm.

 The capacity planning exercise currently in progress aims to identify growth in levels of activity and to define any gaps in the service capability to accommodate that growth. The exercise may identify where spare capacity exists and how that spare capacity might be used to deliver increased activity.

 The latest year for which figures are available show that, in 2003&#150;04, the national average cost of tuition to train a nurse over the three years of their course was &#163;19,370.

In the period between entry to medical school and full registration, it is estimated that training a doctor costs between &#163;200,000 and &#163;250,000. Doctors generally continue training after full registration. As the duration and nature of post-registration training varies greatly and as service and training costs are closely related, it is not possible to provide a meaningful estimate of the total cost of training.

 The Government are committed to improving the position of disabled people in society and believe that public bodies should take the lead in promoting equal opportunities.

Accordingly, the Department keeps the efficacy and efficiency of services provided to disabled people under constant review. For example, in the past year we have improved the provision of online Government information for disabled people and unpaid carers with the launch of Directgov in April 2004 (www. direct.gov.uk/disability). This covers a range of areas including rights, employment, independent living and health.

We are in the process of modernising all benefits, including by making it possible to claim them online.

We are committed to helping disabled people into employment. For example, between April 2003 to March 2004 over 20,000 jobs were gained by participants on the New Deal for Disabled People programme. In addition, the Pathways to Work Program, a new way of giving early and continuing support to people on incapacity benefit is being piloted in several areas and is already generating good feedback and positive results.

<sup>(23)</sup> A person is counted only once in each period, regardless of the number of times they claim and subsequently leave each benefit. Only the first claim in any given period is counted, and it is that claim from which the six-month period has been calculated. As claimants may have more than one claim starting (and ending) within the same three month or annual period this means that the annual figures will be considerably lower than the sum of the four quarters.<br>

<sup>(24)</sup> The status of a claim at the six-month later period does not take account of subsequent changes after the six-month date. The status of a claim may change after the six-month point.<br>

<sup>(25)</sup> Claimants receiving income support or incapacity benefit where claims commenced on or after 1 March 2002. Movements to other benefits are not considered. For example a person who retires and moves to state pension will be counted as leaving JSA for other reasons.<br>

<sup>(26)</sup> JSA numbers for those claimants leaving on finding work show the number of people who have left JSA on finding work, working on average 16 hours per week or more, and on taking up the New Deal Employers Option and have not returned to benefit by the six-month date (benefits considered are jobseeker&#039;s allowance, income support, or incapacity benefit).<br>

Only the claim commencing in the time specified is considered and any claimant whose claim ends, returns to JSA and then leaves again to go into work is not counted in this category.<br>

Only those cases where no subsequent claim to benefit is made after leaving for work are shown. Any claimant who makes any additional claim after leaving benefit to move to work is not counted in this category, regardless of whether that claim also subsequently ends before the six months in question.<br>

Claimants shown in this category may in fact have returned to JSA or another benefit after the six-month point.<br>

Where a case is shown as having left JSA for work and not returned, this does not mean that the person is still in employment. Once a person has left the benefit system it is not possible to say what they are doing after this point.<br>

<sup>(27)</sup> Age is given at the point the claim commences.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Caseload figures have been rounded to the nearest hundred and expressed in thousands.<br>

2. Figures are based on a 5 per cent. sample, and are therefore subject to a degree of sampling variation.<br>

3. JSA figures are based on all persons who were claiming JSA and include those receiving income-based or contribution-based and national insurance credits only cases.<br>

4. SDA claimants are not considered in the numbers receiving another benefit as only claims commencing on or after 1 March 2002 are included in the analysis. SDA has not been available to new claimants since 6 April 2001. From this point, disabled people, whose period of incapacity begins before the age of 20 (or 25 if in education or training before the age of 20), may have been able to receive incapacity benefit without having to satisfy the national insurance contribution conditions. SDA recipients aged below 20 at the cut-off point would have transferred on to IB at the long-term rate in April 2002. Existing recipients can continue to receive the benefit for as long as they satisfy the conditions of entitlement for the benefit. Some persons shown as leaving benefit may therefore have retained entitlement to SDA.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what new strategies have been <i>(a)</i> developed and <i>(b)</i> implemented by his Department since June 2001 to ensure that national insurance numbers are issued, used and controlled consistently.  [182069]</p>









<p><a name="40712w24.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Pond: </b> 
 The Department is committed to ensuring that national insurance numbers (NINOs) are issued, used and controlled correctly. We will continue to develop and implement strategies and processes to enable us to achieve this commitment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w24.html_para0">
In April 2001, we introduced the Enhanced NINO allocation Process (ENP). This process ensures a consistent robust approach to NINO allocation for benefit applications and for those starting work, or in employment. The ENP includes face to face interviews, the provision of more tools for verifying that documents are genuine, and comprehensive training for staff who are interviewing customers regarding applications for NINOs. We have continued to refine this process to achieve a balance between security and customer service.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w24.html_para1">
Before entitlement to benefit can be considered an individual and their partner need to satisfy section 19 of the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997 regarding NINO provision. This requires the customer to provide enough information and evidence to confirm that the NINO quoted on the claim is their own. Where a customer does not know their NINO, they are required to provide enough information and evidence in order that the correct NINO can be traced. If the customer does not have a NINO, they are required to verify their identity and provide enough information in order that a NINO can be issued.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what proportion of all starters on the New Deal 25-plus programme have left to enter sustained unsubsidised jobs.  [176080]</p>








<p><a name="40712w25.html_spnew0"><b> Jane Kennedy: </b> 
 The New Deal has helped to achieve record levels of employment and has been an important boost to the economy, helping over a million people into work. Up to the end of March 2004, there were a total of 697,970 starts on New Deal 25-plus. In the same period, 178,000 people were helped into work through this programme, 117,250 of these into sustained, unsubsidised employment. Therefore almost 17 per cent. of starts have resulted so far in sustained, unsubsidised jobs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w25.html_para0">
A total of 141,580 people (over 20 per cent.) have found sustained employment through New Deal 25-plus. However, some of these are still in receipt of a job subsidy so are not recorded as having left New Deal.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w25.html_para1">
There are currently 54,840 people participating in New Deal 25-plus and a number of these will subsequently leave the programme to a sustained unsubsidised job. The proportion of leavers from the enhanced New Deal 25-plus programme (which started in April 2001) who have left to a sustained, unsubsidised job is 25 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w25.html_para2">
New Deal 25-plus has to be considered in the context of the people it sets out to help. Most have been out of work for 18 months or more in a healthy market and are considered among our hardest to help customers, frequently with multiple barriers to employment. Helping these customers into work is a substantial achievement. Not only does the programme help people into jobs as quickly as possible, it provides those facing greater difficulties with extra help to improve their job prospects and confidence. This help can include: work experience with an employer, training to develop the skills that employers want, and practical help with applying for jobs.

 Details of the Financial Assistance Scheme, for members of pension schemes which have wound up under funded where the employer is insolvent, are being developed in consultation with interested parties. It will not be possible to make a reliable estimate of the cost of benefit payments that would have been paid to those who will benefit until the details of who will be eligible for the scheme are agreed and until detailed information is collected from all those schemes which might be eligible. It is not therefore possible to answer the question in the form requested. However, I refer the hon.

 There are currently no plans to change procedures specifically for the admission to the UK of overseas doctors. Doctors from outside the European economic area who wish to work in the UK normally require a work permit or permission to work through the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP).

<p><a name="40712w32.html_spnew9"><b> Ms Blears: </b> 
 The reform of the jury service provisions was a recommendation contained in Lord Justice Auld&#039;s Review of the Criminal Courts of England and Wales. Jury service is an extremely important civic duty. For too long a large number of people have been excused from serving on a jury because of their profession or position in society. The changes contained in the Criminal Justice Act 2003 send a clear message that serving the community as a juror is the responsibility of everyone. Expanding the pool of potential jurors will ensure that juries better reflect the communities from which they are drawn and this in turn should improve public confidence in the criminal justice system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w32.html_para6">
No formal assessment has been conducted of the effect of these measures on police efficiency. However, we expect that the guidance issued to the Jury Central Summoning Bureau staff will allow individual officers who are summoned to defer jury service where there are good operational or personal reasons for doing so.

 The reduction of Stage 2 of police probationer training has taken place within the context of discussions with Centrex over their budget for 2004&#150;05. Representatives of Centrex, Her Majesty&#039;s Inspectorate of Constabulary and force training managers considered the length of Stage 2 in detail and concluded that 12 weeks would be sufficient to impart a fully comprehensive probationer training programme. I am satisfied that the reduction in length of Stage 2 will in no way affect the quality of the programme.

<p>
<a name="40712w32.html_para7">
The 12 week programme will embrace the principles of practice-based learning and community involvement, and focus on the role and context of policing. In response to force feedback, there will be intakes every six weeks. There will be no general increase of class size and no change in the probationer-to-trainer ratio.
</p>

The relatively small amount of basic public order training delivered to new recruits will be removed, but forces will continue to deliver public order training during Stage 3.

Case file preparation will be removed as forces agree that probationers should focus their initial training on the basic principles of evidence gathering, leaving the technical aspects of case file preparation to Stage 3. However, training on statements will be retained.

<a name="40712w32.html_para11">
Passing out parades will be withdrawn, as the philosophy of the modernised, restructured programme is to encourage probationers to take greater personal responsibility for their development, and in particular their fitness.

All of these changes have been made in consultation with key stakeholders, who are content that the approach taken will not impact negatively on the provision of Stage 2 probationer training. The programme will still impart all the essential components of the 15 week course.

This interest on the part of the RSAF in Typhoon has also been discussed at a range of meetings between MOD officials and BAE Systems representatives. Information on the dates and locations of such meetings is not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Defence Ministers have held no such discussions with the Saudi Arabian Government or Royal Family, or with representatives of BAE Systems.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to the Answer of 24 May 2004, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 1346&#150;7W, on Eurofighter, what stage discussions regarding the possibility of selling Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft ordered for the Royal Air Force to other countries without their first being delivered to the RAF have reached; whether these Typhoon aircraft would come from <i>(a)</i> Tranche 1 and <i>(b)</i> Tranche 2 of production for the RAF; whether discussions have taken place with (i) Singapore, (ii) Saudi Arabia, (iii) Austria, (iv) South Korea and (v) Switzerland; and if he will make a statement.  [181954]</p>









<p><a name="40712w33.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 As indicated by my earlier reply, RAF delivery schedules for Typhoon might be adjusted in order to provide for export of the aircraft. Any such adjustment would take into account the needs of the RAF as well as the benefits of export orders and would have to be made in agreement with our international partners. As part of our normal support for defence exports, we have had discussions with a number of countries regarding Typhoon. The details of these discussions are sensitive and I am withholding the information under Section 1b of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. Austria has already signed an order for 18 Typhoon, which industry in the United Kingdom and in our partner nations are working together to fulfil. Announcements will be made as and when further export orders are confirmed.

<p><a name="40712w34.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The increased expenditure for the Export Support Team figures for 2003&#150;04 compared with the previous year was due largely to the inclusion of ammunition, which was charged to single service budgets in previous years.

In October 2003, the Secretary of State announced a package of measures that will restore stability to the school funding system, including the introduction of a 4 per cent. minimum per pupil guarantee for schools. In addition to increases in general funding, for 2004&#150;05 &#163;279 million for support staff salaries is included in the new School Development Grant, worth &#163;647 million in total. Schools are free to spend their School Development Grant on any purpose that supports improvements in teaching and learning.

 Government support for capital investment in school buildings will reach &#163;5.1 billion in 2005&#150;06. This is compared to &#163;0.7 billion that was available in 1996&#150;97. Much of our capital support is allocated to schools and local education authorities (LEAs) by formula, and they decide how to invest in line with their asset management plans. The Department does not have complete information about capital investment at constituency level. The following table sets out the capital support given by the Government to Cumbria LEA since 1997&#150;98, in total and by programme, including devolved formula capital grants which go direct to schools.

 Information on the number of applications from overseas students by country of origin is available from the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) at www.ucas.ac.uk. Information on the number of these applications which are bogus is not available. Although UCAS has a Verification Unit which detects and records fraudulent applications, their available figures cover all UK-domiciled and overseas students in total, and do not identify overseas students separately.

 In line with Government policy (The Treasury Green Book and Meeting Investment Challenge) the procurement route is determined on the basis of value for money. The Local Education Partnership (LEP) has to submit a business case in support of the procurement route chosen that is then scrutinised by Partnership for Schools and DfES to ensure value for money.

ensure that the LEP takes forward proposals that meet both local requirements and national programme objectives. As a non-departmental public body (NDPB), Partnerships for Schools will only act in the interests of the public sector&#151;and by being a co-investor along with local authorities in LEPs, its interests will consist solely of furthering national or local programme objectives. No conflicts of interest are therefore anticipated.

<p><a name="40712w38.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 The Local Education Partnership (LEP) is a vehicle being developed to deliver Building Schools for the Future at a local level. Its joint venture partners are incentivised to make sure that the building programme is delivering value for money since Partnership for Schools will be able to monitor all bid prices and benchmark them against market norms. Value for money is achieved because any work by the LEP is contingent upon price and quality performance as outlined in the Strategic Partnering Agreement and compulsory periodic benchmarking.

 Partnership for Schools is a company limited by shares and a non-departmental public body established on 2 April 2004 to deliver the Building Schools for the Future programme. In 2005&#150;06, this programme will invest around &#163;2 billion in renewing the English secondary schools estate.

 There have been no formal expressions of interest as the procurement process for Building Schools for the Future (BSF) projects is not yet under way. However, a large range of private sector entities have responded either formally or informally, and on their own account or through representative bodies, to the DfES/PfS consultation paper on local education partnerships and there has been a range of meetings with public and private sector BSF stakeholders.

<p><a name="40712w38.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 Building Schools for the Future (BSF) represents the most complete investment in school buildings infrastructure ever seen in England, with around a projected spend of &#163;2.2 billion in its first year 2005&#150;06.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w38.html_para5">
In order to create a strong focus for change in the way that school buildings and infrastructure are obtained, introducing private sector disciplines, developing and retaining specialist procurement knowledge and allowing the DfES to concentrate on its policy role, at a national level the best delivery vehicle is a national procurement body. Partnerships for Schools(PfS) has been set up as a non-departmental public body (NDPB) to fulfil these challenges and to be the dedicated BSF delivery arm.

<p>
<a name="40712w38.html_para6">
PfS has been set up as an Executive NDPB to give it the ability to employ its own staff, responsibility for its own budget and a focused mission while at the same time ensuring that there is a clear framework for achieving proper standards of propriety and accountability as though it was a Government Department.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40712w38.html_para7">
PfS will work with local procuring agencies to set up Local Education Partnerships (LEPs) with which the procuring agencies would have strategic partnership agreements. PfS will facilitate strategic planning, develop PFI and PPP models for schools infrastructure and reduce transaction costs relative to the value of the investment procured. This in turn will help to provide a steady flow of school projects for the private sector and PfS will offer the opportunities to reduce the unit costs of schools projects.

Notes:<br>

1. The data are taken from Lancashire LEA&#039;s Section 52 Budget Statements submitted to the DfES. S52 is collected at local authority level not district level and consequently the figures provided are for Lancashire LEA.<br>

2. The layout of Table 1 of the budget statement in 2003&#150;04 was different to the layout used in previous years and consequently for financial years 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 the spend by LEAs on SEN was not separated out into the schools budget and LEA budget. For 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 the total central spend by LEAs on SEN is recorded on lines 1.4.1 to 1.4.4, 1.4.7 to 1.4.9 and 1.9 from table 1 of the S52 budget statement.<br>

3. The funding delegated to primary and secondary schools identified as &quot;notional SEN&quot; is as recorded on Table 2 of the budget statement. Figures are only indicative of the amount that might be spent by schools on SEN. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds. Figures may not sum due to rounding.<br>

4. The SEN element of the schools budget includes the provision for pupils with statements, specialist report for statemented and non-statemented pupils, collaboration and integration, fees for pupils at independent special schools and abroad and inter-authority recoupment. This is recorded in lines 1.1.1 to 1.1.6 in Table 1 of the 2003&#150;04 budget statement.<br>

5. The SEN element of the LEA budget includes educational psychology service/assessments and statementing, LEA functions in relation to child protection, health service partnerships/special medical attention, parent partnership, guidance and information and promoting good practice and collaboration. This is recorded in line 2.2.6 of Table 1 of the 2003&#150;04 budget statement.<br>
