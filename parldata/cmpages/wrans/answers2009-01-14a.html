 The Middlesbrough Local Transport Plan (LTP2) contains aspirations to introduce park and ride facilities. The Department for Transport is making &#163;5.46 million available to Middlesbrough over the three financial years, 2008-11, through their LTP2 integrated transport block allocation. It is for Middlesbrough to determine how best to use this capital funding to deliver the stated outcomes of its plan.</p>

The provision of a new station at Nunthorpe Parkway with associated car parking is an element of this package. The Department is committed to working with the Tees Valley Metro promoters to help them to develop their business case and I look forward to seeing the final document in due course. Funding for part or all of these proposals will need to be identified in the Regional Funding Advice (RFA2) transport investment programme for the North East. In this respect, the RFA2 response from the North East Region is to be submitted to Government at the end of February.</p>

 In line with the time scales set out in the Prime Minister&#146;s statement on Iraq on 18 December 2008, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 1233-35, the Merlin Battlefield Helicopter Force will remain fully committed to supporting UK forces in Iraq until circumstances allow for its withdrawal. We are already doing all we can to ensure a swift transition of the Merlin Force to Afghanistan, including the procurement of necessary equipment modifications for operations there.

 As the Prime Minister set out on 18 December 2008, <i> Official Report,</i> columns 1233-35, we will complete our remaining military tasks in Iraq by 31 May 2009 and move to a normal bilateral defence relationship. The subsequent withdrawal of our forces will be complete by 31 July. As part of the future relationship, the Government of Iraq have indicated that they would like to continue to receive military training and education from the UK. We will shortly begin discussions to establish the precise scope of this training and education, which will inform the number and breakdown by service of any UK service personnel in Iraq after 31 July. Our current assumption is that this activity would involve around 400 UK service personnel.</p>

Third Sector: Rhetoric and Reality&#146;, the Government Response was published on 11 December 2008. This included an assessment of how far the Government&#146;s vision of the state and the third sector working together at all levels and as equal partners can bring about real change in our public services. The Government welcomed the Committee&#146;s recognition of the capacity of the sector to deliver excellent and innovative public services but also acknowledged the need to build a robust evidence base that supports the case for more public and private investment in the third sector as a delivery partner. This is why, through the Office of the Third Sector, &#163;5 million has been invested in a new third sector research centre, led by Birmingham university, which will collect and disseminate evidence about the true social and economic value of the sector to society. Government are also investing in a four year National Programme for Third Sector Commissioning, which is providing training for up to 3,000 commissioners of public services to ensure they get the best out of working with the third sector.</p>

 Aimhigher projects are delivered through the 44 area-based Aimhigher partnerships of schools, colleges and universities. Partnerships submit plans to the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE), summarising the type of activities they intend to undertake. However, they are not required to detail their activities with primary schools separately and do not set out the costs of individual activities.</p>

The &#145;Professor Fluffy&#146; project aims to raise awareness of higher education at an early age. In 2004, Professor Fluffy started a tour of primary schools in Greater Merseyside. In a project called &#145;Professor Fluffy's Greater Merseyside Primary Roadshow&#146;, year five and six pupils take part in a range of activities aimed at raising aspirations and introducing the vocabulary of higher education. The project reaches over 140 primary schools a year in Greater Merseyside of which 30 also participate in a visit into one of the colleges or universities. Professor Fluffy's resources are linked to the key stage 2 national curriculum and include the Professor Fluffy comic book, activity booklet and over 20 curriculum modules, e.g. five modern languages and a variety of STEM subjects. The children, and their parents, are also able to access Professor Fluffy's own interactive website which has had over a million pages viewed over the last couple of years. At the end of the programme each pupil receives a special Professor Fluffy certificate in a &#145;graduation ceremony&#146; to celebrate their participation, together with their very own Professor Fluffy.

 The assurances we have previously given this House made clear that there would be an independent review of tuition fees, reporting to the House, once we had evidence on the first three years of the variable fee regime. The first three years of operation will not be concluded until this autumn. The timing and duration of the review and the publication of its results will enable us to fulfil the commitment given to the House in 2004 that there will be no vote before 2010 at the earliest, and to enable the review to present Parliament with an evidence-based report covering the full range of the issues it has been asked to consider through its terms of reference. It will then be for the House to consider how to respond to any recommendations.</p>

Our grant letters to HEFCE set out the expected growth in core fundable students (in full-time equivalent terms), however no distinction between full-time and part-time students is made.

Median incomes are used as the national average in the publication.  5. The figures are based on OECD equalisation factors.  6. Figures have been presented on both a Before Housing Cost and After Housing Cost basis. For Before Housing Cost, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are not deducted from income, while for After Housing Cost they are.  7.

This will assist in providing a clearer understanding of youth victimisation.

The Chief Executive of the UK Border Agency has regularly updated the Home Affairs Select Committee with all of the most robust information available.

For the remaining individuals it is taking the agency around 130 days, on average, to deport or remove them from the UK. A copy of this letter is available in the Library of the House.</p>

 The information requested is given in the following table. Detections (or 'clear ups') can be subdivided into sanction and non-sanction detections. Sanction detections are now the preferred method, providing a more meaningful comparison of individual force performance. From 1 April 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances. Some forces have already abandoned their use on non-sanction detections altogether. The reductions in the use of non-sanction detections are clearly demonstrated by the figures given in the table.</p>

During the lifetime of an operation a SOCA investigation may switch between a criminal investigation and an investigation that seeks to disrupt an individual, group, or criminal activity other than by way of a criminal investigation and vice versa, or it may look to prosecute some members of the group and use civil or other powers against others. SOCA does not therefore hold information on the number of separate criminal investigations within operations.

The NCEI is initially focusing on optimising data collection to enhance our understanding of the inequalities that exist; promoting research to fill gaps in the evidence; and spreading and sustaining good practice in NHS organisations. The NCEI has undertaken a good practice survey to identify current projects aiming to reduce inequalities in cancer care, including cancer screening. The principles behind undertaking robust projects to reduce cancer inequalities, including examples from the survey, will be issued to the NHS later this year.</p>

</td></tr></tbody><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="6"><i> Notes:</i> The NHS Information Centre reports that the figures provided for Scarborough and North East Yorkshire Health Care NHS Trust have been redacted from the table because they appear to be significantly lower than reported. The NHS Information Centre and the Yorkshire and Humber SHA have been asked to investigate this.<br>
<i> Small numbers:</i> To protect patient confidentiality, trusts with less than five deliveries have been removed. <i> Ungrossed data:</i> Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Data quality:</i> Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. <i> Assessing growth through time:</i> HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Coverage and data quality:</i> The maternity tail data coverage is not as complete as the rest of HES data. There are a number of reasons for the coverage and data quality issues such as:<br>
trusts submitting a significantly higher number of delivery episodes compared to birth episodes;<br>
trusts failing to submit data on the number of birth episodes where they record a high number of delivery episodes;<br>
trusts failing to submit delivery&#151;the reason for this is that approximately 20 trusts have a standalone maternity system which is not linked to the Patient Administration System;<br>
trusts identifying a high number of maternity beds available, but not recording any information about deliveries or births;<br>
trusts identifying that they have no maternity beds available, but recording a high number of birth and delivery episodes; and<br>
some trusts have space in their maternity system to record nine birth tails, whereas other systems have space for 18. As deliveries, miscarriages and abortions are all recorded in the birth tail, there are cases where nine tails is not enough to record all of the relevant data . Between 2001-02 and 2005-06, coverage of hospital deliveries was 72.6 per cent. on average, whereas that of home deliveries was 13.6 per cent. on average. The incomplete coverage problem is significantly compounded by the data quality issues outlined above.<br>
<i> Finished Consultant Delivery Episode (FCE)</i>: A finished consultant episode (FCE) is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes.<br>
Maternity events taking place in either NHS hospitals or in non-NHS hospitals funded by the NHS will be recorded as ordinary &#147;Delivery&#148; episodes.<br>
&#147;Other Delivery events&#148; are delivery events other than those resulting in delivery or birth episodes under NHS funding or in any other facility supplied under a service agreement with the NHS.<br>

<i> Finished Consultant Delivery Episode</i><br>
(FCE): A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. FCEs are counted against the year in which the FCE finishes. We have provided a count of total deliveries measured by delivery episode and other delivery event:<br>
maternity events taking place in either national health service (NHS) hospitals or in non-NHS hospitals funded by the NHS will be recorded as ordinary &#147;Delivery&#148;.<br>

<i> Date episode ended</i><br>
&#151;This field contains the date on which a patient left the care of a particular consultant, for one of the following reasons: discharged from hospital (includes transfers) or moved to the care of another consultant.<br>
A null entry either indicates that the episode was unfinished at the end of the data year, or the date was unknown.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
&#151;Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in the data,<br>
 i.e.<br>
the data are ungrossed.<br>

&#151;HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England.

The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Quality of care</i><br>
&#151;Data derived from HES cannot be used in isolation to evaluate the quality of care provided by NHS trusts or clinical teams. There are many factors that can affect the outcome of treatment and it is beyond the scope of HES to adequately record and reflect all of these.<br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.

Information from the decennial national child dental health surveys shows that DMFT in 12-year-old children in England declined from 5.0 in 1973 to 0.7 in 2003, which means that children in this age group are among children with the best oral health in Europe. Meanwhile the adult surveys show that between in 1968 and 1998 the proportion of adults with no natural teeth fell from 37 per cent. to 11 per cent. However, we are not complacent. AH primary care trusts (PCTs) are required to undertake an assessment of the oral health needs of their populations to inform their commissioning of primary care dental services. In September 2007, we published &#145;Delivering Better Oral Health: An evidence-based toolkit for prevention&#146;, which provides practical, evidence-based guidance to help dental teams promote oral  <br>

During 2008, the Chief Dental Officer and other leading members of the dental profession contributed to three regional conferences for PCTs and dental care professionals on implementation of the toolkit. Also, through reforms made to the legislation governing the fluoridation of water, we have given communities with high levels of dental disease a real option of having their water fluoridated.</p>

 Practices with extremely low or high rates, generally have small numbers of patients. For example, if there is only one patient and that patient is exception reported, then the rate will be 100 per cent. If that patient is not exception reported the rate will be 0 per cent. The highest exception rate for practices with substantial numbers of patients are almost always substantially below 100 per cent.</p>

Primary care trusts are responsible for verifying evidence of achievement.

Therefore health care should be provided in the UK to another European economic area national on the same basis as it would be to a UK national. Under EU Regulation 1408/71 a citizen of a member state can seek prior authorisation (via an E112) from their health authorities to go to another member state for planned state-sector treatment. The decision about whether to authorise a referral is a clinical one by that citizen&#146;s member state, taking into account factors such as whether undue delay applies or whether it is a specialist treatment that the home state cannot supply.

 It is for local authorities with social services responsibilities to determine the point at which an application is made to the court for an order under section 31 of the Children Act 1989. Each application will depend upon the unique circumstances of the individual case with which they are dealing. In some cases, it will be appropriate for an order to be sought immediately regarding a child with whom the local authority will not previously have had contact. In other cases, social services may have been involved with a family over many years before concerns arise which make a care order under section 31 appropriate. Information on the time elapsed before the application of care orders is therefore not collected centrally.</p>

 Safeguarding Children and Safer Recruitment in Education (2006) makes clear that everyone in the education service should help keep children and young people safe.

 The National Assessment Agency (NAA) is responsible for administering national curriculum tests. Key stage 1 consists of a series of tests and tasks administered by teachers and these are not marked externally. At key stage 2, the NAA has in place arrangements for marking to be reviewed where a school believes that it is inaccurate to the extent that a pupil has received an incorrect national curriculum level. The NAA is currently managing the final phase of the reviews process and expects that all results will be issued to schools in the coming weeks. The great majority of schools have already received results for their review applications. Once the final phase of review marking is complete, NAA will be able to provide full data on the volume and outcome of reviews for the 2008 national curriculum test cycle.</p>
