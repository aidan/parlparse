<a name="10402w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 My officials at ECGD received a copy of the original Environmental Impact Assessment Report in August 1998. This report was reviewed by Environmental Resources Management in July 1999, and copies of that review are in the Library of the House. We are currently awaiting the final version of the Environmental Impact Assessment Report. We expect that a presentation on the Environmental Impact Assessment Report will be made to the export credit agencies shortly and that after this presentation the Environmental Impact Assessment Report will be made publicly available. As we are not the owners of the reports we cannot be more specific about timing.

<P>
<a name="10402w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 30 March 2001]:</i> The Consumer Council for Postal Services (or "Postwatch" as it calls itself) has been established to promote the interests of users of postal services within the framework now created by the Postal Services Act 2000. It is intended that the Council should have a central role in the new regulatory framework, monitoring service standards and acting as a focus for consumer issues and complaints.
<P>

<a name="10402w01.html_para8">The Act requires that the Council is consulted on key decisions including variations in the services for which licences are required, the granting and modification of licences, and the enforcement of licence conditions. The Act also requires the Council to represent (particularly to the Government, the Postal Services Commission, and licensed postal operators) the views of users, and to provide advice and information to consumers on postal matters. It is expected that the Council will seek to ensure licensed operators have effective complaints handling procedures and compensation and redress systems, and will investigate complaints which have not been satisfactorily handled by licensed postal operators. It will also monitor service quality against standards set by the Postal Services Commission and, with the Postal Services Commission ("Postcomm"), monitor and advise on the Post Office Counters network.
<P>

<a name="10402w01.html_para9">In accordance with a direction given under section 39 of the Act, the costs of the Council are to be recovered from licensees.

These followed the guidance issued by government on the use of brownfield land and sites. In particular, the Regional Innovation Fund took into account the wealth of each region, unemployment and relative levels of R&D expenditure.

This brings forward money already allocated under the Rail Regulator's review of access charges. In addition to delivering long-term savings to the taxpayer, this agreement provides the basis for a new relationship between the company and Government, including a commitment from Railtrack to proceed to appoint a non-executive director to its main Board with a remit to provide a powerful public and consumer voice. The agreement has been enshrined in an agreed general Statement of Principles published today, copies of which are being placed in the Library of the House.

<P>

<a name="10402w04.html_para9">Further measures to end the blight of fuel poverty for vulnerable households by 2010 are set out in the Government's Fuel Poverty Strategy, which was published for consultation on 23 February 2001.

<a name="10402w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 On 23 February 2001, the Government published its Fuel Poverty Strategy for consultation. The Strategy sets out our commitment to end the blight of fuel poverty for vulnerable households--which includes pensioners on low incomes--by 2010.
<P>

<a name="10402w04.html_para10">The Government have already taken action to tackle the main causes of fuel poverty--low income and poor energy efficiency--to help those suffering from fuel poverty.
<P>

<a name="10402w04.html_para11">The Winter Fuel Payment, which has been increased to &#163;200 for this winter, will help many older households in, or at risk from, fuel poverty. For the poorest pensioners we have introduced the Minimum Income Guarantee, which is already helping 1.6 million pensioner households.
<P>

<a name="10402w04.html_para12">We have also reduced the level of VAT on fuel and on the installation of energy saving materials, so that people can more easily afford to keep warm. Further reductions in energy bills have resulted from the reform of the energy market.
<P>

<a name="10402w04.html_para13">But the permanent solution is to provide better insulation and heating. We have made available substantial additional capital funds for housing investment by local authorities. We have also launched our radical new Home Energy Efficiency Scheme (HEES). The scheme now provides grants for packages of heating and insulation improvement measures, including high efficiency central heating systems for low-income households aged 60 years or more. With a budget of over &#163;600 million, HEES is expected to have reached some 800,000 vulnerable households by 2004, 480,000 being over-60s.
<P>

<a name="10402w04.html_para14">In addition, the Energy Efficiency Standards of Performance schemes (EESOPs) run by the energy suppliers have been doubled to some &#163;50 million a year. Around two-thirds of this help is going to pensioner and

low-income families. From 2002, the Government are proposing to increase the scale of the scheme to around &#163;150 million a year, continuing its focus on disadvantaged consumers.

 The Government believe that everyone should have access to good quality open space close to where they live, and attach high importance to their retention in urban areas. Our Urban White Paper: "Our Towns and Cities: The Future" sets out a range of measures for improving the quality of urban parks and green spaces, including the setting up of the Urban Green Spaces Taskforce. On 21 March we issued, for consultation, "Revised Planning Policy Guidance note 17: Sports, Open Space and Recreation." The guidance provides a clearer framework for improving provision of open spaces and ensuring such spaces are better protected from development.

<a name="10402w05.html_para2"><i>Single Regeneration Budget (SRB)</i>

<BR>
<i>1. Peckham Partnership (SRB Round 1)</i>
<BR>
The Peckham Partnership is a Round 1 SRB scheme, and the largest to have been approved to date. The scheme is currently in its sixth year of operation.
<BR>
The majority of funding has been spent on the physical renewal of the notorious 1960s built 'Five Council Estates' in the Liddle Ward of Peckham, originally covering a residential population of 11,000. A large scale programme of decanting, demolition, refurbishment and re-build has led to a demonstrable improvement of the physical appearance of the area, leading to improved levels of resident satisfaction and improved community safety resulting from changes in estate layout and street-scape. The Partnership has also achieved its aim of increased housing tenure mix, with the success of the first phase of the homes for sale (open market and shared ownership) hailed as a particular success, particularly in attracting local people to stay in the area.
<BR>
<i>2. Greater Peckham Alliance (SRB Round 6)</i>
<BR>
Following on from the mainly physical renewal work of the Peckham Partnership and the desire by the local community to work with statutory agencies to improve the social and economic fabric of the area. The Greater Peckham Alliance (GPA), a newly formed community based partnership, has successfully secured funding under SRB Round 6.
<BR>
The main purpose of the GPA is to initiate a range of capacity building projects, build community involvement and commission community-led projects with the central aim of improving local residents educational attainment and economic status plus developing the social fabric of the overall community in Peckham.
<BR>
<i>3. Aylesbury Plus Initiative, Southwark (SRB Round 4)</i>
<BR>
This is a six-year scheme that aims to improve the overall physical and social conditions on the Aylesbury estate through a package of education, training, employment and community safety measures. The scheme builds on Southwark's experience of major regeneration work in the nearby Peckham Partnership area and will therefore input into the wider regeneration of this part of the borough. Housing problems will also be tackled.
<BR>
<i>4. Southwark Campaign Against Hate Crime (SRB Round 6)</i>
<BR>
Led by the London borough of Southwark, the purpose of this seven year programme is to develop and resource a resilient and sustainable integrated community based approach to the reduction of hate crimes in Southwark--acts of violence and abuse motivated by prejudice. This will include fully resourced services for victims and challenging interventions with offenders, to secure improved social cohesion and ongoing regeneration of the borough.
<BR>
<i>5. Elephant Links (SRB Round 5)</i>
<BR>
Led by the London borough of Southwark the purpose of the programme is to catalyse major commercial and public investment and release potential sustainable local regeneration in the Elephant and Castle area.
<BR>
<i>6. Cross River Partnership--Southwark (SRB Round 2 & 3)</i>
<BR>
The London borough of Southwark is one of the four accountable bodies for the early Cross River Partnership schemes, the others being the London borough of Lambeth, the City of Westminster and the South Bank Employers' Group (which comprises private and public sector employers in the South Bank area of both Lambeth and Southwark). The Partnership comprises these four bodies together with the Corporation of London, Railtrack, Focus TEC, Groundwork, TfL, PLA and the LTB. CRP's overall objective is:
<BR>
"to improve and protect the environment of the Cross River area, reinforce London's status as a world class centre for leisure, the arts and business, offer education and training and create job opportunities for local people and improve the quality of life for those who live, work and visit the area".

 We have today issued, to all county councils, district councils and London borough councils in England, alterations to the Code of Recommended Practice on Local Authority Publicity, a draft of which was laid before the House on 15 February 2001.

These costs will be funded by an increase in grant-in-aid to the Board arising from savings on Class III, Vote 3 and from transfers from the non-voted element of DETR's main DEL.

 Regulations activating the powers under section 74 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991 to allow highway authorities to charge utilities whose works overrun came into force on 1 April. We will be monitoring very closely the effect which the new powers have on the level of disruption to road users caused by street works. We have made clear that if it becomes apparent that these have not led to a sufficient reduction in disruption, then the Government are prepared to introduce further measures to address this problem.
<P>

<a name="10402w06.html_para2">We are also issuing today two related publications. The first of these--"Best Practice in Street Works and Highway Works"--is designed to encourage utilities and highway authorities carrying out works in the street to make sure that these are completed speedily and to a high standard. Copies are being sent to every utility and highway authority. The other--a revision of the existing "Code of Practice for the Co-ordination of Street Works and Works for Road Purposes and Related Matters" is intended, among other things, to ensure that works carried out by different bodies are co-ordinated effectively, so as to minimise disruption.

The Rural Task Force is continuing to look at the scope for additional measures to help rural businesses severely affected by the economic impacts of foot and mouth disease.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="10402w06.html_para3">Four main types of fuel are sold at UK garages. These are 95 octane unleaded petrol, 97 octane unleaded petrol (superunleaded), lead replacement petrol (LRP) and diesel (DERV).
<P>

<a name="10402w06.html_para4">The technical requirements for these fuels, including chemical composition, are covered by the European Fuels Directive 98/70/EC, as transposed into UK law by the 



<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 2001 : Column: 20W</I><P>
Motor Fuels (Composition and Content) Regulations 1999. The fuels also meet the requirements of the following British Standards: for 95 octane unleaded, BS EN228:2000, for 97 octane unleaded BS 7800:2000, and for DERV BS EN 590:2000.
<P>

<a name="10402w06.html_para5">Ultra-low sulphur fuels are required to meet the following additional requirements: for petrol of any type listed above a maximum sulphur content of 50ppm as opposed to 150ppm allowed in 98/70/EC, and a maximum aromatics content of 35 per cent. vol. as opposed to 42 per cent. in 98/70/EC, for diesel fuel a maximum sulphur content of 50ppm as opposed to 350ppm allowed in 98/70/EC, and a maximum density of 835 kg/m3 as opposed to 845 kg/m3. The requirements for autogas (LPG), which is now available at nearly 700 sites around the UK, are covered by BS EN 589:2000.

 <i>[holding answer 29 March 2001]:</i> The 'Snoopy' aircraft, although owned by the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), has been used exclusively for research trials by the Met Office using RAF crews. The current contract with the Met Office expired on 31 March 2001, after which DERA has a short term contract with the Met Office for the controlled removal of their equipment. In parallel DERA is actively seeking alternative customers for the aircraft. The situation will be reviewed in March 2002.

 When my predecessor announced the creation of the Defence Aviation Repair Agency (DARA) as a Defence Agency, with effect from 1 April 1999, he stated the intention to move the organisation to Trading Fund status as soon as practicable. Following the approval 



<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 2001 : Column: 21W</I><P>
by this House and the enactment of the requisite Statutory Instrument, DARA will now become a Trading Fund from 1 April 2001.

<P>

<a name="10402w06.html_para8">Customers will now have a clear and transparent pricing structure that will allow them to choose the services that offer the best value for money while helping to maintain robust and healthy competition in the aviation repair industry.

 The information requested is not held centrally.

On sites earmarked for disposal, remediation is generally confined to the removal of ordnance and other defence- specific contaminants where a civilian contractor might not have the relevant experience. Where appropriate, provision is made within the sale agreement for the purchaser of surplus defence land to remediate it to a standard fit for the proposed new use.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w07.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 All service accommodation in England, Scotland and Wales is formally exempt from the council tax regime. Instead, the Ministry of Defence pays contributions in lieu of council tax (CILOCT) to local authorities, broadly equivalent to the amount of tax that would otherwise be due. The average contribution, determined by the type of property occupied, is then recovered from service occupants with their accommodation charge. The system allows a uniform payment wherever personnel are posted, including overseas. In Northern Ireland CILOCT is not paid as domestic rates are still in force.

 The Ministry of Defence pays approximately &#163;40 million in respect of contributions in lieu of council tax (CILOCT) to some 240 local authorities in England, Scotland and Wales.

[156395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w07.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 All members of the armed forces pay the same amount of contributions in lieu of council tax (CILOCT), in relation to the type of property occupied, wherever they are serving. The only exception is for those serving in Northern Ireland where domestic rates are still in force. For those living in a Service Family Accommodation, the current CILOCT charge is between &#163;526 and &#163;1,161 per annum depending on the type of quarter. Personnel occupying single accommodation pay a lower annual CILOCT charge of between &#163;22 for other ranks and &#163;69 per annum for officers, because of the lower valuation of this type of accommodation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w07.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 We do not keep records of how many Service personnel own private properties. All Service personnel living in Service accommodation who also own a private property remain liable to pay council tax on their own property to the local authority concerned. It is for local authorities to interpret the relevant regulations regarding "sole or main" residence criteria. There have been a handful of cases in which they have refused to allow Service home owners a reduction on their private property when they also have a Service family quarter and pay a full council tax contribution for that quarter via the Contributions in Lieu of Council Tax scheme. Although the Ministry of Defence is not in a position to determine the actions of local authorities, my officials have raised individual cases with the relevant local authorities.

 Each case which the police send to the Crown Prosecution Service--whether involving an allegation of anti-Semitic literature or any other offence--is reviewed by a Crown Prosecutor. All cases are carefully considered to make sure that they meet the tests set out in the Code for Crown Prosecutors, which is issued under section 10 of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985.
<P>

<a name="10402w08.html_para5">There are two stages in the decision to prosecute. The first stage is the evidential test. The Crown Prosecutor must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a 'realistic prospect of conviction'. He must consider objectively whether the evidence can be used and is reliable. The Crown Prosecutor must also consider what the defence case may be and how it is likely to affect the prosecution case. A 'realistic prospect of conviction' means that a jury or bench of magistrates, properly directed in accordance with the law, is more likely than not to convict the defendant of the charge alleged.
<P>

<a name="10402w08.html_para6">If the case does not pass the evidential test, it must not go ahead, no matter how important or serious it may be. If the case does pass the evidential test, the Crown Prosecutor must then consider the second stage test to decide if a prosecution is needed in the public interest. In cases of any seriousness, a prosecution will usually take place, unless there are public interest factors tending against prosecution which clearly outweigh those tending in favour. The Crown Prosecution Service will only start or continue a prosecution when the case has passed both tests.
<P>

<a name="10402w08.html_para7">Offences under part III of the Public Order Act 1986, which include offences of producing and distributing racially inflammatory material, require Law Officer's consent. Where the evidential and public interest tests are met consent to prosecute will be granted.

To ask the Solicitor-General if he will make a statement about the arrangements for instructing advocates to prosecute cases on behalf of the Government.  [156818]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w08.html_spmin4"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 Last year the Attorney-General set up a working group, chaired by David Nissen, CB, the Solicitor to the Department of Trade and Industry, to conduct a review of the arrangements for instructing advocates to prosecute cases on behalf of the Government. Following that review and consultation within Government and the legal profession, new arrangements come into force today that will govern the instruction of advocates (whether barristers or solicitor-advocates) in private practice in prosecution cases for the following Government Departments and non-departmental public bodies:
<P>

<a name="10402w08.html_para10"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>HM Customs and Excise; Departments of Social Security/Health; Inland Revenue; Department of Trade and Industry; Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food; Intervention Board; Health and Safety Executive and the Environment Agency.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10402w08.html_para11">A single panel will be set up of advocates for prosecution cases divided into three lists: A, B and C according to the level of experience of the advocate. Appointments will be for three years with the possibility of further renewals. I hope to announce the first recruitment exercise for the new single panel in the autumn. Further details about the application and selection process will be given closer to that time. There will be annual recruitment exercises and advertisements for applications to the new panel will be published. There will be equal opportunities monitoring of the application and selection process and particular care will be taken to encourage applications from women and member of the ethnic minorities. Appointment to the panels will be open to solicitor-advocates.
<P>

<a name="10402w08.html_para12">From today, as a transitional arrangement until the new single panel is set up, my current Lists of advocates for the Departments named will be operated as a single List with instructing solicitors in those Departments free to instruct advocates on the other lists. Those currently on a list will be expected to apply to join the new panel in due course.
<P>

<a name="10402w08.html_para13">Also from today, the role of my clerk in nominating advocates from the lists for instructions/briefs, the reallocation of returns and off-list nominations of counsel will cease. This was a considerable burden placed upon the chambers of each Attorney-General, which in these times can no longer be justified. From now on, Departments will be responsible for dealing directly with clerks concerning the delivery of instructions and the reallocation of returns. Departments will be responsible for monitoring the fair spread of instructions across the lists and the quality of performance of advocates. There will be an Administrative Unit, based at HMCE, responsible for central monitoring that will report to me.

 I am today publishing a consultation paper "Curriculum Online", which sets out our proposals for the next steps in the use of technology to raise standards of education, including consulting on the future of the National Grid for Learning. Copies of the paper have been placed in the House of Commons Library. We are seeking views on the best way to achieve our vision of a consistent and coherent set of electronic resources available across the curriculum. All teachers will have access to the best available resources to support their

lesson planning and all pupils will be able to use the same materials at home as they do in the classroom, to support their homework and revision, for example.
<P>

<a name="10402w10.html_para1">As a first step towards achieving our vision, I am also announcing today the outcome of our competition for the provision of digital course materials for GCSEs in English, mathematics, science, history, geography and French. We will be investing &#163;42 million over three years in these materials, to be delivered over digital television and other channels. The proposals were assessed against criteria including their educational merits and their value for money and the BBC and Granada Media were judged to have submitted the best proposals. Subject to the necessary DCMS approvals, they will be working together to deliver the six GCSEs, split equally between them.
<P>

<a name="10402w10.html_para2">In addition, I can announce that we will be developing a "Cybrarian"--a virtual librarian service for learners of all ages--using &#163;17.5 million from the Capital Modernisation Fund and a further &#163;5 million of DfEE funding. It will offer much more effective ways of connecting learners with the rich electronic content that they need and will be a powerful tool in efforts to bridge the digital divide, particularly for those traditionally poorly served by electronic resources.
<P>

<a name="10402w10.html_para3">Together these announcements represent another important step forward in our plans to use the potential of technology to reinforce and support our commitment to the best of traditional teaching methods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w10.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) are key agents for securing services that better meet the needs of their population. They are able to play a leading role in improving the health of their community and delivering more integrated local services. PCTs are starting to make this happen. 124 new PCTs have become established this year, bringing the total now to 164. Further PCTs will be established next year.
<P>

<a name="10402w10.html_para4">In addition, &#163;100 million will be provided to Primary Care Groups (PCGs) and PCTs to develop primary care service, an average of &#163;10,000 per general practitioner practice, that are aimed to promote new ideas or ways of working that deliver improved patient services. This might include funding, extra clinics, extended opening hours, training GP specialists or developing other primary care clinicians to deliver, for instance, better heart and cancer services.
<P>

<a name="10402w10.html_para5">We recognise that GPs and other primary care health practitioners are dealing with illness and disease now, which in the recent past could only be dealt with in hospitals. This trend will continue and investment is being made now to make sure that GPs have the time and the expertise to deliver top class care in our communities. Therefore, in addition to existing funding and the new resources available to all PCGs and trusts, from April 



<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 2001 : Column: 35W</I><P>
2001 each PCG and PCT will receive &#163;5,000 to support the lead GP or nurse engaged within the local cancer clinical network.
<P>

<a name="10402w10.html_para6">New Personal Medical Services (PMS) pilots are also providing an opportunity to test different ideas for delivering existing primary care focusing on local services problems and bringing about improvements. PMS has proved to be very successful in reaching deprived areas where help is often most needed, making service provision more responsive and equitable.

 Details of the appraisal process and the publication of evidence are matters for the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE). NICE has recently consulted on changes to its appraisal process. I understand that it is proposing that, where information submitted to the institute is designated by a consultee as being 'commercial in confidence', the institute will undertake not to release this information to a third party. However, the institute may ask the consultee to forego such restrictions on release where either there appears to be no obvious commercial reason for the restrictions; or such restrictions would make it difficult or impossible for the institute to show the evidential basis for its guidance.

The project is jointly managed by the Redbridge and Waltham Forest health authority, Forest Healthcare National Health Service Trust and the Walthamstow, Leyton and Leytonstone Primary Care Group. Congestive heart failure and asthma were chosen as the most suitable to consider for new ways of care management. The funding for this project is being provided by regional primary care money.

During that period 2,800 patients received ECT treatment, 75 per cent. of ECT patients were not formally detained under the Mental Health Act 1983 and of those patients formally detained while receiving ECT treatment, 29 per cent. consented to ECT, 12 per cent. were treated as an emergency and 59 per cent. did not consent to treatment but were treated after a second opinion was obtained.

In August 2000, 3,800 families in the borough were benefiting from WFTC.
<P>

<a name="10402w12.html_para5">The Government are also committed to policies that enable pensioners to share in the country's rising prosperity. All pensioners, including 32,000 in the London borough of Southwark, will receive an above- inflation increase in the basic state pension from April 2001. Single pensioners will receive an extra &#163;5 a week, and couples will receive an extra &#163;8 a week. All pensioners aged 75 or over have also been entitled to a free TV licence since November 2000--including around 20,000 in the London borough of Southwark.

 The agreements in question do not absolve individuals from their obligations to file tax returns. They establish the tax liability or tax treatment of certain income or gains for future years, which must then be reflected in the returns for those years. The circumstances in which these agreements have been made are varied. Typically they agree a practical basis for taxing future income or gains where there would otherwise be particular difficulties in establishing an exact figure.

 Luton, South, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, is benefiting from the long-term action we have taken to build economic stability and secure high and stable levels of growth and employment. Since the General Election, claimant unemployment in the constituency has fallen by 1,315 or 40 per cent., youth unemployment is down by 85 per cent., and long-term unemployment has fallen by 75 per cent.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question on the amount of time businesses are required to take providing data for the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and if this can be reduced (155750).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The ONS is extremely conscious of its responsibility to reduce the costs to business of complying with its surveys. Minimising the burden on suppliers of data is one of the ONS's key aims. The ONS produces an Annual Compliance Plan which charts the compliance costs by inquiry. This contains details of compliance-reducing initiatives that are either being undertaken, or are in the pipeline, the compliance target for the current year and the profile of compliance costs over a four year timescale. A copy of the Compliance Plan for 1999-2000 is available in the House of Commons Library.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Regular reviews of surveys are carried out to examine wither there is a continuing need for them. Long term plans for bringing down compliance costs include greater use of administrative data, collecting data over the internet, developing commercial accounting software to include a statistics module and sharing the burden more equally among medium size firms.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician, I have been asked to reply to your recent question on the rate of compliance with the Annual Business Inquiry Financial Questionnaire and what penalties exist for non- compliance (155749).</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 1999, 86 per cent of the businesses included in the Annual Business Inquiry completed the Financial Questionnaire. The Annual Business Inquiry is conducted on a statutory basis using powers provided by the Statistics of Trade Act 1947. Businesses that do not respond are liable to prosecution under section 4(1) of the Act. The maximum penalty is a fine of &#163;2,500. However, enforcement action is only used as a last resort when all other efforts, such as postal and telephone reminder action, have failed to secure the return.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Office for National Statistics uses statutory powers because voluntary surveys would have very low response rates. This would lead to unrepresentative samples and biased results, larger sample sizes with many more businesses receiving questionnaires, and to those businesses which chose to reply being unfairly burdened.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 Since May 1997, my Department has introduced and developed a variety of initiatives which will impact on my hon. Friend's constituency and which promote our objectives of access, excellence, education, and creativity and employment. We have published our strategies to take this forward in "Tomorrow's Tourism" and "A Sporting Future for All", which was recently followed up by the Government's Plan for Sport. We have tackled the issue of social inclusion taking forward the recommendations of Policy Action Team 10 on Arts and Sport and developing social inclusion policies across all our areas, which is recognised within the most recent progress report Building on PAT10.
<P>

<a name="10402w16.html_para2">We have given more support to the cultural and sporting infrastructure. The Spending Review 2000 secured a doubling of the budget for sport and the largest ever increase for the arts: an increase of 80 per cent. from &#163;186 million in 1997-98 to &#163;336 million in 2003-04. In taking forward our aim to develop the educational potential of culture and sport &#163;40 million has been allocated to developing Creative Partnerships; we have established through lottery funding, the &#163;30 million National Foundation for Youth Music; and secured an additional &#163;130 million for primary schools sports and arts facilities through the Space for Sport and the Arts programme. With &#163;120 million of central Government and Lottery funding we will be providing a school sports co-ordinator in one in four secondary schools to work with local primary and special schools to improve sporting provision and physical education for children in the most deprived areas. We have delivered free access to national museums for children and the over 60s and additional money will be provided to allow this to be extended to everyone in December 2001. We have commissioned a Taskforce which is currently considering the issues facing non-national museums in the regions.
<P>

<a name="10402w16.html_para3">We have made improvements in the way the Lottery is spent to ensure a fairer distribution. The introduction of the New Opportunities Fund for spending on health, education and the environment has made a real difference to communities everywhere. For instance it has invested &#163;120 million to support the People's Network, which will enable all 4,300 public libraries to offer free public internet access through UK online learning centres; and a further &#163;50 million to stimulate development of content to support the Network.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the development of a new baton round.  [156852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The then Under Secretary of State for Defence, my hon. Friend the Member for Warley (Mr. Spellar), announced on 10 June 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> column 372W, that the Government had put in hand a programme to develop improved baton round equipment with reduced injury potential. A new baton round, designated the L21A1, is now available and has been issued to police forces in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland, and to the Army. The existing baton round will be withdrawn once all personnel have been trained in the use of the new round. It is planned to begin to deploy the new round on an operational basis from 1 June. Revised guidelines for the use of baton rounds in situations of public disorder which apply in the same terms in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were issued to the police on 1 August 1999.
<P>

<a name="10402w19.html_para23">Used, as it will be, with a new optical sight, the new baton round is more consistently accurate than the old, and the probability of it causing serious or life-threatening injury has been reduced. This has been verified by an independent medical assessment, a copy of which has been placed in the Library today by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence. Although there will be smaller risk of serious injury or death when the new baton round is used, that risk has not been eliminated, and the new round, like the old, will be used in situations of public disorder only in accordance with the existing strict guidelines. Details of use in Northern Ireland will, as now, be reported on every occasion and be copied to the Office of the Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland and to the new Policing Board when it is established.
<P>

<a name="10402w19.html_para24">In addition to its possible use in situations of public disorder, the Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) considers that the improved accuracy of the new baton round makes it suitable for use in dealing with people who are posing an immediate threat to life in circumstances in which use of a firearm would otherwise be necessary.
<P>

<a name="10402w19.html_para25">The Government share the view of the ACPO and of the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland that efforts should continue to find an acceptable, effective and less potentially lethal alternative to the plastic baton round. A research programme to that end has been embarked upon, and a document reporting the outcome of its first phase and setting out the next steps in the work programme has also been placed in the Library today by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

 Following the end of the consultation period in October 2000, the Review of Crime Statistics--which aims to enhance the accuracy and consistency of crime recording and to improve the quality of statistical data--has been subject of a review by a group of experts drawn from key stakeholder organisations and academia. The group's function was to consider the continued relevance and appropriateness of the recommendations in light of the consultation. The Expert's Group report indicates their continued support for the Review of Crime Statistics recommendations. A copy of their conclusions is being made available on the Home Office website (www.homeoffice.gov.uk), and has been placed in the Library.

This project offers support and information to parents and carers of young people who are behaving in an anti-social or criminal manner. The YOT has supervised 26 Parenting Orders since April 2000 and has received positive feedback from parents attending these groups either voluntarily or as a condition of an Order. The YJB are also providing approximately &#163;104,000 to a Bail Support Scheme, being run in partnership with National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders.

 <i>[holding answer 23 March 2001]:</i> The importation of meat is permitted from a limited number of countries where foot and mouth disease is present and where the veterinary authorities have contained the disease in specific regions. EC rules permit imports from those regions of the relevant countries which are not considered to pose a risk to human or animal health. Fully matured boneless beef, which does not pose an FMD risk may be imported from other regions subject to veterinary certification. Countries to which these controls currently apply are Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Zimbabwe, Argentina, Brazil, Colombia and Uruguay. Imports of beef have arrived in the UK from all of these countries in the past year with the exception of Colombia where there are no EC approved establishments. Because of their FMD situation prohibitions are currently in place on imports of meat of FMD susceptible species from South Africa, Swaziland and Argentina.

 The Government share with fish catching and processing organisations the goal of a sustainable, viable future for the sea fish industry. We are taking firm action to address the long term needs of the industry. A key priority is to protect our fisheries resources for the future. In close partnership with the fishing industry we are taking a lead in the EU in establishing the recovery plans for key stocks such as cod and hake. We will continue to take this work forward seeking an appropriate combination of measures to provide for stock recovery.

They will encourage fishermen to improve the quality and thus the value of the fish they catch, by careful handling at sea and on land. There is grant aid to promote the use of sustainable and environmentally friendly fishing methods, through the purchase of suitable gear. Grants are also available for innovation in the processing and marketing of fish onshore.
<P>

<a name="10402w22.html_para6">There is an important role for the provision of advice to the industry in responding to the situation of low fish stocks by developing their operations in viable and sustainable ways, and grant aid is available for projects to provide this support to encourage the introduction of best practice.

We are making new training courses available across England as announced on 22 March; they will be free to fishermen, funded by &#163;1.5 million FIFG and MAFF grant over three years. We strongly urge all fishermen to take full advantage of these opportunities.

Other measures are therefore being announced by DETR to assist fishing regions in providing support for retraining and regeneration.

<a name="10402w22.html_para9">Looking further ahead, the recent Green Paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy issued by the European Commission opens up opportunities for us to secure major changes in the way fisheries policy works in future. The Government will be consulting on this in detail with the fishing industry and other interests with the object of developing an approach which secures an economically and environmentally sustainable future to meet the needs of all with an interest in the industry in the UK. Meanwhile, the various measures we are applying will be addressing the range of problems faced by the industry.

In the Government response to this report, the Department for Culture, Media and Sport announced that it would set up a hotel and restaurant industry group to monitor progress on streamlining regulation affecting the hotel and restaurant industry sector. The full text of the response is available at: www.culture.gov.uk. The Regulatory Impact Unit will continue to work closely with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and others to ensure that forthcoming regulations do not impose unnecessary burdens on tourism or other businesses.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w22.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Iddon: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what directions the Lord Chancellor plans to issue covering the budgets and scope of the Community Legal Service.  [156868]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w22.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor has today issued three directions. The first is a budget direction for the CLS, as required under section 5 of the Access to Justice Act 1999. The budget for 2001-02 includes the following provisions:
<P>

<a name="10402w22.html_para11"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the same budget as in 2000-01 for controlled work and new services, of &#163;232 million;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10402w22.html_para12"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>within that budget, &#163;5 million for the new Partnership Innovation Budget, and an increase in other support grants (from &#163;1.5 million to &#163;5 million);
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10402w22.html_para13"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>as last year, a minimum of &#163;20 million to be spent on services provided by not-for-profit bodies; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10402w22.html_para14"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>an increase in the budget for high-cost cases, from &#163;1 million to &#163;4.5 million.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10402w22.html_para15">The second direction brings a number of tribunals into the scope of the CLS by allowing advocacy services to be funded. They are the VAT and Duties Tribunal; the General and Special Commissioners of Income Tax; and 



<P>
<P><I>2 Apr 2001 : Column: 82W</I><P>
the Protection of Children Act Tribunal. In the first two, the Lord Chancellor's decision is based on the need to provide representation where the interests of justice require it, because of the potential for the exercise of the tribunals' power to be interpreted as analogous to the imposition of criminal penalties. In the third, his decision is based on the overwhelming importance to applicants of being allowed to challenge decisions to place them on the Protection of Children Act List and List 99.
<P>

<a name="10402w22.html_para16">The third direction revises the circumstances in which cases that are normally excluded from scope can be funded. The main changes from the Lord Chancellor's first direction, made in April 2000, are:
<P>

<a name="10402w22.html_para17"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>excluded cases involving the liberty of the applicant will be funded, in line with the Government's obligations under the Human Rights Act;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10402w22.html_para18"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>it will be easier to take action for professional negligence, even where the original service was provided in an area of law that is outside the CLS's normal scope;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10402w22.html_para19"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the treatment of cases against public authorities has been revised to make it easier to bring actions for judicial review or serious wrongdoing, and to match the direction to the way the Funding Code treats equivalent work that is in scope; and
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="10402w22.html_para20"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the treatment of mixed cases has been clarified, to restore the Government's original intention that only cases where the excluded element is minor or incidental to the main issue can be funded.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w23.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department when he expects benchmark costs arrangements to commence and for what types of case; if benchmark costs will cover pre-litigated cases; what progress is being made in relation to fixed costs for fast track cases; and if he will make a statement.  [156581]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Department has no intention or powers to introduce benchmark costs. However, I understand that the Senior Costs Judge is currently undertaking consultation on a draft scheme for certain short and routine applications in civil proceedings. The first round produced a list of applications which might be suitable. A second round of consultation (incorporating figures for localities and grade of fee earner) is now taking place.
<P>

<a name="10402w23.html_para0">The Government have an open mind on the introduction of fixed costs in the fast track but no current plans to seek their introduction. Any changes to the way in which the costs regime operates should not limit the effectiveness of conditional fee agreements and other innovative methods of funding and insuring litigation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many Winter Fuel Payments have been claimed in <i>(a)</i> 1997, <i>(b)</i> 1998, <i>(c)</i> 1999 and <i>(d)</i> 2000; how many have been paid to date; how many remain outstanding; what is the total amount of money as yet unpaid in respect of each year; and what proportion of eligible pensioner households have claimed such payments in each year.  [155080]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w23.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Before the current winter, 2000-01, Winter Fuel Payments were all made automatically. In each of the winters of 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 around 10 million payments were made.
<P>

<a name="10402w23.html_para5">Following the European Court decision, we decided to equalise the age--at 60--from which Winter Fuel Payments could be made. Also, the need to be in receipt of a qualifying benefit was removed. As a result, up to 1.5 million people, mostly men aged 60-64, became newly eligible for the winter of 2000-01. Up to 1.9 million people could also be newly eligible for payments for the first three winters of the scheme. Most of these newly eligible people need to make a claim.
<P>

<a name="10402w23.html_para6">For this winter, over 1 million claims have been made and paid, and over 11 million payments have been made overall. Claims for this winter continue to be received and processed, and payments made. For past winters, 1 million payments have been made so far.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what progress is being made to combat pensioner poverty.  [154880]<P>

<P>
37. <a name="10402w23.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Forth: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on pensioner poverty.  [154896]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Our record speaks volumes. Around two million of the poorest pensioner households are now at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997. That's a real terms rise in living standards of at least 17 per cent.

<a name="10402w23.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Means Testing</center></H4>


<P>
21. <a name="10402w23.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Amess: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will make a statement on the impact of means testing on Incapacity Benefit.  [154879]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 We think it is right that some account should be taken of pensions which duplicate the purpose of Incapacity Benefit--to provide some replacement of earnings. The changes will not affect people in receipt of Incapacity Benefit on the date change, 6 April 2001, and will not affect four in five people who become eligible for Incapacity Benefit after this date. Of the people affected, nearly half will have pensions which will take them above the national average income.
<P>

<a name="10402w23.html_para8">As well as making this change we will provide greater support and security through such initiatives as our carers' package of extra help worth &#163;500 million over three years, the Disability Income Guarantee that will help the poorest severely disabled adults, and families with severely disabled children, the increase in the disabled child premium in income-related benefits, the extension of Incapacity Benefit to people disabled early in life who have not had the opportunity to earn and pay National Insurance contributions and the extension of Disability Living Allowance higher rate mobility component to three and four-year-old children.

<P>
38. <a name="10402w23.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Loughton: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what progress he has made in reducing the number of pensioners and families on means-tested benefits.  [154897]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10402w23.html_spnew9"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Welfare State has always used means-tested benefits as part of a complementary mixture of provision alongside contributory and universal benefits. Each plays a part in meeting people's needs. Spending on income-related benefits amounted to 34 per cent. of overall benefit expenditure in 1997-98. Next year we expect this proportion to decrease to 29 per cent.

<P>
<a name="10402w24.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 We have substantially increased the carer premium in Income Support to &#163;24.40 from 1 April. This will benefit some 36,000 low income carers aged 60 years or over.
<P>

<a name="10402w24.html_para2">We also propose to extend eligibility to apply for Invalid Care Allowance (ICA) to carers aged 65 or over as soon as a legislative opportunity permits. This will enable some older carers with limited entitlement to retirement pension to receive ICA, either at the full rate

<a name="10402w24.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Personal tax and benefit changes mean that on average pensioner households will be &#163;600 a year better off than in 1997.

<a name="10402w24.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 From this April the maximum benefit paid to people in residential care and nursing homes will increase by 1.8 per cent. and by a further 1.9 per cent. later this year. This is the first above inflation increase since 1993 and gives a total increase of 3.7 per cent.

complete than constituency level data, but the following provides a comparative guide to the effect of the Department's policies and actions in Leyton and Wanstead since May 1997.
<P>

<a name="10402w26.html_para5">Measures in our five Budgets so far will lift over 1.2 million children out of poverty. These include record increases to Child Benefit, the introduction of the Working Families Tax Credit, increases in the income- related benefits, the minimum wage and tax changes.
<P>

<a name="10402w26.html_para6">Child Benefit will be worth &#163;15.50 a week for the eldest child and &#163;10.35 a week for other children from April 2001: nationally about 7 million families receive Child Benefit, and in Leyton and Wanstead 10,957 families benefit.
<P>

<a name="10402w26.html_para7">We now have the lowest unemployment rate in 25 years. The New Deals have helped lone parents, the young unemployed, the long-term unemployed, the over 50s and partners of the unemployed to move from benefit into work. In the period since May 1997 the number of people claiming Jobseeker's Allowance nationally has reduced from 1,562,400 to 960,600; in Leyton and Wanstead the number has reduced from 4,900 to 2,400. Since May 1997 the number of lone parents who claim Income Support has decreased from 1,013,500 to 894,100 nationally and in Leyton and Wanstead from 2,800 to 2,200.
<P>

<a name="10402w26.html_para8">Older people are disproportionately affected by fuel poverty. So we have introduced Winter Fuel Payments to help with their heaviest fuel bill. This winter, the payment is &#163;200 for households who qualify. Around 12,000 older people in Leyton and Wanstead have received a Winter Fuel Payment for this winter.
<P>

<a name="10402w26.html_para9">To demonstrate our commitment to combating pensioner poverty, this year we will spend &#163;4.5 billion extra in real terms on pensioners. Some 11,300 pensioners in Leyton and Wanstead will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over 75s of whom we estimate there are about 4,600 in Leyton and Wanstead. 2,600 pensioner families in Leyton and Wanstead are receiving the Minimum Income Guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners. From April they will be at least &#163;15 a week, or &#163;800 a year, better off in real terms as a result of Government measures since 1997.
<P>

<a name="10402w26.html_para10">Other reforms in the pipeline include: the new Pension Credit in 2003 designed to ensure that pensioners benefit from their savings; the launch of Stakeholder Pensions in April this year; and the introduction of the State Second Pension in April 2002 both of which will help provide greater security for tomorrow's pensioners.
