 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="40119w01.html_para0">The export of these biological materials is controlled by States' obligations under the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention (BTWC). They are, however, all materials that have a legitimate use in laboratories and facilities for the production of vaccines to protect against the diseases that may be caused by exposure to them. Their export, in small quantities consistent with legitimate medical and scientific research to established scientific institutions in states that are Party to the BTWC, is not banned under the Convention.

<a name="40119w01.html_para1">The Government would expect all other countries to scrutinise any applications for such exports with the same rigour as we would for exports from the United Kingdom.

This examined options, costs and timescales of BMD for the UK and its deployed forces at a cost of &#163;2 million in Financial Year 1994&#150;95 and &#163;2.5 million in Financial Year 1995&#150;96. An extension was completed in Financial Year 1997&#150;98 at a cost of &#163;300,000.
<P>

<a name="40119w02.html_para0">As part of the Corporate Research programme, the Technology Readiness and Risk Assessment Programme (TRRAP) began in July 1998 following an SDR recommendation, focussing on BMD defence of deployed forces. TRRAP cost &#163;2.2 million, &#163;4.5 million, &#163;5 million and &#163;0.8 million in the Financial Years 1998&#150;99 to 2001&#150;02 respectively and completed in July 2001.
<P>

<a name="40119w02.html_para1">Alongside and following TRRAP, a programme of BMD studies ran from Financial Year 1998&#150;99 to Financial Year 2002&#150;03 at a cost of &#163;0.5 million pa. In Financial Years 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 two further programmes examined the longer-range threat at a cost of &#163;1.2 million per annum and assessed the significance of any capability gap at a cost of &#163;0.6 million per annum.
<P>

<a name="40119w02.html_para2">In Financial Year 2001&#150;02 research into theatre BMD building on TRRAP began at a recurring cost of &#163;1 million per annum. Additionally in Financial Year 2003&#150;04, &#163;4 million will be expended on research through the Missile Defence Centre.
<P>

<a name="40119w02.html_para3">In summary, expenditure in the 10 successive Financial Years since 1994&#150;95 is set in the table below:

Decisions on the acquisition of further Astute submarines will be taken in due course. The MOD routinely considers changes to the future Defence programme to ensure that capability levels meet our anticipated requirements.

<a name="40119w03.html_para10">The international community is heavily involved in helping the ATA deal with these problems, by helping reform its army and police force and through further deployment of joint civil-military Provincial Reconstruction Teams. The international coalition continues to counter Taliban fighters in Southern and Eastern Afghanistan and the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) has recently been expanded to allow it to operate beyond Kabul. Subject to provision of troops by contributing nations this will enable it to support the UN-led programme to disarm and demobilise former combatants and facilitate other parts of the Bonn Process including elections.

 DFID's 2003 Autumn Performance Report on progress against our Public Service Agreement, a copy of which was placed in the Library of the House last month, reported that 80 per cent. of our low-risk projects are currently evaluated as completely or largely successful. Of the remaining 20 per cent., many of these are evaluated as achieving a number of their objectives. While this represents a high success rate, DFID is constantly seeking to improve the impact and value for money of all our interventions, including high, medium and low-risk projects.
<P>

<a name="40119w04.html_para2">All projects are subject to an approval process in which their potential contribution to our corporate priorities is assessed. Once underway, projects are 'scored' annually to review progress towards achieving their objectives. Fuller reviews are undertaken midway through their duration and once they are completed. We also conduct wider evaluations of our portfolio's success and of the lessons we have learned. The performance of our portfolio, and progress against this target, is monitored every three months by DFID's Management Board.

 Of the 27 countries that have qualified for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, nine have so far reached completion point and have received an irrevocable reduction in their stock of debt.

 Since the start of 2002 we have committed over &#163;50 million of humanitarian aid to Ethiopia making us one of the largest donors of emergency assistance. This has been channelled through UN agencies, the Ethiopian Government and non-government organisations (NGOs).
<P>

<a name="40119w05.html_para13">A mix of interventions successfully helped to address global acute malnutrition (GAM) and severe acute malnutrition (SAM) in the drought-affected parts of the country. For example, we targeted localities suffering high levels of malnutrition with supplementary and therapeutic feeding through NGOs and UNICEF. This helped bring GAM levels in the most affected areas down to about 7 per cent. to 8 per cent. from over 20 per cent. at the peak of the crisis.
<P>

<a name="40119w05.html_para14">Some pockets of malnutrition remain in 2004 largely as a consequence of poor targeting and delivery capacity. We are providing support to UNICEF for building capacity of the emergency system and will continue to play our part as and when further needs arise.

 There is still a high level of ethnic violence in Ethiopia. Ethnicity is the basis of most of the major political parties, including the ruling party. Many ethnic groups are politically and economically excluded.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development whether he has made formal representations to the United Nations about his proposal for global intervention in countries whose Governments abuse their populations, made in his speech on 30 October 2003 at the UN High Level Dialogue on Financing for Development; and what criteria would be used for such global interventions. [147449]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w06.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 No formal representations have been made to the United Nations concerning intervention in countries with humanitarian crises. The Department for International Development is working closely with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to contribute to the debate on UN reform. The High Level Panel on Threats, Challenges, and Change appointed by Kofi Annan has an important opportunity to make proposals for a more effective UN response in this area. The UK supports reform that will ensure that the UN Security Council assumes its full responsibility to guarantee peace and security. We cannot allow a repeat of the mistakes made in Rwanda in 1994.
<P>

<a name="40119w06.html_para0">Framing acceptable principles for intervention, so that people are protected effectively, and so that states are treated equally, is part of the challenge presently facing the United Nations. An important attempt to develop common ground on principles and criteria for intervention was made in the report of the Canadian-sponsored International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS). We welcomed the commission's report, The Responsibility to Protect, which was published in December 2001. It attempts to move the debate from an unproductive discussion of intervention towards a new focus on the responsibilities held by states to protect their own citizens from avoidable catastrophes from mass murder, rape and from starvation. When states are unwilling or unable to fulfil their responsibilities, it argues that the responsibility to protect should be borne by a broader community of states. It also stresses that the responsibility to prevent conflict is as important as the responsibility to react, and that any intervention is accompanied by a responsibility to rebuild.

 On 1 September 2003, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) published a working paper entitled "Fiscal Sustainability in African HIPC Countries: A Policy Dilemma?" The paper focuses on the link between fiscal policy and debt sustainability. The authors concluded that, without more international assistance in the form of grants or private non-debt financing (such as foreign direct investment), Governments would need to raise taxes or scale down social spending programmes in order to maintain sustainable fiscal positions in the face of possible adverse shocks. The authors noted that the paper's conclusions were sensitive to assumptions on growth rate, interest rate, and exchange rate dynamics.
<P>

<a name="40119w06.html_para1">This problem has already been recognised by the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF), and the UK is pressing for additional relief at HIPC Completion Point, where necessary, to ensure that countries have sustainable external debt levels. On longer-term debt sustainability, the UK welcomes the report being prepared by the World Bank and IMF on ensuring debt sustainability for low-income countries, including HIPCs, while enabling them to access sufficient finance for their poverty reduction strategies. We hope to reach agreement on the appropriate policy response at the spring meetings of the World Bank and IMF in April.
<P>

<a name="40119w06.html_para2">We also recognise that, in order to meet the Millennium Development Goals, an additional US$50 billion a year until 2015 is required from the international community. That is why the UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility is so important. It could provide the much-needed substantial increase in resources that debt relief alone would not achieve.

 While some African countries have successfully reduced child mortality since 1990, in others it has changed little, and some African countries have experienced a rise in child mortality since 1990. It is generally accepted that a significant change will be needed if the target to reduce under-five mortality rates by two thirds by 2015 is to be achieved. Challenges include: the HIV/AIDS epidemic; economic decline and persistent poverty; inequality; under-resourced and poorly functioning health systems; and lack of progress in reducing the number of deaths of newborn babies.
<P>

<a name="40119w07.html_para1">DFID supports child health through wider work on strengthening health systems. We are actively supporting health sector development in 10 African countries, including working with partners to strengthen policy and action on child health. The UK will also continue to contribute to global initiatives such as the Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, TB and Malaria, the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization and Roll Back Malaria, which have helped revitalise interest in childhood diseases and substantially increased the resources directed to child health. We shall continue to support implementation of the Integrated Management of Childhood Illness Initiative with partners from the United Nations International Children's Fund, the World Health Organisation, the World Bank and the United States Agency for International Development.

 The general security situation in Liberia remains stable, if fragile. However, while the number of UNMIL peacekeeping troops is insufficient to guarantee security across the country, the humanitarian agencies are understandably cautious in extending their activities beyond Monrovia; humanitarian operations remain restricted in scope, with only a few agencies implementing mostly small-scale activities in the more distant and insecure counties. In spite of this, the most urgent and acute humanitarian needs across Liberia are being met. Recent UNMIL deployments to Buchanan and Tubmanburg will, we hope, lead to the opening of UN sub-offices in these strategic towns, and a scaling up of humanitarian assistance. We understand that the UN is considering reducing the security alert level outside Monrovia from the current maximum level of Phase IV. This would also assist the spread of humanitarian programmes.

<P>
<a name="40119w09.html_spnew2"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Given the extensive displacement of the population from their agricultural land, domestic food production in Liberia is inadequate, and will remain so in 2004.

In order to make the best use of this drug, further research to combine it with another drug to protect against early resistance is being undertaken, managed under an umbrella organisation called the Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV), which DFID also supports. MMV is an important and innovative organisation that brings together researchers from the public and private sectors, with donors and foundations. DFID is funding MMV with &#163;1 million per year for five years.

 A succession of failed rains over the past four years has resulted in large-scale food insecurity among pastoral populations in the Sool and Sanaag regions of northern Somalia. The UN Food Security Assessment Unit (FSAU) surveyed the Sool plateau between 27 November and 5 December 2003, with preliminary results showing a global acute malnutrition rate of 18.9 per cent. and a severe acute malnutrition rate of 3.8 per cent. amongst children. Malnutrition rates among adult women (15 to 49 years) were 17.3 per cent., suggesting all household members are affected by the current drought. There is evidence of deterioration in the nutritional status of the population, confirmed by reports of collapsing social support system and a worsening drought after the failure of Deyr rains. Malnutrition rates appeared significantly higher among children from pastoral households than those in major villages. With no rains expected before April, further losses to livestock and other assets are expected.

<P>
<a name="40119w11.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what estimate he has made of the breakdown between public sector finance and private sector finance towards the costs of delivering the millennium development goals in sub-Saharan Africa. [148113]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w11.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 Several estimates of costs of reaching the millennium development goals (MDGs) have been made using differing methodologies and assumptions about developments over the next decade. Uncertainties include how rapidly the policies of African countries might improve, how rapidly countries which have been in conflict emerge from it, how severe the longer term impacts of HIV/AIDS will be, and what impact shocks such as droughts might have.
<P>

<a name="40119w11.html_para0">Improved policies can make a big difference to the costs of achieving improvements in social indicators, but undoubtedly much more money is needed to achieve the MDGs. Both public and private finance has a role to play. Public expenditure is needed to help fund social services such as health and education, and the money for this can come from domestic taxes as well as from external aid. How much domestic revenue is generated depends on how fast the economy grows as well as on the tax system. Private investment, domestic and foreign, can help finance social services too, but also has the potential to accelerate economic growth.
<P>

<a name="40119w11.html_para1">More analysis has been done on how much extra foreign aid will be needed for the MDGs in sub-Saharan Africa than on how much extra private sector money would be necessary. The aid estimates suggest that two or three times the current total annual inflows of $13 billion might be needed. The scale of this challenge suggests that we need to focus on four things. First, we should encourage African countries to develop sound policies for reducing poverty and the capacity to implement them, while continuing to follow prudent macroeconomic policies and to improve the environment they create for private investors. This will enhance their capacity to use aid effectively at the same time as raising their economic growth potential. Second, we should promote higher inflows of aid to countries with such policies. Third, we should seek to improve the quality of aid, in terms of its predictability and 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 2004 : Column 952W</I><P>
flexibility, for instance by directly funding national budgets. Fourth, we should work to make international trade and finance systems more supportive of economic growth and poverty reduction in low income countries.

 DFID does not produce its own estimates of the number of people living in poverty. This is a complex and resource intensive task. We use estimates produced by the World Bank.

 <i>[holding answer 14 January 2004]:</i> The Department allocates funds to the Learning and Skills Council for the provision of A-Levels and equivalent academic courses in the post-16 learning and skills sector. The Department does not provide a specific budget to the LSC for sixth-form colleges. It is for the Learning and Skills Council to determine for itself the right level of investment in sixth-form colleges from the funds allocated to it for learning participation. Mark Haysom the Council's Chief Executive will to write to the hon. Gentleman providing details of the funds allocated to sixth-form colleges from 1996&#150;97 to 2003&#150;04, and provisional allocations to sixth form colleges from 2004&#150;05 to 2005&#150;06. A copy of his letter will be placed in the House Library.

 I announced last month that a minimum of 400 initial teacher training places would be made available in the 2004/05 academic year for trainees with an early years specialism. These are all places on Postgraduate Certificate in Education courses and will therefore in principle attract &#163;6,000 training bursaries. An additional &#163;2 million will be made available to the Teacher Training Agency to cover the costs of the additional places that will fall in the 2004&#150;05 financial year. In view of the growing demand for trained teachers in early years settings, there is every reason to expect that suitable employment opportunities will be available for the trainees who are being recruited to fill these places.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w12.html_spnew6"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The latest available estimates for fee income under the existing arrangements are for 2003/04: the total income from the standard fee of &#163;1,125 is estimated at &#163;847 million. Information on the additional income from variables fees is contained in the Regulatory Impact Assessment published on 8 January alongside the HE Bill. Because of the nature of a variable scheme, the extra income from fees will vary according to the decisions that higher education institutions take on the level of fee, both when variable

<a name="40119w12.html_sbhd5"><H3 align=center>University Bursaries</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w12.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate he has made of the average bursary that universities charging the full &#163;3,000 will pass on to students from poorer backgrounds; and how many students he estimates will receive this bursary. [148567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w12.html_spnew7"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 As a minimum, the Government want to ensure that no student who qualifies for the maximum state support (around 30 per cent. of students) has to take out additional debt as a result of higher fees. For a student on a &#163;3,000 course, this means a minimum bursary/financial support of at least &#163;300. But, as we have made clear the Director will expect more than the minimum from those institutions that do not have a strong record in access. For example, Cambridge University have announced that they will offer bursaries of &#163;4,000 a year for the poorest students. Therefore we expect the average bursary will be more than &#163;300 and more than 30 per cent. of students will benefit.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what powers the Office of Fair Access will have in the setting of bursary amounts in respect of universities that do not have strong records in recruiting students from poorer backgrounds.  [148568]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w12.html_spnew8"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 From 2006, no institution will be able to charge higher fees without having an access plan which will include details of the action they will take to safeguard access, including offering financial support (including bursaries) and running outreach activities. The Director of Fair Access will scrutinise the access plans and refuse to approve any which are not satisfactory.

<a name="40119w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Chechen extremists had close and long-established links to terrorists based in Afghanistan under the Taliban regime. Some foreign terrorists who trained in Afghanistan, and had ties with al-Qaeda, went on to fight in Chechnya. Some Chechens fought with the Taliban and al-Qaeda against the Northern Alliance, and subsequently against the Coalition. Chechen groups even set up an "Embassy" in Kabul in early 2001. Those involved are subject to UN sanctions under UN Security Council Resolution 1267. Under the same resolution, the leading Chechen rebel field commander Shamil Basayev was made subject to UN sanctions on 12 August 2003.We have no strong evidence of Chechen terrorists being in Iraq. Some networks that support Chechen terrorism, however, may also support extremists in Iraq. Chechen extremists have developed links with a wide range of other extremists, including some in Europe, in order to fund and support their campaign. Some extremists see the conflict in Chechnya as a 'jihad' which they have a duty to support.

 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2004]:</i> The formation of a new "government" under the leadership of the pro-settlement politician Mehmet Ali Talat in northern Cyprus is an encouraging development. So too was the statement last week by Turkey's Prime Minister Erdogan. I was impressed during my visit to Ankara last week at the new positive line from the Turkish Government in support of the Annan Plan. I stressed in talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Gul the need for Turkey to support and work for the speedy acceptance of the Annan Plan with a view to finding a settlement that would allow a united Cyprus to enter the EU on 1 May this year. It is in the interest of all with a stake in Cyprus to work for a settlement by 1 May.

That is what the majority of the Turkish Cypriot population voted for on 14 December 2003. We continue to believe that the UN Secretary General's proposals offer the only realistic basis for a just, comprehensive and lasting settlement. All sides must now commit to resume substantive settlement negotiations on the basis of these proposals as soon as possible, in line with the requirements set down by the UN Secretary General in his report of 1 April 2003.

 We continue to follow developments in Hong Kong closely, in line with our responsibilities as a co-signatory to the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary continues to report regularly to Parliament on the implementation of the Joint Declaration.

: The Government have repeatedly said that neither side should take unilateral action that could prejudge the status of Jersualem.

The decision to declare the land between the fence and the Green Line a "closed zone" and require those Palestinians who live on or farm it to apply for a permit to access their land is a matter of particular concern.

The 28 votes listed above represent around 2.3 per cent. of the 1,238 votes on substantive resolutions which have either been adopted or vetoed since 1975. In the same period, there were 23 occasions in which the UK voted positively and the US abstained, and 21 occasions when the UK abstained and the US voted against. There have been no occasions since 1975 when the UK abstained and the US voted positively, or the UK voted against and the US abstained.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w17.html_spnew2"><B> Paul Goggins: </B> 
 Decisions on the targeting of sentences are for the courts, based on the full facts of individual cases. However, the Government is determined to ensure that sentences delivered are appropriate to offences committed. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduces a range of new sentences so that courts have a full range of options at their disposal in order to deal with offences and offenders appropriately.
<P>

<a name="40119w17.html_para5">These include the new Generic Community Sentence, which will allow judges and magistrates to choose specific elements (such as drug rehabilitation, unpaid work, curfew) that best suit the profiles of individual offenders and crimes.
<P>

<a name="40119w17.html_para6">The Act also enhances protection for the public from dangerous offenders. It introduces new indeterminate sentences for use where an offender is considered to pose a significant risk to the public. These sentences will ensure that an offender may be kept in custody for as long as he or she is considered to pose a threat to the public. If the risk posed decreases over time, the offender will become eligible for release once the period specified by the court as the minimum necessary for punitive purposes has been served.

<P>

<a name="40119w17.html_para7">In addition, to promote consistency in sentencing between courts, the Act set up the Sentencing Guidelines Council, an independent body chaired by the Lord Chief Justice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w17.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Forming an accurate estimate of the levels of trafficking in people is problematic because of the secretive and hidden nature of the act. There are currently no accurate, reliable data in existence within the UK or the European Union. A Home Office research study "Stopping Traffic" (Police Research Series 125, published in 2000), indicated that there was intelligence to suggest that some women and children are trafficked into the UK for the purposes of sexual exploitation. This was estimated at between 140 and 1,400 per year but it was not possible to say how accurate this estimate is. The report concluded that there was no evidence to suggest that this was on a large scale in the UK compared with other European countries.
<P>

<a name="40119w17.html_para8">However, due to the very serious nature of the crime, in 2000, the Government set up a multi-agency taskforce called Reflex to co-ordinate the operational response to tackling organised crime groups involved in human trafficking and the smuggling of people into the UK. Since April 2003, there have been 14 significant disruptions (26 in total) and from these 37 convictions for related offences.
<P>

<a name="40119w17.html_para9">The Government have also introduced specific criminal sanctions covering traffickers. We have acted quickly to deal with the worst forms of exploitation by creating an offence of trafficking for the purposes of controlling someone in prostitution within the Nationality, Immigration, and Asylum Act 2002. More comprehensive offences concerning trafficking into, out of and within the UK for all forms of sexual exploitation are included in the Sexual Offences Act which received Royal Assent in November 2003. A new offence covering trafficking for forced labour and removal of organs is included in the Asylum and Immigration Bill, currently before Parliament. All of these offences carry a maximum penalty of 14 years.

 No decisions have yet been made about the level of the fees. The Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) is required to provide a range of fees for indicative purposes only. The upper limit of that range, &#163;500, does not signify that the Government intends, as some newspapers suggested, to set fees at that level.

<a name="40119w17.html_para10">The enabling power is the first stage of a two stage process. The second part of the process is to undertake a full Regulatory Impact Assessment and wider consultation with key stakeholders. Following this consultation, decisions regarding fee levels, scope and timing of introduction can then be made taking these views fully into account.

 For the 12 month period to August 2003 the level of representation for Presenting Officers and Counsel when taken together was 72 per cent. This relatively low level of representation was caused, in large part, by difficulties in recruiting Presenting Officers, particularly in the London area. The level of representation will increase early in 2004 as up to 65 newly recruited Presenting Officers complete their training and take up their posts.

 Approximately 2,500 lorries arrive at Dover every day on board cross channel ferries. Port authorities and operators in both Calais and Dunkerque check all lorries entering their port and again using UK supplied New Detection Technology (NDT) before lorries board ferries for the UK.
<P>

<a name="40119w17.html_para11">As it is clearly more effective to have searched lorries before they embark on ferries to the UK than on arrival at Dover lorries are selected for search by Immigration Service search teams only on an intelligence-led basis employing known profiles of vehicles used in people smuggling. Other vehicles such as private cars and vans are systematically checked in France by agents acting for the ferry operator.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2003]:</i> Prisoners are not routinely held in police cells as a result of overcrowding. When population pressures result in police cells being used, it is under an arrangement between the Prison Service and the police called "Operation Safeguard". Operation Safeguard has not been used since 2002 (between 11 July and 20 December 2002).
<P>

<a name="40119w18.html_para0">The average daily cost of holding a prisoner in a police cell during 2002 was &#163;363 per person per night. The total cost of holding prisoners in police cells in 2002 was &#163;10.4 million.
<P>

<a name="40119w18.html_para1">There are occasions where prisoners have to be accommodated in police cells because the escort contractor cannot deliver them to the receiving prison before its reception closes. There is an on-going arrangement with many police forces, known as "Lock-outs". These are entirely separate arrangements from Operation Safeguard. This arrangement is sometimes used to facilitate the return of prisoners to court the next day or when a court hearing extends into the evening. The average daily cost of holding a prisoner on Lock-out is currently &#163;120 per person per night. The total cost for Lock-outs in 2002 was &#163;1.356 million.
<P>

<a name="40119w18.html_para2">The total cost of holding prisoners in police cells under both Operation Safeguard and Lock-outs in 2002 was &#163;11.756 million.
<P>

<a name="40119w18.html_para3">No prisoners were held under Operation Safeguard in 2003. There were a total of 982 prisoners held in police cells as Lock-outs in 2003. In addition, eight prisoners were held in police cells in the Greater Manchester area on the weekend of 7&#150;8 June 2003, as an emergency measure, following a disturbance at HMP Whealstun, which resulted in a temporary loss of accommodation at the establishment. These prisoners were not held under arrangements for Operation Safeguard or as Lock-outs.

<a name="40119w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Blunkett: </B> 
 Figures collected by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary show that, in 2002&#150;03 the number of officers allocated to patrol duties was 63,426. However, we know that there is significant variation between forces in the amount of time officers spend on front line duties, including patrol. We are, as part of the Police Performance Assessment Framework, collecting data from forces so that we can publish a baseline estimate of front line policing for all forces. This will be a valuable tool to drive up the amount of time spent on front line duties.
<P>

<a name="40119w18.html_para4">We remain committed to tackling administrative burdens and inefficient practices in the police service. Sir David O'Dowd's Taskforce was commissioned to give the Government a police service view of what could be done to tackle the administrative burdens and inefficient practices which keep police officers off the streets. The Taskforce report, published in September 2002, highlighted ways of freeing up significant amounts of officers' time. Among the achievements to date, more than 4,600 forms in 21 forces are now obsolete and all 43 forces now have the capacity to undertake video identity parades. The national roll out of the fixed penalty notice scheme is scheduled for completion by April 2004. Other initiatives are contributing to the reducing burden on police officers. In addition, there is a major Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary Thematic inspection on Civilianisation/The use of non-sworn staff due to report April/May 2004. &#163;8 million has been set aside this financial year for workforce modernisation projects, the criteria for which include the release of officers for front line duties.

 The mandatory sentence for murder is life imprisonment. Under the provisions of the Life Sentences (Northern Ireland) Order 2001, the determination of the appropriate minimum period or tariff, which any life sentence prisoner in Northern Ireland must serve in custody before consideration can be given to release, is a matter for judicial discretion. The sentencing judge can set a tariff for a fixed period of years or determine that a whole life tariff would be more appropriate in individual cases.

<a name="40119w19.html_para4">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced in England and Wales a new statutory framework providing for four different starting-points for the judicial determination of minimum terms in mandatory life sentence cases. That framework provides for an initial starting point of 30 years for a person convicted of the murder of a police or prison officer in the course of their duty in England and Wales.

 My Department recognises the need to review the policy in relation to people with dementia.

<a name="40119w20.html_para10">We receive nominations for people from a broad spectrum of sports and there is always stiff competition for the limited number of awards available in each Honours List. Individual nominations are considered strictly on merit: the discipline in which the individual has achieved success is not a factor in the decision-making process. We are always interested in receiving nominations from the public and sports bodies and the Rugby Football League is one of many of sports organisations invited on a regular basis to make nominations.

 All airlines operating international services are required to have certificates showing that they meet the safety standards established by the International Civil Aviation Organisation.

<a name="40119w22.html_para0">If another Member State has issued an operating permit to an airline we would expect that airline to meet the necessary international safety standards. However, the fact that another Member State had issued a permit would not itself provide authorisation for that airline to operate to the UK. The UK reserves the right to make its own decisions on whether or not to issue a permit. Permits may also be refused, suspended or revoked for safety or other reason, as illustrated in my answer to the hon. Member of 8 January 2004, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 429&#150;30W.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will list the <i>(a)</i> date and <i>(b)</i> nature of each incident involving ships in British waters assisting other vessels attempting to bring illegal immigrants to Britain since 1997; and what the names of the vessels were in each case.  [148502]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency co-ordinates the search and rescue of persons in distress at sea and responded to over 13,000 incidents in the last year. The Agency collects data about the nature of incidents, including the types of vessels involved in terms of whether they are commercial ships, fishing vessels or pleasure craft. However, the Agency does not collect data relating to illegal immigration.
<P>

<a name="40119w22.html_para5">The UK Immigration Service also does not collate the information in the format requested. However, the Service does work closely with European counterparts to identify vessels concerned with smuggling potential illegal immigrants to the UK. In addition, as part of REFLEX, the government's multi-agency task force to combat organised immigration crime, the Immigration Service co-operates with other government departments to exchange information on those suspected of involvement in maritime smuggling.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w22.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Due to its environmental benefits, liquid natural gas (LNG) enjoys a lower rate of duty compared to conventional fuels, equivalent to 6p per litre compared to some 47p per litre for petrol and diesel. In the pre-Budget report the Chancellor announced that this differential will be held constant for a further three years.
<P>

<a name="40119w22.html_para6">Alternatively fuelled vehicles are also eligible for lower rates of vehicle excise duty depending on their CO2 emissions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many vehicles using liquid natural gas benefited from tax advantages in the last year for which figures are available; and how many were <i>(a)</i> cars and <i>(b)</i> vans.  [147941]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w22.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Figures published by the Natural Gas Vehicle Association for August estimate that there are 875 natural gas vehicles in the UK which will have benefited from the duty differential for natural gas. Of these 20 are estimated to be cars: there is no estimate for vans. Details of the split between vehicles using liquid natural gas and compressed natural gas were not published.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what Government grants are available to convert petrol cars to liquid natural gas; what the take-up has been in the current financial year; and how much is available for the remainder of the financial year.  [147942]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w22.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Limited grants are available under the TransportEnergy programmes to offset the additional costs of purchasing clean fuelled vehicles including those powered by liquid natural gas (LNG). Grant offers have been made for 45 LNG vehicles in this financial year, which will be honoured once the conversions are completed under the terms of the grant offer letters.
<P>

<a name="40119w22.html_para7">The Energy Saving Trust, who administer the grant programmes for the Government, will not be issuing any new grant offer letters this financial year as they have now received applications to cover the full TransportEnergy programme budget of nearly &#163;30 million. This is a considerable increase from the &#163;18 million spend in 2001&#150;02, and the Trust forecast they will provide grants for around 8,000 vehicles this year, compared with 5,000 last year. The grant programmes will resume in April 2004.

<P>
<a name="40119w24.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) supports farmers' incomes via a number of methods&#151;direct payments, export subsidies, intervention buying and tariffs&#151;which ensure that EU farmers receive higher prices for their goods. These measures increase the level of production and therefore result in lower imports and / or higher exports than would otherwise be the case. This can have the effect of depressing world prices for certain commodities. Developing country producers who would otherwise be competitive on world markets may find themselves unable to compete. This could distort the allocation of resources in a particular country away from those in which it has a comparative advantage towards less competitive sectors.
<P>

<a name="40119w24.html_para0">The CAP reforms agreed in June 2003 will help to break the link between income support and production in the EU and will reconnect farmers to their markets. Production occurring as a result of loss-making activities should cease as farmers decisions are increasingly determined by market forces rather than subsidies. This production response will reduce EU production and net exports and, where this results in a higher world price, it should have a beneficial impact on developing country producers.

 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2004]</i>: Animal and public health in the UK are protected from BSE from third countries by existing EU import rules. These rules require any third country exporting meat or live animals into the Community to have in place controls equivalent to those in the EU. These controls are supported by a requirement for veterinary certification in relation to individual meat consignments.

<a name="40119w24.html_para2">Imports of beef and beef products are permitted only if EU rules requiring the removal of specified risk material (SRM&#151;eg skull, tonsils, spinal cord, intestine) and methods of slaughter are met.
<P>

<a name="40119w24.html_para3">A recent meeting of the EU's Chief Veterinary Officers was informed that the European Commission were following up the implications of the recent BSE case with the US authorities. The Chief Veterinary Officers supported the Commission in taking this approach. An EU technical visit to the US is being arranged to evaluate the position.

<P>
<a name="40119w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2004]:</i> We agreed a Total Allowable Catch (TAC) for Irish Sea cod of 2,150 tonnes (a 10 per cent. increase on the 2003 TAC that in fact represents a reduction in fishing effort). We agreed 20 per cent. cuts in the associated plaice and sole TACs, as opposed to the 47 per cent. and 34 per cent. cuts proposed by the Commission. A threefold increase in the haddock TAC will help to balance cuts, and a minimal cut in the nephrops TAC allows current catch levels to be maintained.
<P>

<a name="40119w24.html_para7">Landings in Whitehaven, mainly demersal species and shellfish from both UK and Irish vessels, are likely to reflect the above TAC changes.
<P>

<a name="40119w24.html_para8">The designated port arrangements for the United Kingdom will not be affected except that landings of North Sea haddock taken under the special conditions set out in Annex IV of Council Regulation 2287/2003 will be restricted to designated ports in Scotland and on the east coast of England.

A number of these arrangements affect processed foods exports. In addition the Commission has identified possible problems in relation to speculation in the sugar sector and potential stock piling of community exports in acceding member states. To counter this sugar export refunds have been withdrawn with effect from 28 November 2003.

 Consistent with the need to ensure fair and transparent procurement processes in line with legal obligations, the Department's procurement policy is to obtain value for money and protect the public purse.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of the annual sugar consumption in the United Kingdom she estimates is met by domestic sugar beet production.  [148611]<P>

<P>
<a name="40119w25.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 It is not possible to give an estimate of the percentage of the annual sugar consumption in the UK which is met by domestic sugar beet production. This is due to several reasons. Firstly, it is not possible to distinguish between exports of sugar produced from imported sugar cane and exports of sugar produced from domestic sugar beet. Secondly, not all sugar is consumed directly, it is also manufactured into many processed products. Although those processed products may be produced in the UK, they may not be consumed here.
<P>

<a name="40119w25.html_para6">However, the Department produces data on the annual total production of sugar (on a refined basis) from domestic sugar beet and supplies for the UK market. These figures are published annually in "Agriculture in the United Kingdom". Copies are available in the House Library or on the Defra website at www.defra.gov.uk/esg. The latest figures available are for 2002 and are provisional. A total of 1,390,000 tonnes of sugar were produced from sugar beet in 2002. The UK imported 1,309,000 tonnes of sugar and exported 487,000 tonnes of sugar. Thus, the total new supply of sugar available for use in the UK in 2002 was 2,212,000 tonnes (see Table 1 as follows). UK production as a percentage of new supply, which is the commonly used measure of self sufficiency, was 63 per cent. in 2002.

 The use of economic instruments to encourage the aviation industry to take account of and, where appropriate, reduce its contribution to global warming, local air pollution and noise pollution was considered in the Air Transport White Paper, published in December 2003. The White Paper supported widened use of airport charges linked to the level of local noise and air pollutant emissions. In addition, we announced that, as part of the Government's commitment to using economic instruments to help tackle greenhouse gas emissions, the UK will push hard at international level to secure agreement on including aviation in the EU's emissions trading scheme.

 The additional &#163;406 million announced by the Chancellor includes &#163;340 million for local authorities in England. This means that, including the additional resources announced at the time of the provisional local government finance settlement, the Government is making an additional &#163;760 million in grant available for local authorities in England, over and above what the last spending review originally allocated. Total Government support next year will total &#163;54.5 billion&#151;up from &#163;50.8 billion for 2003/04 on a like for like basis. That represents an increase, in real terms, of 30 per cent. in central government support since 1997 and is the second year in succession that all authorities have received an above inflation increase in government grant.

 The Financial Services Authority has developed a 'twin peaks' approach to the requirements for capital to support with-profits liabilities. This compares the capital required on a prudent regulatory basis with that needed on a realistic basis to meet payments made to policyholders, including terminal bonuses. The regulator will consider the impact on individual firms, including those that have a mutual structure, and on the industry as part of further development of its reserving proposals.

 The new Basel Accord will be an international agreement on prudential capital, applying mainly to internationally active banks. Implementation of the new Basel Accord in Europe will be through a new Capital Adequacy Directive, which is expected to have a broader scope covering credit institutions and investment firms (as was the case for the implementation of the existing Basel Accord). That broader scope will encompass some mutual organisations, for example building societies, although the detailed boundaries are yet to be determined. The Treasury will assess the European Commissions formal proposals in the usual way once they are issued.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien:  </B> 
The EU's Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) scheme has traditionally operated for a series of 10-year periods. While we are currently in the cycle for 1995&#150;2004, revisions of the current scheme were agreed at the end of 2003. Details of these revisions can be found in <i>Official Journal</i> of the EU of 19 December 2003 and 31 December 2003 (Council Regulations No. 2211/2003 and 2331/2003 respectively). The main change was a one-year rollover, with amendments to the graduation criteria. This revised GSP scheme is therefore due to end on 31 December 2005. Proposals for a new GSP scheme will need to be agreed by 31 December 2004, thus providing EU importers with 12 months' notice to plan for changes to duty rates.
<P>

<a name="40119w29.html_para3">The Commission has indicated its intention to begin the renegotiation process of the EU GSP scheme early this year through regular working party meetings once initial proposals have been published. Officials from my Department will lead on the consultation across Whitehall and industry and, together with colleagues from the UK's Permanent Representation to the EU, make representations on behalf of the UK at these working party meetings. The proposals will be cleared through Parliament by Explanatory Memoranda in the usual way.

The company is committed to achieving this through natural wastage, voluntary redundancy and redeployment of surplus staff within other parts of the business, under an agreement reached with the unions.

<a name="40119w32.html_para6">To supplement this higher level guidance, the Department has worked closely with RDAs, other Departments and the Office of Project Appraisal Training to produce the "Single Programme Appraisal Guidance".

 There is no specific Government support for the setting up of call centres in rural areas.

RSA is available to support investment and the creation or safeguarding of jobs in the assisted areas for viable projects that benefit regional and national economies and which without RSA would not go ahead.

<a name="40119w33.html_para5">The DTI invests &#163;l billion a year in support of business and of that sum &#163;400&#150;500 million is spent on business support schemes. RSA with an annual budget of &#163;110 million is one of the largest business support schemes.

 Since the introduction of the Community Legal Service (CLS) in 2000, it has improved access for those who are financially eligible to good quality civil legal and advice services. In many areas local CLS providers have linked up with other government programmes jointly to help people climb out of social exclusion.

<P>
<a name="40119w35.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Department for Constitutional Affairs is responsible for Government policy on transsexual people and for the Gender Recognition Bill. The Bill, which was introduced in the House of Lords on 27 November, will see the advancement of the rights of transsexual people by giving them legal recognition in their acquired gender. From the inception in 1999 of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Transsexual People the Government have been careful to take into account the views of all those with an interest in transsexual issues, supporters and opponents. Transsexual people are a small minority group in our society and the issues around the recognition of an acquired gender are often unfamiliar to those not directly affected. Accordingly, the Government have worked closely with individual transsexual people and their representative organisations to better understand the issues and to ensure that the Bill strikes a sensible balance between their rights and the rights of others. The Department's promotion of gender recognition issues has been limited to correspondence and meetings with the transsexual community and those who have

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs if he will make a statement about the Government's proposals for the judicial review of the decisions of immigration appeal tribunals.  [148336]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w36.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The Government has introduced measures in the Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants Etc) Bill to establish a new single Asylum and Immigration Tribunal. This will merge the two current tiers of appeal in asylum and immigration cases. The judicial determinations and decisions made by the new Tribunal will be final and can only be challenged in the higher courts on the grounds that a Tribunal Member has acted in bad faith.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w36.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs whether a case remitted by the Immigration Appeals Tribunal may be returned to the original adjudicator.  [147852]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w36.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Pursuant to Rule 22 of the Immigration and Asylum Appeals (Procedure) Rules 2003, the Immigration Appeal Tribunal may direct a remitted appeal to be returned to the original adjudicator to determine in accordance with any directions given by the tribunal.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w36.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what proportion of appeals remitted back from the Immigration Appeals Tribunal to the adjudicators in 2002&#150;03 were subsequently upheld by adjudicators.  [147853]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w36.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Statistical assessment of cases remitted by the tribunal to the adjudicators indicates that in approximately 25 per cent. of remitted asylum cases this leads to the initial adjudicator decision being changed. Between 1 October 2002 to 30 September 2003 (the last full year for which information is available) this equates to 1.6 per cent. of all adjudicator asylum decisions having a different outcome following remittal and re-hearing.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what the possible outcomes of the remittal process are, with respect to the Immigration Appeals Tribunal.  [147854]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w36.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Once an appeal has been remitted from the Immigration Appeal Tribunal to the adjudicator tier of the Immigration Appellate Authority the appeal is most commonly heard by a different adjudicator, or more rarely, by the original adjudicator. The possible outcomes from the remittal process are for the appeal to be allowed, to be dismissed or withdrawn by the appellant. Following a fresh adjudicator determination, parties again have rights to seek permission to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Tribunal.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w36.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs in what circumstances appeals are remitted back from the Immigration Appeals Tribunal to the adjudicators; 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 2004 : Column 1054W</I><P>
what guidance is given to the tribunal on remittals; and what training tribunal members have had on remittals.  [147865]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w36.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 Appeals are remitted from the Immigration Appeal Tribunal when a defect in the original adjudicator determination is revealed which the Tribunal cannot correct itself. The President of the Immigration Appeal Tribunal has not issued a formal Practice Direction relating to the remittal of appeals, but Tribunal members will take the decision to remit a case where there is no practicable alternative. Decisions are taken in the light of the overriding objective in rule 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Appeals (Procedure) Rules 2003: "to secure the just, timely and effective disposal of appeals and applications in the interests of the parties to the proceedings and in the wider public interest". Training for Tribunal judiciary includes reference to the application of procedural rules and guidance.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what proportion of appeals which are <i>(a)</i> successful, <i>(b)</i> dismissed, <i>(c)</i> withdrawn and <i>(d)</i> remitted back to the Immigration Appeals Tribunal are (i) appeals by asylum claimants and (ii) appeals by immigration authorities.  [148017]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w36.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 At the adjudicator asylum appeal, the two parties are the asylum seeker and the Home Secretary (as the initial decision-maker). Either party can apply for permission to appeal to the Tribunal and, if permission is granted, the appeal will be substantively determined. As either party can appeal, "allowed" and "dismissed" at the Tribunal do not equate to the grant or refusal of asylum.

<a name="40119w36.html_para0">In 2002, the Immigration Appeals Tribunal substantively determined 5,565 asylum appeals.

<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w36.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 There are no automatic "sentences" for fines. However the Courts Act, 2003 provides a number of new arrangements to facilitate the enforcement of fines, including mandatory automatic attachment of earnings orders if the defendant is in employment, or deductions from social security benefits if they are not working which will be applied upon first default. The Act introduces "fines officers" (who will have delegated powers), an automatic increase (to a maximum 50 per cent. of the fine) for continued non-payment of the fine, and a range of new sanctions as further steps for non-payment. These include clamping the defaulter's car and registration of the fine in a new combined register of judgments and fines. There will also be new offences for not providing means information or for providing false information to the court or fines officer. The increase and new sanctions will be piloted in six local pilot areas in a phased rollout from 23 February 2004. The new mandatory application of the Attachment of Earnings Orders and Deductions from Benefits will be piloted nationwide, together with the rollout of the new offences for non-provision of means information from 5 April 2004. Where the court is satisfied that an offender is genuinely unable to pay a fine, schedule 6 of the Courts Act introduces the alternative new sentence of fines payment work, where an offender can work off the value of the fine through unpaid work. This new provision will also be piloted in selected local pilot areas from 5 April 2004.
<P>

<a name="40119w36.html_para2">Persistent offenders fined in the new fines collection scheme provided by schedule 5 of the Courts Act, 2003 will be deemed "existing defaulters" (defined in paragraph 3 of schedule 5) if they have already defaulted on previous fines payments. They will be subject to automatic mandatory attachment of earnings orders (if they are employed) or deductions from benefits (if they are in receipt of benefits) upon conviction. If they default on the current fine as well, they will be subject to an increase (up to a maximum of 50 per cent.) of the fine which will only be disapplied if they stick to the required payment terms for the life of the fine. These defaulters will then be subject to the same range of further steps as the new defaulters in question (1) above, with the ultimate threat of imprisonment for wilful non-payment of the fine.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Department for Constitutional Affairs what steps are taken to ensure that only bona fide constituents are registered on the electoral roll.  [148735]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w37.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Leslie </B> 
: Applications for registration are made to individual Electoral Registration Officers (EROs), appointed by local authorities, who are responsible for compiling the electoral register as accurately as possible. The annual canvass form which is sent to all households provides information about who is eligible to register. An ERO may require a person applying to register to give additional information if they are in doubt as to whether that person is eligible to be registered. It is an offence under the Representation of the People Act 1983 to fail to comply with a request for information from an ERO, or to provide false or inaccurate information to a registration officer. The electoral register is available for public inspection which enables checks to be made that only eligible electors are on the register.

 An <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Commission Notice, issued in June 2002, invited suppliers to express an interest to provide a new digital radio network and associated hardware. This was separated into four "lots", which together would provide the complete new service for the ambulance service.
<P>

<a name="40119w37.html_para0">18 expressions of interest were received. Following a short evaluation, eight were invited to respond to an output based specification. Following this exercise, four responses were received, one of which dropped out soon after. From the remaining three, only one supplier was able to provide Lot 1 (digital infrastructure), while all three were able to provide Lot 2 (Fixed and Hand Portable Radios), Lot 3 (Control Room Dispatcher Equipment) and Lot 4 (Total Integration of all Lots at Ambulance Trusts).

 The Radiocommunications Agency (RA), as the spectrum manager for public safety spectrum, has been working hard to meet ever increasing demands placed on the finite spectrum resource.
<P>

<a name="40119w37.html_para1">The radio spectrum available to the emergency services was a matter for the Public Safety Spectrum Policy Group (PSSPG).
<P>

<a name="40119w37.html_para2">The PSSPG published guidance in order to assist interested parties in identifying available public safety spectrum and advising as to other issues that should be taken into account. This was the case with the Ambulance Service procurement exercise. It is recognised that only the 380&#150;385 MHz and 390&#150;395 MHz spectrum is in the harmonised format for digital technologies and all of this is required in spectrum 'hot spots' to meet the existing airwave requirement. While spectrum in this band is available on a carefully co-ordinated regional basis, it was considered that the capacity to meet a second national network that can be planned and protected to meet the exacting requirements of public safety did not exist.

 <i>[holding answer 5 January 2004]:</i> In the last few years a number of epidemiological studies have examined the postulated link between MMR and autism and have found no association. Some of these studies (Taylor et al, 1999; Farrington et al, 2001; Madsen et al, 2003, Jick & Kaye, 2003) have specifically looked at rates of autism in populations who have had MMR and populations who have not had MMR. These studies did not find an increased reported rate of autism in MMR immunised children when compared with children who had not had MMR. Moreover, the recent study by Farrington et al, 2001 showed no temporal association between MMR and onset of autism at any time following MMR.

 Central Government do not themselves routinely monitor the fee levels offered by councils. It is for local councils to develop an understanding of their local market and set fees accordingly. An annual analysis of fee levels is conducted by Laing and Buisson, independent consultants working in the care sector.

 Newly qualified dentists who wish to work in the national health service general dental services are first required to undergo one year's vocational training. The Department does not collect information on the proportion of dentists who go into NHS or private practice after training. There are relatively few dentists who do all of their dental work privately. The Office of Fair Trading's report, "The Private Dentistry Market in the U.K." stated that about 210 dental practises are totally private, out of 11,000 dental practises. Currently the starting salary for a vocational trainee dentist is &#163;25,776 per annum.

At the same time, broader community based services, which help older people and other adults to live independently in their own homes were provided for 1.4 million people in 2002&#150;03; compared with 1.33 million people in 2000&#150;01. Community based services include day care, meals, respite care, direct payments, professional support, transport and equipment, as well as home care.

 These data are not routinely collected or held centrally. The evaluation of national health service walk-in centres published by the University of Bristol in July 2002, and available at www.epi.bris.ac.uk/wic, suggested that some 13 per cent., of consultations resulted in a referral to a general practitioner. In part to address this, a growing number of NHS walk-in centres now offer access to a general practitioner, as well as the established service offered by nurses.

 Discussions are currently taking place with officials from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister on the requirements of the national health service in respect of affordable housing and the NHS contribution to the provision of key worker accommodation. The Department of Health and NHS Estates have a major programme in place to support key workers. The NHS Plan target of 2,000 extra rental units has been exceeded. By March 2004, around 5,000 NHS staff will have had the opportunity to gain a foothold on the property ladder by way of assistance under the Government's Starter Home Initiative Scheme.

 The Department is satisfied with the existing policy on national health service fully funded continuing care, but wants to ensure that policy is correctly implemented. As a result, all strategic health authorities (SHAs) have reviewed their eligibility criteria and an independent survey has been commissioned to examine SHAs' progress on all aspects of continuing care provision. Forthcoming Directions will introduce a legal framework for assessment for NHS fully funded continuing care.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w39.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The national health service care records service (CRS) includes functionality for recording patient preferences, such as advanced directives. The specification included the requirement to ensure that the existence of patient preferences (including advance directives, for example, a "living will" or a religious requirement that blood transfusions are not to be given) shall be recorded and displayed, and the contractor shall ensure that clinicians are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>alerted to the existence of a patient preference;
<P>
<BR>
advised to ask the patient to confirm its validity; and
<P>
<BR>
advised to record the patient's confirmation of its validity.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40119w39.html_para2">Patient preferences can therefore be captured at the point of care on the relevant system. The patient will be prompted at the point of care to confirm that the advanced directive is still to be enforced&#151;this is to avoid an out-dated statement of patient preferences being enforced (for example, if a patient changes his or her mind).

<a name="40119w40.html_wqn0"><B> Phil Sawford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what action he has taken following the Griffiths report into the research framework at North Staffordshire hospital NHS Trust.  [147507]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w40.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Ladyman: </B> 
 The Department takes very seriously the points made in the report about the importance of public safety, and of protecting children. The Department of Health, Home Office, Department for Education and Skills and the Welsh Assembly Government published "Safeguarding Children in Whom Illness is Fabricated or Induced" in August 2002. Paragraphs 6.46&#150;6.51 provide guidance on the use of covert video surveillance and references the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act of 2000.
<P>

<a name="40119w40.html_para0">This document was in response to the recommendation made within the Griffiths report to develop guidelines to assist the identification of children who have had illnesses feigned or induced by a carer within the framework of "Working Together to Safeguard Children (1999)", the Government's inter-agency guidance on child protection. It was the subject of public consultation prior to being published in 2002.
<P>

<a name="40119w40.html_para1">We have also taken a number of steps to strengthen research and clinical governance systems, not necessarily as a direct result of the findings of the Griffiths report. For example:
<P>

<a name="40119w40.html_para2">We have established the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) to focus our efforts to improve patient safety in the national health service and to run a new national reporting and learning system for patient safety incidents. The reporting system will be implemented across the NHS during 2004.
<P>

<a name="40119w40.html_para3">NHS staff will be able to report adverse incidents and "near misses" affecting NHS patient care to the NPSA, so that patterns and trends can be identified and lessons learnt in one part of the NHS can be properly shared with the whole of the health service.
<P>

<a name="40119w40.html_para4">The NHS Plan set out a review of consent procedures to ensure that good practice in seeking consent for both treatment and research is in place throughout the NHS. In November 2001, "The Good Practice in Consent Implementation Guide: Consent to Examination or Treatment", was published, containing a model consent policy and consent forms.
<P>

<a name="40119w40.html_para5">In the summer of 2000, the Department set up the Central Office for Research Ethics Committees to improve the support provided for multi centre research ethics and local research ethics committees.
<P>

<a name="40119w40.html_para6">The Department published the Research Governance Framework in March 2001, aimed at continuous improvements and the reduction of unacceptable variations in research practice across health and social care. The Department has been monitoring NHS trusts' compliance with the framework since its publication.
<P>

<a name="40119w40.html_para7">In its 2002&#150;03 annual research and development report, North Staffordshire hospitals reported satisfactorily on compliance with the research governance framework targets for March 2003 and that it was either already compliant or on target with the research governance 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 2004 : Column 1069W</I><P>
framework targets for March 2004. Actual compliance with the March 2004 targets will be assessed in the 2003&#150;04 annual research and development report.
<P>

<a name="40119w40.html_para8">The Department has commissioned a substantial audit of the use of continuous negative extrathoracic pressure at the University hospital of North Staffordshire NHS Trust (formerly North Staffordshire hospital NHS Trust). This is still on-going. The results will be published when the audit is completed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on recent research from the Aberdeen Fertility Centre on sperm counts since 1989; what assessment he has made of links between harmful man-made chemicals in the environment and reduced sperm counts; and what steps his Department is taking to reduce exposure to harmful chemicals.  [147231]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w41.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The research from the Aberdeen Fertility Centre has not been peer-reviewed or published, and has not been assessed by the Department. The Global assessment of the state-of-the-science of endocrine disrupters, by the World Health Organization (WHO) International Programme on Chemical Safety concluded in August 2002 that,
<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"although an extensive review of the published data suggest that there could be temporal and geographical variation in human sperm production, it is not possible to conclude that the phenomenon is real and, if so, to what extent reductions in sperm count may affect fertility.

<a name="40119w41.html_para0">The WHO assessment also concluded that,
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Analysis of the human data by itself, while generating concerns, has so far failed to provide firm evidence of direct causal associations between low-level (i.e., levels measured in the general population) exposure to chemicals.and adverse health outcomes".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="40119w41.html_para1">The Government research programme on trends in male reproductive health and the possible influences of occupational or environmental (or other) exposure to chemicals includes two studies on sperm counts. One is a study of Scottish male reproductive health (Medical Research Council Reproductive Biology Unit, Edinburgh). The other (which is co-funded with the European Chemical Industries Council) is a United Kingdom multi-centre study of occupational and environmental exposure to chemicals and male fertility (Universities of Manchester and Sheffield). The results will be published in due course.
<P>

<a name="40119w41.html_para2">The Government's chemical strategy was published in December 1999 and is available at http://www. defra.gov.uk/environment/chemicals/ukstrategy.htm. Its main goals are to: phase out chemicals posing an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment as soon as possible; reduce as far as possible the risks posed by chemicals that are essential in our everyday lives, thus finding a balance between protecting health and the environment and retaining the socio-economic benefits that many chemicals provide; and make full information publicly available about the environmental and health risks of chemicals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w41.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what progress has been made by the Changing Workforce Programme in redesigning the roles of diagnostic staff to reduce waiting times.  [147271]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w41.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Changing Workforce Programme is supporting the development of a number of roles designed to help the National Health Service provide speedier access to high quality services.
<P>

<a name="40119w41.html_para4">In particular, the roles of assistant practitioner and advanced practitioner will help reduce waiting times for radiography services. An accelerated development programme is supporting the implementation of these roles across a network of hospital trusts. To date, 81 assistant practitioners in radiography are in training or scheduled to receive training in 2004, while 79 trainees are working towards advanced practitioner status.
<P>

<a name="40119w41.html_para5">It is anticipated that the majority of plain film imaging will be performed by assistant practitioners under the supervision of qualified radiographers. This will release radiographers' time and allow them to focus on more complex issues, thus increasing service capacity. Once the assistant practitioners are fully trained, further data will be collected to evaluate the impact on waiting times and access to services.
<P>

<a name="40119w41.html_para6">The appointment of advanced practitioners in diagnostic areas such as computer tomography imaging, trauma imaging and gastro-intestinal imaging, has already contributed to a reduction in waiting times. For example, at one site, the waiting time for a barium enema has been reduced from 30 weeks to one week since advanced practitioners have been performing this procedure.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the average wait was for patients to be seen by their own general practitioner in the last year for which figures are available; and what proportion were seen within 48 hours.  [147511]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w41.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Data are collected on availability of access to primary medical services rather than actual waiting times. Information for November 2003 shows that 94 per cent. of the population was able to be offered an appointment to see a general practitioner within two working days.

<P>

<a name="40119w41.html_para7">The review concluded that the strategy would continue to address those areas where fraud could occur in pension credit.
<P>

<a name="40119w41.html_para8">The strategy and introduction of pension credit presents opportunities for improved protection at the gateway during the teleapplication process and for making use of all our contacts with customers to help them get their applications correct from the outset. The use of intelligent questioning, targeted visits and contacts with customers based on established risk, and effective internal and external data matching, all support the prevention of pension credit fraud.
<P>

<a name="40119w41.html_para9">Positive efforts made in driving down the loss and the legislative changes introduced for pension credit have contributed towards the achievement of the Service Delivery Agreement target to reduce fraud and error overpayments to pensioners by 20 per cent. by March 2006.
<P>

<a name="40119w41.html_para10">Measurement of fraud and error in pension credit commenced in October 2003 and we expect to publish results for the first full year's data in July 2005. In the interim we will be undertaking an early examination of cases found to be incorrect so that we can refine the programme protection strategy as necessary.

 Council tax benefit expenditure for 2003&#150;04 is forecast to be &#163;3.4 billion, and for 2004&#150;05 to be &#163;3.8 billion. However, on 15 December 2003, we announced reforms of council tax benefit, which included the abolition of restrictions for people living in band F, G and H properties. This is anticipated to take place from April 2004, with an expected additional cost of &#163;6.5 million per annum benefiting 21,000 claimants.

 There will be a comprehensive evaluation of local housing allowance Pathfinders including interviews with claimants, landlords, local authority staff and stakeholder organisations, as well as an analysis of administrative data. This is already underway.
<P>

<a name="40119w42.html_para1">The findings of the evaluation will inform decisions on the national extension of the allowance. It is envisaged that local housing allowance will be extended to all local authorities in 2006.

 We hope to implement a flat rate housing benefit system in the social sector, similar to that anticipated in the private rented sector to enable people in that sector to benefit from the choice and flexibility that the reforms can provide.

 Tenants whose rent is higher than their local housing allowance will be expected to make good the difference with their landlord. This is no different to what happens under existing rules.

<P>

<a name="40119w42.html_para2">There will not be a hardship payment to tenants whose rent is higher than their local housing allowance. Tenants will have the choice to shop around and look for a cheaper property in such circumstances.

 The nine Pathfinder authorities will implement the new housing allowance using one of two different approaches&#151;a "big bang", or a "phased". Under both approaches, all new claims made after the start date will go directly on to local housing allowance.
<P>

<a name="40119w42.html_para3">Under the "big bang" approach, all existing claims will be converted to housing allowance on the authority's start date. However, the local authority can delay the change on payments to tenants for up to six months.

<a name="40119w42.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) if he will make a statement on the criteria used to set the local housing allowance in each area; [R]  [146695]
<P>
<UL>(2) how often local housing allowance will be reviewed; and what methodology will be used to calculate the new level. [R]  [146696]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_spnew7"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Rent Officers in each Pathfinder area will look at a range of properties and rents in that area. Excluding exceptionally high and exceptionally low rents to avoid distortion, Rent Officers will identify the lowest and highest rents for a property type, add them together and divide by two. This will give the local housing allowance for that property type in that area.
<P>

<a name="40119w42.html_para7">Rent Officers will review the local housing allowance levels on a monthly basis to ensure they remain accurate reflections of average rents in an area. However, an individual claimant's entitlement will only be reviewed annually or where there is a change of circumstances.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the estimated cost is of local housing allowance in the first full year of operation; and what the equivalent cost of housing benefit would have been using the same methodology for the calculation. [R]  [146697]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_spnew8"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 It is estimated that the Local Housing Allowance Pathfinders will cost an additional &#163;20 million in their first year of full operation. Information on the forecasted equivalent cost of housing benefit is not available.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the effect of local housing allowance on rent restructuring in the de-regulated private rental sector. [R]  [146698]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_spnew9"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The programme of rent restructuring applies only to the social housing sector and not to the de-regulated private sector.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how local housing allowance will be adjusted to take into account improvements that are carried out to an individual property. [R]  [146699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_spnew10"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Local housing allowance will not depend on the individual rent or the type of property occupied by a claimant. It will be based on a standard amount for similarly suitable properties in that area for the size of the claimant's household.

<a name="40119w42.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions whether the landlord will be able to apply to have local housing allowance paid directly to him in circumstances when the tenant is likely to abscond with the allowance. [R]  [146700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_spnew11"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Landlords can make representations to receive direct payment if they believe that a tenant will not use their housing allowance to pay their rent. Landlords have the right of appeal if the authority decides to continue to make payment directly to tenants. Each of the Pathfinder authorities has held meetings with local landlords to explain how the housing allowance will work.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what estimate he has made of <i>(a)</i> the change in the number of homes available to rent to those in receipt of local housing allowance and <i>(b)</i> the change in the number of empty homes as a result of the introduction of local housing allowance. [R]  [146701]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_spnew12"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We do not expect there to be any significant change in the number of homes made available to rent to those in receipt of local housing allowance, or an increase or decrease in the number of empty homes as a result of the introduction of the local housing allowance. However, both will be monitored as part of the comprehensive evaluation of the Pathfinders.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what arrangements are being made in each of the Pathfinder local authority areas to house tenants who have to move from the private to the public sector because of the introduction of local housing allowance. [R]  [146702]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_spnew13"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The local housing allowance was launched in Blackpool on 17 November and Lewisham on 1 December 2003. Coventry and Teignbridge both introduced the housing allowance on 12 January this year. The remaining five authorities will be going live during February this year. So far there has been no evidence of tenants having to move from the private to public sector. However, we will monitor this as part of the comprehensive evaluation of local housing allowance Pathfinders, which will include interviews with claimants, landlords, local authority staff and stakeholder organisations, as well as an analysis of administrative data; the evaluation is already under way.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what advice the Department is offering those tenants who get into financial difficulties following the introduction of local housing allowance; and what the estimated cost is of the provision of that advice. [R]  [146703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_spnew14"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Pathfinder authorities are being given an additional &#163;540,000 towards the cost of providing financial management advice to claimants. Pathfinders are working directly or in co-operation with voluntary agencies, such as the Citizen's Advice Bureau, to provide advice on financial management. This is in addition to existing support mechanisms offered by welfare organisations, and loans and advice available from Jobcentre Plus.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) how local housing allowance will be paid; and what arrangements will be made for those tenants who do not have a bank account;  [146704]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether the tenant will be reimbursed for any overdraft fee paid as a result of late payment of local housing allowance into a bank account.  [146705]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w42.html_spnew15"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 As for tenants who currently receive direct payment of housing benefit, payments of the local housing allowance will be made by cheque or a bank transfer. Pathfinder authorities will assist tenants with advice on how to obtain bank accounts.
<P>

<a name="40119w42.html_para8">It is entirely a matter for local authorities to decide whether to reimburse for any overdraft fee incurred as a result of late payment of local housing allowance into a bank account. Local authorities will be able to process local housing allowance claims more quickly than current housing benefit claims, and our aim will be to prevent late payments.

1. Figures are based on latest published forecasts, published in the pre-Budget report on 10 December 2003.<P>

2. Figures for 2003&#150;04 include expenditure on the minimum income guarantee, prior to the introduction of pension credit. Minimum income guarantee expenditure is treated as guarantee credit. The 2003&#150;04 guarantee credit figure also includes child elements of the minimum income guarantee totalling &#163;50 million. These payments were replaced by child tax credits at the same time as the introduction of pension credit.<P>

3. Note that until October 2004, new claimants will be able to claim payment for entitlement dating back to October 2003.<P>

4. Figures are rounded to nearest &#163;10 million.<P>

5. Due to rounding, figures may not sum exactly to totals.<P>

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on progress since the announcement of the Thames Gateway Communities plan; how much public money has been spent; how much private sector capital has been committed; how much land has been acquired; how much land will be acquired; and over what timescale.  [148199]<P>

 I am pleased to be able to report substantial progress in the Thames Gateway even since my right hon. Friend the Member for Streatham announcement in July.
<P>

<a name="40119w44.html_para2">Delivery is the key to the Thames Gateway. The new UDC for Thurrock is now established and Chair and Board appointed, consultation on the London UDC will end on 6 February and new partnership bodies for the other growth areas in the Gateway are now in place. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister expects the new Gateway Office to be operational shortly.
<P>

<a name="40119w44.html_para3">The Thames Gateway expenditure programme provides &#163;446 million over the three years commencing 2003&#151;4. Projects worth &#163;330 million have been accepted in principle for funding, and some &#163;50 million worth of projects have been formally approved. These range from land acquisitions in London's Lower Lea valley, to affordable housing schemes with the Housing Corporation, a new lifelong learning centre for Barking, University campus expansions at Southend and Medway, and environmental Green Grid initiatives across South Essex and North Kent. In addition to this, the Regional Development Agencies, English Partnerships, the Housing Corporation and Highways Agency are also undertaking projects which make a major contribution to the Gateway, including Barking Reach, Chatham Maritime, A 13 improvements and anew Swale Crossing.
<P>

<a name="40119w44.html_para4">Outline planning applications have been submitted for the key private sector developments at Stratford City and Ebbsfleet. These schemes alone represent private sector investment approaching &#163;7 billion.
<P>

<a name="40119w44.html_para5">The Strategic Rail Authority confirmed shortly before Christmas that it will be proceeding with plans for domestic services on the Channel Tunnel Rail link as part of the new Integrated Kent Franchise, and more recently, my right hon. Friend Member for Edinburgh Central, has announced that he is offering financial support for the Thames Gateway Bridge, the proposed new river crossing in East London. Both are strategic projects which will strengthen the platform for new development, and will help to consolidate private sector confidence and involvement.
<P>

<a name="40119w44.html_para6">There are no targets for land acquisition in the Gateway; the need for land assembly by the public sector will be determined by market strength and interest. To date, funding from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister budget for land acquisitions is being pursued for projects in the Lower Lea for new mixed-use development, and in Sheppy, to promote new housing.

<P>
<a name="40119w44.html_spnew7"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Government's policy for the development of sustainable communities in Thames Gateway and the Growth Areas was set out in "Creating Sustainable Communities: Making It Happen" in July 2003. The most recent annual house building figures for local authority areas contained within the Thames Gateway are for the 2002&#150;03 financial year. Local authorities and the national house building council report a total new build of 7,865 houses for this period, of which 1,077 are social housing. It should be noted that these figures are totals for local authorities in Thames Gateway, but that some local authority areas fall only partially within the designated Thames Gateway region.
<P>

<a name="40119w44.html_para7">"Creating Sustainable Communities: Making It Happen" set a target for the Thames Gateway of the development of 120,000 new homes over the period to 2016, which is 40,000 above current planning targets. Projects worth &#163;300 million were approved in July as part of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's new Sustainable Communities funding package. These include funding for new affordable housing.
<P>

<a name="40119w44.html_para8">The Government do not set annual targets centrally for local authorities on either affordable or social housing. Planning policies for affordable housing are set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 3, "Housing", and in Circular 6/98, "Planning for Affordable Housing". They advise that where local planning authorities are able to demonstrate a lack of affordable housing to meet local needs, based on up-to-date surveys and other data, they should indicate in their local plan how many affordable homes need to be provided throughout the plan area, and set indicative targets for specific suitable sites (expressed either as numbers of homes or a percentage of the homes on the site). Local planning authorities should be monitoring their performance against their local plan policies and targets, but this information is not collected centrally.

Not all pensioners are on a low income and council tax benefit exists to help those that are. Steps are being taken to ensure that those who are eligible, including many pensioners, do take up their entitlement. We are also removing the current restriction on council tax benefit for those living in band F, G and H homes from next April.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w45.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B>

<P>
<a name="40119w45.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government has made no changes to the disabled band reduction. It is for each individual billing authority to decide whether a property qualifies for Disabled Band Reduction when deciding entitlement, taking into account case law. An appeal against a decision can be made to the Valuation Tribunal.

<a name="40119w45.html_spnew7"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The recent reports suggesting that my right hon. Friend, the Deputy Prime Minister, was proposing to remove the planning powers of local councils to prevent new building in the countryside are untrue. My right hon. Friend has made no such announcement, and has no such plans.
<P>

<a name="40119w45.html_para3">This press speculation appears to have been based on the draft of a new Planning Policy Statement (PPS7), "Sustainable Development in Rural Areas". The draft was published for public consultation in September 2003 by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. It sets out proposed national planning policies to deliver sustainable rural communities by focussing most new development on towns and villages, and through strict control over new development in the open countryside. Draft PPS7 proposes that local planning authorities should adopt criteria-based policies in development plans for the location and design of rural development, rather than rely on locally designated landscape protection areas. It would remain for local planning authorities in the first instance to determine planning applications, having regard to these and other relevant policies.
<P>

<a name="40119w45.html_para4">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is now considering the responses to the consultation draft. The views expressed will help inform the final version of PPS7.

<P>
<a name="40119w45.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Dhanda: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what measures he has taken to improve fire safety using fire sprinklers;  [148864]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment his Department has made of the merits of compulsory installation of fire sprinklers in <i>(a)</i> commercial properties and <i>(b)</i> leisure facilities.  [148865]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w45.html_spnew9"><B> Phil Hope: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is keen to improve fire safety by all reasonable means and sprinklers are part of a package of measures that can be used in buildings.
<P>

<a name="40119w45.html_para6">Since 1992, guidance supporting the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations, which apply to most building work forming new and altered premises in England and Wales, has suggested the provision of sprinkler systems is necessary in commercial and leisure properties over certain area or height thresholds.
<P>

<a name="40119w45.html_para7">This was expanded in 2000 when the guidance was revised to set a limit of 2000m <sup>2</sup> for the size of any fire compartment in a single storey retail building, beyond which a suitable sprinkler system should be provided. This applies to new and extended retail buildings.
<P>

<a name="40119w45.html_para8">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also nearing the completion of a detailed study into the effectiveness of sprinkler systems in tackling fires in residential properties. The results of this work are being fed into the further development of national standards by the British Standards Institution (BSI) and are forming part of our considerations of the current review of the fire safety aspects of the Building Regulations. The results of that work will shortly be publicly available enabling those involved with fire safety in buildings to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the benefits of residential sprinkler systems. During this review of the Building Regulations we will also be considering the role that sprinklers can play in all buildings and deciding whether the current thresholds in the guidance should be amended or indeed new ones introduced.
<P>

<a name="40119w45.html_para9">In the meantime, our Community Fire Safety programme continues to inform people of the risks associated with fire and the measures which can mitigate against its occurrence and subsequent effect, such as the use of fire detection and alarms and sprinkler systems. This programme has already been effective in reducing fire deaths and injuries from accidental fires.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w46.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The figure of 120,000 is drawn from discussions on development capacity with local planning partners during the preparation of the Gateway initiative, and reflects both existing planning allocations for development and local perspectives on further capacity. Work is now under way with Regional

<P>

<a name="40119w46.html_para0">Development in the Gateway focuses on its substantial reservoir of redundant and brownfield land, most of which will have originally been used historically for industrial and employment use. However, economic renewal is a parallel priority for the Gateway in order both to provide a stronger economic base for existing communities, and meet the employment needs of new residents. The area remains an important industrial and commercial location in the South East, and collectively the Gateway ports are the largest in the country. Retention and renewal of appropriate and good quality employment land to meet the needs of the local economy therefore remains important. The planning exercise now under way will therefore also be taking into account the appropriate future balance of housing and employment land.

 The adopted Chorley borough Local Plan Review allocates 100 hectares of land for housing for the period up to 2006. This figure excludes the former Royal Ordnance Factory site at Euxton, which is also expected to contribute 500 dwellings during the plan period, on the part of the site lying within Chorley borough.
<P>

<a name="40119w46.html_para2">Upon commencement of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill, Chorley borough council will be required to prepare a Local Development Framework to replace the Local Plan Review. In doing so the council should have regard to the annualised rates of average housing provision set out in Regional Planning Guidance for the North West, as applied by the emerging Lancashire Structure Plan. That currently proposes an annual rate of housing provision for Chorley in the period 2006&#150;16 of 210 dwellings per year, net of clearance.

 In 2003, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister received correspondence from the hon. Member and from Mr. Peter Annison, Chair of the Richmondshire Local Strategic Partnership, about affordable housing in North Yorkshire. Affordable housing in North Yorkshire featured in comments on the draft regional housing strategy in Spring last year, and is an issue identified in the sub-region's local authorities' housing strategies. The subject also features in Government Office discussions with North Yorkshire housing authorities, and the Government Office has received representations about funding for a project developed by Esk Moors Action for the Elderly. The North Yorkshire Housing Forum has submitted to the Regional Housing Board three proposals for different types of affordable housing for funding through the Board's 'transformational proposals' commissioning strand, for schemes to start in 2005&#150;06.

 The Communities Plan published in February 2003 made clear that council tenants must be fully informed and consulted at all stages in the process of appraising, choosing and implementing options for the future management and improvement of their homes. Tenants will have the support of Independent Tenant Advisers in this process. Effective tenant engagement is a key test for signing off the results of option appraisals and for giving approval for councils to implement these results.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister whether the Government will press local authorities reviewing the potential for re-allocating excess employment land to consider the option of withdrawing sites from their development plans, with particular reference to those which are identified as low priority for development according to the sequential approach set out in PPG3.  [149190]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Planning Policy Guidance Note 3: "Housing" (PPG3), requires local planning authorities to review all their non-housing allocations, including those for employment, and consider whether some of this land might better be used for housing or mixed use developments.
<P>

<a name="40119w47.html_para0">In July 2003, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published a consultation document, "Supporting the Delivery of New Housing". This proposes to add new policy to PPG3 requiring local planning authorities to consider applications for housing development favourably on allocated industrial and employment sites. It highlighted the need to review employment sites and to identify those which no longer need to be retained for employment uses. Such sites would then be de-allocated at the next review of the plan, and consideration given to whether the sites should be allocated for other uses. Whether such sites are suitable for housing will depend on how they perform against PPG3 policies, including the sequential approach.
<P>

<a name="40119w47.html_para1">The consultation closed on 31 October 2003 and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is considering the responses received. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister will publish the final policy, alongside practice guidance to help local planning authorities in reviewing employment land allocations, in due course.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what estimate he has made of the quantity of previously developed land that is <i>(a)</i> available for redevelopment and <i>(b)</i> likely to become available for redevelopment up to 2016.  [149194]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 From the 2002 National Land Use Database of Previously Developed Land, an estimated 66,000 hectares of previously developed land are available for development in England. This includes both vacant and derelict land and land currently in use with known potential for redevelopment. New sites amounted to 14 per cent. of the 2001 stock of previously developed land. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has not made any forecasts of future flows of land likely to become available for redevelopment.

<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on the implementation of the Stewart report on mobile phone masts in relation to 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 2004 : Column 1093W</I><P>
PPG8, with particular reference to the recommendations of the report on main beam transmissions next to sensitive sites.  [149182]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Stewart report recommended that all telecommunications development be subject to the planning process in order to improve local consultation. On 22 August 2001, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister strengthened public consultation requirements on mast proposals of 15 metres and below and for masts on buildings and structures so that they are exactly the same as applications for planning permission. The changes to the planning arrangements also underlined that school governors must be consulted on all proposals for new masts on or near a school or college.
<P>

<a name="40119w47.html_para2">The Stewart Report also recommended that an independent random, on-going, audit of base stations be carried out to ensure that exposure guidelines are not exceeded. Ofcom (formerly the Radiocommunications Agency) is undertaking the audit, which has been running since December 2000 and has focused on school sites. The results have shown emissions ranging between several hundred to many thousand times below the public exposure guidelines set by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP).

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_wqn4"><B> John Mann: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what account planning authorities in England are required to take of <i>(a)</i> written departmental guidelines circulated to them and <i>(b)</i> ministerial speeches in Parliament.  [147970]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Written Departmental Guidance and Ministerial speeches in Parliament are capable of being material considerations which local planning authorities must take into account when exercising their planning powers (for both forward planning and development control purposes). Central Government policy may be communicated to local planning authorities in various ways (for example by written guidance or oral statements) and may be taken into account by a local planning authority, irrespective of the way in which it is communicated. The weight to be attached to it may vary, however, depending on how formally it is expressed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what guidance he has provided to local authorities on the incorporation of estimates for climate change into the definition of floodplain for planning purposes.  [148281]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The flood zones in the risk-based sequential test in Planning Policy Guidance note (PPG) 25 "Development and flood risk", which was published in July 2001, are based on Environment Agency mapping of the risks at the time of map preparation. This does not include any allowance for climate change. However, local planning authorities and developers are advised to take account of climate change in assessing the risks from flooding. PPG 25 recommends a minimum standard of flood defence that takes account of the allowances for climate change contained in the "Project appraisal guidance for flood and coastal defence", published by the then Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 1999.
<P>

<a name="40119w47.html_para7">Climate change allowances have been re-examined by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) following publication of new climate change scenarios in 2002. Further guidance was published by DEFRA in 2003, which does not differ in its essentials from that already cited in PPG 25.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Government acknowledged the criticisms of council tax in the 2001 White Paper, "Strong Local Leadership, Quality Public Services". Consequently the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has established the Balance of Funding review to consider possible reforms to the current arrangements. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has commissioned various research studies to inform the review including analysis of the potential impact of

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_spnew7"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Housing Corporation is responsible for some 2,000 registered social landlords in England. To comply with the Corporation's Regulatory Code, all registered social landlords provide the Corporation with financial and regulatory information. The Corporation conducts a range of regulatory reviews as part of its routine regulatory exchanges. The Corporation has statutory powers to direct an inquiry into the affairs of a registered social landlord. There is currently only one such inquiry under way, into Solon Wandsworth Housing Association Ltd.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Coleman: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what representations he has received from registered social landlords on allowing them to exceed the cap in relation to the rent increases set down in the Government's rent restructuring policy; and if he will make a statement.  [148729]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w47.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was created in May 2002. Since this time, we have received four written representations from registered social landlords (RSLs) seeking a revision to the cap on rents of properties with the highest capital values which is incorporated into our rent restructuring policy. The current cap in 2003&#150;04 ranges from &#163;87.30 for a bedsit to &#163;102.70 for a property with four or more bedrooms. For the small number of properties affected by this safeguard, the maximum increase in future years is set at Retail Price Index (RPI) plus 1 per cent. a year.
<P>

<a name="40119w47.html_para8">As set out in our initial policy, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently conducting a three-year review of the policy, with the aim of completing this in the spring.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister if he will make a statement on progress since the announcement of the <i>(a)</i> Milton Keynes, <i>(b)</i> Ashford and <i>(c)</i> Stansted Corridor Sustainable Communities; how much public money has been spent; how much private sector capital has been committed; how much land has been acquired; how much land will be acquired; and over what timescale.

 There has been considerable progress in the growth areas since the announcement in July 2002&#151;"Creating Sustainable Communities: Making it Happen: Thames Gateway and the Growth Areas".
<P>

<a name="40119w48.html_para6">Partners are well advanced in developing the &#163;88 million worth of projects approved in July as part of the Government's Sustainable Communities funding package and we are on target to meet the &#163;21.5 million allocated in this year's programme. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's further announcement of 14 January 2004 allocated an additional &#163;63 million to a further 27 projects. &#163;11.5 million has been allocated to schemes which will deliver new and improved strategic green spaces in the growth areas, including a new regional park in the Nene Valley, and a significant expansion of the Forest of Marston Vale in Bedfordshire. Over &#163;50 million has been awarded to 18 other projects to provide key transport and economic infrastructure including new bridges and roads to access sites for 6,850 homes that would otherwise be blocked.
<P>

<a name="40119w48.html_para7">The vast majority of development within the housing growth areas will be undertaken by the private sector but detailed information on each investment is not collected. In addition there will be major investment programmes on commercial sites&#151;such as the &#163;800 million programme for Central Milton Keynes, involving English Partnerships, Milton Keynes Council and a number of private investors. Many schemes funded by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister are, however, designed to enable local partners to lever in specific private sector commitments to infrastructure by unblocking barriers to investment. In most cases negotiations are ongoing, but examples of match funding already committed include the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's commitment of &#163;10.6 million for road access to the Wellingborough East development site, which is matched pound for pound by Bovis Homes.
<P>

<a name="40119w48.html_para8">There are no targets for land acquisition in the growth areas; the need for land assembly by the public sector will be determined on a case by case basis. Several of the projects for which the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is already providing funding will facilitate the assembly of parcels of land for public benefit, such as the provision of affordable housing and community facilities (for example in Harlow), or high quality green spaces within or around the growth areas, as in Cambridgeshire and Bedfordshire. The funding will also facilitate the remediation of heavily contaminated land and the preparation of sites for release to the private sector for development.

<a name="40119w48.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister which Government Departments are involved in plans for the development of the <i>(a)</i> Milton Keynes, <i>(b)</i> Ashford and <i>(c)</i> Stansted Corridor Sustainable Communities; and what commitments they have made.  [148205]<P>

 The July Statement&#151;"Sustainable Communities: Making it Happen: Thames Gateway and the Growth Areas"&#151;set out how growth area projects 



<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 2004 : Column 1099W</I><P>
would be taken forward across Government, with schemes including transport, health, education, sports and green spaces. For example, transport commitments include the &#163;1.6 billion announced by Alistair Darling in July, and most recently the Department for Transport's Local Transport Programme announcement of December 2003, which included schemes worth &#163;221 million across the three growth areas.
<P>

<a name="40119w48.html_para9">A wide range of public agencies are involved. Bringing more agencies together with local partners to look at strategic infrastructure issues is the purpose of the Inter Regional Board being established for the Milton Keynes South Midlands growth area, which will hold its first meeting on 11 February 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w49.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Waterson: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assistance is available for repairing structurally unfit houses owned by the <i>(a)</i> elderly and <i>(b)</i> disabled; and if he will make a statement.  [148236]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w49.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Local authorities have wide ranging powers under the Regulatory Reform (Housing Assistance) (England and Wales) Order 2004 to provide assistance for the repair, improvement or adaptation of any living accommodation in their area. Such assistance, which can be made available at the discretion of the authority, may be in any form, for example by way of a grant, loan or loan guarantee, and can be provided either directly by the council or through a third party. The Order provides that before using these powers the local authority must publish a policy setting out the range of assistance that they will make available.
<P>

<a name="40119w49.html_para0">Funding for this assistance is available from an authority's single capital housing pot and in 2002&#150;03 total local authority expenditure in England on housing renewal grants (excluding disabled facilities grant) was &#163;259 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w49.html_wqn1"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what additional water supply infrastructure is likely to be required for the additional homes proposed for the Thames Gateway up to 2016.  [149184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w49.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Each water supply company produces a water resources plan that looks forward 25 years. The companies update their plans annually, which are then reviewed by the Environment Agency for consistency with its national and regional water resources strategies. The companies serving the Thames Gateway need firm estimates of growth to enable them to identify new water supply and disposal infrastructure requirements and factor these in to their business plans. Companies are therefore working in close liaison with local and regional planners and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister to establish both infrastructure requirements and the scope for achieving water efficiency savings in the new homes through sustainable development. A summary of their final investment plans will be available in late April, but these will cover investment required to meet the totality of demand forecast in their areas not just that which is within the Thames Gateway.

<P>
<a name="40119w49.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is currently considering responses to the public consultation on my right hon. Friend the Deputy Prime Minister's Proposed Changes to Draft Regional Planning Guidance (RPG) for the West Midlands. We hope to publish the final RPG in the spring this year.

<P>
<a name="40119w49.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister (1) what account he took, in setting the revenue support grant for Wychavon District Council for 2004&#150;05, of cost pressures on the council flowing from <i>(a)</i> administering the new local plan, <i>(b)</i> implementing the law on high hedges, <i>(c)</i> administering the Supporting People programme, <i>(d)</i> deregulation of building control services, <i>(e)</i> ending of Market Towns Initiative funding, <i>(f)</i> ending of Local Government On-Line funding and <i>(g)</i> compliance with the Freedom of Information Act 2000;  [146549]
<P>
<UL>(2) what account he took in setting the revenue support grant for Wychavon District Council for 2004&#150;05, of cost pressures on the council flowing from <i>(a)</i> implementation of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 on council property, <i>(b)</i> compliance with new legislation on homelessness, <i>(c)</i> provision for migrant workers, <i>(d)</i> changes to insurance premiums, <i>(e)</i> audit and inspection fees, <i>(f)</i> implementation of new licensing arrangements, <i>(g)</i> provision of recycling and waste services and <i>(h)</i> increases in employer contributions to pension funds;  [146550]
<P>
(3) what account he took, in setting the revenue support grant for Wychavon District Council for 2004&#150;05, of cost pressures on the council flowing from <i>(a)</i> the requirement for more consultation with the community to improve local accountability and community leadership, <i>(b)</i> the administration of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders, <i>(c)</i> further requirements for dealing with stray dogs, <i>(d)</i> administration of the standards regime for regulation of district and parish councils, <i>(e)</i> the need to have the financial capacity to improve following Comprehensive Performance Assessment inspection and <i>(f)</i> the requirement to develop a cultural strategy.  [146555]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40119w49.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's proposals for the funding of local authority revenue spending in 2004&#150;05 take into account the cost pressures and new burdens on local government identified with the Local Government Association in the context of the Spending Review 2002, which set the spending plans up to 2005&#150;06. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has added to those totals to reflect additional pressures and new burdens since the announcement of Spending Review 2002. Additionally, Wychavon District Council has received specific grants for certain items identified by the hon. Member, for example from the Waste Recycling Challenge Fund.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 2004 : Column 1101W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40119w49.html_para1">The Government's proposals for 2004&#150;05 provide for an increase in total general grant of &#163;2.4 billion or 5.5 per cent. Wychavon District Council would receive an increase of &#163;5.6 million or 4.2 per cent. on a like-for-like basis compared with 2003&#150;04.




<P>
<P><I>19 Jan 2004 : Column 1102W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="40119w49.html_para2">Most Government funding to local authorities is paid through general grant and is for councils to allocate in line with their statutory duties, their priorities and the wishes of their electorate.
