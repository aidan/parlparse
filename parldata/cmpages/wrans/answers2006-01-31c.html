<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60131w01.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Buck: </b> 
 No. As now, a person entitled to the statutory minimum can agree to give up that entitlement and accept an alternative concessionary fare scheme instead (e.g. tokens). They would then forego their entitlement to the statutory minimum for an agreed period. However, they must have the option to choose the statutory minimum.

 In the Future of Transport White Paper (Cm 6234) the Government set out that, without radical measures, including more effective demand management, road congestion would get worse. That is why we need to look at whether road pricing would allow us to get more out of the network, particularly at peak times.

<a name="stpa_8">A national scheme of road pricing which covered all roads, charging motorists on the basis of distance travelled and varied according to how congested a road is, could potentially cut urban congestion by nearly half. But moving to a national system of road pricing would be a huge and complex task. That is why the Road Pricing Feasibility Study, which was published alongside the White Paper, recommended that local or regional schemes should be used to pilot approaches to road pricing.

 The principal action being taken by Government to tackle the import of illegally logged timber is implementation of the Forestry Law Enforcement Governance and Trade (FLEGT) regulation. This developed out of the European Commission&#039;s FLEGT Action Plan, published in May 2003. It describes a package of measures to tackle illegal logging, including proposals that the EU enters into partnership agreements with timber producing countries to establish a licensing system designed to identify products and license them for export to the EU.

<a name="stpa_44">The Government are delighted that the proposal for a licensing system was adopted by the EU in December 2005, under the UK&#039;s Presidency. Government believe that as a first step to address illegal logging, it is necessary to build consensus with producing countries and make sure that we do not discriminate against legitimate trade. The EU FLEGT licensing scheme, with its innovative approach of bilateral trade agreements and development assistance for improving forest governance, will achieve this in the first instance.

 The QinetiQ flotation is not unsuitable for private investors.

Based on advice from our financial advisers, the Government do not believe that significant expenditure on a retail offering to encourage private investors to apply for shares would present value for money for the taxpayer.

 DFID&#039;s aid allocation to particular countries is guided by a formula which takes into account the country&#039;s level of poverty and consequent need for aid, and its institutional capacity to make effective use of aid. We also take account of how much aid countries receive from other donors. Once allocated, the aid is spent through a range of channels as appropriate in the country context. These can include support through Governments to deliver their poverty 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>31 Jan 2006 : Column 333W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<a name="60131w12.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_112">DFID believes that effective aid partnerships with developing country Governments depend on shared commitments to reducing poverty and achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDG)s; respecting human rights and other international obligations; and strengthening public financial management to reduce the risk of corruption. DFID uses these commitments both as our criteria for deciding whether to provide aid through Government, and as conditions for our aid. Once aid has been committed to a partner Government, DFID will only reduce it if the Government moves away from one of these three partnership commitments.

People are unable to escape poverty even in good years because they have lost or sold the assets they need to rebuild their lives. If people are to escape from this trap they need concerted effort by Governments to invest in these areas. Our support to education and health go some way towards helping. The provision of safety nets such as timely, adequate and guaranteed payments of cash or food on a regular basis to the neediest also helps rebuild lives.

 The Counter Narcotics Trust Fund (CNTF) has been created to give the Afghans greater ownership of the counter-narcotics agenda and ensure assistance is targeted effectively. The Government of Afghanistan are encouraging international donors to make un-earmarked contributions to the fund to give the Government maximum flexibility to allocate funding in accordance with the four priorities highlighted in its National Drugs Control Strategy: disrupting the drugs trade by targeting traffickers and their backers; strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods; reducing the demand for illicit drugs and treatment of problem drug users; and developing state institutions at the central and provincial level. However, in recognition of the budgetary and policy constraints under which different donors operate, it will be possible to earmark funds for one or more of the following eight pillars of activity (building institutions, information campaign, alternative livelihoods, criminal justice, law enforcement, eradication, demand reduction, regional co-operation). It is not envisaged that the wages of permanent counter-narcotics staff working for the Ministry of Counter Narcotics will be funded through the CNTF&#151;rather the fund will be used to cover projectised activity. The United Nations Development Programme will administer the fund which will ensure transparency and accountability.

<a name="60131w23.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_185">One of the main conclusions of the research was that all countries experience difficulty in establishing levels of identity fraud. The research also suggests that countries which use existing identifiers as pseudo identity numbers&quot;, such as the social security number in the USA, encounter many problems with identity fraud and with establishing the validity of the number, not least because it was not intended to be used for the wide variety of purposes that have become commonplace in the absence of a securely issued identity number.

 The requirement for the Attorney-General to give his consent to any prosecution brought under the provisions of the Racial and Religious Hatred Bill is something that has been raised on a number of occasions during the passage of the Bill through Parliament. The Home Office has also received a considerable number of letters about this provision from MPs and members of the public.

<a name="stpa_200">The Government believe the need for the consent of the Attorney-General for prosecutions to proceed is an important safeguard that will help to prevent spurious and vexatious cases coming to court. This provision already applies to the existing offence of incitement to racial hatred.

<p>
<a name="60131w26.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_202">The use of anti-terrorist powers should always be an appropriate and proportionate response to the threat. That threat remains real and serious, and in the light of the terrorist attacks on seven and 21 July last year, it is quite right that the police should take every measure to safeguard security around our transport infrastructure. While the police do not target the use of anti-terrorist powers against rail enthusiasts, photographing trains and railway stations can be an indicator of possible hostile terrorist reconnaissance and officers who encounter such activity may deem it appropriate to use stop and search powers under the Terrorism Act 2000, when appropriate

The allowances for watermain schemes are &#163;5,000 for properties, which were occupied and on which rates were being paid on or before 31 May 2000, and &#163;2,900 for other properties. The higher reasonable cost allowance for existing properties not connected to the public watermain reflects the importance attached to reducing the number of such properties.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to the answer of 23 January 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1735W, on tax arrears, in how many cases over the last two years where a review has been notified to a taxpayer and it subsequently resulted in a bill to the taxpayer, interest has not been levied; what proportion of such cases that represented; and for what reasons the interest was not levied.  [46060]</p>




<p><a name="st_294"><a name="60131w35.html_spnew0"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The information is not held centrally and can be obtained only at disproportionate cost. However, normally where an adjustment has been made to an assessment of tax, the interest follows automatically, and is calculated and charged by the computer systems of HM Revenue and Customs.

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to the answer of 23 January 2006, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1735W, on tax arrears, if he will make it his policy to notify the taxpayer <i>(a)</i> that interest will be charged, <i>(b)</i> of the date it is to be levied from and <i>(c)</i> the interest rate, at the time the review is notified; and if he will make a statement.

 The usual procedure is that receipts received in one month are paid into the Consolidated Fund on the eighth banking day of the following month. However, to avoid problems with year end accruals, the usual practice is to pay over the March receipts before our accounting system closes in March. Although the 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>31 Jan 2006 : Column 422W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
intention was to do this in March 2005, it was inadvertently overlooked and the payment was made on 12 April.

<a name="stpa_287">This transaction concerns the transfer of money between two central Government accounts at the Bank of England and therefore did not involve any loss of interest, or any risk to taxpayers&#039; money. As at 31 March 2005 the national non-domestic rates (NNDR) requiring payment to the Consolidated Fund was &#163;824 million. As it was year end, the amount received was lower than the usual monthly amount, which is typically about &#163;1.6 billion.

Most local authorities are now receiving at least some of their housing benefit and council tax benefit claims via CMS. In October 2005, changes were made to the system that brought a number of improvements for local authorities, the most significant being a reduction in clerical documentation with three forms being reduced to a single local authority Input Document.

It is possible that claimants may not move directly from JSA to another benefit, e.g. they may cease claiming JSA, find work and then claim IB within the given 90 day period.<br>

<sup>(42)</sup> It is known that the number recorded as returning to work underestimates the true situation. It is not possible to determine the number that moved to employment, however the Destinations of Benefit Leavers 2004&quot; report showed that 62 per cent. of IS, JSA and IB leavers entered employment of 16 hours or more a week.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Figures are expressed in thousands and rounded to the nearest hundred. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

2. Those reasons shown as Recorded as&quot; are what are completed on the JSA computer system following termination of the JSA claim. It is known that this information is not reliable and therefore figures should be used as a guide only.<br>

The Post Office card account has allowed some customers to move from receiving their benefit or pension through cashing an order book at the Post Office counter to getting used to the basics of banking. In practice, there is no real difference in accessing money at the Post Office via a bank account compared to a Post Office card account&#151;customers can collect the same money, on the same day as they do now at the Post Office, by using a plastic card and a personal identification number.

 There is a deficit in a minority of national health service organisations, and a large proportion of the gross NHS deficit is in a relatively small number of organisations, so the focus of our effort will be on these organisations.

Notes:<br>

1. Data are for the latest 12 months from October 2004 to September 2005.<br>

2. A last minute cancellation is one that occurs on the day the patient was due to arrive, after they have arrived in hospital or on the day of their operation. For example, you are to be admitted to hospital on a Monday for an operation scheduled for the following day (Tuesday). If the hospital cancels your operation for non-clinical reasons on the Monday then this would count as a last minute cancellation. This includes patients who have not actually arrived in hospital and have been telephoned at home prior to their arrival.<br>

3. An operation which is rescheduled to a time within 24 hours of the original scheduled operation should be recorded as a postponement and not as a cancellation. The QMCO collection does not record the number of postponements.<br>

4. Some common non-clinical reasons for cancellations by the hospital include: ward beds unavailable; surgeon unavailable; emergency case needing theatre; theatre list over-ran; equipment failure; admin error; anaesthetist unavailable; theatre staff unavailable; and critical care bed unavailable.<br>

We are discussing with Infertility Network UK (IN-UK), the leading voluntary organisation representing the interests of fertility patients, ways in which IN-UK can work with PCTs to help ensure that fertility patients&#039; voices are heard when decisions about the provision of services are made at local level.

Notes:<br>

Finished consultant episode (FCE)<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the hospital episode statistics (HES) unique patient identifier, HESID. This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data is incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

Primary care trust (PCT) and strategic health authority (SHA) data quality PCT and SHA data was added to historic data-years in the HES database using 2002&#150;03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996&#150;97, 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

Ungrossed Data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is the data is ungrossed.<br>
