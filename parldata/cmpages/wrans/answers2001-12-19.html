<a name="11219w02.html_para1">There have so far been no specific discussions on the implications of EU enlargement for the Structural Funds programmes in Wales. However, as the Minister in the DTI responsible for the Structural Funds, I represented the UK at an informal meeting of EU regional policy Ministers held in Namur on 13 July under the Belgian Presidency of the EU, at which the Structural Funds was the main item on the agenda. More recently, I also touched on the subject with Michel Barnier, European Commissioner responsible for Regional Affairs, during his visit to the UK in early November. On both these occasions I put forward the current UK position that there should be a thorough review of the purpose and added value of the Structural Funds, and of the balance between the role of the EU and that of member states in providing assistance to lagging regions, before we enter into a debate about the implications for different member states, nations and regions of possible future Structural Funds regimes.

<P>
<a name="11219w02.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 It is important that major trials are conducted expeditiously in the interests of justice.

I am aware of the case to which this question refers, the name of which I am omitting since the matter

is sub judice; however, I hope that the following information will be of assistance. The trial was originally fixed to commence on 2 October 2001. Application was made on behalf of one defendant for that date to be vacated due to serious illness rendering him unfit to stand trial. The matter was investigated by the Crown Prosecution Service and an independent medical report confirmed the position.
<P>

<a name="11219w02.html_para3">The case was therefore listed again before the trial judge to fix a new date. At this hearing it was clear that the first defendant would not be fit for trial for a period of six months. All parties, prosecution and the four defendants, were agreed that it was in the interests of justice that all should be tried together. However, when Counsel for the Crown sought a listing on the first available date in April 2002, six months ahead, Counsel for another defendant opposed this, on the grounds that neither he nor his junior, who had represented their client from the first appearance before the Crown court, would be available until the end of October 2002, and it would be unjust to deprive him of both counsel in those circumstances.
<P>

<a name="11219w02.html_para4">The Counsel for the prosecution opposed a delay of this length. In the event, the trial judge, having accepted that a delay until April was unavoidable because of the first defendant's illness and having weighed all the competing interests, ruled, with, she said, great reluctance, that the trial should be fixed for 4 November 2002.
<P>

<a name="11219w02.html_para5">One defendant involved in these proceedings is already serving a sentence of imprisonment having been convicted following an earlier linked trial.

 The Department remains committed to co-ordinating the Government's interest in the Millennium following an array of successful celebrations during the year 2000. After the closure of the Millennium Experience on 31 December 2000 which was operated by the New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC), the Department has continued to worked closely with the Millennium Commission which is distributing over &#163;2 billion of Lottery funds. The commission has invested carefully and the projects it has funded will leave a lasting legacy for generations to come.
<P>

<a name="11219w02.html_para10">The commission's projects have created an estimated 13,300 permanent jobs and many capital projects have also acted as a catalyst for the regeneration of key areas throughout the country. Projects have levered in significant additional funding from a wide variety of sources, and the capital projects programme has constituted 1.35 per cent. of the total UK construction industry by value since 1994.
<P>

<a name="11219w02.html_para11">A study into the economic impact of the Millennium Experience at Greenwich which was jointly commissioned by NMEC, English Partnerships and the London borough of Greenwich, has established that the Dome eventually generated contracts worth more than &#163;500 million for UK companies; generated &#163;385 million in direct spending by visitors on transport, accommodation, catering etc.; provided work for over 7,700 people in construction and over 5,000 in management and operation between 1997 and 2000; and led to the regeneration of nearly 300 acres of formerly derelict, contaminated land.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has received no representations this year about making the Dome a listed building. The general rule when looking at buildings for listing is that those less than 10 years old are not eligible for consideration. There is no reason for us to adopt a different policy for the Millennium Dome.

<a name="11219w03.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Representations from hon. Members, industry, performers and licensing law practitioners concerning public entertainment licensing law have tended to fall into five main categories. These are concerns about inconsistent approaches adopted by different licensing authorities; the scope for local licensing authorities to impose disproportionate and burdensome requirements on smaller venues; the duplication of the requirements with the fire safety and health and safety regulations; some evidence of excessive fee charging; and the limitations on the exemption from public entertainment licensing for public houses in the Licensing Act 1964. Changes to public entertainment licensing laws require primary legislation, and our reform of the alcohol and public entertainment licensing laws will address these anxieties. We shall present the necessary legislation as soon as Parliamentary time permits.

year. The findings of this exercise will then be used by the Inland Revenue to ensure that WFTC compliance work is adjusted if necessary.
<P>

<a name="11219w05.html_para2">The Revenue's approach to compliance is based on the progressive use of civil penalties, and prosecution in cases of criminal fraud.
<P>

<a name="11219w05.html_para3">The tables show the number of WFTC applications investigated by the Inland Revenue for the period from October 1999 (when the scheme began) to September 2001. Of the applications investigated for this period, 8,852 were closed in the Department's favour by recovering overpaid tax credits. At present, there are 7,560 WFTC investigations under way.

 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2001]:</i> While Customs do maintain and publish records on the number of people they have searched and on the numbers of seizures they have made, there are no records either of the total numbers of people spoken to by Customs officers or of the qualities of goods they were carrying.
<P>

<a name="11219w07.html_para0">Customs use the indicative levels set out in EC legislation as a guide to help distinguish between goods being imported for individuals' own use and goods which may be being imported for a commercial purpose. Customs then consider a range of other factors in order to determine whether goods are actually being brought into the UK for a commercial purpose.
<P>

<a name="11219w07.html_para1">It is estimated that&#151;in the majority of cases&#151;those individuals with goods in excess of the indicative levels who were stopped and asked questions by Customs when entering the Channel ports in 2000&#150;01 were able to demonstrate that the goods they are carrying were for their own use and were allowed to travel on freely.

<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2001 : Column: 331W</I><P>
the driver for the administration is to crystallise asbestos claims in the US and UK in a consistent and fair manner so the company can arrange for their payments. The administrators are exploring ways of trying to resolve this problem, and if necessary will seek direction from the courts to do that. We do not yet know when the stay on legal actions will be lifted. The insurance and compensation arrangements surrounding asbestos-related claims against Turner and Newall are very complex, and not yet completely clear. Officials are in contact with the administrators and are looking into this as a matter of urgency.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile will be withdrawn from service; and what anti-surface capability the aircraft carriers will have after the withdrawal of the Sea Eagle missile.  [24025]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The decision to withdraw the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile from service in April 1999 was taken as a consequence of the Strategic Defence Review. The review 



<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2001 : Column: 337W</I><P>
concluded that since the end of the cold war the threat of open ocean warfare had reduced and that the requirement for air launched anti-surface ship capability had diminished. While our carriers no longer possess an organic anti-surface ship capability, they would normally operate as part of a Maritime Task Group whose component escorting vessels would typically be armed with a potent mixture of anti-surface weapons including the long range, ship launched Harpoon missile and the helicopter launched Sea Skua missile.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the set number of hours given over to downtime for sleep and rest in every 24 hours are for submarine naval officers; and if he will make a statement.  [23288]<P>

<P>
<a name="11219w09.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Warfare officers in submarines operate in a six hours on, six hours off watch-keeping routine when at sea in a nuclear powered attack submarine. Their 12 hours off watch in each 24-hour period are used for sleep, meals, rest and recreation as well as dealing with routine administrative work.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what training is expected to have been completed by submarine officers before being left as duty officers of a nuclear powered cruise missile-equipped submarine; and if he will make a statement.  [23286]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 All Royal Navy warfare officers undergo a lengthy period of training, progressing from general naval training to specific disciplines, such as navigation, to the level of detail necessary to conduct safely a warfare officer's first appointment. Beyond this, submariners sub-specialise and receive an appropriate level of training tailored to meet the particular demands of watch-keeping in submarines.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Any officer appointed to a submarine is required to be assessed as medically fit for his duty. A comprehensive training and assessment regime is in place to ensure that such officers possess the professional ability and competence required by their duties. This includes a Basic Sea Qualification, which all officers must undertake in the submarine in which they are serving; this is a stringent test to ensure that they have knowledge of the systems onboard required to operate the boat effectively and safely.

 The roles and responsibilities of the regional brigade structure in Scotland have been studied extensively by the Ministry of Defence as part of a wider examination of our force structure. This work has now concluded and I am pleased to announce that 52 (Lowland) Brigade will re-role to become a light infantry brigade, retaining command of the light role battalions in Redford Barracks and Dreghorn Barracks, Edinburgh and assuming command of those based at Preston and Chester. It will also retain responsibility for public duties. The Brigade will be known as 52 Infantry Brigade and the HQ will continue to be based at Edinburgh Castle. In parallel, 51 (Highland) Brigade will become the Scottish Regional Brigade assuming the infrastructure responsibilities of both 51 and 52 Brigades. The Brigade will be known as 51 (Scottish) Brigade and will be based at Forthside in Stirling.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Outturn was lower than estimated in financial year 2000&#150;01 mainly because receipts from the Accruing Superannuation Liability Charge were slightly higher than anticipated, and because the overall increase in pensions was lower than forecast.

 Without peace, the prospects for economic growth and improved quality of life are negligible. But the potential for the region is considerable. Following the Oslo Accords in 1993, the area enjoyed a period of relative peace and economic growth. This benefited Palestinians and Israelis. Events took a downward turn in September 2000. Since then, there has been a continuing cycle of violence. Various attempts to re-engage the peace process have made little progress.

 European Community aid is distributed on a regional basis to all developing countries and countries in transition. Provisional figures for 2000 show that the percentage of EC development assistance spent in low-income countries continues to fall and is now below 50 per cent. This is unsatisfactory but difficult to change because many members states and large parts of the Commission support the distribution of aid for political rather than developmental purposes.
<P>

<a name="11219w12.html_para0">In November 2000, the Council and Commission adopted a new development policy which makes poverty reduction the central objective for all EC programmes in developing countries.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what recent discussions she has had with the World bank about progress towards the 2015 development targets.  [21905]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w13.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I have regular discussions with the World bank about this issue. The most recent occasion was at the meeting of the World bank/International Monetary Fund Development Committee in Ottawa, 17&#150;18 November. I am pleased to report that there is an increasingly strong commitment within the World bank and its member countries for concerted action to meet the 2015 targets. This includes growing recognition of the need to increase the volume of resources made available to poor countries committed to the policy and institutional changes needed to reduce poverty and achieve the other targets; and to enhance the effectiveness of this aid, including by untying it. The UK has already untied its aid, and pledged to increase the oda/GNI ration from 0.32 per cent. in 2000 to 0.33 per cent. by 2003&#150;04. Substantial progress is being made towards the key 2015 target of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty. While regional progress varies, the best available evidence suggests that on present trends the global target will be met but some of the targets, particularly the reduction of maternal mortality, will not be met. Progress varies between regions and countries. Very few African countries are on track to meet the targets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w13.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The priorities of our bilateral programmes are to support national strategies which address both enforcement action against corruption, such as strong and effective anti-corruption agencies, and preventive measures, such as strengthening capacity for public sector budgetary and financial management, procurement, accounting and audit; reforming civil service management, enhancing public oversight through strengthened parliamentary committees, developing measures to reduce judicial corruption and supporting civil society to promote transparency and accountability in public life.
<P>

<a name="11219w13.html_para1">At the multilateral level, negotiations for a United Nations Convention Against Corruption commence in January. This is a major opportunity to develop global standards for tackling corruption and improving international co-operation. We will be playing an active role in these discussions.
<P>

<a name="11219w13.html_para2">We attach importance also to strengthening collaboration with other bilateral development agencies and multilateral partners, in particular through supporting the implementation conventions against bribery in international trade and strengthening regional anti-money- laundering mechanisms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w13.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We are committed to supporting Pakistan's economic and social development for the long haul. This includes support for the Road Map to Democracy announced by President Musharraf in August 2001, which envisages national elections by October 2002. We are working closely with the international financial institutions and other multilateral organisations to ensure sustainable improvements in the lives of poor people in Pakistan. Our bilateral assistance is designed as a contribution to this wider international effort; and my Department meets the UK share of expenditure by the World bank, Asian Development bank, European Commission and UN agencies.

<a name="11219w13.html_para3">Our bilateral programme is focused on three objectives: creating the economic conditions for poverty reduction; strengthening health systems and improving quality and management in education. These are pursued through support to the process of devolution; support to rural livelihoods; and support to the development of the poverty reduction strategy paper.
<P>

<a name="11219w13.html_para4">In health, we are working to improve access to&#151;and quality of&#151;public health services, especially for the poorest. For example, we are helping to improve reproductive health through support for social marketing of condoms through Population Services International. We are also working up an HIV/AIDS drug harm prevention project. On education, we are supporting the implementation of the devolution of education management to provincial and district levels in North West Frontier Province and Northern Areas. We are also helping to raise quality standards by collaborating on reform of the National Education Assessment System.
<P>

<a name="11219w13.html_para5">In terms of support for the political reform effort, examples of these are the assistance my Department is providing to improve the quality of governance by supporting the Elections Commission in the run up to next year's provincial and national elections, and the National Reconstruction Bureau in its deliberations on constitutional reform. We are also focused on working

<a name="11219w13.html_para6">In recognition of Pakistan's reform progress to date, and to support the new three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility agreed with the IMF earlier this month, I have allocated a further &#163;15 million for budgetary aid this financial year, and &#163;45 million for each of the subsequent two years. This is in addition to the on-going technical assistance programme, and represents a major increase in our engagement with Pakistan's medium-term reform programme.

 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para0"><i>Conclusion 6:</i>
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para1">My Department will within the next few weeks publish a booklet for staff on alternative working patterns. The booklet, which has been approved following discussion by a staff Consultative Group on Diversity, will explain the options available for adjusting working patterns in a way which will permit part-time working or downshifting.
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para2"><i>Conclusion 7:</i>
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para3">My Department already makes extensive use of retired staff for suitable short-term assignments.

<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para5">A review of the implications of allowing staff to serve to age 65 is in hand and will be completed by 31 March 2002.
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para6"><i>Conclusion 9:</i>
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para7">My Department has decided not to introduce a short service concession on the grounds that a considerably smaller proportion of men rather than women would be able to comply with the criterion of having less than 20 years service and that the adoption of such a condition would therefore be potentially indirectly discriminatory under s.1 of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 as amended. There are also potential difficulties associated with the concept of the "normal age of retirement" which defines the upper age limit applicable to complaints of unfair dismissal in terms of s.109 of the Employment Rights Act 1996.
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para8"><i>Conclusion 10:</i>
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para9">Discrimination on grounds of age is already forbidden by my Department's Equal Opportunities policy as published in our Staff Handbook (and has been for some years).
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para10"><i>Conclusion 11:</i>
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para11">Is for action by the Cabinet Office rather than Departments.
<P>

<a name="11219w14.html_para12"><i>Conclusion 12:</i>

<a name="11219w14.html_para14">We are not planning to provide bilateral assistance to refugees and internally displaced persons this winter. By agreement with the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, our bilateral programme focuses on providing technical assistance for institution and capacity building, and for economic and social reform. We aim to address the longer-term needs of poor people in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by helping to restructure the economy, strengthen public administration and improve the delivery of social and health care services. This strategy is described in the DFID country strategy paper for the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w14.html_spnew2"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 My Department is focusing on three key areas of assistance in Nigeria: a governance and economic reform programme at federal level, with particular emphasis on strengthening the justice sector (including the police), implementing key economic reforms and promotion of an effective poverty reduction strategy; support in the continuing fight against HIV/AIDS; and working closely with four identified reforming states of the 36 states of Nigeria to demonstrate that reform can deliver practical benefits for the poor. None of our four focal states, Benue, Jigawa, Ekiti and Enugu, is oil producing. However, DFID supports good governance in oil producing states through the European Commission, which is implementing a large programme of small-scale community driven projects. These projects implement progressive and participatory community development, with the aim of enhancing the voice of the communities to articulate effective demand on services from state and local government. The programme is operational in Rivers, Bayelsa and Delta states and will expand to a further three states. A DFID-seconded official has assisted the Delegation of the Commission in the development and implementation of this programme.

 Third age apprenticeships are still in the early stages of development. Their purpose is to increase the take up of training within the new deal 50-plus programme, and to engage more directly with employers in particular sectors of the market rather than in particular locations.

 <i>[holding answer 20 November 2001]:</i> Action Teams for Jobs are the Department's main Area-Based Initiative. They are based in some of the most employment-deprived areas of Great Britain and work closely with local regeneration-related initiatives.
<P>

<a name="11219w15.html_para1">Action teams were announced as a one-year initiative in the March 2000 Budget. Three pathfinder Teams started in June 2000, 37 others followed in mid-October 2000, all completed their first year on 12 October 2001. Although final figures are not yet available, initial results indicate that the Teams have engaged over 38,000 clients and helped 41 per cent. (over 15,500) of them into work.
<P>

<a name="11219w15.html_para2">My right hon.

<P>

<a name="11219w15.html_para4">An action team has been operating in the area covered by the Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland Employment Zone since October 2000. It did not originally include any part of the Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East constituency. However, in March 2001 the Team's remit was extended to cover certain disadvantaged groups across the whole of Redcar and Cleveland.
<P>

<a name="11219w15.html_para5">From January 2002 there will be two separate action teams in the Middlesbrough, Redcar and Cleveland area. One in Middlesbrough, covering 13 wards with high levels of worklessness (Ayresome; Beckfield; Beechwood; Berwich; Easterside; Grove Hill; Hemlington; North Ormsby; Pallister; Park End; St. Hilda's; Stainton and Thornton and Thorntree) and another in Redcar and

Cleveland covering six wards (Coatham; Newcomen; Grangetown; South Bank; Kirkleatham and Easton). The Middlesbrough Action Team will include two wards in the Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East constituency, Hemlington and Park End.

 When assessing whether someone satisfies the qualifying conditions for attendance allowance, decision makers (known as adjudication officers until 1999) are advised to take into account, among other things, whether that person needs supervision from another to avoid danger. It is the Department's view that the Court of Appeal in Cassinelli <i>v</i>. Secretary of State for Social Services is not relevant here as it did not address the question of supervision and only considered the meaning of "severe discomfort" as it related to mobility allowance, a benefit replaced in 1992 by disability living allowance.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how his Department plans to encourage private pension provisions.  [22664]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 This Government are committed to encourage private pension provision&#151;through pension education, making saving pay, providing appropriate savings vehicles and better regulation. This strategy goes hand-in-hand with our broader reform of the pensions landscape with introduction of the state second pension and the launch of the pension service.
<P>

<a name="11219w16.html_para3">Our pension education campaign has been driving home the message that those who can afford to save have an obligation to do so. As part of this, combined pension forecasts will ensure that people have the right information to make well-informed decisions on their retirement income.
<P>

<a name="11219w16.html_para4">The introduction of stakeholder pensions has a significant impact the pensions landscape. Stakeholders are safe, flexible and value for money. For the first time, we have also opened up private pensions to non-earners&#151;giving carers and the disabled a chance to build up a private pension. Since October, all employers with five or more employees must offer access to a stakeholder pension, unless they already offer an appropriate alternative, greatly increasing the coverage of private pension saving.
<P>

<a name="11219w16.html_para5">The Association of British Insurers has calculated that by the end of October nearly 300,000 employers had designated a scheme. The figures also show that some 492,000 policies have been sold in the first seven months since the introduction of stakeholder pensions in April.
<P>

<a name="11219w16.html_para6">We are committed to reforming the regulation of private pension provision. That is why we have commissioned Alan Pickering to lead a review of the regulatory regime, and to report in July with a package of measures for simplification.

investment, are developing proposals to replace the minimum funding requirement with a long-term scheme-specific standard, and have consulted on a package of measures to speed up the winding-up of occupational pension schemes. Better regulation will be better for the individuals&#151;by maintaining their security while removing unnecessary barriers to providing pensions.
<P>

<a name="11219w16.html_para7">From 2003, around half of all pensioners will stand to gain from the new pension credit. For the first time, saving will be rewarded rather than penalised. All single pensioners with weekly incomes of up to &#163;135, and couples with weekly incomes up to &#163;200, will receive a cash top-up. This reward will also be good news for women&#151;around two in three recipients of the credit will be women, as women tend to have smaller pensions than men.
<P>

 The duty to notify changes of circumstances is set out in regulation 75 of the Housing Benefit (General) Regulations 1987.

<P>
<a name="11219w20.html_spnew5"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Currently small employers whose gross national insurance payments in a tax year are &#163;20,000 or less (the small employers relief threshold) can recover 100 per cent. of the Statutory Maternity Pay they pay out plus an additional amount, currently 5 per cent., in compensation for the employers share of national insurance contributions due on SMP payments. The compensation rate is reviewed each year based on a formula which compares the employers' share of national insurance paid on SMP with the total amount of SMP paid by all employers.
<P>

<a name="11219w20.html_para2">From 6 April 2002 the threshold is being doubled to &#163;40,000. This will mean that an additional 10,000 employers a year will qualify and in all around 60 per cent. of all employers paying SMP in a year will get full reimbursement. At the same time the additional compensation rate is being amended to 4.5 per cent. in line with the estimates made of SMP due to be paid and employers' national insurance costs on those payments from April 2002. Regulations will shortly be laid to achieve these changes.

 The Department for Work and Pensions is committed to the Work-Life balance of its staff. A range of flexible working patterns including part time working, job sharing and homeworking is available to staff by agreement with their management. The flexibility to work at home is most frequently used on an ad-hoc basis, but there are individuals who have homeworking as a regular part of their working pattern. The Department is currently looking at ways in which data on the number of people taking up the flexibility can be captured.

 Winter fuel payments are made to most people aged 60 and over, regardless of whether they receive a state retirement pension. The rate is either &#163;200 or &#163;100, depending on whether the person lives alone or with another eligible person. Around 10,400 people in Battersea received a winter fuel payment last year and, of these, around 6,800 received a payment at &#163;200. We expect the figures for this year to be similar.

<P>
<a name="11219w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Up to the end of September 2001, the new deal had helped 1,888 young people move into work in the Wiltshire Employment Service district. There are currently 919 unemployed young people in the district.
<P>

<a name="11219w21.html_para5">Setting the stock of unemployed young people at a point in time against the flow of young people into jobs through the new deal is not a meaningful comparison. However, in Wiltshire long-term youth unemployment has fallen by 70 per cent. since the new deal started. Although some of this reduction is a result of this Government's success in delivering steady economic growth, the new deal for young people has also played an important role.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Stinchcombe: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to his answer of 11 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 840W, on judges' accommodation, if he will publish <i>(a)</i> the terms of reference and <i>(b)</i> the comparison made of the value for money provided by judges lodgings undertaken as part of the triennial review of judges lodgings.  [23912]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 The notional comparison referred to in my previous reply was undertaken merely to test the overall assumption that lodgings should continue to be the main method by which accommodation is provided. The terms of reference were to compare the cost of lodgings with alternative forms of accommodation providing appropriate standards of security, privacy and comfort. Hotel costs were calculated on the assumption that the judge and his clerk would be accommodated in a high quality hotel, that the judge would occupy a suite of rooms consisting of a double bedroom, a lounge/study and en-suite bathroom facilities, and that the clerk would have a single room with en-suite bathroom facilities. Allowance was also made for other associated costs e.g. transport to and from court.
<P>

<a name="11219w22.html_para2">This comparison was an academic exercise using notional representative costs and only formed a small part of the triennial review. Additionally, the costs attributed to hotel use excluded any additional security costs that would inevitably be required to provide the safe and secluded environment provided by lodgings. It would therefore be misleading to publish the comparison.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what is the capital value of the leasehold Lodging Estate in which his Department accommodates judges on circuit.  [23705]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Of the leasehold Lodgings Estate only two have a notional capital value (as the rents are nominal and/or historic). These are the lodgings at Birmingham and Winchester, with a combined estimated capital value of &#163;2.75 million. The remainder are held under leases where the rents are reviewed frequently and which therefore have no capital value to the Department.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Stinchcombe: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to the answer given on 11 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 840W, on judges' accommodation, how many <i>(a)</i> butlers, <i>(b)</i> cooks and <i>(c)</i> security personnel are employed by the Lord Chancellor's Department to look after judges on circuit.  [23916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 Details of the numbers of butlers and chefs/cooks employed to look after judges on circuit were provided in my earlier answer given on 11 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 840W. The answer also states that we do not employ dedicated security staff at lodgings. All staff are expected to be vigilant and ensure that the lodgings are secure at all times.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Stinchcombe: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what his definition is of a guest house of the Wolsey Lodge variety; and how it is differentiated from other forms of accommodation for judges on circuit.  [24100]

<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 I am advised that "Wolsey Lodges" are a consortium of privately owned homes providing a small number of quality rooms for temporary rental. While the properties vary in size and style, they are essentially a public hotel chain. As such Wolsey Lodges are completely different from the network of private lodgings maintained by the Court Service to provide accommodation for High Court judges while on circuit.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Stinchcombe: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to his answer of 11 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 840W, on judges' accommodation <i>(a)</i> if the comparison made of the value for money provided by judges' lodgings examined each judges' lodgings individually and <i>(b)</i> which judges' lodgings were assessed not to provide value for money.  [23911]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 As stated in my earlier answer, the notional comparison undertaken as part of the triennial review was merely to test the overall assumption that lodgings should continue to be the main method by which accommodation is provided. It did not form the main value for money examination within the review.
<P>

<a name="11219w22.html_para7">While a comparison was made for each judges' lodgings individually, the 'hotel alternative' costs were indicative only and did not include additional security costs which would necessarily be incurred for the protection of Her Majesty's High Court judges. It would therefore be misleading to base any decision on the future viability of individual lodgings on this comparison and to publish details of the same.
<P>

<a name="11219w22.html_para8">It should also be recognised that, when discussing alternatives to lodgings, cost is not the only issue. The availability and proximity of suitably secure, private and comfortable accommodation has also to be considered.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Stinchcombe: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department, pursuant to his answer of 11 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 840, on judges' accommodation, what action has been taken since publication of Lord Justice Auld's report to assess the value for money provided by individual judges' lodgings; and what action will be taken in respect of judges' lodgings assessed not to provide value for money in line with the recommendations of the Auld report.  [23917]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w22.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 As my hon. Friend is aware, Sir Robin Auld's report was only published on 8 October. Public consultation on his recommendations takes place up to 31 January 2002.
<P>

<a name="11219w22.html_para9">Consequently, no new assessment of the value for money provided by individual lodgings is being considered until this period of consultation has concluded. The Lord Chancellor will then decide on a course of action with regard to lodgings in the light of this and the findings of the triennial review.

 All magistrates, Crown and county courts produce a warrant when remanding an individual to custody. This is given to the person or organisation transporting the individual to prison, and then handed over at the place of detention.

<P>

<a name="11219w23.html_para6">Total staffing costs at the end of September were &#163;1,825,000. This figure relates to the totality of planning and partnership work, and includes some elements not related to CLSP development, such as the support for, and administration of, the Commission's regional legal services committees. As these various functions are so integrated with CLSP development it has not been possible to separate out the expenditure.

<a name="11219w23.html_para7">At the time of the launch of the community legal service (CLS) in April 2000 only certain categories of work at what is now known as the specialist level were restricted to specialist suppliers, namely those with a licence granted under the Commission's general civil contract. Other work at what is now known as the specialist level was provided outside the contracted system. All legal help work&#151;formerly known as advice and assistance&#151;was contracted. It is therefore impossible to make a direct comparison between the position before 1 April 2000 and now. There were 5,286 contracted providers of all types in place in April 2000.

<P>

<a name="11219w23.html_para9">The Commission currently records data according to 'bid zones'. 'Bid zones' are geographical areas which form the basis of contracting decisions. Information is recorded highlighting areas where a high level of need has been identified, and indicating whether the need has been met, in order to measure progress against the Commission's objective to develop effective providers operating in those categories of law where a need has been identified. In many areas, there will only be a relatively low level of need identified for specialist categories. In these areas, services are often provided by family practitioners who are authorised to carry out work in other categories under what we call 'tolerances'. The process of assessing priority is a key responsibility of CLSPs.

 No individual payments in excess of &#163;10 million have been made by the Lord Chancellor's Department into the Consolidated Fund in error in the last 12 months. The Department secured a short surrender of &#163;12,002,137 from the Consolidated Fund to recover moneys wrongly paid into the fund, due to an error in the accounting processes employed by the magistrates courts during the 2000&#150;01 financial year. The mistakes were detected by internal controls and action has been taken to tighten procedures and to ensure that the mistakes are not repeated. None of the individual payments was for &#163;10 million or more, and the funds were recovered from the Consolidated Fund by short surrender.

 The Lord Chancellor appoints to judicial office exclusively on merit. The number of women holding judicial office substantially reflects the number of women practitioners in the legal profession with the appropriate period of experience which is usually not less than 20 years. The Lord Chancellor has already introduced a number of initiatives to encourage greater

numbers to apply for judicial office and to secure equality of opportunity in the appointments process. For example, he has made information about the appointments procedures widely available; he applies the procedures flexibly in relation to the age and sitting arrangements; he has introduced a work shadowing scheme; he has reviewed the detailed criteria for appointment against which assessments of suitability are made; he is piloting a scheme to encourage applications from those who may think that their career progress to date understates their judicial potential; and has appointed a Commissioner for Judicial Appointments to audit and make recommendations about the appointments procedures and handle complaints. Preparatory work for a pilot assessment centre has begun with a view to running the pilot in 2002. A video about the appointments process will be completed soon. These efforts will continue and be developed with a view to progressive increases in the numbers of women appointed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will take steps to eliminate the differences in rates of pay per hour for supply teachers working for Cumbria LEA and those employed by Lancashire LEA; and if she will make a statement.  [24047]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w24.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Supply teachers employed by an LEA or by the governing body of a maintained school must be paid under the provisions of the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document. The document provides that teachers employed on a short notice basis should be paid a proportion of the remuneration that would be appropriate if they were employed full-time. It is, however, for the individual employer to determine what that proportion should be on the basis of the number of hours worked in the day. An interpretation of how to calculate the appropriate proportion and hours worked per day could differ between two authorities. I am content to allow this flexibility of interpretation to remain.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what steps the Government have taken to combat <i>(a)</i> bullying and <i>(b)</i> vandalism on school buses.  [20636]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Bullying can be a serious problem in and around schools and in December 2000 we launched a new anti-bullying strategy, including a comprehensive new anti-bullying pack for schools with an accompanying video aimed at pupils. We have also required headteachers to draw up anti-bullying policies; these should be kept under regular review with Ofsted involved in carrying out inspections. Although the courts have ruled that a school's duty of care to prevent bullying applies within the school precincts, teachers could discuss bullying on school buses with escorts, the transport company and the local education authority and all three could take action when appropriate.
<P>

<a name="11219w26.html_para1">Vandalism can also be a serious problem on some occasions. It is for the operators of school buses as well as the local education authority to address safety issues including the prevention of bullying or violence. The DTLR has recently published "The School Run" training programme for bus drivers (February 2001), designed to help improve the relationships between bus drivers and young people. The publication also contains "best practice" checklists for schools, bus companies and Passenger Transport Executives, and lesson material alerting children to the dangers of misbehaving on buses.

 Benchmark information based on national pupil performance in maintained, mainstream schools is published annually in the Department's autumn package. The benchmark data enable schools to compare their performance with other schools grouped according to one measure of social disadvantage, that is, the percentage of children known to be eligible for a free school meal. A copy of the autumn package has been placed in the House of Commons Library; it is also available on the Department's website.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will implement measures to ensure that industry is <i>(a)</i> consulted and <i>(b)</i> represented in attempts to replace the individual learning accounts scheme.  [23544]<P>

<P>
<a name="11219w26.html_spnew4"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Some discussions have already been held with training providers. We are now about to seek the views of a wider range of stakeholders. This will include representatives of industry and employers, both large and small. The views obtained will be an important element in designing a new ILA-style programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w26.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 With any universal offer deadweight will exist. Although not an exact calculation, an assessment of deadweight within the ILA programme can be based upon the evaluation evidence drawn from a series of hypothetical questions. Based on the sample selected the first stage evaluation showed that 44 per cent. of account holders said that they would have been able to pay for their course without their ILA discount.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w26.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 My Department actively engaged learning providers in the development of the individual learning accounts programme. For example, a number of seminars were held with learning providers in 2000, prior to the introduction of the national framework for individual learning accounts, and these continued into 2001. At these events providers expressed a wide range of opinions. In September 2000 James O'Brien, Managing Director, Pitman Training, wrote to Ministers to express concern that the programme was open to abuse, but also said that the cap on public support for each individual's ILA account introduced to help control such abuse had been set at too low a level. This is the earliest correspondence we have traced on the specific topic of potential misuse of the ILA scheme.

 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2001]:</i> Officials have, as a matter of priority, been working to validate outstanding claims for payment to learning providers. I can confirm that we will be making payments this week to almost 1,400 providers who had submitted claims up to 21 November. There are, however, a smaller number of claims from around 140 providers, in some cases for significant amounts, on which we need to carry out further checks before payments can be cleared. Officials will be writing this week to all providers whose claims were outstanding up to 21 November to explain the general arrangements for taking forward the processing of existing and future claims.
<P>

<a name="11219w26.html_para5">We are also continuing to work on validating claims made between 21 and 23 November and on dealing with learning booked on the ILA system up to its closure on 23 November. Once we are satisfied that eligible learning has taken place in accordance with the rules of the programme, we will be able to arrange payments to all providers who are not currently subject to investigation, provided that this status does not change following the analysis of recent complaints received.

 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2001]:</i> A full common address trawl of the ILA system has been carried out to identify multiple individual applications at the same address.

 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2001]:</i> The total budget available in England over the two years 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 is &#163;202.1 million, which includes &#163;115.1 million which has been recycled from TEC resources. The aim was to have 1 million ILAs opened by March 2002. No precise number was set for ILAs budgeted to be used, as the ILA programme was an entirely new and innovative programme for which take-up could not accurately be predicted in its early years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to her answer of 11 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 813W, on individual learning accounts, whether there were constraints upon the absolute exercise of the Secretary of State's discretion; and whether the power of the Secretary of State to close down the learning account scheme immediately and without notice was publicised to <i>(a)</i> learning account holders and <i>(b)</i> learning account providers.  [23581]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w26.html_spnew12"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The only constraints on the absolute exercise of the Secretary of State's discretion would be where this was inconsistent with natural justice.
<P>

<a name="11219w26.html_para6">The Secretary of State and I took the decision to shut down the programme with immediate effect from 6.30pm on 23 November. That decision was taken to minimise a serious risk to public funds. Under these circumstances, there was no time to notify providers or account holders in advance.
<P>

<a name="11219w26.html_para7">The shutdown meant that neither the ILA account holders database nor the ILA learning providers database was available to us. However, we issued a press statement on 23 November and provided notification of the shut down-on both the Department and Capita websites which we updated as new information became available. We were also able to resume the operation of the ILA helpline for account holders, on a limited basis, on 27 November.

 The Department has not contacted the Information Commissioner (previously Data Protection Registrar) concerning possible unauthorised access to the ILA account holder's database. The Department's Special Investigations Unit has been working closely with the police and where prima facie evidence of criminal activity has been found the police have been asked to take over investigations.

<P>

 Learners and potential learners could visit the website (www.my-ila.com) only for information purposes and to request application packs. Registered learning providers could access the database once they had been provided with a user name and password. This allowed them to register courses, book learning and to confirm learning had taken place. Learning providers could only view personal name and address details of individuals registered on courses with that learning provider. Staff in DfES had view access only. The organisation 'learndirect' had a separate although restricted access to allow them to issue application packs to inquirers.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, pursuant to her answer of 11 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 813W, on individual learning accounts, for what reason those account holders who had not used their accounts by 23 November cannot be subject to a validation process as a condition of being able to undertake eligible learning.  [23582]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w26.html_spnew21"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Individual Learning Account programme was closed on 23 November as a result of evidence of serious potential fraud and theft. That decision was taken to minimise a serious risk to public funds. However, subject to new validation arrangements, all eligible learning booked onto the ILA system before 6.30 pm on 23 November will be honoured.
<P>

<a name="11219w26.html_para11">The programme is now closed to the further booking of learning by ILA account holders and learning providers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w26.html_spnew22"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The ILA programme was shut down on 23 November and closed to the further booking of learning by learning providers. Officials are setting up, as a matter of priority, arrangements to validate outstanding payments and claims for payment from learning providers so that the majority of providers, who have acted honestly throughout, can be paid as quickly as possible. We will pay for eligible learning that has already taken place and for learning that is already booked on the ILA Centre's system, providing we are satisfied that eligible learning is undertaken, in accordance with the rules of the programme. Learning which was not booked onto the ILA system before the programme was shut down will not benefit from an ILA discount.
<P>

<a name="11219w26.html_para12">The overall purpose of ILAs was to help people overcome the financial barriers to learning by helping with the costs. The incentives and discounts were placed in the hands of the individual as they are best placed to choose learning that is most beneficial to their training needs. Some learning providers will, as a result, have received an increase in their business because of ILAs. 



<P>

However, learning providers can only access moneys if an account holder has decided to use their ILA to help pay for learning at their establishment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The published assessment criteria for each specialism permit joint specialist school applications involving two schools. The criteria also allow for collaborative approaches involving associated applications. Arrangements for associated applications involve a group of schools making solo applications or a combination of solo and joint applications, across a range of specialisms as part of a strategic approach to specialist school provision across an area. Each application succeeds or fails on its own merits.

 Information on the specialist school targets agreed by individual arts, language, technology and sports colleges is not collated but is contained in the development plans and progress reports of each of the 685 specialist schools. These plans and progress reports are retained on individual school files and used in the assessment process for redesignation. Typically, the four-year development plans of an applicant school set between 100 and 400 targets, which focus on a range of school and community strands.

 We are keen to ensure that all young people should have the opportunity to study subjects that interest them. However, we have no plans to introduce a GCSE in Road User Studies as there are other GCSE qualifications that cover elements of the subject area, for example, Design and Technology GCSE. Other vocationally related qualifications approved for use include the Motor Vehicle and Road User Studies Certificates offered by the City and Guilds of London Institute, the Assessment and Qualifications Alliance (AQA) and the Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC). There is also the Motor Vehicle Foundation Studies Certificate offered by the Awarding Body Consortium (ABC).

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made as to the number of people who would be in fuel poverty in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> the Isle of Wight if there were a 5 per cent. rise in fuel prices.  [23678]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w30.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="11219w30.html_para2">The UK Fuel Poverty Strategy, which was published in November 2001, states that for the purposes of estimating the effects of price changes on future numbers in fuel poverty, a reasonable range of price movements by 2010 to consider would appear to be: for domestic gas prices&#151;an increase of 15 per cent. to a fall of 10 per cent. in real terms; and for domestic electricity prices&#151;an increase of 5 per cent. to a fall of 2 per cent. in real terms
<P>

<a name="11219w30.html_para3">If electricity prices were to rise by 5 per cent. and gas prices by 15 per cent. then the number in fuel poverty in England could increase by around 0.8 million. If electricity prices fell by 2 per cent. and gas prices fell by 10 per cent. then the numbers in fuel poverty could fall by around 0.3 million. Future gas and electricity prices are uncertain and will be affected by a number of factors. It is difficult to estimate the precise impacts of price changes on the numbers in fuel poverty. The figures presented give a broad indication of the changes in fuel poverty which might be expected from the stated changes in energy prices.
<P>

<a name="11219w30.html_para4">It is broadly estimated that a 5 per cent. increase in fuel prices may increase the number of households in fuel poverty in England by around 0.4 million. Data are not available to produce estimates of fuel poverty on the Isle of Wight and it is therefore not possible to estimate the impact of changes in fuel prices on fuel poverty on the Isle of Wight.

 The devolved Administrations have been closely involved in the development of the UK's position on the World Summit on Sustainable Development. We will certainly want to ensure that they are represented at the Summit, but the precise composition of the UK's delegation will be a matter for the Prime Minister nearer the time.

The minutes of this meeting and a statement by the Agency are available on their website. A copy of the statement has been placed in the Library of the House. The Board's advice, in summary, was to maintain the current labelling rules supplemented with the introduction of a provision for "GM-free" labelling.

 The European Commission has yet to bring forward a formal proposal for a Framework Directive for Minimum Energy Efficiency Requirements for End-Use Equipment, but it has recently indicated that it should be in a position to do so early in 2002.

<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what advice her Department has issued for footpath users when footpaths cross fields and farmyards covered by biosecurity recommendations.  [23630]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w32.html_spnew0"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 With the improving foot and mouth disease situation, the veterinary risk assessment on use of public rights of way has been revised, and concludes that it is now safe to re-open footpaths crossing remaining restricted premises&#151;apart from those passing through farmyards or buildings&#151;once final cleansing and disinfection is complete, or, if final cleansing and disinfection is not being undertaken, three months after completion of preliminary cleansing and disinfection.
<P>

<a name="11219w32.html_para0">The revised risk assessment was issued on 7 December, along with revised guidance to local authorities which encourages them to work closely with the Department's Divisional Veterinary Managers to establish exactly which rights of way may now be re-opened. Where paths pass through farmyards or buildings, authorities should try to arrange temporary permissive diversions with the farmers concerned, especially where heavily-used paths or national trails are affected. If this is not possible, those paths must remain closed until the veterinary restrictions are lifted. The revised risk assessment and guidance refer to footpaths as the most familiar rights of way, but apply equally to all types of public right of way.
<P>

<a name="11219w32.html_para1">The guidance includes a code of conduct which local authorities are asked to publicise to path users, to encourage them to behave so as to reduce still further the already minimal risk that their activities could transmit the disease. However, there is no conflict between the relaxation of restrictions on rights-of-way users and continuing tight biosecurity controls on some farming activity: the latter are designed to limit the risks arising from working directly with animals, which, though now small, are far more significant than those arising from footpath use.
<P>

<a name="11219w32.html_para2">97 per cent. of footpaths in England are now open. Local authorities may require a little time to establish which footpaths across restricted premises can be re-opened, but almost all should be open by early in the new year, provided that there are no further outbreaks of the disease.

 <i>[holding answer 10 December 2001]:</i> To qualify for subsidy on sheep or cattle an individual must be a producer as specified within European Community legislation.
<P>

<a name="11219w32.html_para8">In some circumstances "pets" may qualify but this is subject to detailed regulations. The definition of a producer, with regard to the grant of premiums for sheepmeat and goatmeat, is laid down within Council Regulation 3493/1990. For beef and veal subsidies this definition is in Council Regulation 1254/1999. Copies of these Regulations are available in the House of Commons Library.
<P>

<a name="11219w32.html_para9">Claimants must also meet the specific eligibility requirements of each subsidy scheme. These are also set out in Community legislation.

<a name="11219w32.html_para10">An overview of how livestock schemes operate within England, and which animals may be eligible for subsidy, is provided on-line at www.defra.gov.uk, under the headings of 'Farming' and 'Cattle and sheep schemes'.
<P>

<a name="11219w32.html_para11">Administration of the livestock subsidy regimes within England is carried out by the Rural Payment Agency (RPA). Local offices of the RPA are able to provide, free of charge, notes for guidance to claimants, which detail the specific rules of the individual schemes.

<a name="11219w33.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The United Kingdom has not been rhizomania-free since 1987, when the first outbreak was found. Since then, the disease has been found in an increasing number of farms, so that 211 are now known to be infected with the disease. The UK was granted Protected Zone status for rhizomania when the Single Market Plant Health legislation was adopted in 1993, at which time only 19 outbreaks had been detected and there was still hope that the disease would not become widely established. Through the containment policy associated with Protected Zone status DEFRA has prohibited the use of outbreak fields for beet production and imposed hygiene requirements, to try to prevent further spread of the disease from those fields. Despite these measures the number of outbreaks has continued to rise. It is likely that the causative organisms for the disease were present in many locations before symptoms of the disease were detected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w33.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The payment period for land put into set-aside under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) during 2001 began on 16 November and will end on 31 January 2002 (or 31 March 2002 where the set-aside has been used for growing non-food crops).
<P>

<a name="11219w33.html_para0">The largest payment for set-aside recorded so far is &#163;110,492.14. The DEFRA financial database does not distinguish between payments to private individuals and those to other legal entities.

<a name="11219w33.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 DEFRA has so far issued payments totalling &#163;56,168,779.92 during 2001 in respect of set- aside under the Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS). This total includes payments for scheme years before 2001, and agrimonetary compensation.

(3) if she will make a statement on her Department's decision to implement the uncultivated and semi-natural areas provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive.  [23067]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w33.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government gave a commitment in the Rural White Paper in November 2000 and to Parliament to consult on implementing the uncultivated land provisions of the Environmental Impact Assessment Directive. The Environmental Impact Assessment (Uncultivated Land and Semi-natural Areas) (England) Regulations 2001, S.I. No. 3966, will come into force on 1 February 2002.
<P>

<a name="11219w33.html_para1">In our consultations on the regulations it was agreed that to be as helpful as possible to farmers the Government should provide a working guide to key but undefined terms in the Directive. The resulting guidelines, a copy of which will be placed in the Library of the House, will set out the categories of land concerned, including to unimproved grassland, heath, moorland, scrubland and wetlands. Unimproved grassland would typically include meadows and grazing pasture, downland or other open or enclosed upland grassland with some tree cover.
<P>

<a name="11219w33.html_para2">The European Court of Justice has established that, even with indicative thresholds, an assessment would still be needed on whether a project was likely to give rise to significant environmental effects. To provide some degree of certainty, the Government decided that each case should be screened, but only those which give rise to significant environmental effects would be considered further under the Regulations.

<i></i> [holding answer 15 November 2001]: A snapshot survey of some hospitals and other health premises was undertaken last year by the NHS Estates Agency of the Department. An advisory panel, which included members of professional organisations as well as Departmental officials, was established to oversee it. Mr. David Hurrell acted as technical co-ordinator. As a result of that limited survey, a more comprehensive one was announced in October 2000.
<P>

 Article 5 of the proposed food supplements Directive would establish the approach to setting maximum limits for vitamins and minerals.

The national health service will be obliged to fund the implementation of any such guidance, and the extra resources that we announced recently will ensure that the NHS is well placed to do so.

Friend the Secretary of State announced on 27 August that national health service bodies could commission treatment for NHS patients from other member states of the European Economic Area (EEA), as part of their wider efforts to reduce waiting times. My right hon. Friend made it clear that NHS bodies would need to meet the costs of treating NHS patients elsewhere in the EEA out of their existing budgets.

 In the light of recent rulings of the European Court of Justice, we announced that we would amend the National Health Service Act 1977 to enable the NHS to commission treatment within the European Economic Area (EEA). We will make regulations shortly. We will also take this opportunity to permit NHS bodies to commission care from outside the EEA, where it is in the patient's best interest to do so. We none the less expect that the overwhelming majority of referrals, where they occur, will be to countries of the EEA.

bodies to pay for the travel of NHS patients going overseas for treatment funded by the NHS. The NHS will meet the cost of the patient's travel from the point at which they begin their international journey (the airport, ferry port or international train station) to the foreign provider. Reimbursement of travel expenses between the patient's home to the airport, ferry port of international train station will be governed by the same rules that currently apply to payment of travelling expenses to hospitals in England. This change will ensure that patients treated overseas under the auspices of the NHS will not be disadvantaged by having to travel further for that treatment.

There is a useful summary of most recent material in "Helping Care Leavers: Problems and Strategic Responses" by Professor Mike Stein and Dr. Jim Wade of the University of York, published in 2000 as part of the Department of Health's resource pack "Getting it Right: Good Practice in Leaving Care."

<a name="11219w37.html_para3">The social services inspectorate produced a detailed inspection report in this area in 1997, "When Leaving Home is Also Leaving Care". The Department commissioned "Moving On" by Biehal et al, published in 1995. This research was built on by Professor Peter Marsh and Mark Peel at the University of Sheffield, in their Department of Health funded study "Leaving Care in Partnership: Family Involvement with Care Leavers" published in 1999. Other research commissioned recently by the Department includes the "Audit and Assessment of Leaving Care Services in London" by Jenni Vernon of the National Children's Bureau (September 2000).
<P>

<a name="11219w37.html_para4">The Department also has research in progress. In April this year it commissioned Dr. Jim Wade to investigate the costs and outcomes of transitional support for care leavers. The study will consider a range of outcomes achieved by young people and evaluate the costs of different packages of support in different local authorities.
<P>

<a name="11219w37.html_para5">Earlier this year the Department also called for proposals for a study of barriers to further education and training for care leavers under its Quality Protects Research Initiative.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many young people who left the care system went into <i>(a)</i> full-time education, <i>(b)</i> further education, <i>(c)</i> higher education and <i>(d)</i> Government training schemes in the last five years broken down by regions and nations; and what support is given to young people with multiple disadvantages to access job opportunities.  [23200]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w37.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Statistical information concerning the educational or employment status of care leavers in England over the last five years is not available. A new statistical collection which will provide this information for care leavers aged 19 has recently been introduced by the Department, and the first year of data will cover 12 months ending 31 March 2002. The Department plans to publish this information in autumn 2002.

<a name="11219w37.html_para7">The Department for Education and Skills is currently rolling out the Connexions service across England. This will offer all young people aged 13 to 19 support and advice to help them fulfil their potential by giving them access to a personal adviser. For those with multiple issues to address, the role of the personal adviser will be to help the young person identify their needs and aspirations, supporting them in overcoming difficulties. This will include working with and supporting education and training institutions, and employers, in meeting these needs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his estimate is of the shortages in the NHS of <i>(a)</i> nurses, <i>(b)</i> GPs, <i>(c)</i> consultants and <i>(d)</i> therapists and other specialist staff.  [23253]<P>

<P>
<a name="11219w37.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The NHS Plan acknowledges that a shortage of human resources is the biggest constraint faced by the National Health Service today. Targets for increasing the number of doctors and nurses were set in the NHS Plan and rolled forward in the manifesto before the last election.




<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2001 : Column: 451W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11219w37.html_para8">The NHS Plan targets are for 7,500 more consultants, 2,000 more general practitioners, 6,500 more therapists and other health professionals and 20,000 more nurses by 2004. In September 2000 there were 1,100 more consultants, 126 more GPs, 1,400 more therapists and other health professionals and 6,300 more nurses than in September 1999, the NHS Plan baseline. Provisional data from the 2001 census indicate that 10,000 more nurses were employed in the NHS in 2001 than in 2000.

<i>Note:</i><P>

1. Expenditure is taken from health authority and primary care trust summarisation forms which are prepared on a resource basis and therefore differ from cash allocations in the year. The expenditure is the total spent by the health authority and by the primary care trusts within each health authority area. The majority of General Dental Services expenditure is not included in the health authority or primary care trust accounts and is separately accounted for by the Dental Practice Board.<P>

2. Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in an element of double counting where one body acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by other bodies. The effect of this double counting within the answer cannot be identified.<P>





3. Some health authorities act as lead commissioners for particular specialties which inflates their figures when compared with others and also causes differences between years. Other factors may also distort the figures so the results are therefore not all directly comparable with each other and with answers to similar questions for previous years.<P>

 We are committed to introducing a screening programme for prostate cancer if and when screening and treatment techniques are sufficiently well developed.

 My Department's innovation programme expenditure is primarily providing support to industry UK-wide. In the financial year 2001&#150;02, &#163;340 million was allocated to this support. It would be a disproportionate cost to ascertain the regional breakdown of this expenditure.

 Business Links exist and operate only in England. There are 45 Business Link operators, appointed by the Small Business Service (SBS), operating in 45 designated areas throughout England.
<P>

<a name="11219w42.html_para14">Business Link operators receive a grant from SBS in the form of a Core Services allocation, which funds the core business support services that the BL operator is obliged to deliver under the terms of their agreement. Other funding is provided by the SBS to deliver specialist services like the UK Online for Business, Local Partnership Fund and High Growth Start-ups programmes, these funds are allocated at regional level.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="11219w43.html_para0">The energy targets relating to this objective and the progress towards these targets are as follows:
<P>

<a name="11219w43.html_para1"><i>Targets</i>
1. Ensure competitive gas and electricity prices in the lower half of the EU/G7 basket, while achieving security of supply and social and environmental objectives.
<P>

<a name="11219w43.html_para2">2. Improve the environment and sustainable use of natural resources, including by reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 12.5 per cent. from 1990 levels over the period 2008&#150;12 and moving towards a 20 per cent. reduction in CO2 emissions by 2010 (Joint target with DEFRA).
<P>

<a name="11219w43.html_para3"><i>Progress</i>
<P>

<a name="11219w43.html_para4"><i>Competitive energy prices:</i>
Overall, in 2000, based on the data available from the International Energy Agency, UK industrial and domestic gas prices, both including and excluding taxes, were in the lower half of the EU/G7 basket. UK domestic electricity prices, including taxes, were also in the lower half of the EU/G7 basket during 2000. However, industrial electricity and domestic, excluding taxes, electricity prices were not in the lower half of the EU/G7 basket. But figures for the UK show that electricity prices have fallen in 2001.
<P>

<a name="11219w43.html_para5"><i>Security:</i>
The Department monitors electricity supply through supply interruptions and lost time. Between 1996&#150;97 and 1999&#150;2000 both the number of interruptions and average time lost have declined. Oil stocks are also monitored, with a target to maintain national emergency oil stocks at, or above, levels required by international obligations. At 



<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2001 : Column: 472W</I><P>
the end of the third quarter of 2001 the UK held stocks equal to 70 days of consumption, compared with an obligation of 67.5 days.
<P>

<a name="11219w43.html_para6"><i>Diversity:</i>
The Department has a target to achieve 10 per cent. of electricity generated from renewable resources by 2010, subject to the costs to consumers being acceptable. In 2000, renewables accounted for 2.8 per cent. of electricity generated in the UK.
<P>

<a name="11219w43.html_para7"><i>Social:</i>
The Department has introduced a social target of fuel expenditure as a percentage of income (including housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest) for the lowest three income deciles to be reducing and below 5 per cent. by 2003&#150;04. Over the last three years fuel expenditure as a percentage of income has been reducing and in 1999&#150;2000 was 7 per cent.
<P>

<a name="11219w43.html_para8"><i>Sustainability/environment:</i>
Projections suggest that the UK is on course to meet its Kyoto commitment to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases by 12.5 per cent. by 2008&#150;2012 from 1990 level. The Department is also on course to meet the sulphur dioxide emissions target of 80 per cent. below 1980 levels by 2010.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w43.html_spnew3"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 At the end of the last financial year, 31 March 2001, the unit cost of case investigation by the Insolvency Service had been reduced by 10.6 per cent.

<P>
<a name="11219w43.html_spnew4"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Department does not provide funding for the Citizens Advice Line for London (CALL) general advice line. It has however provided time-limited funding support for a consumer helpline pilot run by CALL as one of three such pilots across England, each using different approaches. The pilot funding has always been time limited to March 2002.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the reasons for the difference between the initial voted annually managed expenditure and provisional outturn for financial year 2000&#150;01, as listed in the Treasury document, Public Expenditure 2000&#150;01: Provisional Outturn, for the Export Credit Guarantees Department and the self-financing public corporations categories; and if she will make a statement.

 Annually managed expenditure mainly comprises the refinancing of bank export finance loans made by commercial banks under ECGD's guarantee. Such refinancing produces worthwhile savings to the taxpayer. The refinancing programme has been significantly increased during 2000&#150;01. Some of the rise in AME is due to costs associated with refinancing, but these are more than offset by the savings.

 <i>[holding answer 3 December 2001]:</i> We have no plans for such an investigation.

Furthermore, any price indicated to consumers which is rendered misleading as a result of illegible terms and conditions could be the subject of a criminal prosecution under the Consumer Protection Act 1987. In relation to standard consumer contracts, the Director General of Fair Trading has used his powers under the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations 1999 to ensure that these are presented in print of acceptable size. In relation to offers for credit, under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 in order for the terms of a consumer credit agreement to be enforceable they must be readily legible.

 The Government have welcomed the publication of "Sea Changes". The Department is very much aware of the regeneration and economic development needs of seaside resorts, given its responsibility for the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) and for co-ordination of policy on the assisted areas and structural funds maps.
<P>

<a name="11219w44.html_para2">We look to the RDAs to continue to develop and implement economic and regeneration strategies on a regional basis, working closely with other regional and local partners. In its guidance to the RDAs on preparing their Corporate Plans for 2002&#150;04, the Department has specifically asked them to explain how they intend to work with the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, local Regional Tourist Boards, and other regional, sub- regional and local authority bodies in the development and implementation of sustainable tourism strategies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to her answer of 29 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 1049W, on the aluminium industry, what assessment he has made of the extent to which the UK will be affected by the downturn in world aluminium markets.  [22992]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w45.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Alcan and Alcoa, the two largest employers in the UK aluminium industry, recently announced detailed proposals for restructuring their global operations as a result of recent falls in world demand for aluminium. This would result in a reduction of around 7 per cent. in the combined UK work forces of these two companies. Under these proposals two sites, Alcoa's Dolgarrog rolling mill and Alcan's Glasgow foil plant, would close completely with employee reductions at Alcan's Rogerstone mill. However Alcan's Bridgnorth plant would gain an extra 60 jobs and &#163;13 million in investment. Industry assessments suggest that overall UK aluminium companies currently face low prices and profit margins, and that the market is likely to remain weak in the short to medium term.

<P>
<a name="11219w45.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2001]:</i> The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) and The Packaging (Essential Requirements) 1998 Regulations provide the regulatory framework aimed at encouraging a reduction in packaging and packaging waste in England and Wales. These, and similar regulations in Northern Ireland and Scotland, are designed to allow the United Kingdom to fulfil the European Union obligations of Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste.
<P>

<a name="11219w45.html_para0">These regulations encourage a reduction in packaging and packaging waste by setting demanding recovery and recycling targets along with requirements to discourage over-packaging. They also place financial burdens on business in relation to the weight of packaging they place on the market. Awareness of these regulations is already promoted by the Government and the enforcement agencies. This month the Commission has published a proposal to revise Directive 94/62/EC. The need for any future advertising campaign will be considered as part of the future implementation of the revised Directive.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w49.html_spnew21"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 No, Railtrack plc entered into administration because it was, or shortly would be, unable to meet its debt liabilities. The decision not to proceed with RenewCo was taken following advice from the ONS that the proposed RenewCo structure would classify in the public sector and as a result did not satisfy the conditions agreed on 2 April and in light of Railtrack's directors being informed of the decision on 5 October to reject their 'Project Rainbow' proposal for additional funds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w49.html_spnew22"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Railtrack plc in administration continues to receive funding to the level and profile determined in the regulator's October 2000 periodic review and the 2 April agreement.

 The original contract between London Underground and Westinghouse Signals Ltd. was to deliver a signalling system with a long term operating capacity of 36 trains per hour (tph) and a fallback capacity of 27 tph in the event that the development of the advanced signalling system failed to meet the contract programme. It was necessary to implement fallback arrangements utilising existing technology to deliver a system capable of supporting 24 tph.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 13 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 623W, on London Underground, for what reason his Department allowed London Underground to give a waiver to senior LU managers in regard to a legal challenge by infrastructure companies and bidders; and if the waiver will extend to such a challenge by a member of the public.  [22740]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w50.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 London Underground is responsible for managing the competitions for the contracts to modernise the tube infrastructure.
<P>

<a name="11219w50.html_para2">I understand that, as is common in such transactions, the legal documents for effecting the transfer of the infrastructure companies to the bidders contain various limitations on the bidders' ability to make claims against London Underground, including in relation to information disclosed by London Underground as part of the bid process. Although considered unlikely, it is possible that a bidder could seek to make a claim against an employee of London Underground rather than the company itself. Since employees are insured against such claims by London Underground, the effect would be to circumvent the intended cap on London Underground's liability. London Underground therefore intends to include a waiver in relation to claims by a bidder against employees of London Transport, London Underground or the infrastructure companies.

<P>

<a name="11219w50.html_para3">As stated in my answer of 13 November 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 623W, the wavier will not prevent legal action by London Transport or London Underground against their own employees. Nor will it extend to potential claims by a member of the public.

 London Underground is responsible for managing the competition for the contracts to modernise the tube infrastructure.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w50.html_spnew28"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 London Underground is responsible for managing the competition for the contracts to modernise the tube infrastructure. In addition to general health and safety law, the infrastructure companies will be required to comply with a contractual safety case.
<P>

<a name="11219w50.html_para13">The independent Health and Safety Executive will be examining these contractual safety cases as part of the assessment process for the next revision to London Underground's statutory Railway Safety Case. The Government have always made it clear that the plans for modernising the tube will only go ahead if the Health and Safety Executive are satisfied that London Underground has made an acceptable case for safety.

 The British Transport police (BTP) have provided the following information. During the period December 2000 to November 2001, 12,787 notifiable and 5,013 non-notifiable offences were recorded by the BTP area responsible for the London Underground. The term "notifiable" refers to those offences that police forces in England and Wales are required to report to the Home Office. The term "non-notifiable" refers to those offences that are not reportable, and are generally of a less serious nature. The number of arrests is not recorded by the BTP.

 The reliability, capacity and quality of travelling environment delivered by the infrastructure companies will be measured against benchmarks that are based on performance in the current year.
<P>

<a name="11219w50.html_para15">On reliability, an infrastructure company that performs 5 per cent. better than current performance will be penalised at a rate of &#163;3 per lost customer hour for any deterioration in that performance level. If it performs 5 per cent. worse than current performance, then the penalty rate doubles so that a further deterioration in performance is penalised at a rate of &#163;6 per lost customer hour.
<P>

<a name="11219w50.html_para16">A similar mechanism is used to incentivise improvements in capacity and the quality of the travelling environment. On these measures, the payment rate varies according to the line in question, but in every case the benchmark is set so that the marginal payment rate doubles if performance deteriorates below the current level. I understand that London Underground intends to make details of the contracts available once they have been signed.

Until the final outputs are agreed it is not possible to say what the costs involved will be. Value for money is one of the considerations under discussion.
<P>

<a name="11219w52.html_para0">Virgin Trains have so far been paid over &#163;400 million under the cross country franchise since it commenced on 5 January 1997. The upgrade to cross country services, including the lease of new trains and infrastructure enhancements, are a commercial venture by Virgin Trains.

<a name="11219w52.html_para1">Subsidy levels decline year on year. The company will be paying premiums under the West Coast Trains franchise from 2002&#150;03 and under the cross country franchise from 2010&#150;11.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w52.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions when he will publish his consultation document on planning obligations.  [24260]




<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2001 : Column: 517W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w52.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 I am publishing today a consultation document entitled "Planning obligations: delivering a fundamental change" which is one of a series of consultation papers that together propose a radical reform of the planning system.
<P>

<a name="11219w52.html_para2">Planning obligations (also known as section 106 agreements) are typically agreements between developers and local authorities negotiated in the context of granting a planning consent. They have been criticised by the Committee on Standards in Public Life (the Nolan Committee) for being insufficiently transparent. Business finds them slow to negotiate, unpredictable and, in some cases, unfair. They are then a disincentive to developers who may find themselves with long, expensive planning delays.
<P>

<a name="11219w52.html_para3">I am proposing to replace the present system of negotiated planning obligations with a tariff that will be set by local authorities in their local development plans. The tariff will apply in principle to all development that receives a planning consent. It will therefore give business much more certainty about what cost, in terms of planning obligations, it faces if it chooses to buy and develop a particular piece of land or property. I am also proposing that some development should be exempt because it is too small, it is financially marginal&#151;such as development of an urban brownfield site&#151;or serves a clear purpose in promoting sustainable development.
<P>

<a name="11219w52.html_para4">The tariff would be spent in line with the priorities set out in local development plans. I would expect the provision of affordable housing to be a high priority in most plans.
<P>

<a name="11219w52.html_para5">My proposals will create an open, accountable and predictable system that will enable business to see, at the outset of a development, what level of planning obligation is likely to be incurred. The tariff will, so far as possible, require no negotiation. It will be much easier for local authorities to administer and should allow planning permissions to be issued much faster.
<P>

<a name="11219w52.html_para6">I propose in the consultation document to allow planning obligations to be used to enable communities to share in the benefits of sustainable growth. Development pressures in some areas are placing heavy burdens on the existing infrastucture and especially on the supply of affordable housing for nurses, teachers, police officers and other keyworkers. We need to ensure that new development supports the investment required in new facilities to help improve the quality of life for local communities.
<P>

<a name="11219w52.html_para7">Copies of the consultation document will be placed in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on an appraisal framework for ports in the United Kingdom.  [23387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w53.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Department is issuing today a consultation document concerned with the development of an appraisal framework for port projects in the UK.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para0">The development of an appraisal framework for ports was identified in "Modern Ports: A UK Policy" as an important plank in the application of a sustainable transport policy to ports. The intention of the appraisal framework is to put ports on a similar footing to other modes, to make the appraisals more consistent with each other and to take full account of the role of ports in promoting sustainable transport. We believe that the use of a common framework assists promoters, objectors, local authorities, other public bodies and all those involved in planning inquiries to consider whether all relevant factors have been covered. The framework is also a contribution to the package of measures designed to speed up planning decisions on major infrastructure projects announced by the Department in July 2001.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para1">The consultation will assist the Department in drawing up a guidance note for all those involved with port developments requiring some form of official approval. It is intended that the guidance note will be issued later in 2002.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para2">We are inviting comments from all those with an interest in port related matters, including ports, port users, environmental interests, other Government Departments, local authorities, and other public and private bodies.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para3">The document outlines an appraisal framework derived from the guidance for multi-modal studies, but taking account of the particular effect of port developments. The document invites comments and suggestions on a number of topics, such as the content and format of strategic appraisal, scheme description, coverage and measurement of detailed effects and the appropriate level of detail required.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para4">The consultation is being conducted in accordance with the criteria contained in the Cabinet Office's Code of Practice on Written Consultation. Responses are requested to be sent to my Department by 5 April 2002. Copies of the consultation document are in the Library, and it is also available from my Department (EAMI Division, Zone 1/34, Great Minster House, 76 Marsham Street, London SW1P 4DR) and on the Department's website.

<a name="11219w53.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Pound: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the progress of the Quinquennial Review of Ordnance Survey.  [24994]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w53.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce today the outcome of the first Stage of the Quinquennial Review of Ordnance Survey. I have placed copies of the Stage 1 Report in the Libraries.




<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2001 : Column: 519W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para5">Stage 1 of the Review of Ordnance Survey, announced on 15 February 2001 was managed by a Steering Group chaired by my Department. It also included representatives from Ordnance Survey, HM Treasury, Cabinet Office and two external members from the Association of Geographic Information (AGI) and the London borough of Lewisham. Consultation took place with a wide range of stakeholders and customers in the geographic information business in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para6">Ordnance Survey is a Government Department and Executive Agency operating within a Trading Fund regime. The main recommendation of the review is that it should further strengthen its business focus by becoming a Government-owned plc on 1 April 2003, with Government owning 100 per cent. of the shares. This would provide Ordnance Survey with additional commercial freedoms that are considered to be essential if it is to use its full potential to develop the geographic information and e-business marketplace.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para7">The Stage 1 Review rejected the options of abolition, merger, contracting out and market testing. It considered privatisation carefully, but stated that this was not a real option at present because there is much for Ordnance Survey to do to increase its value as a business through increasing market presence and decreasing cost through operational efficiencies. Additionally, the reviewers concluded that privatisation could endanger Ordnance Survey's existing partnerships, both within the Government and the private sector. Government-owned plc status would balance the requirement of the national interest in maintaining consistent, up-to-date, and fit-for- purpose geographic information, with the commercial imperatives of an efficient organisation.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para8">I have carefully considered the Stage 1 Report and its argument that there is a need for a further step change from the current Trading Fund status to enable Ordnance Survey to respond effectively to the requirements of the marketplace. I have accepted that the change in status will enable the further development and expansion of their business of providing geographic data for others to add value and generate commercial products, but I wish to have this confirmed by means of a clear business case.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para9">The report's recommendation is in line with the wider Government policy of increasing accountability for Government organisations and increases the potential for high quality managers to raise the return to Government from the efficient and effective use of Ordnance Survey assets and investment.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para10">I am minded to accept the Review's recommendation and have authorised the Steering Group to proceed to a Stage 2 Review which will be asked to undertake a detailed analysis of the best structure for a company, confirm the benefits and costs compared to the current Trading Fund status, consider the right operating framework, and propose means of removing any obstacles which will influence the establishment of Ordnance Survey as a Government-owned company by 1 April 2003. Stage 2 will also investigate how further public- private partnerships might benefit Ordnance Survey.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para11">I will make a further statement when the Stage 2 Review is complete and I have assessed its findings.

[22757]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w53.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 I refer the hon. Member to the answer that I gave today to my hon. Friend the Member for Ealing, North (Mr. Pound) regarding Stage 1 of the Quinquennial Review of Ordnance Survey, at columns 518&#150;19W.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para12">Cabinet Office guidelines stipulate a two-stage approach to Quinquennial Reviews. The content of the second stage of Quinquennial Reviews is dependent on decisions made following the first stage. The first stage of the review has considered and made recommendations regarding the most appropriate organisation for delivering the functions currently carried out by Ordnance Survey.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para13">Work will begin on the second stage of the review early in the new year, which will consider further the issues raised within Stage 1, and on how Ordnance Survey can improve its performance. Cabinet Office guidelines recommend that the second stage of a review should be completed within three months.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para14">I can confirm that a staged timetable was envisaged when Stage 1 of the Ordnance Survey Quinquennial Review was announced.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w53.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Hatton judgment raises serious questions about the interpretation and application of the European Convention on Human Rights. We are therefore submitting a request for the case to be referred for consideration by the Grand Chamber of the Court. The grounds for this request are set out in a letter to the Court, copies of which will be placed in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w53.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 There has been a proliferation of research into the causes of homelessness over the past decade, including recent studies on older people. The Government have announced that they are establishing a new homelessness directorate to bring together existing work to help homeless people as well as to develop new work to prevent homelessness and investigate its causes, as part of this consideration will be given to further research in this area.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what estimate his Department has made of the number of specialist hostel places available for single homeless women, broken down by region.  [24187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w53.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Information about hostel provision is not collected centrally and no estimates of specialist provision for women have been made. However, the hon. Member might be interested to know that information gathered on 3,387 people contacted by the contact and assessment teams in London during 2000&#150;01 show that around 10 per cent. of rough sleepers are women, with around a fifth of this group being aged under 25.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w53.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what estimates his Department has made of the number of people made homeless as a result of administrative errors and failures by housing benefit units.  [24192]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w53.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Information reported to the Department relates to the number of households accepted under the homelessness provisions of Housing Acts as being eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in priority need. Cases that are the result of rent arrears are identified, although the number of these attributable to delays or errors in housing benefit administration are not separately distinguished.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para15">The Department's housing policy statement "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all&#151;The way forward for housing" (December 2000) recognised that the fundamental challenge facing housing benefit is its administration. Problems with administering housing benefit can result in unacceptable levels of fraud and error, as well as backlogs of delayed claims. Our immediate priority has therefore been to work in partnership with local authorities to improve standards of administration. We have also set up a help fund to enable local authorities to formulate and implement improvement plans. In addition, we will introduce national performance standards to support the better administration of housing benefit from spring 2002.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para16">The best value regime is also helping to drive up standards of delivery across all local authority services. Best value performance indicators in place since April 2000 include a measure of the average speed of processing housing benefit claims. Provisional and unaudited best value performance information published by the Department suggests that about a quarter of English local authorities took on average 60 days or longer to process new housing benefit claims in 2000&#150;01. Final performance figures for 2000&#150;01 will be published early in 2002.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w53.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what baseline figures his Department has for the number of <i>(a)</i> officially recorded and <i>(b)</i> unofficial estimates of older homeless people (i) sleeping rough, (ii) in hostel accommodation, (iii) in move-on accommodation, (iv) in bed and breakfast accommodation and (v) in special needs accommodation.  [24186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w53.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 The most recent street count showed that there were 532 people sleeping rough across England on any one night. We estimate that between 15 and 20 per cent. of those will be aged over 50. Information 



<P>
<P><I>19 Dec 2001 : Column: 522W</I><P>
gathered by Housing Services Agency (HSA) shows that in London during 2000&#150;01 the contact and assessment teams (CATs) contacted some 609 (17 per cent.) rough sleepers or former rough sleepers who are over 50-years-old.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para17">Information gathered by Housing Services Agency shows that in London during 2000&#150;01 there were 26 moves into permanent accommodation and 319 moves into temporary accommodation, including 180 moves into hostel accommodation by rough sleepers aged over 50 years. Due to the nature of rough sleeping some people will be recorded more than once in these figures as they may have been moved into a hostel, or other temporary accommodation, more than once during the year.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para18">Due to the way the information is collected and the fluctuating pattern of rough sleeping by some people, it is not possible to provide exact figures on the number of older rough sleepers and former rough sleepers currently sleeping rough, in hostel accommodation, in move-on accommodation, in bed and breakfast or in special needs accommodation.
<P>

<a name="11219w53.html_para19">On 30 September 2001, the total number of households being accommodated by local housing authorities in bed-and-breakfast hotels under existing homelessness legislation was 12,290 and a further 9,480 households were being accommodated in hostels. Information is not held centrally on the proportion of these that are older homeless people.

[24085]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w54.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The AAIB report on the circumstances of the emergency landing at Newcastle airport on 3 February 2001 involving the Chief Commissioner of the Metropolitan police will be published on 7 February 2002. The emergency landing was caused by the incorrect assembly of the nose landing gear retraction mechanism on the American manufactured Piper PA 34 aircraft. The sequence of events had occurred before on other aircraft of the type and the examination of the maintenance standards issues raised by this emergency landing has led to the delay in publishing the report.

 Since January 1999, increases in regulated fares have been limited to RPI-1 per cent., with performance-related arrangements also applying to London commuter operators. The Strategic Rail Authority monitor fares increases to ensure that the train operating companies keep within the permitted level. The authority has recently commissioned an independent evaluation of the success of Fares Regulation since it commenced in 1995. The study will consider how regulation has performed in practice compared to the expectations of the policy at the time. The results to this study are expected to be published in spring 2002.

 All train operating companies have performance targets in their franchise agreements which can lead to enforcement action being taken if not met. There are also targets for performance in train operating companies' Passenger's Charters which, if not met, trigger discounts to passengers renewing season tickets. In his draft franchising policy statement of 16 July the Secretary of State asked the Strategic Rail Authority to look at what could be done within existing franchise agreements, or by

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what contingency plans his Department and the SRA have made for line closures.  [23941]<P>

<P>
<a name="11219w60.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2001]:</i> There are statutory procedures prescribed in the Railways Act 1993, as amended by the Transport Act 2000, which must be followed before a full line closure can take place. There are currently no plans to take forward any new closure proposals.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions where the top six predicted road accident blackspots are; and what estimate he has made of the predicted number of deaths in each one in the next 30 year period.  [24059]<P>

<P>
<a name="11219w60.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is not possible to predict where specific accident blackspots will be in the future. Casualties at different sites vary from year to year and the numbers can be affected in particular years by major incidents which are not typical.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will make a statement on the relationship between the Civil Aviation Authority Economic Regulator and Safety Regulator, with particular reference to the means by which they communicate to ensure air safety.  [23561]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11219w60.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Directors of the Consumer Protection Group (which issues airline licences), Economic Regulation Group (ERG) and Safety Regulation Group (SRG) are all members of the Board of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). They all sit on the Executive Committee, which has responsibility for corporate governance, the approval of strategy and ensuring the development and execution of policy.

<a name="11219w60.html_para0">In the event of there being concerns about the financial viability of an air operator or an air traffic service provider, particularly where the safety of operations may be affected, arrangements are in place for this to be brought to the immediate attention of the Group Director Safety Regulation. The Safety Regulator, based on the information before him, would in turn instigate appropriate action to ensure the continued maintenance of air safety.
<P>

<a name="11219w60.html_para1">Section 2(1) of the Transport Act 2000 enshrines the paramountcy of safety by placing it ahead of other regulatory considerations for the CAA. Furthermore the CAA has set up an internal committee comprising representatives of SRG, ERG and the Directorate of Airspace Policy to exercise oversight of the air traffic services licence.
<P>

<a name="11219w60.html_para2">The primary objective of the Chairman of the CAA is to ensure that the CAA continues to promote, in an efficient and cost-effective way, high standards of safety in all aspects of civil aviation.
