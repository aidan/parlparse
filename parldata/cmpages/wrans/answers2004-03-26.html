 The Department for Transport's Chief Scientific Adviser is Professor Frank Kelly, who divides his time between this role and his position as Professor of the Mathematics of Systems at the University of Cambridge. He obtained his doctorate in 1976 from the University of Cambridge, and since then has held positions in the University's Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Mathematics.
<P>

<a name="40326w01.html_para1">Professor Kelly's research interests are in random processes, networks and optimization, and especially in applications to the design and control of networks and the understanding of congestion phenomena. He and colleagues at Cambridge developed, jointly with British Telecom, the routing scheme implemented in BT's main digital telephone network. His current research is directed at understanding methods of self-regulation in large-scale complex networks, which include both transport networks and the communication infrastructures upon which our experiences of transport increasingly depend.
<P>

<a name="40326w01.html_para2">Frank Kelly has received several prizes for his work. In 1989 he was awarded the Guy Medal in Silver of the Royal Statistical Society, and in the same year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1992 he

was awarded the Lanchester Prize of the Operations Research Society of America, he gave the 1995 Clifford Paterson Lecture of the Royal Society, the 1996 Blackett Lecture of the Operational Research Society, and was awarded the 1997 Naylor Prize of the London Mathematical Society. He received an Honorary Doctorate of Science from Heriot-Watt University in 2001.
<P>

<a name="40326w01.html_para3">Professor Kelly served as Director of the Statistical Laboratory in the University of Cambridge from 1991 to 1993. He has served on the Scientific Board of Hewlett-Packard's Basic Research Institute in Mathematical Sciences, the Scientific Council of EURANDOM, the Conseil Scientifique of France Telecom, the Council of the Royal Society and the Council of the Royal Statistical Society. He has chaired the Royal Institution/University of Cambridge Mathematics Enrichment Project, and the management committee of the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Sciences.

 This was an open competition to recruit a Chief Scientific Adviser at Senior Civil Servant Pay Band 2 level for the Department.
<P>

<a name="40326w01.html_para4">The process was managed and chaired by Alastair Macdonald, the Civil Service Commissioner. The other panel members were Lord Oxburgh, Sir David King, the Government's Chief Scientific Adviser and the previous DfT Permanent Secretary Rachael Lomax and the current Permanent DfT Secretary David Rowlands.
<P>

<a name="40326w01.html_para5">The successful candidate was Professor Frank Kelly who took up post on 1&nbsp;August 2003. It is not the Department's practice to declare the names of the other short listed candidates, as all applications are made in confidence.

 Project Angus is the construction of a new Fleet headquarters building at Whale Island, Portsmouth.

This is the final step in the Fleet First re-organisation of the Fleet headquarters which has created a better integrated and more effective Fleet headquarters and saved around &#163;10&nbsp;million a year in running costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra does not allocate funds to be spent on coastal damage compensation. Except in limited circumstances no compensation is payable to those affected by flooding or erosion, including cases where it is decided not to defend a particular area, or to undertake managed realignment. This approach, adopted by successive governments, is justified by current legislation which provides operating authorities with permissive powers to undertake flood and coastal defence works. There is no general obligation to build or maintain defences at all or to a particular standard. Consonant with this approach, the legislation also makes no provision for compensation from public funds to persons whose property or land are affected by erosion or flooding.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 On the basis of current scientific evidence, reactive culling as carried out in the Randomised Badger Culling Trial is not viable as a policy option. There are circumstances in which localised culling of badgers might be considered in the future, for example in combination with a vaccine or live test for bovine TB, but neither of these is currently available.

 Theoretically, it is possible for badgers to pass TB to other wildlife species, but the low level of incidence of the disease in species such as foxes (which can share sett space with badgers) and small rodents suggests they are not a significant risk.

 The Rural Development Service (RDS) of Defra provide grants under the England Rural Development Programme (ERDP) to farmers and land managers in the Peak District National Park to restore drystone walls and construct stiles. These grants are made through the Countryside Stewardship Scheme (CSS) or the Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESAs) scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w03.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The indirect ELISA for badgers (known as the live test) was evaluated using blood samples collected from 1982 badgers killed during statutory badger removal operations in 1991 to 1993. The sensitivity of the test was 40.7&nbsp;per cent. and the specificity 94.3&nbsp;per cent. The positive predictive value (the percentage of positive test results where the animal was confirmed as infected) of the test was 67.5&nbsp;per cent. the negative predictive value (the percentage of negative test results where the animal was confirmed as uninfected) 84.6&nbsp;per cent. A project (development of immunological assays for the detection of Mycobacterium bovis infection in badgers), funded by the Department, is investigating this area. The project is due to end in March 2005 and the final report should be available shortly afterwards.

<a name="40326w03.html_para5">Regarding the assessment of the risk that translocated badgers are not free from TB infection, it is current practice to test all candidates for translocation using the live test three times before release. If any test is positive, then that animal and members in its group are not released.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the most recently calculated rate of repeat TB breakdowns in cattle herds is in <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;England and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;Scotland.  [158414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w03.html_spnew26"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The most recent information on recurrent (repeat) TB incidents dates back to 2002. This shows that the number of confirmed new TB incidents (CNIs) in herds that had a history of CNI in the previous three years increased by 72&nbsp;per cent. between 2000 and 2002. This increase was not significantly different from the overall percentage increase in CNIs. In England, approximately 25&nbsp;per cent. of herds with a CNI in 2002 had a history of CNI in the previous three years. In contrast, none of the 27 Scottish herds affected by CNIs in 2002 had experienced a CNI in the previous three years.
<P>

<a name="40326w03.html_para16">Because of the distorted pattern of TB incidents (breakdowns) caused by the suspension of TB testing during 2001, bovine TB statistics for 2002 may not be representative of a typical year. Similar data on repeat TB breakdowns for2003 has not been collated yet.

No movements of cattle onto or off the premises of the infected herd were permitted from the time that indications of possible Brucella infection were first reported on 12&nbsp;March. The four cows and one bull which tested seropositive for brucellosis during investigations were slaughtered on 18&nbsp;March following confirmation of brucellosis that day; the remainder of the herd was slaughtered on 19&nbsp;March. Precautionary movement restrictions have also been placed on seven neighbouring herds which are currently undergoing further tests and on the herd which supplied two bulls to the farm during the preceding 12 months; no other cattle apart from seven calves from a neighbouring premises have been brought onto the farm during that time. In the last year there have been only a small number of movements off the farm, other than movements direct to slaughter. These animals are being traced and will be tested.

<a name="40326w05.html_wqn5"><B> Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the involvement of Grainseed in the conduct of the National List trials for Chardon LL in 1998 and 1999, on behalf of the British Plant Breeders Society, and their impact on the research findings.  [163206]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 A thorough evaluation of all the data used for the assessment of Chardon LL in National List trials was conducted by the independent experts on the Herbage Value for Cultivation and Use (VCU) group. The group recommended that the 1998 Grainseed data were acceptable as part of a valid assessment of the performance of Chardon LL. However, the group recommended that the 1999 Grainseed data should be excluded because of substandard plant populations. This was done and data from a reserve site used instead.
<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w05.html_wqn6"><B> Alan Simpson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what evidence she has collated, in the absence of ruminant feeding studies, that Chardon LL has added value for cultivation and use in the United Kingdom.  [163213]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The criterion for adding a variety to the UK National List is that it should, taking its qualities as a whole, represent a clear improvement compared with other forage maize varieties already on the UK List. Chardon has been assessed on this basis and found to meet the performance standards set to indicate a clear improvement in value for cultivation and use. The evidence for this is that in National List trials, Chardon's results met the improvement standards for several important characteristics. Animal feeding studies are not required for this assessment.

<a name="40326w05.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Lawrence: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will publish the results of the Reading University Chardon LL feeding studies involving broiler chickens.  [162980]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;March 2004]</i>: I am unaware of any feeding studies undertaken by Reading University involving broiler chickens and GM maize Chardon LL Publication of the results of studies carried out by the University is a matter for them and those funding the work.

<a name="40326w05.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action she is taking to ensure that illegally logged timber on board MV Greveno does not enter the United Kingdom.  [163172]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> The UK is pressing for a new EU import Regulation as part of the EU Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process. This Regulation would apply to timber imports from FLEGT partner countries. Until this Regulation is in force, Customs have no powers to prevent illegally logged timber from being imported into the UK.
<P>

<a name="40326w05.html_para7">The UK is working closely with the Government of Indonesia to control illegal logging and its associated trade. The UK Government have drawn the shipment of timber on the MV Greveno to the attention of the relevant Indonesian authorities, who will look into the issue immediately.
<P>

<a name="40326w05.html_para8">As requested by the Council of the European Union, the UK Government are also currently examining the feasibility of using national legislation, such as that related to money laundering, to deal with imports of timber that have been produced in contravention of the laws of the producer country.

<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> If too many announcements are made by oral statement at the end of Questions, Parliamentary business could be hindered.

 The Government has used the Department of Trade and Industry's updated energy projections (UEP) as a basis for calculating sectoral and installation level allocations for the power generation sector. The sector allocation is based on UEP projections of carbon dioxide less the amount the Government has decided power stations are to contribute to meeting national climate change targets and a portion to be set-aside for the New Entrants Reserve. This sectoral allocation is then allocated pro-rata to individual power stations according to historical emissions.

 <i>[holding answer 22&nbsp;March 2004]:</i> Yes.

 The Department is not aware of receiving any recent representations, on the manufacture of road fuel from waste plastics, from either the fuel industry or environmental groups. The Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) has, in the past, received inquiries on this issue. However, because WRAP'S remit is to develop markets for recycled materials, and the manufacture of road fuel from plastics does not meet the definition of recycling in the Packaging Directive (2004/12/EC), the issue has not been pursued.

 The Department is currently reviewing the permitting of waste recovery and disposal activities. Informal consultation with stakeholders has shown strong support for continuing to require applicants for permits to demonstrate technical competence, which is a feature of the current waste management licensing system. However, there was also a view that other ways of demonstrating technical competence should be introduced in addition to certificates of technical competence issued by the Waste Management Industry Training and Advisory Board. We are considering how to deliver this as part of a new permitting regime and expect to formally consult on proposals in due course.

 While not directly involved in these discussions, DFID and other Government Departments were aware of the content of the legislation as it was being drafted, and a Bank of England Secondee to the CPA was involved in the drafting process.

 Building confidence in the banking system in Iraq will take time, and will depend to a considerable extent on the quality of the legal and institutional framework in which the banking system operates.

The CPA also provides advisers to an Office of Human Rights and Transitional Justice. Assistance focuses on forensic assessment and exhumation, training for local capacity building, control of standards and missing persons. The CPA is providing over $99&nbsp;million project support to the Iraqi justice sector.

 Conditions on the delivery of mail are a licensing matter for the regulator, Postcomm. The Postal Services Act 2000, and the License granted by Postcomm under it, requires Royal Mail to make one daily delivery to every household in the United Kingdom. It does not specify the time at which this has to be made, and consequently data on delivery percentages at particular times of the day are not available. Postcomm understands from Royal Mail that the reasons for the change to a single delivery were to improve efficiency and to maintain quality of service. Royal Mail believes that addresses on rural and dedicated business delivery routes are in any case highly unlikely to be affected by the move to a single daily delivery.

 The DTI has taken a number of steps to improve SME's ability to access investment capital. These include the Regional Venture Capital Funds, UK High Technology Fund, The Community Development Venture Fund (known as the Bridges Fund), Community Investment Tax Relief, Investment Readiness Pilots and Early Growth Funds. We are currently also developing the Enterprise Capital Funds as announced in the 2003 pre-Budget report.

<a name="40326w08.html_para8">Following our review of business support the Department has built on the success of the Smart scheme and replaced it with two new products, Grant for Research and Development and Grant for Investigating an Innovative Idea. The grants available under the new products are potentially bigger than under Smart. During the last two years the number of individuals and small businesses supported annually through Smart and the new products has increased by almost 50&nbsp;per cent. In addition, the Department has also built upon the success of the Small Firms Loan Guarantee scheme by raising the amount available to manufacturing businesses and extending the scheme to new sectors such as child care and nursery education.

 Modelling carried out to support the recent Innovation Review shows the current cost of onshore wind generation as 3.1&#150;4 p/kWh expected to fall to W2.5&#150;3.2 p/kWh by 2020 and offshore wind generation as 6.0&#150;7.6 p/kWh expected to fall to W3.0&#150;4.6 p/kWh by 2020.
<P>

<a name="40326w09.html_para0">These costs are indicative and subject to variation as the economics of electricity generated from both onshore and offshore wind farms are dependent on the amount of wind at the wind farm site. Electricity generated by onshore and offshore wind farms is eligible for support under the Renewables Obligation.

<P>

 Government policy on Green Belts is set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 2 (PPG2). It remains the policy to protect Green Belts as far as can be seen ahead and boundaries must be altered only exceptionally. Decisions on the need to alter boundaries in order to accommodate development are for regional planning bodies and local planning authorities in the first instance. Any proposals for changes should be brought forward through the regional and local planning process in order to ensure that they are subject to public consultation and scrutiny.
<P>

<a name="40326w09.html_para2">It is not be possible to estimate what proportion of development in the South East will be on Green Belt land up to 2020 until new regional spatial strategies (RSS) for the East of England and the South East are issued, probably in 2006 and 2007 respectively.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was not able to identify the source of the reference to '56&nbsp;million homes'. The latest population projections by Government Actuary's Department show the UK population rising from 59&nbsp;million in 2002 to 63&nbsp;million in 2021. It is, however, the number of households that relates to homes. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's 1996 based household projections for England show household numbers rising to 24&nbsp;million in 2021 an increase of 3&nbsp;million households from 2001.

<a name="40326w09.html_para7">The latest revisions to Regional Planning Guidance now underway are looking further&#151;to 2021. Policy options will take into account the Barker Review's finding that current levels of housing supply are not sufficient. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister agrees that to deliver our commitment to stability and affordability in the housing market a significant increase in development over time is needed. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister needs to consider the scale of such development and how it can be delivered both in high demand areas and in areas suffering problems of low demand. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister also need to balance the economic case for increased development against its social and environmental implications. The need to reflect all these issues in our policies, in order to avoid the mistakes of the past, underpins our commitment to deliver, not just more housing, but sustainable communities that people want to live in.

 The UK Film Council, the Government's strategic adviser for film, has recently completed an extensive consultation on its funding and policy priorities for April 2004 to March 2007. The consultation document "Three Years On" proposes that the UK Film Council should continue to fund the British Federation of Film Societies (BFFS) at &#163;100,000 per annum until 2006&#150;07. This funding would form part of the council's substantial budget for its Distribution and Exhibition fund, which aims to promote accessibility to film across the country. This proposal is supported by the British Film Institute. The BFFS would be required to demonstrate the impact of its work in developing the diversity and range of cinema distribution and appreciation. Beyond continuation of funding, the UK Film Council has outlined plans for a fund for digital equipment for film societies, of direct benefit to constituent members of the BFFS.

<a name="40326w10.html_para6">The DCMS has received no representations from film societies within the last year, concerning funding from the UK Film Council. The UK Film Council has received one letter from BFFS, and will shortly meet the BFFS to discuss the issues raised.

In 2002 exterior stone cleaning was performed on the main buildings at a cost of &#163;120,000 in compliance with the lease. In 2003 one previously vacant floor of a satellite building was refurbished, at a cost of &#163;46,000 in order to facilitate and accommodate restructuring of part of the Department. In the same year two obsolete fire warning and alarm systems were replaced at a cost of &#163;153,000.

 We are committed to promoting the Convention in the lead up to its first Review Conference in Nairobi at the end of this year. Following a comprehensive lobbying campaign of those states not party to the Convention in 2003, Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials will be actively participating in several regional seminars and workshops aimed at promoting the Convention and increasing the number of States Parties. They include events in Vienna, Tokyo and Vilnius.

 The Government considers that the best way of combating the production, use, stockpiling or transfer of anti-personnel landmines is to persuade as many countries as possible to sign the Ottawa Convention. The United Kingdom was among the first states to ratify the Convention and we continue to urge others to do the same. During 2003 we undertook, through our diplomatic missions, a comprehensive lobbying exercise of those states not party to the Convention, urging their ratification or accession at the earliest opportunity. This exercise was part of our activities in the Ottawa Convention's Universalisation Contact Group. We have built on this exercise in 2004 with a more targeted approach and hope to use the various regional events being held in the run up to the Nairobi Review Conference to encourage non-States Parties to sign the Convention.

Progress in other spheres such as the moratorium on the use of the death penalty is welcome, but it remains to be abolished formally and implementation is thus incomplete. The situation has however deteriorated in some areas. In particular, in the level of media freedom and the effect of the State controlled media on the conduct of free and fair elections.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest 5.<P>

2. Please note that these figures for 2003&#150;04 refer only to the main payment run i.e. they do not include the late payment run figures. We estimate that there are approximately 100,000 people in Great Britain paid via late payment runs (0.8&nbsp;per cent. of all payments). However, since late payment runs are mainly in respect of non-system cases whose claim had not been received by Qualifying Week, they are heavily skewed towards men aged 60.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will publish the evidence on which the finding is based that premature death from <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;cancer has reduced by 10&nbsp;per cent. and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;coronary heart disease has reduced by 23&nbsp;per cent. since 1997, as set out in the foreword to the consultation document Choosing Health.

<a name="40326w13.html_spnew5"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 "Our Healthier Nation", the Government's overall health strategy for England, sets out targets to reduce the death rates from cancer by at least 20&nbsp;per cent., and all circulatory diseases by at least 40&nbsp;per cent., in people aged under 75 years by 2010. Progress in respect of these targets are measured against the baseline of the average of the three years 1995, 1996 and 1997.
<P>

<a name="40326w13.html_para5">The targets are monitored using mortality statistics from death registrations provided by the Office for National Statistics. The mortality rates are subsequently calculated by the Department of Health. Mortality rates are age standardised to allow for changes in the age structure of the population (using the European standard population as defined by the World Health Organisation).
<P>

<a name="40326w13.html_para6">The following tables show the three year average mortality rates for all cancers and all circulatory diseases since the baseline figure was established.

 The Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has kept the safety of HRT under constant review and provided targeted advice to women and health professionals in response to important new evidence as it has emerged.
<P>

<a name="40326w14.html_para2">Despite some weak observational evidence suggesting a possible benefit, HRT has never been licensed for the prevention of heart disease in the United Kingdom. In 2002, two large studies in the United States provided important new clinical trial information about the effect of combined oestrogen plus progestogen HRT on the risk of heart disease in women with and without a pre-existing heart condition. One of these studies further demonstrated an effect of HRT on the risk of stroke. Immediately upon publication of this study, the CSM informed health professionals and women that HRT had not been proven to be beneficial in preventing coronary heart disease and may in fact result in a small

<P><I>26 Mar 2004 : Column 1135W</I><P>
increase in the risk in the first year of use. The CSM also advised that this type of HRT causes a small increase in the risk of stroke.
<P>

<a name="40326w14.html_para3">Clear warnings about the risk of heart disease and stroke in association with combined HRT use have been agreed throughout Europe and are being included in the summary of product characteristics for health professionals and the patient information leaflet that accompanies each pack of medicine.
<P>

<a name="40326w14.html_para4">In addition, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has placed a comprehensive review of the risks (including heart disease and stroke) associated with HRT use on its website. Detailed information has also been published in the safety bulletins issued by the MHRA and the Chief Medical Officer, which are available on their respective websites.
<P>

<a name="40326w14.html_para5">The CSM's expert working group on HRT has been informed that the oestrogen-only arm of the US Women's Health Initiative trial has now found that the risk of stroke in users of this HRT preparation is increased similarly to combined HRT. These findings have not yet been published, but will be urgently considered by the CSM and its expert working group on HRT as soon as they are available. When their review is complete, the current product information will be updated as necessary and women and health care professionals will be clearly informed of the new advice.
<P>

<a name="40326w14.html_para6">The CSM advises that for the alleviation of menopausal symptoms, health professionals should prescribe the lowest effective dose of HRT for the shortest possible time and perform regular health checks on HRT users, including a reassessment of the need to continue HRT on an annual basis. The CSM also advises that for the prevention of osteoporosis, HRT should only be used by women who are intolerant of, or contraindicated for, other medicines approved for this purpose.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what consultation has been undertaken with healthcare professionals before the awarding of contracts under the National Programme for Information Technology; and if he will make a statement.  [162186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Extensive consultation has taken place with clinical representative groups, including the professional Royal Colleges, the General Medical Council, and the British Medical Council, all of whom have provided valuable input. As well as the national professional bodies and groups, the national programme for information technology (NPfIT) team has engaged closely with expert primary care practitioners, including practising general practitioners, who are there to represent and feedback issues with their professional colleagues.
<P>

<a name="40326w14.html_para7">The National Clinical Advisory Board has ensured that the wide-ranging clinical needs and requirements are reflected in the design of the NPfIT solutions and integrated into the ongoing plans of the programme. There are currently 29 full members and 12 working groups covering a variety of care settings, from cancer care to out of hours care.

<a name="40326w14.html_para8">The NPfIT to date has hosted around 400 local events, engaging managers, clinicians, allied health professionals and IT staff. Over 21,000 individuals have been involved. We are undertaking a concerted effort to ensure as many people as possible are now engaged on the local plans to prepare for phased roll out after April 2004.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health when the data on which the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency based its statement of 11&nbsp;March on dosage levels of Seroxat was first made available to the regulator.  [162491]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w15.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The advice issued by the Committee for the Safety of Medicines (CSM) on 11&nbsp;March 2004 followed a re-evaluation of the original dose finding studies carried out for the licensing of paroxetine in 1990. This forms part of the ongoing in-depth review of the safety of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), including paroxetine (Seroxat), by the CSM's expert working group on the safety of SSRIs.
<P>

<a name="40326w15.html_para0">The expert group initially reviewed one of the dose finding studies for paroxetine in October 2003. On the advice of the expert group, the manufacturer was then asked to provide data to justify the current dosing recommendations for all indications as part of the European review of the risks and benefits of paroxetine. The expert group reviewed all the information available at its meeting on 27&nbsp;February 2004.
<P>

<a name="40326w15.html_para1">On 10&nbsp;March 2004, the CSM endorsed the advice of its expert group and advised that public communication was necessary on the basis of the re-evaluation of clinical trial data and the evidence of prescribing of paroxetine outside of the recommendations in the summary of product characteristics, in particular the use of starting doses above 20 mg in the treatment of depression.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on primary care trust provision of mental health services.  [163222]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w15.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 Primary care trusts have a crucial role to play in both the commissioning and provision of mental health services. We know that up to one in four primary care consultations concerns a mental health problem and many people receive all their mental health care and treatment from their general practitioner.
<P>

<a name="40326w15.html_para2">In recognition of the importance of primary mental health care, the National Service Framework for Mental Health (1999) set two standards to deliver better services and to ensure the provision of consistent advice and help for people with mental health needs in primary care.
<P>

<a name="40326w15.html_para3">The NHS Plan (2000) set targets to put in place 1,000 graduate primary care mental health workers and 500 new community mental health staff by December 2004. The National Institute for Mental Health in England has established a work programme on primary care mental health.

<a name="40326w15.html_para4">These developments are complemented with investment in improving GP premises and increasing the number of GP registrars. Last year, the NHS Plan target to put in place 550 GP registrars by March 2004 was met more than nine months early and we now have 637 more GP registrars in post than in 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans the Government has to designate a single body to co-ordinate work across government in tackling obesity.  [163600]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="40326w15.html_spnew2"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Department takes the lead on work to tackle obesity. However, the Department cannot tackle obesity alone. Cross-governmental working is essential. The Government launched their major consultation on public health this month. The Public Health White Paper will provide the overarching framework to improve public health and will present real opportunities to progress work on the prevention and management of overweight and obesity.
<P>

<a name="40326w15.html_para5">The consultation will enable a wide range of stakeholders to contribute to the debate on overweight and obesity. This will build on the work already started through the food and health action plan and the activity co-ordination team. The Government will draw up their White Paper in the light of the consultation.
