<P>
<a name="20415w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Over the years 1997 to 2001 taken together, the Child Support Agency has met the majority of its targets. It is on course to meet all of its targets this year.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans he has to encourage companies to retain existing final salaries pension schemes and to make them available to new employees; and if he will make a statement.  [45027]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 We welcome the fact that many employers continue to provide occupational pensions on a voluntary basis to their employees. Final salary and money purchase schemes can both provide good incomes in retirement as long as sufficient contributions are made. When deciding what type of scheme to offer, an employer must take into account the costs of doing so and the long-term impact on their business. The Government want to create an environment in which employers can continue to provide occupational pension schemes. We want to remove unnecessary burdens on schemes. As part of this we have announced the replacement of the Minimum Funding Requirement. We have already introduced interim changes to the MFR designed to enable it to operate more effectively. We have commissioned Alan Pickering to report in summer 2002 on ways to simplify the overall burden of regulation on schemes and will be publishing proposals later this year.

19. <a name="20415w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Stunell: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on his plans to reform the housing benefit system.  [45030]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w01.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 We have a comprehensive long-term strategy for reforming housing benefit and dealing with the legacy of neglect we have inherited.
<P>

<a name="20415w01.html_para0">Work is already well under way to radically improve HB administration and bear down on fraud. Many of the key measures set out in our response to consultation on the Housing Green Paper have already been implemented. For example, we have launched comprehensive new performance standards, reformed the extended payments scheme to provide better work incentives, reformed the single room rent, and are making housing benefit easier to administer.

20. <a name="20415w01.html_wqn3"><B> Dr. Pugh: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what percentage of new deal leavers have entered sustained unsubsidised jobs.  [45031]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Up to January 2002, 56 per cent. of young people leaving the new deal for known destinations entered sustained, unsubsidised jobs. In addition, research shows that an equivalent proportion of those leaving for unknown destinations also move into work.

<P>
31. <a name="20415w01.html_wqn4"><B> Linda Gilroy: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the New Deal for Lone Parents.  [45045]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The New Deal for Lone Parents is a long-term investment, making a real difference to the lives of lone parents and their children. Over 300,000 lone parents have benefited from the help and support offered through the new deal, and over 130,000 of these have found work.

21. <a name="20415w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Flight: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many of the Government's target group have taken out stakeholder pensions.  [45032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Comprehensive information is not yet available (and will not be until the end of the current tax year). However, early figures from the Association of British Insurers (ABI), based on a limited sample of information from pension providers, show that in cases where earnings of purchasers are known to providers, then the majority of them have earnings of between &#163;10,000 and &#163;30,000 a year. ABI figures also show that 320,000 employers have designated a stakeholder pension scheme for their workforces as at the end of February 2002; representing a compliance rate of over 85 per cent., and over 750,000 people have bought a stakeholder pension.

<P>
22. <a name="20415w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the number of pensioners living in poverty in <i>(a)</i> 1997 and <i>(b)</i> at the latest date for which figures are available.  [45033]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Poverty and social exclusion are complex concepts, affecting many aspects of people's lives; including their living standards, health, housing and quality of environment. The third "Opportunity for all" report sets out the Governments strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents the latest information on the indicators used to monitor progress against this strategy.
<P>

<a name="20415w01.html_para2">The Government's first priority was to address the immediate problem of pensioner poverty today. That is why we introduced the Minimum Income Guarantee (MIG) in April 1999 to provide money for the poorest pensioners as quickly as possible. 2,200 pensioners in the Cotswold constituency are receiving the MIG and over 2 million pensioners nationally benefit from the MIG.




<P>
<P><I>15 Apr 2002 : Column 695W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20415w01.html_para3">This Government has also introduced measures to ensure that all pensioners share in rising prosperity. From this April the basic state pension has risen by &#163;3 a week for single pensioners and &#163;4.80 for couples above inflation increases last year.
<P>

<a name="20415w01.html_para4">This is in addition to the introduction of winter fuel payments, currently &#163;200, made to over 11 million pensioners and free TV licences for the over 75s which benefit some 3 million pensioners.
<P>

<a name="20415w01.html_para5">From 2003 the pension credit will reward those who have worked hard and saved hard.
<P>

<a name="20415w01.html_para6">We are also committed to tackling the longer term issues by helping people build up good second pensions. To this end we have introduced stakeholder pensions and improved the state earnings related pension scheme through the introduction of the state second pension. This will boost the additional state pension entitlement of &#163;14 million low and moderate earners. Additionally, for the first time 2 million carers and 2 million people whose working lives are disrupted by long-term illness or disability will also be able to build up entitlement to the state second pension.

23. <a name="20415w01.html_wqn7"><B> Paul Flynn: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what plans he has to restore the link between the basic pension and earnings.  [45035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Restoring the earnings link does nothing to help poorer pensioners. We will be spending an extra &#163;6 billion a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of policies introduced since 1997. This includes &#163;2.5 billion more on the poorest third of pensioners. This is three times more than an earnings link since 1998 would have given them.
<P>

<a name="20415w01.html_para7">Increases in the basic state pension over the last two years have given single pensioners &#163;2.10 a week more than an earnings link would have given them and &#163;3.35 more for couples.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Government is committed to improving the position of older people in our society. This is an issue that is relevant not only to my Department but also to others across Government.
<P>

<a name="20415w01.html_para8">The Government's strategy is co-ordinated by a Cabinet sub-committee of Ministers from several Departments, chaired by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State. The strategy consists of five main strands: encouraging and enabling active aging, promoting age diversity, tackling pensioner poverty for today's and future pensioners, maintaining and supporting independence in later life and working in partnership with older people to provide better services focused on the needs of individuals.
<P>

<a name="20415w01.html_para9">We will publish a report later this year that will show how the Government's strategy is helping to ensure that later life is a time of opportunity for older people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 Jobcentre Plus was launched as a national organisation on 1 April, replacing the former Employment Service and the working age functions of the Benefits Agency, and providing services to around 5 million people. The agency's business plan for 2002&#150;03, a copy of which is available in the Library, sets out the organisation's aims and priorities for its first 12 months, including opening around a further 225 fully integrated offices by April 2003.

 We have introduced a wide range of measures to help people with disabilities secure work where they are ready and able to do so.
<P>

<a name="20415w02.html_para0">We have improved the permitted work rules in incapacity benefit to make it easier for people to make the first moves into work. Over 8,200 people have already been helped into work through the new deal for disabled people pilots. Building on that success we now have a national network of job brokers from the public, private and voluntary sectors who work closely with employers, voluntary groups and health services to help people with health conditions and disabilities move into work. Later this year we are also introducing the job retention and rehabilitation pilots to test the effectiveness of making co-ordinated, earlier health and/or employment interventions to help people who become sick or disabled to stay in work.
<P>

<a name="20415w02.html_para1">Disability employment advisers continue to provide specialist support to disabled jobseekers, and disabled employees and their employers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w02.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 It is not possible to state the exact number. We estimate, extrapolating from the results of the Area Benefit Reviews, that there were 204,000 cases of fraud in income support in 2000&#150;01.

 We have a target to reduce losses from fraud and error in income support and jobseeker's allowance by 25 per cent. by 2004 and by 50 per cent. by 2006. We have already achieved an 18 per cent. reduction.
<P>

<a name="20415w02.html_para4">From this month we are beginning to use new powers in the Fraud Act 2001 that make it easier to catch fraudsters and give greater punishments to those who persistently abuse the system.

 The state second pension reformed the state earnings-related pension scheme (SERPS) on 6 April 2002. It will boost the additional state pension entitlement of 14 million low and moderate earners.

 The Department believes that employment is the best way out of poverty and our Welfare to Work initiatives are helping people move into work in all parts of the country. The new deals have already helped over 600,000 people into jobs, including over 700 in the hon. Member's constituency.

<a name="20415w03.html_para2">We do recognise that there are some geographical areas that lag significantly behind the national average in terms of work outcomes. The departmental neighbourhood renewal strategy aims to improve the aggregate employment rate for the 30 local authorities with the poorest initial labour market position. The City of Westminster is not one of these 30 areas and so we are not currently administering any area-based poverty initiatives in this area. However, these constituents still have access to our range of national welfare to work initiatives available through Jobcentre Plus.

<P>
<a name="20415w03.html_spnew5"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 We are mindful of the needs of people with disabilities, that is why the Government have taken steps to provide help towards the extra costs that people with disabilities may have, through Disability Living Allowance and the disability premiums in income-related benefits. This could include heating costs. Most people over 60, including many who are disabled, are entitled to winter fuel payments.

<P>
<a name="20415w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Ageist employment practices are bad for employers, older workers and society. The cost of the fall in employment of the over 50s is estimated to be in the range of &#163;16 billion to &#163;31 billion per year in lost gross domestic product. The Department for Work and Pensions is promoting the business case for non-ageist employment practices to all employers and individuals across Great Britain through our Age Positive campaign.
<P>

<a name="20415w03.html_para3">The introduction of the employment-related age discrimination legislation, and the consultations on its development, are the responsibility of my right hon.

 We believe that support for children must come first. None the less we recognise that there are many calls on the finances of non-resident parents. The standard percentage rates for child support maintenance in the new scheme reflect those other demands. Any attempt to reflect the specific costs of each person would lead to the reintroduction of an overly complex scheme.
<P>

<a name="20415w03.html_para5">The judgment rate is the statutory interest rate. It is set in England and Wales by the Lord Chancellor and in Scotland by the Lord President of the Court of Session.

 The Government are committed to ensuring people are properly informed in order to make decisions about saving for their retirement and the "Pensions Education" publicity campaign is a major part of this strategy. Results so far are encouraging&#151;since the campaign started in January 2001 it has provoked more than 1.1 million responses and almost 1.4 million information guides have been sent out. Changing attitudes towards planning for retirement will inevitably take time.

<P>
<a name="20415w03.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The issue of EU level solvency requirements for pension funds is being considered as part of the proposed directive on occupational pension schemes. Any impact on UK schemes would depend on the details of the requirements. We are working to ensure that the final version of the directive is consistent with UK pension arrangements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) what overseas facilities are run by the British Army's Training Estates Division; and in which countries the facilities are located;  [47617]
<P>
<UL>(2) which military and security forces have received training within the British Army's Training Estates Division overseas facilities since 2 May 1997; which countries were involved; what types of training were provided; and how many personnel were trained;  [47616]
<P>
(3) what human rights criteria are used to assess which military and security personnel are eligible to receive training within the British Army's Training Estates Division overseas facilities.  [47618]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Army Estates's Division is responsible for managing UK training areas only. Part of the Army's Land Warfare Centre (LWC) (formerly Training Support Command (Land)) has responsibility for the conduct of some overseas training. The LWC conducts training at four overseas facilities. These are in Germany, Canada, Belize and Kenya. In addition, the Field Army maintains a facility in Brunei, though this is not part of the LWC training estate. I should point out that the arrangements under which we use these facilities are different in every country and we are not responsible for the "running" of all the facilities in question.
<P>

<a name="20415w04.html_para4">Since 1997 large numbers of British units have trained at these facilities but details are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Foreign military personnel on attachment to British units and foreign observers have also participated in British exercises, but once again, details are not held centrally and could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="20415w04.html_para5">The LWC does offer jungle warfare training to members of foreign forces at its facilities in Belize. Since 1997 a total of 18 students have participated in this training, 12 from the Netherlands and six from the Ukraine.
<P>

<a name="20415w04.html_para6">In terms of formed foreign units that use the overseas facilities, certain NATO countries are permitted to conduct training at the facilities that the LWC operate in Germany under arrangements contained within the NATO Status of Forces Agreement (SOFA). This agreement in itself authorises the UK to manage facilities which are owned by the German Federal Government. In summary, the countries whose forces are permitted to train at these UK managed facilities are Belgium, Canada, France, the Netherlands, the USA and of course Germany itself. Since 1997, the formed foreign units that have trained here are Bundeswehr Units (31 Airborne Brigade, 313 Infantry Parachute Battalion, 272 Airborne Attack Defence Battalion, Seven Armoured Recognisance Battalion, 270 Airborne Supplies Company); German Specialist Units (GSG and SEK (German Civil Police Special Operations)); Belgian Units (two (BE) Commando Battalion, Regiment Beveijing&#151;five Linie, Regiment De Chasseurs Ardennais and one BE Parachute); Dutch Units (108 Company (Special Forces) and HQ 11 Air 



<P>
<P><I>15 Apr 2002 : Column 707W</I><P>
Mobile Brigade); United States Units (75th Rangers) and multinational formations conducting Allied Rapid Reaction Corps training.
<P>

<a name="20415w04.html_para7">Because of the different arrangements that prevail, if forces from foreign nations wish to use the facilities that LWC use in Canada, Belize and Kenya, that would be matter for agreement between that country and the respective host nation. This would also apply if a country other than those specified in the SOFA wished to train on the British managed facilities in Germany.
<P>

<a name="20415w04.html_para8">The Ministry of Defence continues to play a role in fostering human rights through the Defence Diplomacy Mission which aims to dispel hostility, build and maintain trust and assist in the development of democratically accountable armed forces thereby making a significant contribution to conflict prevention. A key contribution to the fulfilment of this mission is provided by military training. Details of the Defence Diplomacy Mission including its objectives and scope is published in the MOD Policy Paper No 1; Defence Diplomacy (2001) a copy of which is in the Library of the House.

 The Strategic Defence Review did not set a figure for the size of the Army. A decision was made, however, to increase the Army's manpower requirement by some 3,300 posts to reflect the inclusion of a sixth deployable brigade and a second line of communication. It remains our intention to man the Army to achieve this, although the overall manpower requirement is dynamic and subject to continuing review in light of evolving doctrine, new technology and equipment and possible changes to the operating environment.

<a name="20415w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Defence Vetting Agency is the largest government organisation carrying out national security checks on people to allow them to be employed in jobs involving access to sensitive information or assets. These jobs range throughout the Ministry of Defence and armed services, a number of other Government Departments, and defence contractor companies. This year will see the Agency emerge from a challenging modernisation and rationalisation programme that started soon after it was created in 1997. The completion of the programme will create a much more responsive, integrated organisation, able to exploit the capabilities of modern information technology to the benefit of its customers. The chief executive has been set the following key targets.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he expects HMS Albion to be fully operational; what refit would be necessary to keep HMS Fearless in operation for one more year; how much it would cost; whether he has considered recommissioning HMS Intrepid; whether he foresees any need for CPD capability in the next 12 months; and what contingency plans he has in place.  [46971]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 On current plans, HMS Albion will be available for operational tasking early in 2003, and she is expected to be fully operational by mid 2003. HMS Fearless would have needed to undergo and assisted maintenance period at an estimated cost of about &#163;1.5 million to allow her to continue in service for a year beyond her decommissioning date. The assisted maintenance period represented the minimum package of 



<P>
<P><I>15 Apr 2002 : Column 714W</I><P>
work required to keep HMS Fearless in service. Given the age of the vessel, the possibility of additional unplanned repair during this period could not be ruled out. The cost of re-commissioning HMS Intrepid, the sister ship of HMS Fearless, which last put to sea in 1994, would greatly exceed the cost of HMS Fearless's foregone assisted maintenance period. It would not therefore make financial sense to re-commission HMS Intrepid.
<P>

<a name="20415w06.html_para5">The requirement for a docking and heavy lift capability needs to be considered in the prevailing operational context at any particular time. Our assessment is that until HMS Albion enters service, the circumstances in which it is most likely that the UK wold be involved in an operation requiring a dedicated amphibious assault capability would be where we were acting as part of a coalition force. In such a scenario, depending on the requirements of the operation, a docking and heavy lift capability could be provided from within the forces of our coalition partners to enhance the UK's specialist amphibious capabilities of HMS Ocean and the five landing ships logistic. HMS Ocean is available for amphibious force tasking until October this year when she is due, on current plans, to commence a docking period before she again becomes available for tasking early in 2003. However until HMS Albion enters service, the amphibious assault capability will, if operational imperatives dictate, be filled in part by other platforms.

 At the talks at Weston Park last summer, both the Irish and UK Governments recognised that there is an issue to be addressed, with the completion of the early release scheme, about supporters of organisations now on ceasefire against whom there are outstanding prosecutions, and in some cases extradition proceedings, for offences committed before 10 April 1998. Such people would, if convicted, stand to benefit from the early release scheme. The Governments accept that it would be a natural development of the scheme for such prosecutions not to be pursued. Consideration continues of the best way to discharge this commitment.

 Vision 2020 is a draft document, which was published by the Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1999 setting out a series of goals, including the eradication of poverty in the state in 20 years. In 2000, we initiated a discussion with the Government of Andhra Pradesh and others, including civil society, about how best to deploy our resources so that they contributed most effectively to poverty reduction in the state. This resulted in a DFID strategy paper for Andhra Pradesh, which sets out our approach to assisting in the elimination of poverty in the state by working towards five priorities. A copy of the strategy in the Library of both Houses.

 There are approximately three million Palestinians living in the West Bank Gaza Strip, nearly half of whom are registered refugees. Following three consecutive years of rising real per capita income from 1997 to 2000, the Palestinian economy has been hit hard by the conflict. Surveys have barely been able to keep up with the level of damage inflicted on the Palestinian economy since the start of the Intifada in 2000. Damage to infrastructure, loss of life and strict closure activities has led to a dramatic decline in economic activity, particularly as Palestinians have been denied access to their jobs over the Israeli border. During 2001, it is estimated that GNI had declined by 12&#150;15 per cent., unemployment risen by up to 50 per cent., and the numbers of people living below of the poverty (US$2 a day) increased to 50 per cent..

<P>

<a name="20415w10.html_para1">We are working with others to try to determine the full extent of the damage and the humanitarian consequences. But international efforts remain hampered by restricted access. It is clear that there will be no improvements in the situation without an end to violence and a return to negotiations.

<a name="20415w10.html_para2">I have kept our programme of development assistance under close review. The long-term goal remains unchanged&#151;the establishment of a viable Palestinian State, which can co-exist peacefully with Israel. The strategy also remains valid: to provide help for immediate and emergency needs while at the same time working for longer-term sustainable and institutional development.
<P>

<a name="20415w10.html_para3">The economic and social decline over the past 18 months has required a review of the balance between longer-term goals and urgent needs. We have sought to provide emergency assistance in ways that can contribute to sustainable development. As soon as possible we will work for a rapid assessment of the current situation and set priorities for action so that all agencies can respond in a co-ordinated and effective manner.
<P>

<a name="20415w10.html_para4">DFID is committed to support the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNWRA) in meeting the needs of Palestinian refugees. We have steadily increased our financial and technical support to UNRWA, from &#163;6 million in 1997 to &#163;35 million in 2001, in response to the rising needs. I am in contact with Commissioner General Peter Hansen about the impact of the Israeli Defence Force incursions to many UNRWA camps, and what additional support is required for urgent actions. We have provided &#163;5 million for the 2002 Emergency Appeal and will consider urgently what further support we can give, on top of our planned contribution for this year to UNRWA's core activities.
<P>

<a name="20415w10.html_para5">It is hard to quantify the impact of violence on UK development assistance. Closures and violence have adversely affected all programmes. It has proved difficult for international staff to travel to the region. In addition, closures and violence have hindered the movement of project staff. Prior to the recent incursions, we were confident that projects would meet their goals, albeit in a longer time period. We will need to look afresh at the impact on our programmes of recent intense incursions.

 2001&#150;02 is the latest year for which specific funding figures on adult education are available: the LSC made available &#163;17.8 million in grant to inner London education authorities in that year. Prior to this, it was for each authority to decide how much of its education SSA it wished to spend to promote services for adult education: total education SSA for the inner London authorities was &#163;1,187 million for 1999&#150;2000 and &#163;1,248 million for 2000&#150;01. 'Adult Education' is interpreted as the local education authority secured adult education sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans he has to reduce the incidence of rough sleeping in rural settlements with populations under 3,000; and if he will make a statement.  [46454]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w11.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Recorded levels of rough sleeping in small rural settlements are not high. On 3 December 2001 the Prime Minister announced that the Rough Sleepers Unit had achieved its target of reducing rough sleeping by at least two-thirds by 2002.
<P>

<a name="20415w11.html_para1">The latest published rough sleeping figures for England show that all local authority areas containing rural settlements with populations under 3,000 returned either a count of less than 10 rough sleepers or an estimate of 0&#150;10.
<P>

<a name="20415w11.html_para2">On 13 March the DTLR launched "More than a roof", the Government's new approach to tackling homelessness, which has sustaining the two-thirds reduction in rough sleeping as one of its key objectives.
<P>

<a name="20415w11.html_para3">Many former rough sleepers have now moved into shelters, hostels and their own homes as part of their move to an independent lifestyle, but many still need help to rebuild their lives away from the streets. It is also vital that we continue to prevent those vulnerable to rough sleeping from hitting the streets in the first place and that those still on the streets receive the help they need to come inside.
<P>

<a name="20415w11.html_para4">The DTLR will invest over &#163;30 million during 2002&#150;03 to support local strategies around the country to ensure the two thirds reduction is sustained&#151;the same level of revenue funding that led to the Rough Sleepers Unit meeting its target.
<P>

<a name="20415w11.html_para5">The new Homelessness Act will also bring about radical change in the way that central and local government, and all other partners, work together to tackle homelessness in all parts of the country including rural areas. For the first time ever, local authorities will be required to carry out a review and develop a strategy for their area that prevents homelessness and provides solutions for people who are, or who may become, homeless.

<UL>(2) when instituting a non-statutory public inquiry, pursuant to the arrangements set out in Part IV of the memorandum attached to DOE circular 18/84, what format he would expect such an inquiry to take; and if he would expect providers of local services and members of the local community to be able to give evidence.  [48936]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w11.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 DOE circular 18/84 makes it clear that the method of written representations will be suitable for most cases. But where there is evidence of interest by other parties the dispute may be resolved by either a meeting of the representatives of the local planning authority and the developing Department or through a non-statutory public local inquiry. Planning inquiries for cases decided by the Secretary of State follow the Town and Country Planning (Inquiries Procedure) (England) Rules 2000. But an inquiry held under the arrangements set out in DOE circular 18/84 is non-statutory and so it is not bound by these rules. However, it is expected that any such inquiry would follow the spirit of these rules so far as practicable and that interested parties would be given an opportunity to express their views.

 The Government would like to liberalise the UK-US aviation market in a way that would allow UK airlines to be able to compete with US airlines on fair terms. We are reviewing the policy options for achieving that objective.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w12.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Slot allocation is governed by European Regulation 95/93. The Commission issued a proposal to amend this regulation in June 2001. This proposal is being carefully considered following consultation with the UK aviation industry. The UK's objective is to ensure the most efficient use of scarce airport infrastructure.

<a name="20415w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 It is too early for meaningful estimates to be made. However, to date 50 groups of companies have been approved by the Inland Revenue for entry into tonnage tax. These 50 groups, and eight more, have received approval from the DTLR of their training commitments. This equates to about 509 officer training places.

<a name="20415w13.html_para0">We believe that recent changes we have made to the Support for Maritime Training (SMarT) scheme, together with the tonnage tax training commitments, will lead to a significant increase in seafarer recruitment.

<a name="20415w13.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Where a highway authority chooses to impose overstay charges on utility companies, under section 74 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, the authority can keep the moneys received to meet the cost of operating the charging scheme and can spend any surplus on developing policies for the promotion and encouragement of safe, integrated, efficient and economic

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 10 April a package of measures that the Government had taken to deal with the problem of abandoned vehicles. New regulations came into effect on 9 April to reduce the notice periods after which abandoned vehicles could be removed and disposed of. It is now possible where vehicles of no value have been abandoned on the highway for a local authority to remove and dispose of them on the termination of a 24 hour notice. In addition, measures were announced to promote joint working between local authorities and the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency.
<P>

 The Transport Act 2000 repealed the part of the Channel Tunnel Act 1987 concerning regional passenger services and, as of 2001, the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) has a duty under S206(4) of the Transport Act 2000 to formulate a strategy for British passenger services through the Channel Tunnel.

 No special assessments of the quarrying industry have been made in order to determine the number of operational sites and the number of full-time employees. Each year, we conduct a survey of quarrying known as the Annual Minerals Raised Inquiry, which is sent to all quarries having extant planning permission, for the purpose of determining the amount of material being quarried. Over the period 1990 to 2000, the number of such quarries dealing with either stone or sand and gravel declined slightly from around 1,780 to around 1,710. However, over the same period, the number of people present within quarries and covered by the provisions of the Mines and Quarries Acts 1954 and 1969 declined in these quarries by some 40 per cent. from around 31,500 to around 18,000.

 There is no requirement on companies to record British direct investment overseas on a project basis and there is no organisation in Japan that records inward investment in the way that Invest.UK does for the UK.

The dramatic increase in investment in 1999 and 2000 is probably accounted for by investments by Vodafone and Cable and Wireless.

 The Government said last year, following recommendations from the Low Pay Commission, that it would consider the economic circumstances at the time before deciding whether to increase the main and development rates of the minimum wage by 10 pence/hour in October 2002, to &#163;4.20 and &#163;3.60 respectively.

We have concluded that conditions in the autumn of 2002 can be expected to support increases of 10 pence/hour and will therefore make regulations implementing these increases later this year. We have placed a short paper on this subject in the Libraries of the House.

 No complaints made against officers involved in Operation Helios have been referred by the Metropolitan police service to the Police Complaints Authority for supervision. The Authority has not formally asked for a referral. However, the Authority has suggested to the Metropolitan police that it might be appropriate for any complaint accepted by the police in relation to this investigation to be referred voluntarily.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what measures are being taken to tackle knife crime.  [43420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are committed to ensuring that violent offenders are punished effectively. Severe penalties are available to the courts to deal with offenders who carry knives. For instance, any person who has an article with a blade or point in a public place or on school premises can be sent to prison for up to two years. It is also an offence for any person to have an offensive weapon in a public place or on school premises, or for any person to sell knives to people under 16.
<P>

<a name="20415w19.html_para0">The police give high priority to action against knife crime. For example, the Metropolitan police are using an intelligence-led approach in exercising their powers to stop and search people who they believe may be carrying knives, and are working with door staff to tackle the problem at licensed premises. Largely as a result of these initiatives, the Metropolitan police have arrested and charged 17.8 per cent. more people for carrying knives and offensive weapons over the year to February 2002 than in the previous year.

There was a change in counting rules for recorded crime on 1 April 1998, which was estimated to have increased the total number of criminal damage offences recorded over England and Wales as a whole by 5 per cent. Numbers of recorded crimes after this date are therefore not directly comparable with previous years.

Under proposals in the Police Reform Bill, the British Transport police will be able to apply directly to the courts for Anti Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) in order for them to deal more effectively with particular problems of anti-social behaviour. It is also proposed to give criminal courts powers to place restrictions through ASBOs on the actions of offenders imprisoned for anti-social behaviour related offences once they are back in the community.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The recently published White Paper "Policing a New Century: A Blueprint for Reform", reaffirmed the Government's view that one of the priorities for the police service is to manage ill-health retirement effectively. The Police Negotiating Board are considering ways to deliver a fair and more consistent approach towards early retirement due to ill health. This should enable forces to reduce the level of ill-health retirement and match the performance of the best quartile of forces by 2005. The measures under consideration include the Police Negotiating Board issuing joint guidance to police authorities and senior management to ensure that wherever possible officers continue in employment where they are capable of performing sufficient duties to make their retention operationally justifiable.

The new Recovered Assets Fund, which has replaced CAF, and other measures, including the Proceeds of Crime Bill now under consideration by Parliament, will enable more criminal assets to be seized and recycled back into the community.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many cases of trafficking in people were identified in each year since 1997; and what enforcement action was taken <i>(a)</i> against the victims of trafficking and <i>(b)</i> against the organisers and beneficiaries of trafficking.  [44709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Forming an accurate estimate of the levels of trafficking in people is problematic due to the hidden nature of the act. There is currently no accurate, reliable data in existence with the United Kingdom or the European Union. A Home Office research study "Stopping Traffic" published in 2000, indicated that the number of women and children trafficked into the United Kingdom for the purposes of sexual exploitation was likely to be in the range of 140 to 1,400 per annum.
<P>

<a name="20415w20.html_para4">As there is at present no specific offence of trafficking, the police and other law enforcement agencies are not able to say how many organisers and beneficiaries of trafficking have been investigated, arrested or prosecuted. However, we are introducing a new stopgap offence of trafficking for prostitution in the forthcoming Nationality Immigration and Asylum Bill, which will carry a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment. We will follow the stopgap offence with further legislation to cover those being trafficked for both labour and sexual exploitation. These offences will go wider than is possible in the immigration legislation and will cover people who are trafficked within the United Kingdom, as well as those who are brought here from abroad. The Government's aim is to tackle the organised criminal groups who are behind the trafficking, not the victims of this heinous trade.

<a name="20415w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Home Department has set out its strategy on trafficking in the recently published White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Haven", comprising our plans on legislation, enforcement, international co-operation and prevention and support for victims. Trafficking of people involves arranging their movement for the purposes of exploitation. The exploitation may take the form of bonded labour or servitude, or commercial sexual exploitation. It is often accompanied by violence, or threats of violence, against the victim, or their family. Trafficking is often associated with illegal immigration but does not necessarily involve crossing a frontier. Our strategy takes account of those who are trafficked into and throughout the United Kingdom, as well as those trafficked within the country.
<P>

<a name="20415w20.html_para5">We recognise the need to offer the victims of trafficking particular support to help them escape their circumstances, and facilitate them to assist law enforcement to tackle organised criminal gangs behind the trafficking. We will make special arrangements for their protection and support. Where victims are not entitled to remain in the United Kingdom, we will consider whether it is appropriate to allow them to stay here. If they wish to return home, we will work with the voluntary sector to help them do so, provide initial counselling and ensure they have suitable accommodation to return to and to help them reintegrate in to their own community. The White Paper also sets out our intention to develop a best practice "toolkit" on victims of trafficking, which will act as a guide for immigration officers, police and others potentially dealing with victims of this heinous crime.

 No. The text of "Mein Kampf" in English translation has been freely available in the United Kingdom for many years. It has served as a means of understanding the background to a particular period in European history and the terrible crimes that were committed by the Nazis. However, if anyone believes that there is anything in this particular translation that falls foul of the law, they should of course report the matter to the police.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to the answer of 9 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 492W, on the European Crime Convention, if he will make a statement on the outcome of consideration as to the practical implications for banks.  [44793]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w20.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The practical implications for banks of the 2001 Protocol to the 2000 European Union Mutual Legal Assistance Convention (which the hon. and learned Member for Dudley, North (Ross Cranston) has referred to as the European Crime Convention) are very similar to the existing provisions on customer information in the Terrorism Act 2000 and the provisions on customer information orders and account monitoring orders contained in the draft Proceeds of Crime Bill. The Government's current view is that the mechanism to be used to obtain information in response to requests for these orders made under the Protocol will resemble that used to obtain similar types of information under the Terrorism Act and the relevant provisions of the draft Proceeds of Crime Bill. Accordingly, the costs per order are expected to be comparable to those identified by the Regulatory Impact Assessment conducted for that Bill. A separate Regulatory Impact Assessment for this Protocol will be carried out.
<P>

<a name="20415w20.html_para7">The key difference between the measures in the Terrorism Act and the Proceeds of Crime Bill and the Protocol is scope. The Protocol covers a wider range of serious crimes. Banks will therefore be expected to provide information in relation to slightly different types of criminal investigation.

 The requirement for the police to destroy fingerprint and DNA samples taken from suspects later released was amended by Article 82 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001 which allows the police discretion to retain these samples. DNA provides an important tool in the fight against serious crime and in particular offences of violence against the person. The Government are pleased that the Court has upheld its view that the law strikes a fair balance between the interests of the individual, the victims of crime and society as a whole. The court's decision will allow the police to continue to make best use of this important scientific technology in the fight against crime.

 The Government accepted in full the conclusions of the Competition Commission report into the supply of banking services to SMEs in the UK and have asked the Director General of Fair Trading to seek undertakings from the eight main clearing banks to implement the remedies suggested. The majority of those remedies will apply through the UK and are designed to improve competition in this market. In addition the Competition Commission found evidence of excess profits for the four largest clearing banks in England and Wales, but not in Scotland or Northern Ireland. Consequently, their recommendation that banks should be required to offer interest or free banking to SMEs will apply only in England and Wales.

By 2004, these organisations will receive 75 per cent. of the NHS budget to enable them to do so effectively, which constitutes considerable devolution in the running of the NHS. As

 A consultation document on whether or not to fortify wheat flour with folic acid was issued in July 2000 jointly by the Health Departments and the Food Standards Agency (FSA). This was based on the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (2000) conclusion that fortification of wheat flour with folic acid would help reduce the number of births affected by neural tube defects.

<a name="20415w25.html_para3">The consultation responses have been analysed and the summary of responses posted on the Department's website. The majority of respondents were in favour of fortification although this was not overwhelming (59 per cent.).

 The "in vitro" diagnostic medical device (IVD) regulations (SI2000 No. 1315) ensure that IVDs that have a specific medical purpose meet relevant essential safety, quality and performance requirements before being placed on the market with a CE mark. The regulations came into force on 7 June 2000 with a transition period until December 2003. During this time, manufacturers may choose on which basis to place their device on the market. The regulations require that manufacturers of IVDs bearing the CE mark must be able to demonstrate that the device will achieve the manufacturer's claimed performance.
<P>

<a name="20415w25.html_para5">The Department has published two voluntary codes of practice and guidance for genetic tests being sold directly to the public. These set out broad requirements in areas such as: peer-reviewed evidence of value, accreditation and quality assurance in testing laboratories, consent, confidentiality, sample and information storage, and customer information. Under the "Code of Practice and Guidance on Human Genetic Testing Services Supplied Direct to the Public" (September 1997) suppliers notify the Human Genetics Commission (HGC) of their proposed service and HGC publishes a statement of conformance with the Code. In addition, those supplying genetic paternity testing services are expected to comply with the Code of Practice and Guidance on Genetic Paternity Testing Services" (March 2001). All Government and public bodies commissioning paternity testing services are expected, so far as is practical, to ensure that those supplying services comply with this code.

 Patients may seek advice from their General Practitioner, other health care workers or NHS Direct.

of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy at the MRC Functional Genetics Unit in Oxford and the expenditure on this is about &#163;440,000 a year.
<P>

<a name="20415w27.html_para0">The MRC expenditure figure on all types of Muscular Dystrophy for the last five years is an estimated &#163;3.7 million.

<a name="20415w27.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2002]:</i> The Department has no plans to ask the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) to carry out research specifically into illnesses possibly caused by exposure to depleted uranium. However, NRPB does undertake research that is relevant to the assessment of the risks to health from such exposures. In particular NRPB has carried out extensive research into the distribution of uranium in body organs, its retention and excretion, following inhalation of a wide range of uranium compounds. It has also developed computer models that enable the concentration of uranium in the various organs and resulting radiation doses to be calculated. Depleted uranium is mildly radioactive, and NRPB's research programme on the effects of ionising radiation in general is therefore relevant to assessment of the radiological risks from exposure to depleted uranium.

 <i>[holding answer 26 March 2002]:</i> The Food Standards Agency, which has been responsible for negotiating this Directive on the Government's behalf, has consulted widely on its likely impact. There would be labelling costs falling on manufacturers of all food supplements, but these would be substantially offset by a two-year transitional period. Any additional impact of future developments on lists of permitted nutrients and maximum limits cannot yet be assessed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w27.html_spnew5"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> All Trusts were assessed on their performance during 2000&#150;01 against a set of key targets that are the most significant factors in determining their overall performance rating for the year. Those Trusts that indicated the poorest levels of performance against the key targets were awarded a rating of zero stars.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w27.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Burns: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the link between women taking the contraceptive pill or on hormone replacement therapy and their likelihood of suffering a deep vein thrombosis; and what measures are being taken to advise and make aware these vulnerable groups of the dangers of DVT and how to lower the risk of suffering from it.  [46830]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20415w27.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> A very small increase in the risk of developing deep vein thrombosis (DVT) for women who take oral contraceptives (OCs) or hormone replacement therapy (HRT) has been recognised for many years. Accordingly, OCs and HRT are contraindicated in women who have a personal or family history of DVT and who are therefore most at risk.
<P>

<a name="20415w27.html_para3">In 1995 several new studies suggested that a slightly increased risk of DVT was associated with newer OCs (the so-called third generation pills that contain desogestrel or gestodene as progestogen) compared to older ones (so-called second generation pills that contain levonorgestrel as progestogen). This issue was considered by the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) in 1995, 1996 and 2001 and by the Medicines Commission in 1998 as more data became available. They have advised that 



<P>
<P><I>15 Apr 2002 : Column 788W</I><P>
for every 100,000 women who use OCs for a year, 10&#150;20 more cases of DVT may be expected to occur relative to healthy non-users. This increase in risk is less than the risk of DVT associated with pregnancy (an extra 55 cases of DVT for every 100,000 pregnancies).
<P>

<a name="20415w27.html_para4">Warnings about the risk of DVT in women who take OCs have been in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPCs) for health professionals and the patient information leaflet (PIL) for women for many years. These warnings were updated with respect to the increased risk of DVT in women who use third, as opposed to second, generation pills in early 1999 and were included in the BNF (British National Formulary). In 2001, product information for all combined oral contraceptives was further updated to inform women and their health professionals that their risk of DVT is greatest in the first year they ever use an OC. Comprehensive information about the risk of DVT with use of oral contraceptives was provided to health professionals and women in a Dear Doctor letter in 1995, in an article in the Medicine Control Agency's (MCA) safety bulletin "Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance" in 1999 and on the MCA's website in 2001.
<P>

<a name="20415w27.html_para5">With respect to HRT, evidence suggesting an increased risk for DVT was considered by CSM in 1996. They advised that an additional 10&#150;20 women may experience a DVT out of every 100,000 women who use HRT compared with healthy non-HRT users of a similar age. The SPCs and PILs for HRT products and the BNF were updated in line with this advice in 1998. Health professionals were informed of the risk of DVT in association with use of HRT in an article in "Current Problems in Pharmacovigilance" which contained a pull-out sheet with information specifically for women.
<P>

<a name="20415w27.html_para6">In addition to targeted information, every pack of oral contraceptives and HRT contains a PIL for women. These clearly inform women that they should not use OCs or HRT if they have a personal or family history of DVT. They also inform women of their additional risk of DVT compared with non-users. PILs for the second and third generation OCs describe what DVT is and how it is caused, its potential severity and possible outcome. They also list the symptoms of DVT and advise women to stop taking their pills immediately and seek medical help in the event of their occurrence. In addition, they advise women to stop taking their pills prior to periods of prolonged immobilisation, especially surgery and to re-start only when fully re-mobilised. Any woman wishing to take OCs is encouraged to discuss the risks of DVT with her doctor and, provided she understands and accepts those risks, to jointly choose the treatment that is best suited to her in light of her individual medical history.

The Government acknowledges the importance of diagnostic procedures, such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and is encouraging hospitals to streamline their services so that tests are carried out, and a diagnosis made, as quickly as possible. The length of time that a patient may have to wait for any scan is dependent on their clinical condition. Emergency cases need to be seen immediately. Other cases will be carried out as quickly as possible, however this is dependent on the clinical priority of all the remaining patients waiting to be scanned. To increase the capacity of diagnostic services, funding has been made available for the provision of new and replacement scanners. By 2004, approximately 100 MRI scanners and 200 CT scanners will be provided through central purchasing programmes.
