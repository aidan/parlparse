 The European Community has been the driving force in the liberalisation of air services within Europe through the progressive establishment of the European single market in aviation during the late 1980s and 1990s. This has allowed European airlines to compete freely on intra-EU routes, offering services and setting fares according to their commercial judgement. The Government fully supports this process, as we believe that fair competition between air carriers in a liberalised market is the best guarantee of a good deal 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 Nov 2004 : Column 251W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

The subject is discussed regularly at international official-level meetings, most recently during the environmental debates at the 35th Assembly of the International Civil Aviation Organisation (27 September&#150;8 October 2004). On that occasion, the trigger for discussion was a working paper by the Government of India entitled &quot;Problems caused by night curfews in some parts of the world&quot;, in which it was argued that night curfews were a hindrance to market access and the growth of air transport operations and hence should be removed.

They are making use of Government grants, industry support and the resources of Government Offices and Regional Development Agencies, as well as other Government bodies participating in regional steering groups. Existing support programmes, including the ERDP have been targeted to deliver SSFF regional action plans.

 Lord Burns reported that the pre-breeding fox population of England and Wales was estimated to total some 217,000. He noted that this almost trebled during the breeding season, but that the pre-breeding population was roughly stable, suggesting that some 400,000 foxes died each year. He also noted that hunts were estimated to kill some 21,000 to 25,000 foxes annually, which equated to approximately 6 per cent. of fox deaths per year. This does not suggest that a ban on hunting will have a significant impact on overall fox numbers in future years. Defra does not itself make estimates of the fox population nor provide a year by year comparison.

 We are aware of the recent consultation by the Welsh Assembly on changes to assessment arrangements in Wales. In England we have listened to sensible concerns about testing at the end of Key Stage 1 and have introduced reforms this year so that the results of standard tasks and tests are combined with the teacher&#039;s assessment in one comprehensive judgment. But we continue to believe that national curriculum tests at the end of Key Stages 2 and 3 provide an effective and objective means of assessing all pupils in England on a consistent basis against national standards. They assure the accountability of schools to parents and taxpayers and help inform parents and teachers about each child&#039;s progress.

 The DfES is committed to ensuring that all parents have a choice of good schools for their children to attend.

Consequently, there are plans to increase provision in Lambeth substantially, to absorb demographic growth and to enable Lambeth residents to be educated locally. The Lambeth Academy, opened by Her Majesty the Queen on 26 October 2004 as a wholly new school, already provides extra places for 180 children each year.

<p><a name="st_90"><a name="41103w09.html_spnew9"><b> Mr. Miliband: </b> 
 Chapter 4 of our &quot;Five Year Strategy for Children and Learners&quot;, published in July 2004, sets out eight key reforms for secondary schools, five of which concern their buildings. Every secondary school which is up to the standard should be a specialist school, which triggers a capital grant for specialist facilities. All secondary schools will have the freedom, as foundation schools, to own their land and buildings and manage their assets, if they wish. We have introduced dedicated capital funding to encourage more places in popular schools. We will expand the academies programme to provide for 200 by 2010. Every secondary school will be refurbished or rebuilt to a modern standard through Building Schools for the Future.

<sup>(7)</sup> School-based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred 



directly by the schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure.<br>

<sup>(8)</sup> Pupil numbers include only those pupils attending maintained establishments within each sector and are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

<sup>(9)</sup> 1999&#150;2000 saw a change in data source when the data collection moved from the RO1 form collected by the ODPM to the Section 52 form from the DfES. 2002&#150;03 saw a further break in the time series following the introduction of Consistent Financial Reporting (CFR) and the associated restructuring of the outturn tables. The figures in italics indicate the change in sources. In 2002&#150;03 school based expenditure is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table A line 51 net current expenditure (NCE). For 2001&#150;02 and earlier years the expenditure is calculated as lines 1 to 12 less lines 29, 30, 35 and 37. This differs from the old Net Institutional Expenditure (NIE) calculation only in the treatment of meals and milk which is no longer excluded and no adjustments for balances are now made. This is taken from Section 52 Outturn Table 3 for 1999&#150;00 to 2001&#150;02 and from the RO1 form previously.<br>

<sup>(10)</sup> The 2002&#150;03 calculation is broadly similar to the calculation in previous years. However, 2001&#150;02 and earlier years includes all premature retirement compensation (PRC) and Crombie payments, mandatory PRC payments and other indirect employee expenses, while in 2002&#150;03 only the schools element of these categories is included. In 2001&#150;02 this accounted for approximately &#163;70 per pupil of the England total, while the schools element of these categories accounted for approximately &#163;50 per pupil of the England total in 2002&#150;03. Also, for some LEAs, expenditure that had previously been attributed to the school sectors was reported within the LEA part of the form in 2002&#150;03 and would therefore be excluded, though this is not quantifiable from existing sources.<br>

<sup>(11)</sup> Expenditure was not distinguished between the pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of Section 52 for financial year 1999&#150;2000.<br>

<sup>(12)</sup> School-based expenditure in nursery schools was not recorded in 2002&#150;03.<br>

<sup>(13)</sup> Not available.<br>

<sup>(14)</sup> Spending in 1997&#150;98 reflects the transfer of monies from local government to central Government for the nursery vouchers scheme. These were returned to local government from 1998&#150;99.<br>

<sup>(15)</sup> The 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance.<br>

Local authorities and the Student Loans Company have never been able to guarantee payment at the start of term to late applicants. The Student Loans Company has paid out over 549,000 loans to date, with a further 80,000 fully approved and scheduled for payment as soon as the students&#039; attendance is confirmed by their institution.

<a name="stpa_41">There has been some local variation in the speed with which some individual local education authorities have been able to process applications, but the Department and the SLC have worked closely with the LEAs affected to ensure that students are not disadvantaged. The vast majority of LEAs are now processing late applications within a maximum of six weeks, which is the normal service standard set by the Department. As in previous years, the Department has written to higher education institutions asking them to be supportive of students who do not have loans in place at the start of term.

 The Department collects information centrally on the number of teachers taking sickness absence, but not on the cause. The most recent figures show that in 2003 the average number of days lost to sickness absence was 5.4. This compares favourably with other occupations in both the public and private sectors. We nevertheless have a range of measures to ensure that teacher health and well-being is taken seriously, which include a focus on tackling sources of stress and excessive workload. Research conducted for the Department in the autumn term of 1999 by the School of Education at the University of Cambridge found that colds, influenza and associated respiratory tract infections were reported to be the most important causes of teachers&#039; absence, followed by upset stomach, headache and stress or depression.

 The Performance Indicators Steering Group (PISG) is the body which approves the content and methodology of the Performance Indicators (PIs) and associated benchmarks. The PISG is chaired by HEFCE (The Higher Education Funding Council for England), and includes representatives from Universities UK, the Standing Conference of Principals, and HESA (Higher Education Statistics Agency). Individual Higher Education Institutions are notified of their provisional PIs well before publication and are able to comment and take up any issues with the HESA,

I am also looking at the benchmarks to see if there is any way they can be improved or better understood.

 The Government have no plans to do so. Although we have not ruled out a Royal Commission, in the light of the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures, published in July 2002, we do not believe that a Royal Commission, or other form of public inquiry, would serve any useful purpose at the present time. The Select Committee concluded that there is at present a continuing need for animal experiments both

in applied research to develop human and veterinary medicine and to protect humans and the environment, and in research aimed purely at extending knowledge. The Government endorsed this conclusion in our response to the Select Committee report published in January 2003. Instead, we would rather use the available resources to make continuing improvements to the operation of the 1986 Act and to promote the fullest application of the 3Rs&#151;replacing the use of animals with alternative methods; reducing the number of animals needed for a particular purpose and refining the procedures to minimise suffering.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether an assessment has been made of the usefulness of the DNA database.  [194872]</p>








<p><a name="st_116"><a name="41103w13.html_spnew5"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 An assessment of the usefulness of the National DNA Database has been carried out through the on-going evaluation of the Home Office DNA Expansion Programme. The programme was set up in April 2000 to fund police forces to increase the collection of offender DNA samples and facilitate the build up of DNA profiles on the database. It also funds the retrieval of more DNA material left by offenders at crime scenes. It has provided &#163;182.6 million to police forces between April 2000 and March 2004 in addition to &#163;19 million per annum approximately from forces&#039; own budgets. The majority of the &#163;182.6 million is used by forces to cover the costs of processing DNA samples in forensic laboratories and the cost of 650 additional Scenes of Crime and Intelligence Staff and equipment.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41103w13.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_61">The programme&#039;s target was to hold a DNA profile for all known active suspect offenders on the database by March 2004 (it held 760,000 DNA profiles from suspect offenders in April 2000). This was achieved. There are currently 2.73 million DNA profiles taken from 2.45 million suspected offenders on the database (as at end September 2004), the great majority of known active suspect offenders. The UK now leads the world in terms of its ability to identify offenders and eliminate suspects by using a DNA database.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41103w13.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_62">Police data returns show that there were over 45,200 DNA &quot;offender-to-scene&quot; matches in 2003&#150;04. The chance of a match with a subject profile when a crime scene profile is first added to the database is now about 45 per cent. The match rate increases to about 70 per cent. when matches obtained later as new subject profiles are loaded and included.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41103w13.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_63">Evaluation of the DNA Expansion Programme has shown that the database can make a significant contribution to crime detection by linking DNA evidence found at crime scenes to offenders and significantly increasing the probability of crime detection. Where crime scene DNA is added to the database the rate of detection can be significantly 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>3 Nov 2004 : Column 298W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
increased. In 2003&#150;04, the overall detection rate was 23 per cent. but where DNA was successfully recovered from a crime scene and loaded on to the National DNA Database the detection rate rose to 43 per cent.

Through iQuanta there is now timely data on the performance of all forces and Basic Command Units across all the major crime types. This data is also available to forces themselves and police authorities, who now have a means of holding forces to account.

<a name="stpa_91">PSU is engaged with seven under-performing or &quot;target&quot; forces: Cambridgeshire, Cleveland, Greater Manchester, Humberside, Nottinghamshire, Northants, and West Yorkshire. This proactive role has changed the dynamic of the Department&#039;s relationship with the police service, underpinned by a sound analytical and evidence-based footing, and demonstrating a new and effective way of doing business. Each engagement has been different. In some, PSU has helped a force&#039;s own improvement regime to go further and faster. In others, the unit has been a catalyst for change. In the third category, PSU&#039;s involvement has a more fundamental process of attempting to put the force on a path towards recovery.

<p>
<a name="41103w15.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_92">In liaison with the ACPO, PSU launched the high profile, national Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign. This links in to the government&#039;s Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy and aims to crack down on alcohol-fuelled disorder, as well as using tough enforcement measures to take action against irresponsible drinkers and vendors who are fuelling anti-social behaviour. This campaign was positively received and early data has provided a baseline to measure the impact and success of this.

<a name="stpa_93">PSU&#039;s work on national projects, such as Automatic Number-Plate Recognition (ANPR), National Video Identification (NVIS) and the Policing Priority Areas (PPAs) have been widely recognised as a success.

<a name="stpa_94">PSU&#039;s role in police use of forensic science has also been successful, in particular on DMA and NAFIS (Fingerprint Automation) and through reviewing and changing force-level forensic processes. This has helped the 62 per cent. increase in the number of DMA matches achieved and the 34 per cent. increase in the number of &quot;DNA detections&quot; delivered. PSD have led on the development of a computer simulation model for forces to identify blockages in their forensic processes. A work-package of good practice is to be disseminated to all forces.

Each has demonstrated how working with small communities suffering from crime, the fear of crime and anti-social behaviour can bring about significant improvements in police and partnership working. This police-led programme has now been extended and there are now 29 identified sites. There has been significant success in reducing crime and providing public reassurance in the existing PPAs and the programme continues to build on the progress made so far.

Of these 1,225, the ADR was judged to lead directly to the admission in 80 per cent. of cases. The median bed stay was eight days, accounting for 4 per cent. of the hospital bed capacity. The projected annual cost of such admissions to the NHS is &#163;466 million. The overall fatality was 0.15 per cent. Most reactions were either definitely or possibly avoidable. Drugs most commonly implicated in causing these admissions included low dose aspirin, diuretics, warfarin, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs other than aspirin, the most common reaction being gastrointestinal bleeding.

 Since 1999 and the entry into force of the Ottawa Convention no funds have been specifically dedicated to the clearing of landmines in the Falklands Islands. Given the unpredictability of the environment, landmine clearance in the Falklands is particularly hazardous. Since August 1982 the landmines have been clearly marked and have very little impact on the local community. When landmines do surface they are cleared by the Explosive Ordnance Disposal teams based on the islands as part of their duties. Between 1997&#150;2001, 156 mines were discovered and destroyed in this way. Between 2001&#150;04, 268 mines were discovered and destroyed.

We are unable to assess the value of illicit funds generated by each of the banking, industrial and service sectors. However, under the terms of Security Council resolution 1483 (22 May 2003), more than $1 billion of former Iraqi regime assets have so far been frozen internationally and transferred to the Development Fund for Iraq, for the benefit of the Iraqi people.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was aware of a number of claims that sanctions were failing. The United Kingdom continually worked hard at the United Nations Security Council to limit Iraq&#039;s efforts to erode sanctions, and ensure the effective implementation of the Oil for Food Programme. As the Iraq Survey Group reported, sanctions were successful in curbing Iraq&#039;s ability to import weapons and technology. Sanctions were maintained against Iraq from 1990 until the adoption of resolution 1483 on 22 May 2003, when economic sanctions were lifted and the arms embargo was left in place.

 The Iraqi Ministry of the Interior is responsible for election security in Iraq. The Iraqi Police Service will provide appropriate security to polling stations, supported if necessary by the Iraqi National Guard. The Multinational Force will continue to support the Iraqi Interim Government in providing area security in order to assist the political process as mandated by UNSCR 1546.

 The UK strongly supports the constitutional requirement for 25 per cent. of the seats in the Transitional National Assembly to be held by women. The Iraqi Electoral Law (CPA Order 96) stipulates (Section 4, Paragraph 3) that,
