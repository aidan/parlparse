<a name="70721w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Laurence Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on his Department's plans to introduce a fast-track approach to bringing young offenders to court. [7526]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government are committed to halving the time from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders and tackling delays throughout the youth justice system. We are taking immediate action to speed up proceedings against young offenders. My right hon. and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor has already written to the chairman of every youth panel in magistrates courts throughout England and Wales encouraging them to deal swiftly and effectively with persistent young offenders and to minimise the granting of adjournments. We intend to follow this up with good practice guidance to all relevant agencies. The Crime and Disorder Bill will also include reforms to the youth justice system designed to ensure that young offenders are dealt with more speedily.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what mechanisms he plans to establish for consultation on the incorporation of the European convention on human rights into <i>(a)</i> English and Welsh law, <i>(b)</i> Scots law and <i>(c)</i> Northern Irish law. [7527]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 We published a consultation document on incorporation--"Bringing Rights Home"--in December 1996. We are now developing proposals for legislation in the light of the responses to that document and further discussions we have had since then. We will announce our conclusions in a White Paper later this year and are happy to consider any representations made in response to it.

<a name="70721w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Concerns have been expressed at the need to resort to the High Court for any review of a coroner's decision. This is one of a number of matters that we keep under review, but we have no present plans to change the legislation.

<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. May: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the policy of his Department on the timely payment of debts; and what is his Department's record on the payment of debts in the current financial year. [9529]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 All Departments are required to pay their bills within agreed contract terms, or 30 days from receipt of goods or service or a valid invoice where no such terms exist, whichever is the later. Information on payment performance for the current financial year is not immediately available, but I shall write to the hon. Member with the information as soon as possible. The Government will publish a league table of departmental payment performance for 1996-97 in the autumn.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 I refer my hon. Friend to the reply I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Selby (Mr. Grogan) on 16 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>173</i>, and to the letter I sent to all hon. Members on 17 July.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reasons section 7 of form A for use when surrendering items covered by the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 requires the person surrendering an item to agree to accept any payment rather than the sum specified in the compensation terms. [9670]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Payments will be made only in accordance with the terms of the compensation scheme as approved by Parliament. Valid claims under options A or B will result in the payments agreed in the scheme. The claim form asks claimants to declare that they will 
"accept any payment made in relation to any items claimed for under Options A or B as a settlement of"
their
"claim in relation to those items".
<P>

<a name="70721w01.html_para0">With a claim under these options, the claimant knows exactly the payment on offer. Signature of the declaration enables the firearms compensation section to pay claims immediately--at the time of acknowledgement--rather than having to send a further letter before payment can be agreed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what will be done with items surrendered under the terms of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 prior to the completion of the action being taken by owners in the European Court of Justice. [9668]




<P>
<P><I>21 Jul 1997 : Column: 387</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 With the exception of the items that are retained for police training purposes or acquired for public display in museums, all surrendered items will be destroyed. We are satisfied that the compensation scheme is in line with our obligations under European law and the disposal of surrendered items will proceed as described.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if late payment of compensation under the terms of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 will attract interest. [9669]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Payments will be made under the published terms of the scheme. There is no provision to include interest as part of these payments, but payments will be made as swiftly as possible.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what paperwork a handgun owner is required to complete when handing in to the police any item required to be surrendered under the terms of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997. [9671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 When making a claim for a handgun or accessories, applicants must complete and submit a claim form provided by their police force. Those submitting a claim under option C must attach documentary evidence as to the value of their items. Claimants must also produce their firearm certificate, temporary permit or certificate of registration as a firearms dealer and dealer's record of transactions, as appropriate. It will also be necessary to produce evidence of lawful ownership of the items as at 16 October 1996, as specified in the compensation scheme itself.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Wilshire: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department who will be the legal owner of handguns handed in to the police under the terms of the Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997. [9667]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Items surrendered under the terms of the compensation and ex gratia schemes will become the property of the Secretary of State.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Colvin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he will be tabling the draft compensation order for .22 calibre pistols and equipment. [9100]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 Under the terms of clause 2 of the Firearms (Amendment) Bill there is no requirement for details of the compensation arrangements for small-calibre pistols and ancillary equipment to be tabled. Small-calibre pistol owners have already received details of the ex gratia scheme. As I informed the House during the debates on 9 June, copies of the scheme had been placed in the Library a few days beforehand. The scheme sets out the terms of payment for pistols and equipment that are surrendered voluntarily. It is intended that this ex gratia scheme will become the formal compensation scheme following the passing of the Bill. This, too, was explained fully to the House on 9 June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Michael </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 July 1997]:</i> We are very concerned to ensure that the law on rape is effective in punishing and deterring crime and fair to victims. We have in the past laid down amendments aimed at reforming the law in this area and this remains our commitment. We have a number of competing priorities in this parliamentary Session and will need to look carefully as to when we could deal with this issue.




<P>
<P><I>21 Jul 1997 : Column: 390</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70721w02.html_para2">The law on consent in respect of rape, or the use of the sexual history of victims, is provided for in the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1976. Under that Act, no question may be asked about, or evidence adduced of, the complainant's previous sexual history with anybody except the defendant without the leave of the trial judge. A judge should grant leave only if he is satisfied that it would be unfair to the defendant to refuse to do so.
<P>

<a name="70721w02.html_para3">We will continue to examine how the law is applied. A Home Office research study into the process of rape cases is seeking to identify what factors influence whether a recorded rape leads to a conviction. Among the factors under examination are the use of the victim's sexual history in court and the importance of corroborative evidence where consent is disputed.

 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1997]:</i> Such information is not currently held centrally and could not be obtained except at disproportionate cost. Various estimates have been provided by organisations supporting or arguing against hunting with hounds. However, it will be for Parliament to determine how to take forward any further detailed work on the likely effects of a decision to ban hunting with hounds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Kilfoyle: </B> 
 The Government have today issued guidance to civil servants on their role and conduct during the devolution referendum campaigns. The guidance provides a generic set of principles which individual Departments can incorporate into guidance tailored to their particular needs and situations. It stresses that civil servants should conduct themselves in accordance with the civil service code, and is based on the need to maintain the political impartiality of the civil service and to ensure that public resources are not used for party political purposes. Copies of the guidance have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and are also available from the Vote Office.

<a name="70721w02.html_para4">The report shows that the civil service continues to attract a strong field of applicants for both generalist and specialist schemes. The diversity of sources from which recruits are drawn continues to grow, with successful candidates from more than 60 different higher educational institutions. Good progress has also been made towards the goal of increasing the proportion of recruits to the generalist scheme who have scientific degree backgrounds.

To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster what guidelines exist to ensure that civil servants cannot work on a party political basis. [9071] <P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w03.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Clark: </B> 
 Civil servants are under a duty, laid down in the civil service code, to conduct themselves with integrity, impartiality and honesty, and in such a way as to deserve and retain the confidence of Ministers and to be able to establish the same relationship with those whom they may be required to serve in some future Administration. Ministers are also under a duty not to use public resources for party political purposes, to uphold the political impartiality of the civil service, and not to ask civil servants to act in a way that would conflict with the civil service code. In their private lives, civil servants must comply with restrictions on their political activities as set out in the civil service code and the civil service management code.

 <i>[holding answer 7 July 1997]:</i> As already announced, we are extending the life of the Millennium Commission to enable it to meet its existing commitments to the millennium experience. Should these commitments unavoidably increase in the future, we will take further steps to ensure--through the lottery--that the commission is able to meet them. But it is our firm resolve that such action should not prove necessary; the Millennium Commission shares this resolve.

 The success of the new deal will depend on effective partnerships in which all sections of local communities, including the private, public and voluntary sectors, play a full and relevant part.

 In our new deal for young and long-term unemployed people, we intend to offer the widest possible range of opportunities for people to gain skills and improve their employability. Education and training will be guaranteed for all those participating in any of our four options of help. We want organisations from all sectors to join in our crusade to get people off benefits and into jobs, and I hope that the horticultural sector, like all others, will respond to this challenge. It is also possible under current arrangements to train to national vocational qualification level 2 and above in horticulture, under training for work.

It is likely to have a core administrative centre, but it is too early to say where this might be located. Responsibility for work on the university for industry rests with my individual learning division.

 Over the next five years, we plan to bring into service three type 23 frigates to replace two type 22 frigates, HMS Boxer and HMS Beaver, and one type 42 destroyer, HMS Birmingham. The value of the contract for these vessels is estimated at around &#163;450 million. We will also bring into service two auxiliary oilers at the turn of the century. These vessels, for which the contract is worth around &#163;200 million, will replace the aging O class fuel replenishment ships, RFA Olna and RFA Olwen. The two amphibious ships, HMS Fearless and HMS Intrepid, will be replaced early next century by HMS Albion and HMS Bulwark; the value of the contract for these vessels is estimated at &#163;450 million.

<a name="70721w05.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The estimated cost of UK forces assigned to the ARRC, and the headquarters costs, is some &#163;2 billion in the current financial year, or some one tenth of the defence budget. These forces include 1 and 3 Divisions, 24 Airmobile Brigade and support troops, which could contribute to a number of missions, under both NATO and non-NATO command, in support of the Government's security and defence policies.

 There is currently one one-star officer from the ethnic minorities in the RAF and none in the Royal Navy, Royal Marines or Army, although a one-star officer recently retired from the Army. This reflects the under-representation of the ethnic minorities in the armed forces, a position we are seeking to redress. A new management-led, self-classification survey of the ethnic origin of serving personnel was introduced in July 1996. Prior to this date records cannot be relied on.

The Department does not hold a central database of employment advertisements for civilians and it is therefore not possible, except at disproportionate cost and effort, to check whether any of these may have contained an age restriction other than the permitted exceptions.
<P>

<a name="70721w05.html_para4">As a general principle, the armed forces require recruits aged between 16 and 26 years, although in some trades older applicants are acceptable. Approximately 90 per cent. of advertising for recruiting individuals into the services make references to these age restrictions.

 According to currently available information, 12 C3A1 anti-personnel land mines, commonly known as Elsies, were used in Iraq and not subsequently recovered. Consistent with the provisions of international law current at the time, details of their precise locations were not recorded in view of the nature of the operations. Given the current circumstances in Iraq, it would not be practical

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many service men and women have been <i>(a)</i> killed and <i>(b)</i> seriously injured in road traffic accidents while serving in Bosnia since the end of hostilities following the Dayton accord. [9315]<P>
<P>

<a name="70721w05.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Since the deployment of the implementation force on 20 December 1995, three British soldiers have died and six have been listed as seriously ill or very seriously ill as a result of road traffic accidents in Bosnia. With treacherous weather and poor roads, conditions are very challenging, demanding a high degree of skill from drivers. Those military personnel required to drive vehicles in Bosnia undertake pre-deployment driving training to prepare them for the conditions there. The dangers are taken very seriously and an active information campaign ensures that all personnel are reminded of the need to drive with great care.

 The introduction of plea and directions hearings in the Crown court continues to reduce delays. In the magistrates courts, the Magistrates' Courts (Procedure) Bill introduced recently by the Lord Chancellor will speed up the progress of half a million minor motoring cases per year. Generally, the Government are considering the scope for reductions in delays in the criminal courts suggested by the review of delay in the criminal justice system, and there will be a further announcement in due course.

The Department funds a number of publications that are available to general practitioners, pharmacists and other health professionals--for instance, the British National Formulary and a Medicines Resource Centre monthly bulletin, which give information on the treatment of various conditions and the drugs involved in such treatment.
<P>

<a name="70721w07.html_para1">In 1994, the Department agreed to fund a helpline run by the Council for Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction, a voluntary organisation which aims to support those who wish to withdraw from tranquillisers and sleeping tablets. CITA was provided with funding of &#163;10,000 in 1994-95, &#163;10,000 in 1995-96 and &#163;10,000 in 1996-97. In addition, the Department continues to fund the mental health charity MIND, which operates local self-help groups for people dependent on tranquillisers.

 In Stoke-on-Trent, North, the health authority has established a locality approach to developing healthy communities through involving a wide range of statutory and local community organisations. The report of the director of public health this year will focus on "determinants of health". A wide range of public health initiatives is already under way in North Staffordshire, and many more have been identified as priorities by the health authority for 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="70721w07.html_para2">Key priorities include:

<a name="70721w07.html_para4">Nationally, the Government will be taking forward the public health agenda across a broad front. I outlined the scope of our new health strategy "Our Healthier Nation" on 7 July; copies of my speech are available in the Library. In the autumn, we shall publish a Green Paper setting out the strategy in detail. Many Government policies will contribute to improving public health, such as welfare to work, education policies and the integrated

The Department of Health is working closely with the other Departments involved, as it is in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on developing the food standards agency. In the autumn, we shall publish a White Paper on measures to reduce smoking and draft Bill to ban tobacco advertising. Healthy living centres and health action zones will also address public health issues.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health, pursuant to his answer of 9 July, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>504</i>, what was the nature of the work carried out by Drivers Jonas in respect of Orsett hospital. [8979]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Information about the exact nature of the work carried out by the chartered surveyors Drivers Jonas in respect of Orsett hospital is not held centrally.

The strategy identified vulnerable groups as gay men--in particular, young gay men--bisexuals and other men who have sex with men, injecting drug users, men and women who travel to or have links with high prevalence countries, currently those in sub-Saharan Africa, and women partners of men in these groups.

 The table shows the mean weekly incidence of new general practitioner episodes of asthma in children per 100,000 of the population in England for each year since 1977. The data are collected from individual practices, and are not collated on a regional basis. It is therefore not possible to provide a regional breakdown. The figures show a clear increase over three decades up to the early 1990s. Although increasing awareness of asthma may have contributed to part of this rise, it does appear likely that part is due to an actual growth in the prevalence of the disease. However, it is still not known what causes asthma or what accounts for this rise.
<P>

<a name="70721w09.html_para8">Nevertheless, there has been a decline in general practitioner episodes of asthma since 1993, suggesting that the previously rising incidence of asthma has abated. This may reflect more effective treatment and higher-quality medical care. The Department of Health remains committed to tackling the burden of asthma on those who suffer from it, and continues to fund research into its causes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he will make a statement on the Crown Office's policy on prosecution for consensual homosexual acts involving males between the ages of 16 and 18 years. [9219]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McLeish: </B> 
 My noble and learned Friend the Lord Advocate is responsible for the prosecution of crime in Scotland. He informs me that he considers that the public interest is not served by routinely prosecuting all persons who participate in private consensual homosexual acts, which are unlawful by reason of the fact that one or both are under 18 years.
<P>

<a name="70721w10.html_para4">The Lord Advocter had directed procurators fiscal to report to the Crown Office for Crown counsel's consideration cases of consensual homosexual acts in private where both the participants are over 16 years but one or both are under 18 years.
<P>

<a name="70721w10.html_para5">This is consistent with the approach taken by the Lord Advocate's predecessors in office since February 1994 when an identical direction was issued to procurators fiscal by the then Lord Advocate.

<a name="70721w10.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what reasons underlie <i>(a)</i> the entitlement of recipients of the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance to exemption from vehicle excise duty and <i>(b)</i> the non-entitlement of people with mobility difficulties in receipt of attendance allowance to such exemption. [8829]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w10.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The basis for entitlement to exemption from vehicle excise duty for those in receipt of the higher rate mobility component of disability living allowance is severe mobility need which may require some form of private transport. Provision is focused on those disabled before the age of 65. However, those in receipt of attendance allowance are entitled to VED exemption under transitional protection arrangements if their application for exemption was approved before 13 October 1993.

 A study of the Woolwich rail tunnel, the potential for Thames gateway metro services and the regeneration benefits these may offer is being undertaken for my Department as part of a study of potential new east Thames river crossings. I expect this to be completed by the autumn. Consideration of these proposals will be made in the light of the study's findings and our fundamental review of transport policy. Regeneration benefits of the Thames gateway metro will be examined using the appraisal framework my Department is developing.

 Children who are taken on organised trips in newer coaches in Britain already have to be provided with a seat belt.

Similar arrangements will apply in Northern Ireland from 1 September this year. Enforcement of these regulations is a matter for the police.

 My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment has received a letter from the Permaculture Association (Britain), which is concerned about the impact on urban trees of action to reduce the amount of drinking water lost through leakage.
<P>

<a name="70721w11.html_para2">Events over the past few summers have shown that water conservation is an issue that must be taken seriously. Against this background, average losses of nearly 30 per cent. through leakage from the mains system are intolerable. As part of the Government's 10-point plan for a better water industry, tough mandatory targets are to be put in place to secure a substantial reduction in leakage over the next five years.
<P>

<a name="70721w11.html_para3">Existing leakages may artificially increase the availability of water to trees in the immediate vicinity. However, not all trees in towns will be situated near leaking pipes and so be serviced in this way. In addition, as the naturally dry condition of recent years have demonstrated, most trees are able to adapt to changing conditions above and below ground and to adjust their water demand accordingly. Action taken to reduce leakage is, therefore, unlikely on its own to result in major losses of trees from our towns.

 The abolition of the gas levy will have a minimal effect on carbon dioxide emissions. My Department has estimated that it will result in an annual increase in emissions of about 0.04 million tonnes of carbon in 2000, equivalent to 0.02 per cent. of emissions. We estimate a negligible effect by 2010 because the real value of the gas levy and the quantity of gas covered by it both decline over time.

 <i>[holding answer 16 July 1997]:</i> The Secretary of State has no involvement with offshore aggregate prospecting and, consequently, he has no information about its extent within the middle deep and outer Thames estuary.
<P>

<a name="70721w12.html_para3">Prospecting for marine sand and gravel is licensed by the Crown Estate as a custodian of virtually all the territorial sea bed out to 12 nautical miles. Before the Crown Estate issues a prospecting licence, it seeks comments from the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the appropriate countryside agencies and the royal commission on historical monuments of England. Prospecting has very little impact on the sea bed because the survey techniques are mainly non-intrusive and surveys are governed by a voluntary code of practice between the industry and MAFF. Bulk sampling--maximum 500 tonnes--requires the prior agreement of MAFF.
<P>

<a name="70721w12.html_para4">Commercial extraction of marine aggregates requires a dredging licence granted by the Crown Estate which will not grant a licence until the Secretary of State issues a favourable "Government view" on the application for a licence. The "Government view procedure", co-ordinated by this Department, provides for a comprehensive environmental assessment to be made of the dredging proposals, including their possible effect on coastal defences, nature conservation and fishing interests. Unless the Secretary of State is fully satisfied that all these interests will be safeguarded, a favourable "Government view" will not be issued.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Research recently published by the Department looked at both the financial and service quality impact of CCT on blue collar services covered by the Local Government Act 1988. It showed average annual savings on contract prices of 9 per cent. for the second round of tendering. This finding is, however, dependent on the way in which the social costs and benefits of CCT are treated. Other research, commissioned outside the Department, suggests a wide variation in estimates of savings when these factors are taken into account.
<P>

<a name="70721w13.html_para0">The departmental study also indicates that these savings have been accompanied by only relatively minor improvements in service standards; more attention needs to be given to the development of local performance indicators. A majority of the authorities surveyed also thought that user involvement in the specifying and monitoring of services could be improved. These issues will be addressed by our best value proposals, currently being developed with the support of local government and the private sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to meet representatives of the Local Government Association to discuss the effect of the abolition of the advance corporation tax credit on local authorities. [9400]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w13.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The Secretary of State, with ministerial colleagues, last met the Local Government Association on Wednesday 16 July. The subjects discussed included the likely impact of the abolition of the advance corporation tax on local authority pension funds.

<P>
<a name="70721w13.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Clifton-Brown: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list for each local authority the effect on their pension fund contributions of the withdrawal of ACT credits in the Budget. [9908]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The next valuation of local authority pension funds in England and Wales is due in March 1998. Only after that exercise has been completed will a true picture emerge of the effect of the Budget proposal on ACT credits and what effect this will have on future employer contributions to the separate funds.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans the Government have to issue guidance to local authorities in respect of families who seek planning permission to accommodate dependent relatives; and if he will make a statement. [8975]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Raynsford </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 1997]:</i> This issue was raised for discussion in last year's Green Paper on household growth. The Government are still considering the responses to the consultation, on which we will make a statement in due course. I have no plans currently to issue further advice.
<P>

<a name="70721w13.html_para2">Rights to erect annex buildings in the gardens of dwelling houses similar to those that currently apply under the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 have existed for many years. To benefit from permitted development rights, however, such new buildings in the gardens of dwelling houses must be "incidental to the enjoyment" of the house. The creation of a separate main residential unit would constitute development requiring planning permission.
<P>

<a name="70721w13.html_para3">However, extensions to create annexes for dependent relatives may be appropriate in certain circumstances, subject to conditions. This is to prevent the creation of independent living accommodation which could subsequently be let or sold off separately from the main house.
<P>

<a name="70721w13.html_para4">The same is true for separate buildings--often conversions of outbuildings--intended for use for dependent relatives. In these cases, it is even more likely that a separate unit of accommodation will be created.
<P>

<a name="70721w13.html_para5">The Government are aware of the need to give householders as many rights to develop their properties as possible, but consider that these freedoms should not be detrimental to the interests of neighbours or the quality of the area in general, and therefore have to draw a line beyond which a planning application is required.

The principal mechanisms to secure objectivity are up-to-date development plans and a prompt, efficient appeals systems. The Department is carrying out a comprehensive review of the planning system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 1997]:</i> Local authorities intending to use their powers in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to direct unauthorised campers to leave land should make reasonable attempts to ascertain the campers' health and welfare needs before deciding whether eviction is justified. They need to inquire first from the campers themselves if they are receiving assistance from health and welfare services. Even if they are not, this does not mean that they do not need assistance. If it appears that assistance is being received, or is needed, local authorities should liaise with the relevant statutory agencies; the local authority may well at this stage have sufficient information to assess whether it would be justified in evicting.
<P>

<a name="70721w14.html_para0">It is important that local authorities maintain close relationships with the statutory agencies and that, if those agencies have relevant information, this is made known.

<a name="70721w15.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Banks: </B> 
 The Government give support for individual sports mainly through the English and UK Sports Councils. The British Federation of Sand and Land Yacht Clubs, the sport's governing body, has been awarded a grant of &#163;19,000 by the UK and English Sports Councils. This runs to September 1997. From September, the funding and development of the sport will rest with the UK Sports Council. Sand yachting has so far been awarded &#163;47,660 from the lottery sports fund.

 We are committed to giving a high priority to protecting our heritage. Government funding to achieve this is channelled in the main through English Heritage. Increasingly, the lottery is also contributing substantial aid. English Heritage and the heritage lottery fund have had continuing discussions in recent months about possible funding initiatives in which they can collaborate to the greater benefit of historic buildings.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no such plans.

The BBC is carrying out an extensive consultation exercise about the future direction of Radio 4 and I am sure that it will take into account in arriving at its decisions the strong feelings expressed by Madam Speaker and by hon. Members on both sides of the House about the broadcasting of our proceedings.

 The Treasury collects data on the ethnic origin of its staff on a confidential, self-declaration basis. When it was collected, an assurance was given that the information would be used in aggregate form only and never in a way that might enable individuals to be identified. The analysis sought cannot be given because the total number of staff in the private office of the Chancellor of the Exchequer is sufficiently small to enable the individuals to be identified.

 Age is not a criteria used in recruitment advertisements except for those who join the Treasury through the European fast stream, where there is an age limit of 31. The European fast stream offers EU-related work in the British civil service which, together with specially structured training, is designed to help young British graduates in the competitions for entry into the EU institutions. The age limit of 31 for such entrants reflects a period of training in advance of an age limit of 35 imposed by the European Commission on recruitment to the European institutions. The reason for the age limit is explained in the recruitment literature.

 Following requests from the construction industry for help in correctly determining the employment status of its workers, the Inland Revenue and Contributions Agency published new guidance in 1996. To provide uniformity of approach across the industry, construction companies were required to review the employment status of their workers and, by 5 April 1997, make necessary changes and start accounting for Pay-as-you-earn and national insurance contributions where appropriate.

 The advisory cost limit was last increased in 1993--<i>Official Report</i>, 18 February 1993, column <i>307</i>--and is to be further increased to &#163;500 from today.
<P>

<a name="70721w17.html_para0">The purpose and application of the advisory cost limit remain unchanged. It is intended to act as a threshold for disproportionate cost parliamentary questions. Any written PQ where the marginal cost of preparing the answer is considered likely to exceed the threshold may be refused in whole or in part on the ground of disproportionate cost. Alternatively, the Minister may decide that the PQ is to be answered irrespective of cost. There is no advisory limit for oral PQs.
<P>

<a name="70721w17.html_para1">The advisory limit continues to be based on eight times the average marginal cost for written PQs, which is now &#163;62, rounded to the nearest &#163;50 for convenience of application.

<a name="70721w18.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 July 1997]:</i> There are two different sets of measurements: the number of contracts--or taxpayers getting relief--and the number of people covered by the contract. It is common for more than one person--usually spouses--to be covered by a contract. The lower figure of one third million quoted in the Red Book represents the number of eligible contracts 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jul 1997 : Column: 446</I><P>
and the number of people who get tax relief by making their payments net of tax. The higher figure quoted in the press release--550,000--represents the total number of individuals covered by the contracts.

 The first report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life Cm 2850, made it clear that, when Members are meeting Ministers or others on topics in which they have an interest, the onus is on the Members to declare that interest, not the Minister to know--paragraph 63 of Cm 2850. It is not practicable for Ministers and officials, among their other duties, to vet requests for meetings against the Register of Members' Interests. Should evidence of non-declaration emerge, or contravention of the resolution of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, the matter would be brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.

 The first report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life Cm 2850, recognised the value of enabling Members to retain interests outside the House, provided these were properly declared, both in the Register of Members' Interests and on other occasions. Subject to these requirements, and to the rules of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, Members are free to seek meetings with Ministers and officials who will consider such requests alongside the many other approaches from individuals and organisations concerned to press their own interests or those of others.

 As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister explained in response to the hon.

 <i>[holding answer 18 July 1997]:</i> Mechanisms are already in place, through the British National Space Centre partnership and the responsibilities of the Natural Environment Research Council, for ensuring that the scientific aspects of Earth observation are fully integrated into the research council system. NERC, as well as the Office of Science and Technology, is a partner in BNSC and NERC staff are fully involved in the definition and implementation of BNSC's EO activities. NERC's responsibilities include the promotion

<P>
<a name="70721w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 1997]:</i> The United Kingdom has been more successful than any other ESA country in winning announcements of opportunity for scientific and strategic exploitation of data from ESA's European remote sensing satellites. We are also one of the leading countries in the development of commercial applications of Earth observations. The British National Space Centre is aiming to continue this success by working with ESA, the EU, Government Departments, industry and academia to ensure an effective infrastructure for processing, archiving, and distribution Envisat data combined with continuing promotional and applications development support.

<P>
<a name="70721w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 1997]:</i> The Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council received an allocation from the science budget of &#163;200.65 million--including provision for its international subscriptions--for 1997-98. Within that allocation, it is for PPARC to determine its priorities, including deciding whether and at what level it should participate in ESA missions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w20.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Gillan: </B> 
To ask the President of the board of Trade what monitoring PPARC undertakes of the comparative industrial spin-off of its space science expenditure including the ESA subscription against that of its expenditure on ground-based astronomy and particle physics. [9433]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Battle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 July 1997]:</i> As the only research council which exclusively supports basic research, the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council's mission requires it to "take account" of the potential for contributing to the UK's industrial competitiveness, as opposed to the requirement on the other research councils to place "special emphasis" on this issue. Nevertheless, PPARC seeks to ensure that UK industry benefits from contracts for the construction of major facilities, and that technologies developed for research are exploited in industry.
<P>

<a name="70721w20.html_para0">PPARC is developing performance indicators to help to monitor the number of contracts won by UK companies, and the extent to which the academic community collaborates with companies. As contracts placed by ESA are linked to the level of the UK's subscription, and the high-technology contracts placed by the Gemini telescope project are linked to the level of the UK's participation in the project, there are already good opportunities for UK companies to win contracts. While UK companies already benefit substantially from contracts from ESA, they have not done so well at winning supply contracts

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food how many <i>(a)</i> live sheep and <i>(b)</i> consignments of live sheep were exported from Dover on 5 July; what was (i) the place of departure and (ii) the final destination given on the route plan in respect of each consignment; what was (1) the time of departure and (2) the time of arrival at final destination 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jul 1997 : Column: 458</I><P>
of each consignment; where each consignment received the 24-hour break stipulated by the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 and if a full 24 hours was spent there; how many livestock vehicles were turned away from Dover by his officials on 5 July and for what reasons; and if he will make a statement. [8537]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Four vehicles containing 2,280 sheep were exported from Dover on 5 July. Two locations in Italy were declared as the destinations and the place of departure was in Essex. The ship departed from Dover at 01.00 and the animals were due to arrive at their destinations during the early morning of 7 July having received two 24-hour rest periods, one at the start of the journey and the other at premises in Belgium during the journey. In the port of Dover, two vehicles were served with an enforcement notice requiring the animals to be accommodated in premises close to Dover because the vehicles did not meet the additional criteria necessary for a journey of over more than eight hours, as required by schedule 7 to the Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what steps he takes to establish the journey times taken for each movement of non-human primates from entry into the crate in the country of export to arrival at point of destination in this country; if he sets a maximum journey time for such journeys; and if he will make a statement. [8216]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w20.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 July 1997]:</i> There are no statutory limits on journey times for such animals. The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997, implementing directive 91/628 as amended, sets transport conditions and specifies that animals which are subject to the convention on international trade in endangered species--CITES--shall be transported in compliance with CITES guidelines or the standards set by the International Air Transport Association. Enforcement of the order is a matter for local authorities.

1. The sterling rate of compensation has been reduced on six occasions as a result of green pound fluctuations.<P>

2. Compensation is fixed in terms of payments per kilogram live weight. Where cattle are not weighed live, a coefficient --of 2 for cows and 1.7 for all other cattle--is applied to the recorded dead weight.<P>

3. A degressive top-up payment for clean cattle--heifers and steers--originally set at 25p/kg was available for the first six months of the scheme. The original top-up payment is still available for clean cattle that were over 30 months of age on 17 June 1996.<P>

4. With effect from 25 November 1996, the minimum period during which an animal has to be present on a UK holding before becoming eligible for the scheme was increased from three months to six months.<P>

5. With effect from 4 August 1997, payment will be limited to a maximum weight of 560 kg per animal.<P>

6. All basic rates of payment in ecu or sterling apply to cows and bulls unless otherwise indicated.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The changes to the compensation arrangements for the over-30-months scheme, which will apply from 4 August, have been introduced to reduce scheme expenditure, which is considerable. Providing financial assistance to offset the impact of the changes would frustrate the objective of reducing scheme expenditure.
<P>

<a name="70721w21.html_para0">Nevertheless, in the period leading up to 4 August, it is recognised that some farmers will accelerate their culling patterns to benefit from the current compensation rates. The Intervention Board has made provision for abattoirs to slaughter more animals than would otherwise have been accepted in this period, although it can not rule out the possibility that demand will exceed the capacity available.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The effect of the weight limit on farmers' incomes will depend on the weight of the animals being presented. For a typical suckler cow farmer culling five cows per year, each weighing 620 kg, the reduction in 



<P>
<P><I>21 Jul 1997 : Column: 460</I><P>
income arising from the introduction of the weight limit and the lower compensation rate for cull cows will be about &#163;395.
<P>

<a name="70721w21.html_para1">The weight limit and the reduced compensation rate for cull cows are being introduced to reduce expenditure on the over-30-months scheme, which is expected to amount to well over &#163;200 million this year in compensation alone.

<a name="70721w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Cormorants are protected by the 1979 EC birds directive, implemented in the UK by the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. This Act provides for them to be shot under licence in strictly limited numbers in cases where they are causing serious damage to a fishery and where there is no other satisfactory solution. There are no powers to undertake a general cull.

 Departmental organisation is a matter for internal decision, bearing in mind the jobs to be done and the need for efficient and economic administration. It is not a subject for public consultation or negotiation, although we consider very carefully representations made by interested bodies and individuals. We do, of course, consult fully with the departmental trade union side on the effects of our decisions on our staff.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to ensure that the public are properly informed of the results of food chemical surveys for which his Department has a responsibility; and if he will make a statement. [10072]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70721w23.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Government believe that the public should be properly informed about all food safety matters. I have therefore decided to make some important changes to improve the reporting of results from our regular food chemical surveys. I plan to increase the amount of information available about surveys and ensure wider publication of the results. For all relevant surveys, the full results for individual samples, including brand names, will be given. Furthermore, I will open up the food chemical surveillance programme to greater public scrutiny by publishing information on surveys to be undertaken.
<P>

<a name="70721w23.html_para0">I endorse fully the view that we must release the results fairly and provide the public with the best possible advice on their significance. These changes will benefit consumers by enabling them to make a more informed choice about the food that they buy. The only surveys which will be excluded from these arrangements are those for which brand names have no bearing on the interpretation of the results, such as dietary surveys involving individual people or exploratory surveys aimed at developing analytical methods.
<P>

<a name="70721w23.html_para1">In addition, I propose to review the current arrangements for reporting surveys on pesticides, veterinary residues and microbiological safety of food, which are administratively different from food chemical surveys. I will report on proposed changes to the House as soon as possible.

 A multi-agency action plan aimed at increasing the levels of physical activity among the sedentary population is presently being developed and people who are obese will be one of the target groups. In addition, "Eating and Health--A food and nutrition strategy for Northern Ireland", which was published in November 1996, aims to improve nutrition including the reduction of obesity in Northern Ireland.

 On 8 July, the drinking water inspectorate, which advises me on drinking water quality matters, published a report on "Nitrates, Pesticides and Lead 1995 and 1996" which describes the actions being taken by the water companies to reduce levels of lead in water supplies. The measures taken include the replacement of lead communication pipes and table 5.8 in that report includes the numbers of such pipes replaced by Dwr Cymru in 1995 and 1996. In addition, Dwr Cymru's response to the Government's 10-point plan launched at the water summit describes the grants available from the company to its customers toward the cost of replacing lead supply pipes and plumbing. Copies of both reports are in the Library of the House.

<P>
<a name="70721w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government are committed to reviewing all the main areas of insecurity that affect pensioners. The key objectives of the review will be that pensioners should have an adequate income in retirement, that they should share fairly in rising national prosperity and that public finances should be both sustainable and affordable.
<P>

<a name="70721w24.html_para3">I have received a number of representations from hon. Members on the issue of retirement pension pay days. Retirement pension is a weekly benefit paid in advance from the first pay day, usually a Monday, on or after the 65th birthday. In assessing the impact on income, account needs to be taken of the fact that, although retirement pension is paid in advance, income received immediately preceding retirement, such as earnings and most social security benefits, are generally paid in arrears. Most pensioners are therefore entitled to a week's pension within a week of receiving their last income.
<P>

<a name="70721w24.html_para4">Account also needs to be taken of the fact that, as a consequence of the pension being paid in advance, any change of circumstances which would result in reduction of benefit, such as hospitalisation, is effective only from the next pay day. In addition, no benefit is recoverable in respect of the week in which the pensioner dies.
<P>

<a name="70721w24.html_para5">The estimated gross annual cost of paying retirement pension for the days between state pension age and the first retirement pension pay day is &#163;22 million.
<P>

<a name="70721w24.html_para6">We will announce shortly our pensions review which will examine all aspects of the basic pension and its value. We will consider any representations that are submitted on this issue.
<P>

<a name="70721w24.html_para7">We will retain the basic state pension as the foundation of pension provision, increasing it at least in line with prices.
<i>Notes 
</i>1. Estimate provided by the Government Actuary's Department. This cost is in 1997-98 prices and is the gross cost to the national insurance fund. Some &#163;1 million of this cost would be offset by reduced payments of widow's benefit where cases transfer from widow's benefit to retirement pension.

 The central information and technology unit, CITU, through its agent the Central Computer and Telecommunications Agency, CCTA, has set a model timetable and framework for Government Departments to follow to ensure that business-critical systems are year 2000 compliant and thoroughly tested well in advance of 2000. The Department is on course to meet this timetable.

<a name="70721w25.html_para1">The Department of Social Security has established a year 2000 project led by the Information Technology Services Agency, ITSA, to co-ordinate the extensive activity across DSS. An ITSA director, reporting to the chief executive, leads the work. There is a project manager and a core team of five staff to take the project forward within the CCTA-approved framework. In addition, each business unit has appointed co-ordinators and staff to work with the project which is working within the CCTA-approved framework for managing IT projects. The departmental board, chaired by the permanent secretary, is receiving regular reports on progress.
<P>

<a name="70721w25.html_para2">The project is on schedule. The Department's main computer systems have now been fully analysed for year 2000 compliance and plans to complete the necessary changes are being implemented. All the major benefit and recording computer systems supporting the day-to-day delivery of social security will be amended by the end of 1998 to permit a full year's processing before 2000. Like any large organisation, the Department also makes full use of a wide range of personal computers and commercial software packages. We are working closely with external suppliers to assess the year 2000 compliance of these products and other non-IT areas.
<P>

<a name="70721w25.html_para3">The total projected cost to the Department has been estimated at &#163;30 million. A further review is to be carried out at the end of August 1997 to enable updated, costed plans to be produced in October.

 One of our key aims is that delivery of service should be simpler and more efficient. To maintain and improve the level of service while keeping within announced spending totals, managers are proposing to move the processing of benefits from the Benefits Agency office at Uxbridge to the Harrow office but, as the hon. Member will see, the Benefits Agency guarantees that the range of services offered to the public will be unaltered. Queries on operational mattes are for the chief executive of the Benefits Agency, Peter Mathison. I have asked him to reply to the hon. Member directly and for his reply to be published with the answer.

<P>

</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The BA is currently undertaking a reappraisal of its services and the way they are delivered, in order to maintain and improve the level of service whilst keeping within the spending targets that have been set for the next two years.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The agency is committed to ensuring that people will get the help they need to claim the benefits they are entitled to. The Chilterns Area Directorate remains committed to providing a high level of service to its customers and equal access to the benefit system for all members of the public.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is proposed to move processing staff from Uxbridge to the Harrow site. The two offices are only 11 miles apart with excellent transport links. The range of services offered to the public will be unaltered. The BA would normally only consult with outside organisations in cases where there would be a significant change in services provided. In this case, in addition to consulting staff, outside organisations were consulted, as a matter of good practice. There are no plans therefore to extend the consultation period.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Staff have been aware of the proposals since November 1996, they were disclosed to local customer organisations earlier this year and have also been reported in the local press.

All comments and representations will be taken in account before any decision is made.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Until recently we have always had a full claims processing and claims maintenance operation at both Colham House, Uxbridge, and King's House, Harrow.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>However, when the new Job Seekers Allowance was introduced in October last year, we moved the processing and maintenance of claims for unemployed customers into the five local Job Centres. This is a more practical arrangement as it means that these customers can deal with both job search and benefits issues at the same time.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With our staff now spread over seven sites (5 Job Centres and 2 Benefits Agency offices) the building space at Colham House and King's House is not being used efficiently, and I have to look at ways of rationalising our estate to make the best use of resources and to ensure value for money.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Proposed Changes
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We propose to move all remaining processing and claims maintenance work from Colham House, Uxbridge to King's House, Harrow starting in November this year. There will be no change to the arrangements for personal callers who go to our Uxbridge office, and staff remaining at Colham House will be able to deal with all enquiries and make Crisis Loan payments as they do now.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Advances in Information Technology allow us to process claims off-site, and staff are linked by computer terminals and a telephone network to allow them instant access to customer information to answer queries and give advice.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As most of the contact we have with customers is by phone or correspondence, the changes would be largely invisible to your constituents. In fact we would expect to be able to raise the quality of the service we provide because of the increased viability gained from the merger of processing work into a larger unit.
</FONT></UL><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the longer term I would also be looking to improve caller facilities at Uxbridge by vacating Colham House completely and moving to more suitable premises in the town centre.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State today launched the historic new deal for lone parents, fulfilling the Government's manifesto commitment to help lone parents get off benefit and into work. In the first phase, up to 40,000 lone parents will be contacted over eight areas throughout the UK and offered help in finding work. Up to 4,300 lone parents will be contacted in north Cheshire, which includes Warrington, North. The programme will be rolled out nationally from October 1998.

<a name="70721w26.html_para0">The new deal for lone parents marks a radical new approach to welfare and is central to our plans for long-term reform of the welfare state. A unique feature of the scheme is the use of new technology to help co-ordinate benefit, employment and career services. This will start in Cambridge and later roll out across the other areas. From today, lone parents will be given a helping hand up into work, not just a hand out of benefit.
