Occasionally they are licensed to a benefice and may even receive a part-stipend in addition to their pension. The Pensions Board has discretion to suspend or reduce pension if the recipient is in work which falls within the definition of pensionable service.

 On 8 November 2005, Ofcom published research by the Generics Group <sup>1</sup> which examined the cost and power consumption implications of digital switchover for UK households. The report estimates that there are 24.8 million primary sets and 24.3 million secondary sets in regular use. This excludes television sets that are used exclusively for other purposes such as video gaming. Ofcom&#039;s most recent figures for digital take up were published on 9 December 2005. As of 30 September 2005, 65.9 per cent. of homes&#151;round 16.4 million homes&#151;can receive digital television services on at least one set.

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="51215w03.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 We have been quite clear since launching our Olympic bid three years ago that lottery proceeds would form a key part of the public funding package. We have allowed for up to &#163;1.5 billion to be raised in this way, some of which will be raised by new lottery games solely for this purpose. We expect the non-Olympic good causes to receive up to 5 per cent. less in income, as a result of sales diversion, over the eight-year period from 2005 to 2013. In addition, up to &#163;410 million will be redirected from the proceeds of non-Olympic lottery games after 2009.

Notes:<br>

1.The mid-2000 population estimates used in the 2002/03 settlement were based on the 1991 Census.<br>

2.Settlements for 2003&#150;04 to 2006&#150;07 have used population figures derived from the 2001 Census.<br>

3.Revised population estimates for 2001 and 2002 published by the ONS have been reflected in Amending Reports by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister.<br>

4.In the 2006&#150;07 Settlement, population projections for 2006 will be used for the dominant data drivers of population as this allows the settlement to be more forward looking. The mid-2004 population estimates have also been used but within wider indicators used in the top-up formulae.<br>

<p><a name="st_49"><a name="51215w06.html_spnew4"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 The Government have set out a full response to the Barker Review of Housing Supply on 5 December 2005. This builds on the Sustainable Communities Plan and seeks to deliver a better balance between housing supply and demand in every English region. We recognise that affordability problems are not exclusively a problem in London and the South East, but extend to the South West and into parts of the Midlands and hot spots in the North.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_37">We have announced a package of measures, including increases in housing supply, reforms to improve the planning system&#039;s responsiveness to the housing market and we are consulting on a planning gain supplement to provide funding to support additional housing supply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_38">By providing homes where demand is highest, we will tackle constraints to the continued economic development of the country as a whole. National growth is partly dependent on enabling the continued development of London and the South East. Constraints on London and the South East&#039;s housing supply and economic development are likely to harm the economy and job growth of the UK as a whole, given the links between regions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_39">Addressing constraints to growth in London and the South East should also reduce long-term regional disparities in house price inflation. This will enable people to move between regions to take advantage of employment opportunities. Labour mobility helps to reduce disparities between regions. In addition, improving the supply responsiveness of the housing market may also reduce inflationary pressures and all regions will benefit from lower economic volatility as well as lower real interest rates.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_40">We are taking steps to help northern regions to maintain the rate of improvement they have shown in recent years. We have set a regional economic performance target, jointly owned by ODPM, the Treasury and the Department for Trade and Industry, to help narrow the persistent gaps in economic growth rates between the regions. To meet this objective the Government have taken significant measures, in areas such as education, skills, employment and transport, to improve the economic performance of all the English regions.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Skills issued on 8 December the following written ministerial statement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_43">I am announcing today a step change in the support the Government provides to front-line professionals in children&#039;s services by leading the implementation of an information sharing index.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_44">The information sharing index is a key element of the Every Child Matters programme to transform children&#039;s services by supporting more effective prevention and early intervention. Its goal is to improve outcomes and the experience of public services for all children, young people and families. Better information sharing is essential for early and effective intervention. The index will provide a tool to support better communication among practitioners across education, health, social care and youth offending. It will allow them to contact one another more easily and quickly, so they can share information about children who need services or about whose welfare they are concerned.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_45">Our decision about the way forward with the index has been informed by substantial input from, and consultation with, many front-line practitioners and managers across a wide range of children&#039;s services organisations. We have also drawn extensively on the experience of local index approaches run under existing legislation by Trailblazer local authorities. Our conclusions respond to what stakeholders have told us they need to be able to do their jobs more effectively and take account of views expressed on the design of the index.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_46">The index will be a simple basic online system containing:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_16">minimal identifying information for each child; name, address, date of birth, gender, and contact details for parents or carers. Each child will also have a unique identifying number. In almost all cases this will be a scrambled version of their Child Reference Number (which all children are allocated when a claim for child benefit is made);</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_17">contact details for their educational setting and GP practice and for other practitioners or services working with them; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">where a practitioner judges it appropriate and necessary, an indicator showing that they wished to be contacted by other practitioners because they have relevant information to share, are taking action, or have undertaken an assessment in relation to that child.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_47">No case information will be held on the index. Children, young people, or, where appropriate, their parents or carers will be able to ask to see their records and to challenge any inaccuracies, in accordance with data protection legislation.

</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para14">
There will be a single central index with its data partitioned into 150 parts, one relating to each local authority in England. A central index will ensure that the system works for children who move areas or who access services from more than one area. Partitioning the data will ensure local authorities take the lead in maintaining the accuracy of the data for children living in their area.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para15">
<a name="stpa_48">To avoid double-inputting of data and to ensure high standards of accuracy, information on the index will be drawn from and updated through existing systems. It will use proven technology.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para16">
<a name="stpa_49">Technical access to the index will be either through the practitioner&#039;s existing case management systems, via a web link or, where an approved practitioner has no access to appropriate IT facilities, via another approved user who does have IT access.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para17">
<a name="stpa_50">The Government are determined that the index will be as secure as possible, and will therefore ensure it complies with rigorous security standards. Access to it will be granted only to authorised users who have undergone appropriate checks, including those provided by the Criminal Records Bureau. Practitioner use of the index will be audited to ensure information is only accessed where it is necessary for practitioners to do so, and so guard against inappropriate access by authorised users.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para18">
<a name="stpa_51">The Government are today making available a report on local authority Trailblazer experience. Copies will be placed in the Library of the House.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para19">
<a name="stpa_52">The experience of the Trailblazers identifies significant benefits in the effectiveness of services. These include improved access to information to inform action, better identification of children not receiving universal services, and better multi-agency communication and information exchange. Scope for significant efficiency gains has also been demonstrated from time saved by practitioners on such tasks as identifying other services involved with a child, tracking down and contacting the individual practitioners involved, and making wasted referrals to services already involved with a child. These savings have been quantified as worth over &#163;88 million per annum across England. We do not intend to reduce funding for children&#039;s services, but instead to enable savings realised to be reinvested in more and better services for children and more effective use of staff time. We anticipate that this will enhance staff satisfaction with their jobs.

<a name="stpa_53">The Government will commit substantial resources to the index. One-off implementation costs will be an estimated &#163;224 million over the next three years&#151;this includes the costs of adapting systems that will supply the data to the index and adapting the day-to-day systems used by practitioners so they can access the index from their own systems. It also includes the cost of ensuring the original data supplied to the index is accurate, that there are robust systems in place to ensure security, and that staff are trained to use the index properly. Operating costs, thereafter, will be &#163;41 million per year. Most of these costs will fund the additional staff needed to ensure the on-going security, accuracy and audit of the index. Both set-up and running costs 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Dec 2005 : Column 2200W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
will be funded by central Government, so that the costs to local authorities do not form a pressure on the council tax.

<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para21">
<a name="stpa_54">Our plan is that a technically robust, secure and accurate index is available to support children&#039;s services across England by the end of 2008. To enable this to be achieved we plan to publish draft regulations under Section 12 of the Children Act 2004, which will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. An initial set of regulations in spring 2006 will provide the necessary vires to allow trials to take place for the creation of the initial records. We then plan to publish in autumn 2006 the main regulations to govern the operation of the index. We will consult publicly on draft regulations in the summer/autumn of 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w06.html_para22">
<a name="stpa_55">Implementation will be led by a dedicated project team within DfES. The Project Team will continue to work closely with local authorities, users and other stakeholders to ensure that developments continue to be relevant and lead to more effective practice. Building on the current knowledge gained by the local authority Trailblazers, the project team will directly and actively seek the views of children, young people and families and will ensure those views are taken into account as we develop the index.&quot;

who hold one or more A level (or AS equivalent) qualification on entry. The average score given is based upon the A&quot; level points for the student&#039;s best three A&quot; levels (or AS&quot; equivalents). For 2002/03 onwards, figures are based upon students who hold either GCE A&quot; level or VCE A&#039; level qualifications. The average score given is the average tariff points score based upon all A&quot; level qualifications (not just the best three).<br>

 The Government do not fund free nursery education places for children aged two and there are currently no plans to do so. However, local authorities are fully funded to meet their statutory responsibilities to deliver a free part-time place for three and four-year-olds through their Education Formula Spending Share (EFSS)&#151;their main education budget. Overall resources are determined by means of a national formula, taking into account local factors including deprivation, ethnicity and area costs. From April 2006 funding for the free entitlement is being consolidated within the new Dedicated Schools Grant (DSG) arrangements. This will place a ring-fence around education spending while maintaining flexibility for local authorities to determine the distribution of funding in the light of local needs and circumstances.

<p><a name="st_80"><a name="51215w09.html_spnew10"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 The decision to restrict the requirement to register to commercial flocks of 50 or more birds was based on advice from an expert group which considered that only flocks of this size would be likely to play a significant role in the spread of Avian Influenza. From a logistical point of view it was seen as a priority to focus on gathering information from these larger flocks. Once this has been achieved, it will be possible for owners of smaller flocks to register on a voluntary basis should they so wish. We could also revise the mandatory requirement to include smaller flocks at a later date, should experts and others consider that this would confer sufficient added benefits to justify the costs.

 In July 2004 the House of Commons Commission agreed that a permanent screen should be installed in front of the front row of the Public Gallery.

This resulted in the need to install a horizontal timber shelf to connect the new glass screen to the front panel, thus reducing the proportion of Members&#039; seats which are visible from the Public Gallery.

<p><a name="st_141"><a name="51215w16.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 The role of charities in anti-retroviral treatment (ART) provision reflects the strength of charities in health services more generally, including as a health provider and in improving demand. DFID has funded two reviews recently, suggesting that charities and other civil society organisations make up a large proportion of the service provision in health in many countries. They are also often the provider of choice of the poor even if they have to pay. Charities have a particular role in fragile states or states emerging from conflict. Many charities working in the field of HIV and AIDS are able to reach marginalised groups that Governments do not, such as intravenous drug users. They have also shown ability in reducing the stigma and discrimination associated with AIDS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w16.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_104">DFID recognises that increased delivery of health services and drugs, including anti-retroviral treatment, needs to be matched by investments in poor and vulnerable people&#039;s ability to demand services and hold service providers to account. Charities and other civil society organisations have a role in promoting an open debate about treatment and care, and in increasing the accountability of Governments. DFID also recognise that these organisations have an important role to play in advocacy and in giving communities a greater voice in ensuring the delivery of quality services. They are also critical for communicating information about services to communities, which increase people&#039;s access, ensure people understand the requirements of treatment (treatment literacy) and the importance of adhering to drug regimes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51215w16.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_105">While recognising the primary role of Government in ensuring that health services are provided to people, DFID is exploring ways to better support charities and other civil society groups. In 2000, we supported the Christian Health Association of Nigeria (CHAN), an organisation focused on co-ordinating the network of Christian voluntary health services in the country, and giving people access to health care that was previously unobtainable.
