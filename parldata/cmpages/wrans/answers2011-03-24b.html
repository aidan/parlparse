From 2011-12, each Department will provide revenue funding from its own Departmental Expenditure Limit to support private finance initiative schemes relating to services for which it has policy responsibility. Therefore, the figures for private finance initiative funding 2011-12 only cover the allocations in respect of schemes for which this Department has responsibility. As a result, the figures imply there has been a £766 million reduction, when there has actually been an increase in private finance initiative revenue funding.</p>

 Although the Home Office and UK Border Agency have made grant payments to fund charitable organisations over the past five years and may continue to do so in the future, it would not be possible to fully answer this question to the level of detail required without incurring disproportionate cost. To do so would require investigating more than 300 not-for-profit recipients, and identifying whether they, in turn, make payments to charities as a lead partner.</p>

 I do not consider that there is merit in a change from the current arrangements in favour of stricter liability. The general principle in considering negligence is that the victim needs to prove that the defendant's actions caused the accident. It would be an anomaly if this was changed for collisions with pedestrians and cyclists. Also, it could lead to unfair results in cases where the motorist is driving entirely responsibly and the accident is caused by the irresponsible or negligent behaviour of a cyclist or pedestrian.</p>

 In January of this year a web-based survey was launched to gauge the opinion of Reserve personnel and their employers. This survey was publicised through the chain of command and in-house defence publications. In the month that it was online, the survey received approximately 7,500 responses which are currently being collated and analysed. Senior Reservist personnel have also been co-opted on to the bodies overseeing the study, and a number of written submissions from Reservists and others have been received.</p>

 The future extent of reservist integration with Regular forces is a central component of the study. To develop the role played by the Reserve forces and deliver cost effectiveness for Defence we believe there are several avenues for investigation. We are also analysing the extent to which other nations (particularly the US) integrate their Reserve and Regular components.</p>

 We believe that the indefinite detention of detainees is unacceptable, and we have repeatedly called for Guantanamo Bay to be closed. On 6 July 2010 the Prime Minister confirmed to Parliament that we will continue to request the release from Guantanamo Bay and return to the UK of Shaker Aamer, the final remaining former legal British resident. The Government have reiterated this request to the US Government on numerous occasions. Both the Deputy Prime Minister and I have raised Mr Aamer’s case with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. We are actively engaged at senior official level in pursuing our request with the US Administration. However, the outcome of these discussions is uncertain and any decision regarding Mr Aamer’s release is a matter for the United States Government.</p>

 The UK is at the forefront of efforts within the EU and the wider international community to bring pressure to bear on the Belarusian authorities, following the fraudulent election and crackdown on the opposition and human rights defenders last December. We have been vocal in advocating a tough EU response, such as re-imposing targeted sanctions on the individuals responsible for human rights abuses. We have repeatedly demanded the release of those detained on political grounds, both at a national level and through our membership of international organisations, such as the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, Council of Europe and at the UN Council on Human Rights.</p>

 It is a condition of their employment that members of the diplomatic service must be prepared to serve anywhere in the world at any time during their career, sometimes at very short notice. Those with children have a legal obligation as parents to ensure that their children receive a full-time education from the age of five years. Most parents prefer to take their children with them abroad, but in some countries we do not permit staff to take their children either for health or security reasons. In others, local schools of an acceptable standard are not available. Continuity of education is also an important factor, particularly at secondary level.</p>

 According to International Monetary Fund figures, economic growth across the Palestinian Territories was 6.8% in 2009. The west bank’s economy grew at 7.2% in 2009; however, much of this growth was derived from higher Government spending and international aid rather than from exports, which fell in that period. The west bank’s economy continues to be constrained by a number of factors, including movement and access constraints on goods and people, and poor investment confidence.</p>

 We recognise the importance of passporting entitlement to disability living allowance to additional forms of help and support such as the Blue Badge scheme and exemption from vehicle excise duty. Therefore we are considering carefully how passporting arrangements will operate as we develop the assessment criteria for personal independence payment. We are working across Government and with the devolved Administrations to ensure that measures can be taken to maintain passports where appropriate. Where applicable we have also taken the legislative measures in the Welfare Reform Bill to enable continuing passporting arrangements.</p>

 No they will not. Every effort is made to ensure that lone parents who move from income support to jobseeker's allowance, as their youngest child reaches the relevant age, continue to receive their payments without interruption. The change does require the customer to make a claim with HMRC to child tax credits for their children if they are claiming child dependency addition, as this is not available under jobseeker's allowance. However, this is completed on the customer's behalf to ensure that the lone parent's level of benefit is maintained, albeit from two separate sources, during the transition.</p>

 We want the EU budget to be smaller, so that our domestic efforts to cut the deficit are not undermined by growth in EU spending. At 43% of the EU budget, CAP cannot be immune to the hard choices being made elsewhere. There must, therefore, be a very substantial cut to the CAP budget during the next financial framework which starts in 2014, as part of a wider strategy to deliver budgetary restraint by identifying savings across the EU budget.</p>

 Levels of support for farmers under common agricultural policy schemes are generally determined by detailed EU rules which apply to all claimants under the schemes in question. In most cases, therefore, payments to one eligible claimant would not be expected to impact on payments to another eligible claimant. The exception would be where there is an element of competition for set funding, for example, the Higher Level Stewardship scheme. But then the key issue is not the size of the claimant's farm, but the extent to which a claimant meets the criteria set for the scheme in question.</p>

 The Government are committed to encouraging people from all walks of life and all religions to come forward to foster or adopt looked after children. The revised National Minimum Standards coming into force on 1 April 2011make clear that anyone interested in becoming a foster carer or adoptive parent should be treated fairly, without prejudice, openly and with respect. The statutory frameworks for foster care and adoption certainly do not prevent a person holding Christian or other particular religious beliefs from becoming a foster carer or adoptive parent.</p>

 We have no plans to introduce emergency life skills in the national curriculum.

Schools often ask organisations such as the Red Cross and St John Ambulance to provide pupils with information about first aid and dealing with emergency and risky situations.</p>

In addition, if Priesthorpe applies for a school games organiser post, then they will receive funding from DCMS and Department of Health to enable that post holder to work for three days a week to carry out the role of school games organiser. Schools can use their own funds to top up this post to a full-time role, if they wish.</p>

 The non-statutory programmes of study for personal, social, health and economic (PSHE) education in England currently provide a context within which schools teach pupils about the importance of parenting. In particular, the personal well-being programme of study sets out how young people should learn about the roles and responsibilities of parents, carers, children and other family members, as well as the skills and qualities needed in parenting, and their importance to family life.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 23 March 2011]:</i> The Secretary of State for Education has already appointed a group of practitioners and experts led by Sally Coates, Principal of Burlington Danes Academy, to review the whole framework of teachers’ standards, which includes the Qualified Teacher Status standards. There is a range of experience of initial teacher training provision on the group, both from the perspective of schools and from Teach First. The group is currently considering how it will engage other experts, the profession and its representatives and those who use the standards, including ITT providers.</p>

 Ministers travelled to the Cabinet meeting in Bradford by train. A coach was hired at a cost £750 to transport Ministers from Leeds train station to the venue and back to the station. Ministers combined their attendance with visits to services and projects in the area. Departments will have incurred additional costs associated with travel to Leeds train station but this information is not held centrally by the Cabinet Office. The total cost of hiring the venue for the Cabinet meeting in Bradford was £2,279 including catering and other related costs. Therefore, the central cost of the Cabinet meeting in Bradford was £3,029.50.</p>

Before placing a medical device on the market, the manufacturer must meet the relevant safety, quality and performance requirements set out in the regulations and apply the CE marking of conformity. Any assessment required under the regulations is carried out by a third-party independent certification organisation known as a Notified Body. The Agency is not part of this certification process but does designate and audit UK Notified Bodies as being competent to undertake this task and also assesses pre-market clinical investigation protocols. The Agency has a mainly post-market surveillance role which includes assessment of adverse incidents brought to its attention and enforcement where breaches of the regulations have been identified.</p>

While data are not available in the format requested, research published in 2010 found that there was a greater fall in prevalence in 16 and 17-year-olds in England following the increase in the age of sale than in older age groups (Fidler J. and West R.

In its electricity market reform consultation, DECC published a number of policy options for a capacity mechanism. These included options that would in principle enable generation capacity as well as energy to play a role in the market.

 The Government recognise the importance of keeping transmission losses to a minimum. Minimising losses reduces the amount of electricity that needs to be produced, in turn resulting in lower carbon emissions and other costs. National Grid is incentivised to minimise transmission losses as part of its annual system operator incentive scheme set by Ofgem. In addition, Ofgem is considering whether further incentives should be placed on Transmission Owners in the next Transmission Price Control Review (2013-21) to help reduce losses and how these would operate. This will be covered in Ofgem's strategy decision document, due to be published on 30 March 2011.</p>

The first Research Excellence Framework assessment will be in 2014. Higher Education Innovation Funding is allocated to higher education institutions to support their interactions with business and other users.

               <a name="11032486000022"> Collaborations between business and academe are enabled through a range of activities by the Technology Strategy Board, not all of which involve funding partnership with the research councils. Overall, through its support for collaborative research and development (R and D) projects, the Technology Strategy Board has provided support to approximately 1,500 unique businesses and about 2/3 of projects have at least one academic partner (more may have academic sub-contractors). Furthermore, there are currently over 1,000 live knowledge transfer partnerships, and each of these is a partnership between business and the knowledge base, a majority of which will be higher education institutes. Such partnerships are likely to continue going forward, but it would not be possible to specify numbers as projects as individual collaborative R and D projects can range from £10,000 to £100 million, and are funded on the basis of their technical and economic merit with no pre-set targets for the number of partnerships.</p>
