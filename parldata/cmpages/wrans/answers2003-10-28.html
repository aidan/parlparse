 Short Money is allocated under three headings: general funding, travel expenses and the costs of the office of the Leader of the Opposition.

The amounts available in 2003&#150;04 for general funding and the office of the Leader of the Opposition are &#163;2,935,041 and &#163;548,102 respectively. Full travel expenses have yet to be claimed.
<P>

<a name="31028w01.html_para5">Cranborne Money is the House of Lords equivalent of Short Money. It must be used by the Official Opposition exclusively in relation to their parliamentary business.

 Local Criminal Justice Boards are newly formed partnership comprising key stakeholders including the Police, the Crown Prosecution Service, Probation and the Courts.

 The Government have commissioned an independent review of the regulation of legal services aimed at promoting competition and innovation and improving services for consumers and we are reviewing future demand for legal services and the suppliers needed particularly in the publicly funded sector.

 Since the launch of the CLS in April 2000 more than 200 Community Legal Service Partnerships have been set up, covering more than 99 per cent. of the population of England and Wales.

<P>
<a name="31028w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 This matter was last raised internationally at the ICAO 33rd Assembly in 2001, when the overwhelming majority of States spoke out against the introduction of a tax on aviation fuel. Analysis by the European Commission has also suggested that an EU-wide tax would deliver minimal environmental benefit. However, the Government remain committed to finding alternative ways of applying the 'polluter pays' concept to civil aviation. Information is contained in the joint HM Treasury/Department for Transport discussion document "Aviation and the Environment: Using Economic Instruments", published in March 2003.

 The Department provides funding to local authorities for bus priority measures such as quality bus corridors which, in 2002&#150;03, put in place almost 900 kilometres of improved bus routes.
<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para4">The Department has published Good Practice Guidance on Quality Bus Partnerships and has facilitated their provision on a statutory basis through powers in the Transport Act 2000, making them enforceable by traffic commissioners. Many such partnerships comprise one or more bus corridor improvements.
<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para5">The Bus Partnership Forum has published an information pack, "Bus Priority: The Way Ahead", to help local authorities get the most out of bus priority measures including bus corridors.
<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para6">Research shows that quality partnership schemes typically increase bus patronage by between 5 per cent. and 20 per cent. within the first 12 months of operation. These schemes also contribute towards modal shift, with surveys showing that around 33 per cent. of new users had previously undertaken their journey by car.

[133989]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31028w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The setting of bus fares in a deregulated market is a matter of commercial decision for bus operators. The appropriateness of a flat-rate fare system (with concessions for those statutorily entitled to them) will depend on the size of the urban area concerned and on travel patterns within it. Many operators are simplifying their fare structures in the light of evidence that this is what customers prefer.
<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para7">The Department's booklet, "Protecting Bus and Coach Crews", advises that simplifying fare structures can reduce the scope for disputes between passengers and drivers. This booklet is currently being revised by the Safer Travel on Buses and Coaches Panel (STOP).
<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para8">In April 2002, the Department published "Get on Board: an Agenda for Improving Personal Security in Bus Travel", including advice to operators and local authorities on using fare structures to reduce the scope for conflict between drivers and passengers.

<a name="31028w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department's Local Transport Plan (LTP) funding provides local authorities with the resources from which they can develop bus/rail interchange facilities. The LTP guidance highlights the benefits of developing seamless travel conditions at interchange points where rail and bus services can dovetail to enable fully integrated journeys.
<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para10">The West Yorkshire Passenger Transport Authority which has Centre of Excellence status, has, for example, developed a network of modern bus interchanges in the major urban centres of the county many of which provide bus/rail links. These have the latest designs which have resulted in significant improvements in user satisfaction, and increases in passenger throughputs. They are also developing a significant number of bus/rail interchange facilities at smaller rail stations.

<P>
<a name="31028w03.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 Information about where bus tickets are sold is not held centrally. This is essentially a matter for local decision. Multi-journey tickets, particularly weekly and monthly travelcards and carnets, are commonly sold off the vehicle.
<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para12">The Department's booklet "Protecting Bus and Coach Crews" advises that the use of pre-paid tickets reduces the scope for disputes between passengers and drivers and the risk of theft created by carrying large amounts of cash on the bus.

<a name="31028w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Transport Act 2000 empowers local authorities to make ticketing schemes covering local bus services which may include travel on connecting rail or tram services. Operators themselves may agree inter-available tickets within the terms of the Public Transport Ticketing Schemes Block Exemption Order. This Order covers journeys by bus, rail, tram or ferry.
<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para13">The "Plus-bus" scheme run by "Journey Solutions" and funded by transport operators, provides an add-on bus option to rail tickets at either or both ends of a train journey.

<a name="31028w03.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The Department is providing significant funding to improve rural bus services through the Rural Bus Subsidy Grant (RBSG) and Rural Bus Challenge (RBC). This has enabled local authorities to address the transport needs of rural communities, including where necessary the provision of services from rural train stations.
<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para15">The Department has recently conducted research on the impact of RBSG and RBC funding. This showed, for example, that in allocating RBSG, several authorities gave attention to reducing barriers to travel and promoting social inclusion, by considering access and interchange requirements. More than a quarter of the authorities responding to the study's survey, specifically sponsored services that provided improved bus-rail interchange.




<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2003 : Column 147W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para16">The research also showed that RBC funding has allowed and encouraged the development of complex schemes involving feeder services to main routes. In Lincolnshire, for instance, the Interconnect scheme has sought to remove barriers to travel by combining infrastructure and vehicle improvements with new service patterns revolving around guaranteed interchange and, increasingly, demand responsive transport.
<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para17">The Department's Local Transport Plan funding has also enabled examples of good practice in rural rail/bus links. Cornwall which is one of the Centres of Excellence has established the first "bus branch line" in the UK. Work on the project, which fully integrates rail and bus services was completed in September 2000 and the service now operates between Redruth train station and Helston.

<P>

<a name="31028w03.html_para19">Civil enforcement of bus lanes in London by London local authorities and Transport for London (TfL) has been enabled by powers contained in Part II of the London Local Authorities Act 1996. Such enforcement is carried out using bus mounted cameras, roadside cameras and closed circuit television cameras. Under the bus lane enforcement camera project run by TfL, 



<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2003 : Column 148W</I><P>
836 buses have been equipped with cameras and 46 roadside cameras have been installed to date. In addition, the following 12 London authorities are currently using closed circuit television cameras to enforce bus lanes in their areas: Bexley, Camden, Croydon, Ealing, Enfield, Hammersmith and Fulham, Haringey, Lambeth, Newham, Southwark, Waltham Forest and Wandsworth. In 2001&#150;02, 290,231 penalty charge notices were issued by London local authorities and TfL for bus lane contraventions.

 From June 2001 the Transport Act 2000 provides a standard minimum requirement for concessionary travel in England which guarantees half fares for all pensioners and disabled people on local buses, with no charge for the pass. Local authorities may make more generous provision at their discretion. From 1 April this year concessionary travel schemes are available to men aged 60 to 64, bringing them into line with women of the same age.

statutory walking distances from school. Under the Transport Act 1985 local authorities have a power to provide concessionary travel for school children, and for young people aged 16 to 19 who are undergoing full-time education (see table). That power applies to all journeys, not just those to or from school. Some bus operators offer reduced fares for young people on a commercial basis. These schemes will vary from time to time.

 The Bus Partnership Forum recently produced a report, "Understanding Customer Needs", which was placed on the Department's website in May 2003, and has been widely publicised among operators and local authorities.

<a name="31028w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McNulty: </B> 
 The extension this year of the minimum statutory requirement to men aged 60&#150;65 cost &#163;50 million per year. The Government does not plan further extensions of concessionary fares. We estimate that free concessionary travel for pensioners in England (women aged 60 and over, men aged 65 and over) would cost in excess of an extra &#163;300 million a year. We have not costed all the variants listed in the question and could do so only at disproportionate cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer of 15 October 2003, 



<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2003 : Column 155W</I><P>
<i>Official Report</i>, column 240W, on road deaths, whether the information provided by the Dutch on new traffic arrangements at various sites in North Holland indicated decreases in casualties; and what reasons were given by the two UK authorities for considering more familiar techniques rather than the measures used in North Holland.  [134106]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31028w04.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 Information was supplied on 15 locations in North Holland that had been treated in innovative ways. Only two of the locations had an injury accident record showing more than one injury per year (one had two in a single year, one had three). Of the 15 treatments, 13 were neutral in their influence on injuries, one may have saved injuries and one may have put injuries up. In all cases, though, the casualty numbers are very small.
<P>

<a name="31028w04.html_para6">No specific reasons were given by UK authorities, in discussion with Department officials, for not including measures used in North Holland. The discussions took place while the authorities were considering various approaches in the design of traffic management for the areas under consideration. Removing traffic signals was just one technique in the approach used in North Holland for sharing space. We are not aware that either of the UK sites had traffic signals but the authorities were considering a range of techniques similar to those used in North Holland. Lower vehicle speeds plays a key part in this. Reducing the dominance of motor vehicles allow alternative urban treatments aimed at providing a more equal allocation of space for all road users.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many vehicles are outside the vehicle registration system; and how many of these will be brought back into the system through the measures set out in the Regulatory Impact Assessment for the Road Vehicles (Registration and Licensing) (Amendment) (No 3) Regulations 2003.  [134749]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31028w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 October 2003]:</i> These are currently 2.1 million vehicles on the vehicle record with no current keeper details, although not all of these will be in use on our roads.
<P>

<a name="31028w05.html_para0">As I announced on 22 May, I have set the DVLA tough new targets in relation to Continuous Registration, which have to be achieved by 2007. One objective is to halve the number of vehicles outside the system, either by relicensing them or by removing them from the road.
<P>

<a name="31028w05.html_para1">The purpose of the regulations is to stop further seepage out of the system by making keepers of vehicles responsible for taxing them until the DVLA are informed that the vehicle has been sold or taken off the road. This will be assisted by enhanced checking procedures for the identity of new keepers when DVLA is informed of a change of keeper.
<P>

<a name="31028w05.html_para2">In addition, as a result of the publicity that will accompany the new arrangements, it is anticipated that many unlicensed vehicles will be brought back onto the register by their keepers relicensing them.
<P>

<a name="31028w05.html_para3">Vehicles outside the system will be dealt with through enhanced enforcement measures&#151;mainly wheel clamping and removal&#151;undertaken by the DVLA. Since April 2002 local authorities can now take on the powers of DVLA in clamping unlicensed vehicles. 14 authorities have these powers already, three are being inducted into their use currently and a further 27 are in talks with DVLA about taking on these powers. This will complement DVLA's own wheel clamping capacity and will ensure that vehicles currently outside the system are properly dealt with.

difficulty in returning to civilian life; and if he will make a statement on his assessment of the emotional changes that can result.  [121522]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31028w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 In my statement of 17 September 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 51WS, I drew Member's attention to the King's College London research paper published on the same day. It confirmed the MOD's assessment that although joining the armed forces is generally a positive experience, with the overwhelming majority of Service Personnel who have difficulty making the transition back to civilian life. Personnel most vulnerable to problems of transition include those discharged for medical reasons, including mental health conditions, as well as those dismissed for disciplinary reasons, premature leavers and those discharged as temperamentally unsuitable.
<P>

<a name="31028w05.html_para4">The MOD has a comprehensive range of measures to prevent or help deal with these potential difficulties. All Service Personnel who are medically discharged are entitled to the full resettlement package available to personnel serving prescribed lengths of service, including a career transition workshop, financial and housing briefings and individual interviews with a career consultant who is available for up to two years after discharge. When Service Personnel are medically discharged, the Veterans Agency automatically considers entitlement to pensions and allowances under the War Pension Scheme. Disablement pensions are tax-free and not income-related. The scheme includes a range of supplementary allowances to address the disabling effects of accepted disorders, for example, mobility and care. The War Pensioners' Welfare Service, located throughout the United Kingdom, provides war pensions advice, information and help to access appropriate services. When personnel leave the armed forces, their medical management becomes the responsibility of the national health service (NHS). Since the 1950s war pensioners have been entitled to NHS Priority Treatment for their accepted disorders.
<P>

<a name="31028w05.html_para5">The MOD has recently developed an Early Service Leavers Initiative which involves a programme to improve the transition process for those who leave early for whatever reason and are not eligible therefore, for the full resettlement package. The overarching aim is to create a resettlement umbrella that will cover all Service leavers. The Initiative provides for a range of measures that will include a mandatory resettlement interview to assess vulnerability, provide guidance on access to Job Centre Plus and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits, housing associations, financial matters and give contact details for the ex-Service charities and other welfare organisations.
<P>

<a name="31028w05.html_para6">As part of the Veterans Initiative, projects are in place or being developed on housing and homelessness and employment issues. Many of these involve the voluntary sector. Close contact is also being maintained with the DWP Pathways to Work Project and MOD is represented on the Social Exclusion Unit's Mental Health Project. This is inter-Departmental and is looking at how to improve employment rates for adults with mental health problems, both in terms of take-up and retention of jobs and how to promote greater social participation and access to services for this group. The Department of Health (DoH) has designated mental health in the community at large as one of its key 



<P>
<P><I>28 Oct 2003 : Column 159W</I><P>
priorities. MOD is working closely with DoH colleagues to explore better services including delivery of mental health services for veterans and improved access to services. This will include work to increase Service leavers' and veterans' awareness of NHS facilities and services and to brief health professionals on military matters and culture.

<P>

<a name="31028w06.html_para0">The CHP industry believe that supplying operators in this situation with allowances for free from a limited CHP set-aside may act as an incentive.

We are considering this and other options in the draft National Allocation Plan which we intend to publish for consultation in early December, giving industry an opportunity to comment on the various options.

 It is not possible to give a precise date for any such relaxation of current beef export controls. We have submitted papers to the European Commission to support our case for lifting restrictions and these are now being considered by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA). EFSA's opinion is expected in early 2004. In addition an inspection by the EU Food and Veterinary Office is likely to be required.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether <i>(a)</i> the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea and <i>(b)</i> the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries has scientific evidence on the connection between fishing effort by the UK fishing fleet and the levels of fish stocks in UK national waters; and if she will review fisheries management systems including those applied by the Faeroese and Icelandic industries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31028w07.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 In recognition of the migratory behaviour of the fish species concerned, stock assessments and related work are carried out on identifiably discrete stocks of fish, rather than according to national boundaries. For the same reason they are carried out by independent international organisations, which combine data from most of the main countries and fleets that exploit each stock in order to assess their impact on stocks. As part of this process, the scientists from the UK who attend the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) and the Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries, (STECF) therefore submit data on our national catch, and on fishing effort, to inform the discussions. I expect the report being prepared on fisheries by the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit to cover a broad range of issues related to fisheries management, including possible alternative management systems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31028w07.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 October 2003]:</i> As biofuels can be produced from mainstream arable crops, a large proportion of the UK's 4.2 million hectares of arable land (2001&#150;02 figures) is suitable for growing biofuel feedstocks. The key factor in determining the amount of land used is the need for the market return to the farmer to be sufficient to motivate diversion from production for established food and animal feed markets. Achieving the Biofuels Directive's reference target of 5.75 per cent. use of biofuels by 2010 would require the production of biofuels from waste vegetable oil, plus feedstocks from around 1 million hectares of agricultural land.

Ozone and its precursors can be transported over hundreds of kilometres making ozone a transboundary pollutant. Local emissions of precursors do not generally make a significant contribution to local ozone concentrations in the UK.
<P>

<a name="31028w08.html_para3">The most important components of winter smog are particulate matter (PM10) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2). PM10 is a complex mixture of local primary combustion particles, mechanically generated particles and secondary particles formed in the atmosphere from oxides of nitrogen and sulphur dioxide and transported over hundreds of kilometres. 18 per cent. of UK PM10 emissions are from road traffic sources and 42 per cent. of NOX emissions are from road traffic sources. The contribution from road traffic sources to ambient concentrations in cities during winter smog episodes is likely to be higher than implied by national emission totals. Studies suggest that between 25 per cent. and 40 per cent. of PM10 concentrations and 50&#150;70 per cent. of oxides of nitrogen concentrations are likely to be derived from road traffic in urban areas.

 The Government does not have information on the number of employers paying less than the nationally agreed rate or the national minimum wage in the construction industry.
<P>

<a name="31028w09.html_para3">We are not being complacent on the enforcement of the national minimum wage. The Inland Revenue completed over 6,200 investigations in 2002&#150;03, identifying more than &#163;3.5 million in minimum wage arrears on behalf of underpaid employees in the economy as a whole. The National Minimum Wage (Enforcement Notices) Act 2003 also came into force on 8 July 2003. The Act makes it absolutely clear that Revenue officers can issue enforcement notices (an instruction to employers requiring them to start paying the minimum wage to workers and make good any arrears of pay) on behalf of former workers as well as current ones thus closing an enforcement loophole.

<i>[holding answer 27 October 2003]:</i> The purpose of Consumer Direct is to increase the provision, quality and consistency of consumer advice across England, Scotland and Wales. Current unmet demand for consumer advice is estimated at up to 1.5m calls per annum ("DTI Consumer Helplines Study", February 2002).
<P>

Local Authorities, working in partnership within the English Government Office regions, Scotland and Wales, will be responsible for running Consumer Direct contact centres. These centres will provide advice on individual consumer problems and complaints via telephone or e-mail, or will refer consumers to local Consumer Support Network members if further help is required, or to other organisations who are better placed to assist. Consumer Direct will allow existing advice services to focus their skills and resources where they can add most value, in particular helping vulnerable consumers, providing face-to-face advice, implementing education programmes and clamping down on rogue traders and scams.

 An answer to the question could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="31028w09.html_para7">Information on UK trade, published by HM Customs and Excise, gives figures for selected regions of the world but these do not correspond to the regions required. It would, therefore, be necessary to use data for UK trade with individual countries and aggregate them to arrive at the totals for the required regions. UK trade data prior to 1988 are not available electronically so compiling this part of the answer would require manual entry of 6,000 numbers. Another 6,000 items of data would have to be downloaded from the trade database for more recent information on UK trade. Downloading recent data is complicated by various political changes that have taken place over the period in question, such as the break up of the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia, as well as the German unification. As a result of these changes, several countries did not exist in the earlier years but do now, while some that did exist earlier no longer do so. Finally, the combined set would have to be aggregated to provide trade statistics for the specified regions.
<P>

<a name="31028w09.html_para8">The second part of the question requires a comparison of trade by the UK and the World. Information on world trade is available from the International Monetary Fund (Direction of Trade Statistics), but again, their regions do not correspond to those required to answer the question. For example, the IMF grouped centrally planned economies together, as a separate "region", although geographically they were in (Eastern) Europe, Asia and Central America. It would be necessary to calculate regional totals from those for individual countries. The IMF data are not available in electronic form so this procedure would entail manually compiling a database consisting of 30 years' worth of data for around 200 countries for two trade flows (imports and exports).
<P>

<a name="31028w09.html_para9">For strict comparability, it would be advisable to use the IMF source for UK trade rather than Customs' figures. In all, this would entail manually compiling a

<P>
<P>
<a name="31028w11.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Discrimination on the ground of pregnancy or maternity is a form of direct discrimination on the ground of sex. The courts have interpreted the Sex Discrimination Act as meaning that discrimination on the ground that a woman is, or might become, pregnant is unlawful. This is reinforced by the amended Equal Treatment Directive published on 5 October 2002, which says that less favourable treatment on the grounds of pregnancy and maternity within the meaning of the Pregnant Workers Directive constitutes sex discrimination.
<P>

<a name="31028w11.html_para8">In 1999, the Government introduced specific protections to prevent women from suffering detriment and from being unfairly dismissed or selected for redundancy for reasons connected with their pregnancy, childbirth or maternity leave. We have also ensured a women has a clear right to return to her job after maternity leave, on the same terms and conditions as if she had not been away.

<a name="31028w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 There will be no additional cost to local authorities resulting from the implementation of the Licensing Act 2003. Fees will be set by the Secretary of State at a level that will allow the full recovery of all costs relating to their duties under the Act. There will therefore be no additional cost to council-tax payers as a result of the new regime.

 <i>[holding answer 27 October 2003]:</i> We have discussions with the gun trade associations on a range of issues. Most recently we have been discussing the problems which have arisen as a result of criminals converting air weapons which use the self-contained gas cartridge system to fire conventional ammunition. It was not possible to modify these guns to prevent conversion and we have therefore made provision in the current Anti-Social Behaviour Bill for future manufacture, importation, transfer or sale to be prohibited. Existing owners will be able to retain their guns provided they obtain a firearms certificate.

<a name="31028w12.html_para5">Legislation and law enforcement alone cannot solve the problem and it is vital that community groups, local authorities and those involved in service provision, including education, engage with us in taking action to deal with this problem. Community groups have therefore been involved in the two national meetings my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has chaired, with a third meeting due to be held on 25 November. We are planning a community engagement event in January, to bring together community activists, representatives of voluntary organisation, law enforcement and policy officials to take forward this dialogue and support community involvement in tackling gun crime. The Government have also made available &#163;1.5 million of recorded assets receipts to support community involvement.

Many of these Operations have forged good links with the communities they serve by establishing Independent Advisory Groups, made up of members of the local community.

<a name="31028w13.html_para4">Males below the age of 15 or those assessed as vulnerable will normally be placed in one of two Secure Training Centres, Rainsbrook in Warwickshire or Hassockfield in Durham, or in a local authority secure community home.

This is a positive step towards implementation of the 2 December 2002 ceasefire agreement between the two parties. Further talks to resolve outstanding issues including an implementation timetable, immunity, army integration and registering the FDD as a political party, are due to take place soon.

 We continually monitor the security situation in Rwanda and Burundi. The Government of Rwanda has made a concerted effort to bring security to the country. In this they have been broadly successful. However, the conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Burundi make the border areas potentially dangerous. The security situation in Burundi is unstable. But, there has been a positive development recently in Burundi with the signing of the Pretoria Protocol on 8 October on power sharing between the Force pour la Defence de la Democratie (FDD) (Nkurunziza) and the government of Burundi. Only the Forces Nationales de Liberation (FNL) (Rwasa) lies outside the peace process.

 The Government believes that there is a strong case for a single, coherent constitution for the European Union. In effect, the existing treaties already make up a constitutional structure. However, they are overly complex and unclear. For this reason, the Government supports redrafting, restructuring and consolidating the treaties.

 We are aware of reports that Interahamwe militia and ex-Forces Armees Rwandaises (ex-FAR/I) in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are regrouping.

We are encouraged by the recent statement of the Transitional National Government (TNG) in Kinshasa, that the TNG would no longer tolerate the presence on its national territory of the ex-FAR/I. The recent visit to Kinshasa by a high-level Rwandan delegation to discuss how the two countries can work together to help resolve this problem is a further positive sign.

<a name="31028w16.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Government are firmly committed to their Modern Apprenticeships (MA) programme across all sectors, including the photographic sector in England. We have demonstrated that by first commissioning and then, jointly with the Learning and Skills Council, implementing the recommendations of the Modern Apprenticeship Advisory Committee. Photography featured in the Modern Apprenticeships TV advertisements last year aimed at young people. Under Sir Roy Gardner a business-led Modern Apprenticeship Task Force is taking a key role in promoting MA to employers and thereby contributing to increased take-up. In doing so we are able to raise both the quality and expand the number of opportunities available. This action supports the Government's broader aims announced in our Skills Strategy White Paper "21st Century Skills" published recently.
<P>

<a name="31028w16.html_para1">The Learning and Skills Council in England determines the allocation of MA places for each sector based on local labour market needs. It is working closely with the Connexions Service, the new Sector Skills Councils (SSC) and others to increase demand for places from both young people and employers. While the number of MAs in the photographic industry is currently small, it is planned that Skillset the Trailblazer SSC for the Audio Visual Industries will shortly include Photo-Imaging, offering an exciting opportunity to further develop effective training for the sector. The number of MAs in learning are at the highest level since they were introduced in 1994&#151;at 234,100. Over 750,000 have started since 1997.

 There are two types of student loan. Borrowers who started their courses before the 1998/99 Academic Year are liable to repay fixed-term (mortgage-style) loans. Income contingent loans apply to the vast majority of borrowers who entered higher education from the 1998/99 Academic Year.
<P>

<a name="31028w17.html_para2">Under the mortgage-style loans scheme, a student can apply to defer their loan repayments for a year at a time if their income is not more than 85 per cent. of national average earnings. This deferment threshold is recalculated annually in line with figures published by National Statistics, and is currently &#163;21,364 for the year starting 1 September 2003. Any change to the 85 per cent. threshold would require primary legislation and we have no plans to make such a change.
<P>

<a name="31028w17.html_para3">The threshold for repaying income contingent loans is an annual income of &#163;10,000. Borrowers over this threshold are liable to repay 9 per cent. of their income over &#163;10,000. The repayment scheme came into effect in April 2000. The level of the threshold will rise to &#163;15,000 from April 2005.

 The amount of income needed for a teacher to become a higher rate tax payer will depend on their own and their family's circumstances.

 It will be for Regional Housing Board to prioritise the use of resources the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has provided to the east of England amounting to &#163;330 million over two years (2004&#150;05 to 2005&#150;06).

For the whole of England there were estimated to be 501,000 households i.e. 2.4 per cent.

 Hertfordshire is an area with strong housing pressures and very high house prices. Much of the county is covered by green belt.

 The New Millennium Experience Company (NMEC) was responsible for maintaining the Dome, and decommissioning its contents, from its closure on 31 December 2000 to end of June 2001. During this period, NMEC incurred expenditure of &#163;8.2 million funded by the Lottery, although partially offset by net income of &#163;3.9 million from the sale of assets following closure.

<a name="31028w18.html_para7">English Partnerships (EP) took over responsibility in July 2001, since when it has incurred expenditure of &#163;6.3 million on maintaining the Dome, up to the end of August 2003. EP has also incurred expenditure of &#163;6.7 million on decommissioning the Dome's contents and site preparation for its long-term use, and &#163;7.4 million in connection with the current sale process, from February 2001 to the end of August 2003. &#163;6.7 million was spent by EP on the earlier competition to find a long-term use for the Dome, which began in March 1999 and ended in February 2001. EP has received income, net of VAT, of &#163;0.9 million for events held at the Dome since it became available for such use at the end of 2001, thereby reducing the amount of public money used to support the Dome. The remaining EP expenditure, and their future costs, will be recovered from eventual sale proceeds.

 These credits were introduced in 1983 to remove the need for many men in the 60 to 65 age-group, whose occupational retirement age was 60, to register as unemployed solely in order to obtain unemployment credits. These automatic credits effectively replaced unemployment credits for the majority of these men. We are unable to estimate the cost because not all people who are awarded these credits need them for benefit purposes.

 The upper age limit for carer's allowance was abolished with effect from 28 October 2002. The allowance for those over 65 years is subject to the same rules as those which apply when a person below the state pension age is entitled to more than one Social Security benefit.

<a name="31028w21.html_para0">Only one benefit at a time can be paid in full for income maintenance. Both state pension and carer's allowance provide a measure of income replacement for individuals who have reached pension age. In these circumstances one benefit has to be adjusted by reference to the other.

We plan to run the test until the end of the calendar year and the findings will be evaluated in the New Year. Before starting the test at Wembley, we communicated widely with local groups representing customers with disabilities, to encourage them to cooperate in the use of the test form and to provide feedback, which will form a valuable part of the evaluation process. No decisions will be taken on further use of the new form until after the test results have been evaluated.

<a name="31028w22.html_para4">The National Care Standards Commission (NCSC) was established under the Act as part of the Government's reforms to modernise the regulatory system for care services and independent healthcare. The NCSC is an independent, non-departmental public body, acting at arm's length from the Department. It regulates statutory and independent sector care services in accordance with the regulations and national minimum standards that flow from the Care Standards Act, to ensure consistency and improve the quality of life and level of protection of some of the most vulnerable people in society.

<a name="31028w22.html_para5">The interpretation and implementation of the regulations and standards is a matter for the NCSC, as the independent regulator, based on appropriate legal advice. It is for the NCSC, as the regulator, to satisfy itself that care home providers have complied with the regulations to ensure that care home residents' health, welfare and well-being are being protected. Providers have a right of appeal to the independent Care Standards Tribunal against the decisions of the regulator.

 The National Health Service has a general duty under section 3 of the National Health Service Act 1977 to provide nursing services to such extent as it considers necessary to meet all reasonable requirements. This duty has been delegated by the Secretary of State to primary care trusts (PCTs) pursuant to section 16B of the 1977 Act and section 17 of the same Act gives the Secretary of State the power to direct a PCT about the exercise of those functions. The National Health Service (Nursing Care in Residential Accommodation) (England) Directions 2001 directed the NHS to provide nursing care for all care home residents, where nursing care had the same meaning as in section 49(2) of the Health and Social Care Act 2001. PCTs are required to follow these Directions and guidance has been issued to PCTs about the practical operation of the system

 The Department has received representations from the Royal College of Radiologists, the Society of Radiographers and others about waiting times and staff shortages in radiotherapy. We are working with the Society of Radiographers and the Royal College of Radiologists to look at all ways of increasing the radiotherapy work force. We have increased the number of therapy radiographers by 10 per cent. since 1997 and to ensure future growth, we have more than doubled, by 111 per cent., the number of training places at universities. We are also extending the careers of radiotherapy staff through new ways of working, which will allow staff to develop and extend their roles in the profession. We have also increased the number of clinical oncologists by 28 per cent., with numbers set to rise further.
