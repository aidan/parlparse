To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on his action to promote inward investment into Wales; and if he must seek the approval of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry before making any offer to a potential investor.  [66136]<P>

<P>
<a name="90118w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We continue to create an attractive commercial and economic environment for indigenous as well as inward investing companies. My right hon. Friend will be leading an inward investment mission to North America in the Spring, hosting events for inward investors, promoting Wales generally and meeting potential investors to further Wales' prospects of even greater success. These activities are in addition to the work undertaken by the strengthened Welsh Development Agency and other bodies in Wales.
<P>

<a name="90118w01.html_para14">Although there is no requirement to seek the approval of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry before making offers of support to potential investors, offers of assistance are subject to inter-Departmentally agreed rules designed to ensure appropriate co-ordination of assistance offered across the UK. These rules are currently being revised to reflect the devolution settlements and the revised arrangements will be set out in a concordat on financial assistance to industry, which we hope to publish shortly.

<a name="90118w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 For 1999-2000, I am making &#163;5 million available to local authorities in bus subsidy grant, which is in addition to the support for socially necessary services provided by local authorities out of their unhypothecated resources. Of the &#163;5 million, &#163;3 million must be spent on support for rural bus services, with local authorities free to decide whether to spend the remaining &#163;2 million on either rural or urban services. I am currently consulting on the distribution formulae used to allocate the grant to individual local authorities, and I will be announcing the allocations shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what factors were used by the Driving Standards Agency to determine acceptable distances for customers to travel to other driving test centres following the closure of their local facility.  [65351]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 We consider what would be reasonable distances for customers to travel to take their test, based on information from customer surveys, analyses of the postcodes of test candidates, and in the light of experience gained from establishing the new network of driving theory tests centres. In general, candidates should not have to travel further than 7 miles in administrative districts with a population density of 1,250 or more persons per sq. k, 30 miles in districts with a population density of fewer than 100 persons per sq. k, and 20 miles elsewhere.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what factors have resulted in changes in the criteria for the closure of driving test centres over the past 10 years.  [65355]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The criteria of operational suitability, cost efficiency and a safe environment for staff and customers have remained unchanged during the period. However, the fall in demand for driving tests during the 1990s has resulted in a need to rationalise the estate to reduce overcapacity, which would otherwise be a burden upon costs and therefore test fees. As part of this process, we have established guidelines for the maximum a candidate should have to travel to a test centre: 7 miles in administrative districts with a population density of 1,250 or more persons per sq. k, 30 miles in districts with a population density of fewer than 100 persons per sq. k, and 20 miles elsewhere.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the consultative process prior to closure of driving test centres is used in all cases.  [65350]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Yes, except when we have to close a test centre temporarily or at short notice, owing to health and safety, or operational reasons. In such cases, consultation before closure may not be possible. The Driving Standards Agency gives as much notice as possible to interested parties about a closure and the alternative arrangements that are being made.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what savings have resulted from the closure of driving test centres in each year since the inception of the Driving Standards Agency; and what future savings resulting from closures of driving test centres have been planned for.  [65356]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Driving Standards Agency estimates that, since the start of the 1993 financial year, savings in rent and rates payments of &#163;700,000 have accumulated as a result of closures. Figures from before then are not available. There has also been over &#163;1 million of capital receipts from the sale of freehold properties.

<a name="90118w02.html_wqn5"><B> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what factors have contributed to falls in demand for <i>(a)</i> practical and <i>(b)</i> theory driving tests in each of the regions, with particular reference to the effect of the introduction of the theory test on demand; what assessment the Driving Standards Agency has made of future changes in demand for theory and practical tests; and what steps will be taken to meet changes in demand.  [65352]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The key factor underlying the number of candidates coming forward for a driving test is the number of young persons becoming eligible to obtain a driving licence. 54 per cent. of theory test candidates and 55 per cent. of practical test candidates are aged under 20 years.
<P>

<a name="90118w02.html_para4">Overall test demand is also strongly influenced by the pass rate as this affects the number of retests being taken by unsuccessful candidates. The national average pass rate for car theory tests is currently 59 per cent. and 47 per cent. for car practical tests.
<P>

<a name="90118w02.html_para5">The theory test has added another step to the learning to drive process, though it has probably not deterred people altogether. Applications for practical tests reflect the staged-testing process and also a recent fall in the theory test pass rate.
<P>

<a name="90118w02.html_para6">Demand for the practical test may temporarily increase in the first months of this year as candidates try to pass before the introduction of the longer practical test in the Spring, with an offsetting decrease afterwards, but in the longer term returning to recent levels.
<P>

<a name="90118w02.html_para7">No special regional factors have been identified.
<P>

<a name="90118w02.html_para8">The Driving Standards Agency has introduced more flexible staffing arrangements to cope with fluctuations in demand.

 The development of standards for construction products, including drainage pipes, is a matter for the British Standards Institution in co-operation with European standards bodies. More detailed specifications for sewerage pipes are developed by the water industry, as was indicated in an answer on 7 July 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>480-81</i>, to a Written Question from the hon. Member for Lichfield (Mr. Fabricant). These standards are not formally endorsed by my Department and are thus not subject to Government policy.
<P>

<a name="90118w03.html_para4">Regulation 7 of the Building Regulations requires that building work which is subject to the Regulations should be carried out using proper materials which are appropriate for the circumstances in which they are used. As the blockage of a drain or sewer can be anticipated at some time during their lifetime, it is not unreasonable to expect the pipe to be able to withstand normal cleaning activities.

At this early stage in the review it cannot be said whether or not the listing will need to be amended.

 As part of the Government's programme of regular financial, management and policy reviews of non-departmental public bodies, we are to conduct a review of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. The review will evaluate the role and performance of the Royal Commission in order to make recommendations on its future development; in particular on the scope, focus and impact of the Commission's inquiries; and on its working methods and resources, and how these are managed. In carrying out the study, my Department will consult widely with relevant organisations and with those who have experience of the Royal Commission's work.

<P>
<a name="90118w04.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The only station that passengers are currently prevented from entering between 8 and 10 am each Monday to Friday is Chancery Lane. This is because of long-term engineering work on escalators.
<P>

<a name="90118w04.html_para0">However, there are occasions where stations implement what is known as 'station control' for safety reasons, thereby preventing overcrowding on platforms. This is where passengers are prevented from entering the system until platforms have been cleared. This usually lasts for only a few minutes, though in extreme cases, the station may close completely for a short while.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to review the operation of the Warsaw convention in relation to air accidents as it applies to <i>(a)</i> United Kingdom-based airlines and <i>(b)</i> airlines using UK airports; and if he will make a statement.  [66394]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w04.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Warsaw convention is an agreement relating to international carriage by air. Signed originally in 1929, it has been the subject of a number of amendments which have not necessarily been ratified by all the original signatories. Although the United Kingdom has ratified all the amendments currently in force, the operation of the convention in relation to international carriage performed by foreign airlines using UK airports will depend upon the level of accession to the convention by the foreign airline's country of origin and the airline's conditions of carriage. The convention, as amended by the Hague Protocol 1955, applies in the UK by subordinate 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 307</I><P>
legislation to domestic carriage performed by any airline but with numerous modifications, including an uplifting of passenger liability limits. Protocol No. 4 of Montreal 1975 has recently entered into force and provision for implementation, for both international carriage and, with modifications, for domestic carriage, is currently the subject of consultation. I expect two draft Orders in Council for approval by resolution of each House to be laid soon.
<P>

<a name="90118w04.html_para1">To coincide with the entry into force of Council Regulation 2027/97 in October last year, Parliament adopted the Air Carrier Liability Order 1998 which introduced, for the purposes of national legislation giving force to the Warsaw convention for both international and domestic carriage, unlimited liability for passenger claims with strict liability up to 100,000 SDR for United Kingdom and other Community airlines.
<P>

<a name="90118w04.html_para2">The International Civil Aviation Organisation plans to hold a Diplomatic Conference later this year for the purpose of adopting a new convention intended to replace all previous Warsaw instruments and broadly to align the liability provisions with those of the Council Regulation. Officials from my Department have been involved in the development of the new convention and the United Kingdom will participate actively in the Conference.

The Cleaner Vehicles Task Force has also set up a sub-group to consider the merits and longer term potential of alternative fuels. The Energy Saving Trust's Powershift programme, funded by the Government, provides grants towards alternatively fuelled vehicles, and the costs and performance of vehicles purchased under the scheme are monitored and evaluated.

 The Energy Saving Trust's Powershift programme, funded by the Government, provides grants towards alternatively fuelled vehicles including those running on road fuel gases. 73 local authorities have so far benefited from Powershift grants for gas vehicles. My Department has also funded the first stage of the ALTER (Alternative Traffic in Towns) project which is a Europe-wide initiative that encourages local administrations to purchase clean vehicles and to convert existing vehicles to cleaner fuels. To date 32 cities, towns and counties in the UK have signed up to this initiative.

 The Franchising Director regulates Virgin's Saver and Weekly Season Tickets.

<a name="90118w04.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Coloured road surfaces have no meaning in law, and are not prescribed in the current Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions (TSRGD). However, coloured surfaces are commonly used to give prominence to a section of the carriageway set aside for a particular purpose. In the case of cycle lanes, my Department is considering including guidance in the new Local Transport Note on Signs for Cycle Facilities to be published after the new TSRGD is published later this year. The Highways Agency will also be publishing its own general guidance--Coloured Surfacing in Road Layouts (Excluding Traffic Calming)--in February, and this will include some advice on the use of coloured surfaces for cycle lanes.

 The UK policies on exports and imports of waste are set out in the "United Kingdom Management Plan for Exports and Imports of Waste", which was published on 16 May 1996. The Plan came into effect on 1 June 1996.
<P>

<a name="90118w04.html_para3">Under the Plan imports of waste from European Community Member States, with the exception of Ireland and Portugal, for disposal by high temperature incineration are being progressively phased out under an annual quota. The quota is due to expire on 31 May 1999.




<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 309</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90118w04.html_para4">There is, at present, an apparent inconsistency over whether waste imported under the quota needs to be disposed of, or simply imported into the UK, by 31 May 1999. Following public consultation on this issue, my Department today placed in the Library of both Houses an amendment to the Plan, making it clear that the waste must arrive at the appropriate disposal facility by 31 May 1999. This amendment will come into effect on Tuesday 19 January 1999.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for what reason yachts registered under the Merchant Navy Act 1894 must be re-registered every five years.  [66361]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w05.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The previous registration regulations were largely based upon the Merchant Shipping Act 1894 and so represented the requirements for registration at that time. Unfortunately there was no provision for deleting vessels from the register, unless notified by the owner, where they had been sold to a foreign owner. More importantly, ships that were sunk could not be removed either. Over time this meant that many ships remained on the register when in fact they did not exist. Additionally, owners have not always updated their address when they moved which has resulted in out of date information being held.
<P>

<a name="90118w05.html_para0">The new regulations aim to keep the data more accurate whilst minimising the effect upon owners. An up to date register will be easier to administer and enable us to transfer all relevant records to our computer database without the additional cost involved in transferring redundant information. This in turn will enable us to keep registration costs as low as possible. We will also have accurate records to assist Coastguards in an emergency 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 310</I><P>
and will be able to confirm current ownership quickly if registered owners find themselves in difficulty in foreign ports. Finally, it will enable us to discharge our international obligation to maintain the register more effectively and provide data to those that require it i.e. transcripts, etc., in an improved and efficient manner.

 <i>[holding answer 14 January 1999]:</i> The Government were concerned to ensure that the British public were provided with factual and balanced reporting of Operation Desert Fox. Journalists reporting from Baghdad were, and are, subject to considerable restrictions on access and information. It was particularly important, therefore, that live coverage of and commentary on Operation Desert Fox from Iraq should explain, and take account of, such restrictions. This was made clear to media representatives, including in the BBC, on a number of occasions.

 The Defence Medical Services (DMS) Study Team comprised four military officers, including representation from all three Services, and two civil servants. The study work formed part of their normal duties and there were therefore no additional staffing costs to the defence budget. Travel and subsistence costs incurred by the team amounted to some &#163;1,000.
<P>

<a name="90118w05.html_para5">The team's conclusions and the Defence Secretary's vision for the future were published in a booklet sent to every member of the DMS. Printing costs totalled some &#163;9,672.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w05.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to the letter of 3 October 1998 (D/Min/DP/Jb3521/98/M) from the Minister for Defence Procurement to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, what progress was made in 1998 by his Department in reducing its use of controlled substances under the Montreal Protocol whenever acceptable alternatives were available, and to minimising emissions of materials where they must still be used; and if he will provide specific examples.  [65388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w05.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has programmes in place, where technically feasible, to convert equipment and facilities to use materials that do not deplete the ozone layer. However, owing to the complexity and inevitable length of these programmes, the progress made during 1998 should be seen in the context of longer-term developments.
<P>

<a name="90118w05.html_para6">The Royal Navy has reduced the total installed charge of CFC-12, used in marine refrigeration and air conditioning systems, from 40 tonnes at the beginning of 1996 to 8 tonnes by the end of 1998. New refrigeration equipment was procured last year to enable the conversion of the remaining surface vessels by the end of 1999 and the conversion program for the Trafalgar class submarines was started. During 1998, the Army continued trials of alternatives to halon fire extinguishants for use in armoured vehicle engine compartments and two alternative refrigerants are being evaluated for specific vehicle applications. The RAF completed a study that identified alternatives to the CFC solvent used in cleaning of oxygen equipment and also eliminated the use of the CFC necessary for the maintenance and testing of the VC10 cabin conditioning equipment. A modification programme was initiated to replace the CFC in refrigerators on the E3 Sentry and is due for completion by the middle of this year.
<P>

<a name="90118w05.html_para7">For applications where no acceptable halon alternatives have been identified, my Department, through the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency, and the Royal Navy continued their research into new chemical fire extinguishants and water mist technologies.

<P>

<a name="90118w05.html_para8">To minimise emissions of the controlled substances, the Royal Navy has procured and is installing high integrity valves and flexible refrigerant hoses for its vessels. A lubricant additive was successfully evaluated, procured and installed in most vessels to assist in the detection of leakages. Competitive tenders for electronic leak detection equipment are currently being assessed, following the successful completion of an evaluation program. All the Services have procured equipment and introduced procedures to recover the materials for recycling during system maintenance. Education and training of users of ozone depleting substances are featured in the comprehensive package of environmental protection courses made available by the RAF to all members of the Department during 1998.

 <i>[holding answer 14 January 1999]:</i> Farm tourism is growing in importance, with a 3 per cent. increase in visitors between 1996 and 1997. In areas where agriculture or traditional industries are in decline, tourism can help economic development and create jobs.

<a name="90118w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Overall, between 1991-92 and 1997-98 average payments to lawyers in the Crown Court increased by 66 per cent. including disbursements, 63 per cent. excluding disbursements. Excluding the most exceptional cases, that is the top one per cent. of the most expensive cases, which may distort the overall figures, average payments to defence lawyers in the remaining 99 per cent. of cases increased by 82 per cent. compared with an inflation rate of 18 per cent. over the period. Among the reasons for the increase in average payments in those 99 per cent. of cases are fewer guilty pleas, resulting in more effective trials, and more work claimed per case by defence lawyers.

<P>
<P>

 Between 1991-92 and 1997-98 average payments to defence lawyers in the Magistrates Court increased by 11 per cent. inclusive of disbursements, or 12 per cent exclusive of disbursements. Over the same period the aggregate rate of inflation was 18 per cent. 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 322</I><P>
However, the introduction of Magistrates Court Standard Fees in June 1993 will have reduced the average payment because more individual payments are being made in respect of the same defendant. For example, payments in respect of Bail Act offences are now paid as a separate fee rather than being included in the payment for the case as a whole.

To ask the Minister of State, Lord Chancellor's Department what estimate he has made of the increased costs of litigation which will arise from the right of lawyers providing representation, pursuant to conditional fee agreements to uplift their costs by up to 100 per cent. in successful cases.

<a name="90118w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As the right hon. and learned Gentleman is aware, the maximum uplift allowed in a conditional fee agreement was set at 100 per cent. by his noble and learned Friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern in 1995 in the Conditional Fees Order 1995. I am not aware of any assessment that was made at that time or before the figure was set. We shall be undertaking research and monitoring into the operation of conditional fees and to that end my officials have already begun discussing with the profession and other consumer and interest parties what form this research and monitoring may take.

It is an ever expanding market with new products coming into the market all the time. I am aware of at least eight providers of insurance to underpin conditional fees. I doubt that a comprehensive list exists or can be put together given the vibrant and expanding nature of this market.

<a name="90118w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The consultation document "Joining Forces to Protect the Public", published on 6 August 1998, included proposals to align probation area boundaries with police force area boundaries, which would mean combining the Devon and Cornwall probation areas. We are now carefully considering the replies received, including that from the hon. Member for Truro and St. Austell, and expect to announce decisions about the future organisation of these services soon.

<a name="90118w11.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We announced, as part of the Comprehensive Spending Review in July, that fire authorities in England would get an increase in the fire service element of total standard spending of &#163;143.6 million--an average annual increase of 3.5 per cent.--over the next three years, including &#163;47.1 million (3.6 per cent) for 1999-2000. The Review recognised future funding pressures, including pensions, but we have also deliberately set challenging efficiency targets for the fire service, as for other key public services.
<P>

<a name="90118w11.html_para0">As part of the provisional local government finance settlement for 1999-2000, we made changes to the fire standard spending assessment distribution formula, which will help those authorities which are facing the highest potential liabilities for pensions. Under the provisional settlement, London's fire standard spending assessment would be increased by 3.8 per cent. for 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="90118w11.html_para1">We are considering the responses to the consultation document on the review of the firefighters' pension scheme and expect to come forward with proposals in the coming months.

 Arrangements to compensate special constables who are injured on duty are contained in the Special Constables Regulations. The 1995-96 Special Constabulary Working Group reviewed these arrangements and recommended a number of improvements. Proposals for new regulations were circulated to the police staff associations, the Association of Police Authorities and the special constabularies in December 1997. As a result, representations were received from:

<P>
<a name="90118w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The information has been provided by the Police Complaints Authority (PCA).
<P>

<a name="90118w11.html_para5">The Police Complaints Authority has a statutory obligation to supervise the investigation of complaints involving death or serious injury. It also has discretion to 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 333</I><P>
supervise any other complaint investigation where, in its view, the public interest makes it appropriate. A police force may also voluntarily refer a matter. If no complaint is made by a member of the public, then the referral of the case remains a decision for the force concerned.
<P>

<a name="90118w11.html_para6">Prior to 1993, PCA statistics did not separately identify the supervision of investigations into deaths involving police vehicles. In the calendar year 1993, the Authority supervised investigations into eight cases involving seven deaths. From 1 January 1994 to 31 March 1995 (when statistical recording changed from calendar to financial year) 16 investigations into deaths associated with police vehicles were supervised by the Authority. 12 of those involved some form of pursuit. In 1995-96 it supervised 27 such investigations with 21 involving police pursuit. In 1997-98 29 investigations were supervised and 9 of those involved pursuit.

 Figures are not available centrally in exactly the categories requested, as statistics collate pursuit accidents with those arising from immediate responses to emergency call. Collection procedures changed in 1993 to include all police vehicle accidents on the roads. These range from minor-damage-only incidents to serious ones involving injury or death. The information set out in the table has been provided by Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary, to which forces submit statistical returns.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w12.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department under what circumstances police authorities are permitted to charge promoters for the costs of crowd policing outside <i>(a)</i> sporting events and <i>(b)</i> entertainment events.  [65489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is for chief officers of police to decide when to charge for providing a police service. However, under Home Office guidelines, no charge should normally be made for officers deployed on the public highway outside sporting or entertainment venues.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in how many cases periods of extended supervision for sexual and violent offenders were imposed under the provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 between 30 September and 31 December 1998.  [65567]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 These provisions were commenced on 30 September 1998. Information about extended sentences is being collected on the Home Office court proceedings database but will not be available until the autumn of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many local child curfew schemes were made by local authorities under the provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 between 30 September and 31 December 1998.  [65566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The relevant provisions of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which enable local authorities to establish a local child curfew scheme, were brought into force on 30 September 1998. Home Office 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 336</I><P>
guidance on the operation of these new powers was issued on 29 September 1998. Before imposing a local child curfew, local authorities, in consultation with the chief officer of police and such other persons or bodies that it considers appropriate, must first draw up proposals for a local child curfew scheme, including arrangements for consultation with the residents in the area in which the curfew is to apply, and submit these to the Secretary of State for approval.
<P>

<a name="90118w12.html_para0">No applications for local child curfew schemes have been received at this early stage. Local child curfew schemes are designed to be part of an integrated response to reducing crime and disorder in local areas. In considering their potential use, local authorities will wish to take into account the wider crime and disorder reduction strategies, also required under the Crime and Disorder Act, which are currently being developed.

<P>
<a name="90118w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The investigation of alleged offences is an operational matter for chief officers of police and information is not collected centrally on the number or type of investigations being conducted by the police.

 This Department has received 10 letters and a petition.

<a name="90118w12.html_para1">The Coal and Other Mines (Horses) Regulations 1956 set out the requirements about the use of horses and ponies in mines.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the number of criminal conviction certificates which will be issued per year; and what plans he has to introduce a code of practice governing the use of such certificates.  [65965]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We estimate that there will be between 5 million and 6 million conviction certificates issued each year. Under section 122 of the Police Act 1997, a code of practice for registered bodies (which will be entitled to receive copies of enhanced criminal record certificates and criminal record certificates) will be developed in consultation with interested parties. In the case of criminal conviction certificates, it will be for the individual concerned to decide to whom to provide the information contained in them. We shall, however, consult about guidance to employers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether it is Government policy to encourage the use of the criminal conviction certificate in the assessment of candidates for employment.  [65966]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 No. It will be up to individual employers to decide whether to ask to see a criminal convictions certificate. Criminal conviction certificates will only give details of unspent convictions. This is information which applicants can be asked to disclose at the moment. The criminal conviction certificate will allow employers to be sure that the information they have been given is full and accurate.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the cost of providing police protection at Chevening House, Kent in the last year for which figures are available; and what is the additional daily cost when the Foreign Secretary is in residence.  [66007]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 It is established Government practice not to disclose the actual cost of protecting an individual. If the costs of protection were revealed, it would be possible to estimate the scale of protection and that would prejudice the security of the individual. For the same reason, we are unable to disclose details of protection provided.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received concerning the time taken to process applications for the renewal of visas for foreign nationals currently living in the United Kingdom; and what steps he has taken to reduce the time.  [65728]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 I regularly receive representations concerning the time taken to process such applications. The introduction of compulsory application forms for most immigration applications has enabled a large number of straightforward applications to be decided quickly. The current computerisation and restructuring of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate's caseworking functions is intended to speed up caseworking times. This restructuring is now underway and, until it is completed and the new structures have settled down, the major upheaval involved will inevitably affect processing times.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will exempt adult volunteers working in youth organisations from paying the fee required by the Criminal Records Bureau for checks on full-time employees working with young people.  [65871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We considered very carefully whether there was any way in which free checks could be provided for volunteers. Whilst we acknowledge the valuable contribution volunteers make, we have concluded that it will not be practicable to provide any free checks from the Criminal Records Bureau for volunteers or for any other groups. We realise that this is unwelcome news, but providing free checks would prove an unsustainable burden on the public purse, and may increase demand for certificates from the Bureau to an uncontrollable extent. In addition, we do not consider it would be fair to allow 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 338</I><P>
volunteers to have free certificates when there are other equally deserving groups such as the unemployed or the disabled. The cost of the fees for certificates from the Bureau will be kept to the minimum necessary to recoup costs.

 I refer the hon. Member to the reply I gave him on 19 January 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column<i> 387</i>. Whilst some replication of experiments is needed to ensure the reliability of previous research, the Inspectorate will not recommend that a licence be granted unless there are good reasons for replicating work already undertaken.
<P>

<a name="90118w12.html_para2">In regulatory toxicology, we are currently encouraging regulatory authorities and testers to make full use of reduction, refinement and replacement alternatives, including the possibility of data sharing, in order to reduce the need for animal tests.

<P>
<a name="90118w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 We have been reviewing the criminal injuries compensation scheme in the light of the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Review, and are considering whether any changes to the scheme might be necessary or desirable. That consideration includes the awards for injuries resulting from sexual offences. We hope to be able to announce shortly how we intend to carry this forward.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Criminal Injuries Compensation Board advise that there is no data to distinguish loss of earnings from other elements of compensation paid in respect of claims settled by them under the scheme based on common law damages. The approach was often to make an inclusive award which encompassed a loss of earnings element, but which did not quantify it precisely.
<P>

<a name="90118w13.html_para0">The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority advise that under the tariff-based scheme, introduced with effect from 1 April 1996, the amount of compensation paid for loss of earnings is as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what was the average time taken to settle claims for criminal injuries compensation by the CICA and its predecessor the CICB in each year from 1990 to the present.  [65925]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 There are no meaningful average waiting times for settling claims for criminal injuries compensation. Claims under the scheme vary greatly in their complexity. They range from straightforward ones, 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 340</I><P>
in which a decision may be issued within a matter of weeks, to exceptionally complex cases where, for example, the medical diagnosis or prognosis is uncertain, and where therefore, it may take a number of years for the injury to be fully and fairly assessed. Interim payments are usually made in such cases to assist the victim in the shorter term.
<P>

<a name="90118w13.html_para7">The Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA) and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board (CICB) advise that--if cases at the extremes are discounted--the average time to issue a first decision under the 1990 scheme (administered by the CICB) was about nine months. Under the tariff scheme (administered by the CICA), the average time is about seven months.

<a name="90118w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Home Office estimates that minimum sentences of three years for those convicted for a third time of domestic burglar will add between 4,000 and 4,400 to the prison population over 10 years. The build up will be gradual because the new provision applies only when all the offences are committed after implementation (in December 1999) and one of the two previous offences was committed after the offender had been convicted of the other.

 The Government value greatly the work of the Law Commission. The recommendations on involuntary manslaughter and corporate killing contained in their report no. 237 "Legislating the Criminal Code: Involuntary Manslaughter" raise some difficult and complex issues.

 <i>[holding answer 13 January 1999]:</i> Yes. The Government were concerned to ensure that the British public were provided with factual and balanced reporting of Operation Desert Fox. Journalists reporting from Baghdad were, and are, subject to considerable restrictions on access and information. It was particularly important, therefore, that live coverage of and commentary on Operation Desert Fox from Iraq should explain, and take account of, such restrictions. This was made clear to media representatives, including in the BBC, on a number of occasions.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if the British Consul in Yemen has been allowed to see the fifth British national detained; and if he will make a statement on the role of the Foreign Office regarding the detention of the five British nationals.  [66089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 Our Consul-General had access on 14 January to the fifth British detainee, Malek Nasser Harhara (to whom access has been denied on the grounds that he is a Yemen/British dual national). Mr. Harhara said that he was in satisfactory health and had not been physically abused.
<P>

<a name="90118w14.html_para0">The Consul-General had called on three of the detainees on 8 January. All three looked in reasonable condition. Of these, one detainee, Sarnad Ahmed, said that he had been tortured in the week after his arrest on 24 December 1998, but that his treatment had improved since then. The Consul-General reported that he appeared now to be in good health.
<P>

<a name="90118w14.html_para1">I made clear to the Yemeni Prime Minister on 11 January my concern about the allegation of torture. Dr. Iryani said that only one of the detainees had complained. He had investigated the issue personally. If the claim were found to be true, whoever was responsible would be prosecuted. Dr. Iryani assured me that the detainees would be properly treated.
<P>

<a name="90118w14.html_para2">A second detainee, Shahid Butt, told our Consul-General that, in the week since his arrest of 24 December 1998, he had been hit once or twice and slapped, and made to sign a paper. The Consul-General reported that he looked fit and well. He complained that there was no light in his cell at night and that he could not go to the toilet when he asked, and about the number of mosquitoes.
<P>

<a name="90118w14.html_para3">The third detainee, Gulam Hussain, looked in good condition. The Consul-General checked carefully that he had no problems with his back or with his asthma, two pre-existing medical conditions.
<P>

<a name="90118w14.html_para4">On 9 January 1999, the Consul-General saw Mohssin Ghailan, another of the detainees. He said that his treatment was now normal. He added that he had been slapped in the week after his arrest, but not since then. Mohssin also said that he was concerned about a possible liver problem, and was in some pain. The Consul-General noticed that his skin was yellowish, but could not judge the significance, not knowing his normal complexion.

<P>

<a name="90118w14.html_para6">I spoke again to the Prime Minister of Yemen on 14 January 1999. I welcomed the fact that we had had access to Mr. Harhara. I repeated my concern that all the detainees should be charged or released. I also pressed for access to the detainees for their defence lawyer, and for an independent doctor. Dr. Iryani took note, and undertook to work for a positive response to these requests.
<P>

<a name="90118w14.html_para7">Since then, the lawyer representing the detainees, Mr. Basunaid, has informed us that charges have been laid. The detainees have been charged with association with armed groups planning to commit murder, explosions and destruction and with the possession of weapons, under Article 133 of the Yemeni Penal Code. The case is, therefore, sub judice.
<P>

<a name="90118w14.html_para8">Our Ambassador and Consul-General continue to press for access to the detainees for Mr. Basunaid and for an independent doctor. They are also pressing for further consular visits, including to Mr. Harhara, and for transfer to the central prison in Aden where conditions are better. Mr. Basunaid has, however, been told by the Yemeni authorities that he must await the end of the Eid holiday before seeing his clients.
<P>

<a name="90118w14.html_para9">The Embassy and Mr. Basunaid are in close touch about all issues relating to the case, including about the allegations that the detainees may have been forced to confess. In the light of our contacts with Mr. Basunaid, we will consider whether to make representations to the Yemeni authorities about the conduct of the investigation.

Officials explained that their lengthy capacity illustrated the dangers of operating in Chechnya and asked if Granger had any information which might help to secure the release of Carr and James, given that the UK has no diplomatic representations in Chechnya. The answer was no. Granger described the terms and funding of their contract with a Chechen private company, ChechenTelecom, to establish a telecommunications infrastructure in Chechnya, and said that ChechenTelecom assumed full responsibility for the security of Granger expatriate staff in Grozny.

 Millennium Volunteers will have a total of &#163;15 million allocated to it from the windfall levy as start up funding in Great Britain, of which &#163;12.75 million is available in England. &#163;303,935 has been spent on the Programme to date in England, of which &#163;109,870 relates to projects and related expenditure and &#163;194,065 relates to administration. I hope to be making a further announcement about Millennium Volunteers and the longer term funding of the programme in England shortly.
<P>

<a name="90118w15.html_para2">A total of 269 volunteers have taken part in the nine Millennium Volunteers demonstration projects we established last summer. Of these, 168 were female and 101 male; 226 were white and 43 were from black or Asian ethnic groups. We will be evaluating the benefits to the community and to the individual volunteers of Millennium Volunteers but it is too early to provide such an assessment at present.

<a name="90118w15.html_para3">Although the Department has no mechanisms in place to monitor specific subject areas, it has in place a programme of evaluation work to assess the impact of the new funding arrangements on participation in higher education by different types of student, examining for instance the social background, ethnic group, disability, age and gender of students and subject of study, which will include engineering. This work will draw on data produced by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS) and the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). In addition, we are commissioning an update of the Student Income and Expenditure Survey which will provide information about the impact of the new arrangements on student finances.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what guidance his Department gives on the maximum time which local education authorities should take to produce a statement of special educational needs; and what procedures are in place to measure compliance with this guidance.  [65785]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Local education authorities are required by law to serve a draft statement on the parents of a child with special educational needs within eighteen weeks of first proposing to carry out an assessment of the child's needs. The Audit Commission monitors LEAs' compliance with this requirement, and publishes annual statistics for England and Wales showing the proportion of draft statements produced by each LEA within eighteen weeks. These statistics show that in 1996-97 only 48 per cent. of all draft statements were prepared within the statutory deadline. The Programme of Action on special educational needs published by the Department last November made it clear that the Government regard this figure as unacceptably low, and that they are committed to achieving a significant improvement. The Department has recently provided LEAs with advice on good practice in this area, and has challenged the worst-performing LEAs to improve.

To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland, pursuant to the letter of 6 October from the Minister with responsibility for agriculture, the environment and fisheries to the hon. Member for Linlithgow, what expert advice and recommendations he has received from Scottish Natural Heritage concerning the re-introduction of beavers into Scotland; and what action he proposes to take.  [65392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w17.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Macdonald: </B> 
 No formal advice or recommendations has yet been submitted by Scottish Natural Heritage to my hon. Friend. I understand that SNH's view is that a limited pilot reintroduction project may be the best way forward. SNH is developing proposals prior to putting advice and recommendations to Ministers.

<P>
<a name="90118w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 As part of the Government's programme of periodic reviews of non-Departmental Public Bodies, I announced to the House on 19 May 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>336</i>, our proposal to move forward with a review of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.
<P>

<a name="90118w18.html_para5">The first stage of the review has been completed. This addressed major issues of principle. The report has established that <i>(a)</i> there is an overwhelming need and demand for continuation of the Royal Commission's core functions, principally surveying and recording the man-made environment of Scotland and maintaining and curating the National Monuments Record of Scotland; <i>(b)</i> privatisation or contracting out of the entirety of the Royal Commission's activities is not feasible, although opportunities will continue to be taken to contract out discrete areas of work where this is cost-effective; <i>(c)</i> there are arguments for and against rationalisation or merger with other organisations dealing with built heritage or public record functions; in the absence however, or significant cost savings or a demonstrable increase in efficiency, the balance of advantage lies with the status quo; and <i>(d)</i> there is a continuing role for the Royal Commission and local authorities to play at the national and local levels respectively. I have arranged for a copy of the report to be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.
<P>

<a name="90118w18.html_para6">With these issues of principle now resolved, the second stage of the review will examine a number of organisational, management and finance issues. This will encompass the public services dimension to the Royal Commission's activities and liaison with local government.
<P>

<a name="90118w18.html_para7">I am writing to the Royal Commission's Chairman informing him that we concur with the report's conclusions.

 In general any business which provides credit under agreements which are regulated by the Consumer Credit Act 1974 is required to hold a consumer credit licence issued by the Director General of Fair Trading. The Act regulates agreements involving the granting of credit up to &#163;25,000 to individuals, including sole traders and partnerships. Section 16 of the Act exempts some types of consumer credit agreement and businesses which only offer exempt agreements do not require a licence. Licences are also required by businesses and others who hire or lease out goods, arrange credit for others, collect debts, undertake debt adjusting and debt counselling, and by credit reference agencies.

 The Government have been consulting the Government of Japan for some time about arrangements for returning the nuclear materials, including plutonium, recovered from reprocessing Japanese spent nuclear fuel at Sellafield. This is in keeping with the terms of the letters exchanged between the two Governments in 1978 in support of reprocessing contracts between Japanese utilities and BNFL and the policy of successive Governments.
<P>

<a name="90118w20.html_para2">The Government of Japan's preferred means of using the recovered plutonium is for it to be converted into Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel for use in Japanese nuclear power stations. The MOX fuel, including material produced by BNFL's counterpart COGEMA in France, will be returned by sea and carried by UK-flagged transport ships belonging to Pacific Nuclear Transport Ltd. (PNTL), a subsidiary of BNFL.

<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 365</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90118w20.html_para3">The purpose of the consultations between the UK and Japan has been to ensure that appropriate measures are put in place for the physical protection of the material in line with internationally agreed commitments and recommendations on physical protection and reflecting the concern of all parties to prevent the proliferation of sensitive nuclear materials. This includes compliance with the recommendation of the International Atomic Energy Agency that MOX fuel, like all other Category 1 nuclear material, should be accompanied during transport by an armed security escort.
<P>

<a name="90118w20.html_para4">All plutonium recovered from Japanese spent fuel reprocessed in Europe originates from uranium which was enriched in the US. Because of this, it falls within US rules of origin under which the US retains certain rights and responsibilities over its retransfer. This means that plans for the transport of MOX fuel from Europe to Japan by sea must comply with specific US requirements concerning safety and physical protection. These are set out in the 1988 US-Japan agreement on nuclear co-operation and include the requirement either that the transport ship should be accompanied by an armed escort vessel or that alternative security measures acceptable to the US should be in place.
<P>

<a name="90118w20.html_para5">The security arrangements currently under discussion with Japan and the US would involved 2 PNTL transport ships travelling together for mutual protection. Each would carry armaments, for defensive use only, under the control of specially trained officers of the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority Constabulary. These security provisions are solely for protecting the ships, their crew and their cargo in the extremely unlikely eventuality of an armed assault by terrorists.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if it is intended that the proposals for a directive on the taxation of savings as announced in the European Council Conclusions (Vienna 11 and 12 December) should involve an investigation of the differing income tax regimes of member states in respect of the taxation of savings and the differing rates of income tax thereon.  [64641]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w21.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 No. The draft directive on the taxation of savings which is currently under consideration in Brussels would not affect the way income from savings is treated in national income tax systems.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security in his Written Answer on 4 November 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>603-06</i>, advised the House that the Contributions Agency had introduced a new National Insurance Recording Computer System. During the first year of operation the system is being introduced through a series of pilots leading to national implementation.
<P>

<a name="90118w21.html_para3">Progress has been made against plans to move pilots into national operation. The NIRS2 link to the Jobseeker's Allowance computer system was implemented nationally on 9 November 1998 and new claims are now being dealt with through the normal interface between the two systems. The NIRS2 reports used for Incapacity Benefit were implemented nationally on 18 November 1998. Reports are being carefully screened before being released to Benefit Agency local offices.
<P>

<a name="90118w21.html_para4">Retirement Pensions and Widows Benefit calculation facilities became nationally available on 6 January 1999. The Benefits Agency is continuing to make initial awards of Retirement Pension and emergency payments to widows and those claiming Retirement Pension where no record of the contribution history is available.
<P>

<a name="90118w21.html_para5">The Benefits Agency has continued to identify and distribute claim packs automatically to those individuals approaching pension age using information from the previous National Insurance Recording system (NIRS). All initial awards of Retirement Pension have been calculated using the information from the old NIRS system. This contingency arrangement has worked well since the conversion to the new NIRS2 system began on the 19 June 1998. 97 per cent. of all claims to Retirement Pension have been processed using information from NIRS. Initial awards made since April 1998 will be reviewed when the 1997/98 National Insurance Contribution information has been posted to account. The Benefits Agency hopes to begin reviewing these claims from April 1999.
<P>

<a name="90118w21.html_para6">The Benefits Agency has increased the capacity to calculate clerically entitlement to State Earnings Related Pension Scheme for people who request it. 3,500 such calculations have been completed.
<P>

<a name="90118w21.html_para7">On 4 November 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 603-06, I reported that over 14 million National Insurance contributions for 1997/98 had been recorded on individual accounts. On 11 January the number of contribution items posted had risen to 31 million. We normally expect to record about 47 million contributions each year by the end of December. We hope to have recorded the balance by March 1999.
<P>

<a name="90118w21.html_para8">On 4 January 1999 the cumulative total of age-related rebate payments, paid to Occupational and Personal Pension Schemes in respect of individual scheme members in this financial year, increased from &#163;630 million to &#163;1,411 million, nearly 60 per cent. of the expected total for the year. This includes the December payment of &#163;385.57 million and the January payment of &#163;392 million. The figure includes a compensation element to compensate individual scheme members for any loss of investment income because of delayed payments.

<a name="90118w21.html_para12">From the first Monday of the new benefit year, 4 January 1999, new claims to Incapacity Benefit and Jobseeker's Allowance are being based on contributions paid during the 1996/97 and 1997/98 tax years. It is estimated that 65 per cent. of the relevant 1997/98 contributions have been posted to NIRS2. Whilst the remaining 1997/98 contributions are still being recorded in NIRS2, information to pay some new claims will need to be obtained from other sources.
<P>

<a name="90118w21.html_para13">The expected number of claims in January 1999 where contribution information will need to be obtained from other sources for Jobseeker's Allowance will be approximately 75,000 and for Incapacity Benefit approximately 21,000. These figures will be lower in February and March because additional National Insurance contribution information will be available on NIRS2, and by April 1999 all the National Insurance contributions needed should be available on the system. Claims will be automatically reviewed when 1997/98 National Insurance Contributions are posted.
<P>

<a name="90118w21.html_para14">There are long-standing contingency instructions in place to deal with these cases, and the Benefits Agency will advise customers if any additional information is required to deal with their claims. Both Jobseeker's Allowance and Incapacity Benefit contingency arrangements are in place from 4 January 1999.
<P>

<a name="90118w21.html_para15">Considerable effort has been jointly made by DSS Agencies, pensions industry and Andersen Consulting to maintain service levels. Staff from the Contributions Agency, Benefits Agency and Andersen Consulting were working together throughout the Christmas period to resolve the outstanding problems.
<P>

<a name="90118w21.html_para16">All the work involved is being taken forward through a co-ordinated plan agreed between the DSS Agencies involved and Andersen Consulting. Within the plan, priority is being given to those aspects of the NIRS2 system, which most directly affect benefit claims. I continue to expect that it will take until the end of this financial year to resume normal operations in full, and it will take longer to catch up on all backlogs. I shall keep the House informed of progress.

 The Council on Tribunals (CoT) produce a code of practice entitled "Access for Disabled People Using Tribunals" to which the Independent Tribunal Service (ITS) fully adheres in relation to its own tribunal premises. Appeals involving Disability Living Allowance are heard by Disability Appeal Tribunals (DATs), and these tribunals sit only in premises containing appropriate facilities for disabled people. Such facilities include car-parking spaces, access ramps, internal lifts and furnishings and fittings suitable for disabled people whilst both sitting in and moving around the premises.
<P>

<a name="90118w22.html_para0">ITS operates an equal opportunities policy of which an essential element is an awareness of the needs of people with disabilities. This policy is explained to all new members of the administrative staff early in their induction training and reinforced at regular intervals thereafter, whilst tribunal clerks, who deal face-to-face with disabled appellants, are given more detailed supplementary training. An Equal Opportunities Officer is based in Nottingham, whose role is to monitor changes in policy and practice and to provide regular updates to all staff.
<P>

<a name="90118w22.html_para1">Judicial Officers of ITS--that is, tribunal chairmen and members--whilst not direct employees, also receive training in various aspects of human awareness and interpersonal skills, including the needs of people with disabilities. This, too, is delivered initially as part of the induction training for new appointees and subsequently incorporated into regular "refresher" training programmes at both local and national level.

 The take-up of Stakeholder Pensions will depend on a number of factors and cannot be reliably predicted.

<a name="90118w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The figure of &#163;9,000 was judged to be broadly the annual earnings level where, at current levels of compulsion, pension contributions would be sufficient to make funded pensions cost-effective.

If the contribution record to determine their claims could not be obtained because of the difficulties with the NIRS2, they will have been offered emergency payments and told the reason. I refer my hon. Friend to the written answer my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Social Security gave the hon. Member for Newbury (Mr. Rendel) on 4 November 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>603-06</i>. It is estimated that 3 per cent. of claims fall into this category; this relates to about 1,500 claims a month (or 4,500 between October and December 1998).

 The information is not available in the form requested.
<P>

<a name="90118w22.html_para5">In April 1999 the Income Support rate for pensioners will be increased by more than if they had been uprated by earnings.
<P>

<a name="90118w22.html_para6">On this basis the estimated cost to the Income Related benefits of increasing the rate of Income Support (IS) for pensioners by earnings rather than prices would be approximately &#163;250 million in 2000-01 and &#163;520 million in 2001-02. These figures are based on departmental forecasts of the future number of pensioners on Income Related Benefits. Estimated forecasts beyond 2001-02 are not routinely provided on an annual basis, and to do so would incur disproportionate costs.
<P>

<a name="90118w22.html_para7">However, long-term figures on the costs to income related benefits have been estimated using PENSIM, a dynamic simulation model that projects pensioners' incomes into the next century. For illustrative purposes the estimated cost of uprating IS for pensioners in line with earnings by 2010, based on PENSIM, would be around &#163;3.5 billion in today's prices. PENSIM estimates, however, are based on a number of economic and behavioural assumptions. Due to the reliance on assumptions and the time period covered, estimates should be treated with caution, and have been heavily rounded.

<P>
<a name="90118w24.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The vast majority of dentists are self-employed, and it is therefore up to them where and when they establish themselves. The establishment of Personal Dental Services pilots requires the approval of the Secretary of State, and we have no plans to change this process. Funding through the Investing In Dentistry scheme, which may result in new practices being set up, is also approved by the Secretary of State, and we are considering whether the operation of this scheme can be improved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w24.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The powers of the licensing authority, of which the Medicines Control Agency is an executive arm, are set out in the Medicines Act 1968 and secondary legislation including the Medicines for Human Use (Marketing Authorisations Etc.) Regulations 1994. There are no plans to extend those powers.
<P>

<a name="90118w24.html_para4">However, the MCA's Consultation Letter MLX 249 proposes amendments to these Regulations. The proposed amendments relate to a new statutory procedure for determinations by the licensing authority of whether a product is a medicinal product requiring licensing. The procedure would allow for representations to be made against a provisional determination that a product requires licensing. If a final determination is made, it will be sufficient evidence for the purposes of legal proceedings that the product requires licensing under the Regulations, unless it can be shown that the determination was made unreasonably or has been annulled. There is a further proposal that, when a final determination has been made that a product requires licensing, the licensing authority be able to serve a notice in writing on a person requiring that he refrain from placing the product on the market or otherwise marketing the product, and that it be an offence to breach such a notice. Decisions of the licensing authority would be subject to judicial review or other challenge in the civil courts.
<P>

<a name="90118w24.html_para5">When consideration of responses to the consultation is complete, we will consider whether and what legislative proposals should be put before Parliament.

 We have allocated &#163;135 million to health authorities as a central contribution towards health authorities funding of the running costs of primary care groups in 1999-2000.

<P>

<a name="90118w25.html_para2">We have agreed that locum/compensatory payments can be paid to practices to enable them to cover such absences. In some cases cover will be provided from within the practice. We therefore do not expect any deterioration in the quality or level of service to patients to result from GP membership of primary care groups. Indeed we are confident that Primary Care Groups will lead to improvements in services to patients. One of their key functions is to develop primary care.

 Two of the principal objectives of the Meat Hygiene Service (MHS) are to deliver value for money in the provision of efficient and high quality services and to achieve the financial and performance targets set by Ministers. Indeed the Agency has met all its performance targets since it was launched in April 1995.
<P>

<a name="90118w25.html_para3">The Chief Executive of the MHS is responsible to the Minister for the Agency's performance and operations. He is accountable for securing efficiency and economical conduct of the Agency's business. The Agency works in line with government tendering rules to optimise value for money. For example the MHS makes extensive use of contract Official Veterinary Surgeons (OVSs) which it obtains by means of national competitive tendering procedures. These are in line with Government purchasing policy and ensure that the best value for money is obtained for plant operators.
<P>

<a name="90118w25.html_para4">My ministerial colleagues and I monitor closely the financial performance of the Agency. Indeed, MHS charges for each financial year are subject to ministerial agreement before being implemented.

 Bovine somatotrophin (BST) is a hormone produced naturally by all cows and is present in small quantities in all cows milk. Applications for authorisation of the product have been very carefully assessed by various expert committees in the UK and Europe and all agree that the applications meet the statutory criteria of safety, quality and efficacy. Safety includes the safety of the consumer. Its use in the EU is subject to a moratorium. If permitted, it would be subject to veterinary control.
<P>

<a name="90118w25.html_para5">The European Commission has reported that the productivity increase from the use of BST is estimated to be in the range of 5 per cent. to 20 per cent. However, 



<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 384</I><P>
since EU milk production is constrained by quotas, it is unlikely that there would be any significant impact on either output or price.

 The Government have not issued specific instructions to the Environment Agency about the market testing of its flood defence work. Rather, the Agency is consistently encouraged to continue to deliver improvements in efficiency, and market testing and contracting out feature among the measures that the Agency may wish to use to achieve its efficiency objectives.
<P>

<a name="90118w26.html_para2">The Agency's Financial Memorandum generally requires that all contracts for whatever function are designed to secure value for money and should be let on a competitive basis unless the Agency is satisfied there are good reasons to the contrary.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to discuss with his counterparts in other European Union member states the establishment of a pesticide policy across the Community.  [65415]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w26.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Minister takes the lead as respects agricultural pesticides; the lead on other pesticides (and biocides) lies with my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>

<a name="90118w26.html_para5">Directive 91/414/EEC already provides a common basis for the regulation of agricultural pesticides across the Community. Until it is fully operative, the Directive permits the various national arrangements to continue. This transition, from national to harmonised regulation, has proved more lengthy than originally envisaged but the great majority of rules are in place for chemical pesticides and significant progress has been made regarding those for biological pesticides.
<P>

<a name="90118w26.html_para6">The European Commission has finally recognised that progress needs to be more rapid and last October produced a working paper proposing ways of achieving this. UK Ministers and officials will play a full part in discussions of the Commission's proposals and will seek to advance practical measures to make the Directive fully effective. However, we shall continue to maintain our first priority--the protection of people and the environment.

<a name="90118w26.html_wqn6"><B> Dr. Gibson: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what is the expected timetable for the UK regulatory authorities to consider the report being produced by the European Commission on the environmental and health effects of the insecticide Lindane; and if the report will be published.  [66015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w26.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Austrian authorities submitted an initial evaluation of Lindane to the European Commission last month, as part of the EU's routine review programme for plant protection products. The process of peer review and decision-making by the Community is likely to take until the first half of the year 2000 but could be expedited if issues of human or environmental safety arise. The first phase, scientific peer review, is scheduled to run between March and October. The UK regulatory authorities will participate in this work and will therefore be considering the Austrian report ahead of the meetings.
<P>

<a name="90118w26.html_para7">If action is called for by the Austrian evaluation, the Government will not hesitate to take steps or to press the Commission to do so. After a decision has been taken by the Commission, the report from the decision making process will be made publicly available.

<a name="90118w26.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what assessment he has made of the amounts of pesticides used in grain stores in the UK.  [66014]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Ministry has collected pesticides usage data covering the agricultural and horticultural sectors since the 1960s and reports analysing all these data have been published. Information on grain stores is gathered every four years; the next survey will be this year for storage in 1998-99 of the 1998 harvest.
<P>

<a name="90118w26.html_para8">Comparison in usage data between the last surveys in 1994-95 and previous ones is difficult because of changes in grain store practice, survey methodologies and quantities of grain surveyed. However indications are that use in commercial stores has gone down substantially--the weight of pesticide per tonne of grain was only a third of the 1985-86 level--while use in farm stores appears to have increased--the weight of pesticide per tonne of grain was up by about a fifth on 1990-91 figures. The changes result from stricter hygiene requirements of grain buyers and improved administrative arrangements avoiding unnecessary treatments. There has been a move away from the practice of admixing pesticides with the grain towards treating the store's walls and floors to ensure no pests are left between emptying and re-filling.

<P>
<a name="90118w26.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Gordon Prentice: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what research his Department has funded into the engineering design of grain stores to enable grain to be safely stored without the use of added chemicals.  [66012]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w26.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) has a strategic research programme on grain storage which includes a project on the development of modified atmosphere application systems for use within grain stores, as an alternative to control by pesticides. The MAFF work underpins more applied research funded by the levy body, the Home Grown Cereals Authority (HGCA).

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, pursuant to the letter of 30 September 1998 from the Minister, my hon. Friend the Member for Scunthorpe (Mr. Morley), for fisheries and the countryside to the hon. Member for Linlithgow concerning habitats, if he will make a statement on the action planned for sand dunes.  [65384]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w27.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 January 1999]:</i> Under the UK Biodiversity Action Plan, a costed Habitat Action Plan for coastal sand dunes is being prepared and is due to be published later this year. It will include specific targets for the protection and enhancement of sand dunes and a list of actions to help achieve these targets.
<P>

<a name="90118w27.html_para0">A large proportion of sand dunes is designated as SSSIs and twenty-one sites have been proposed to the European Commission as candidate Special Areas of Conservation under the Habitats Directive.
<P>

<a name="90118w27.html_para1">The Countryside Stewardship Scheme includes various measures to encourage farmers and land managers to improve the natural beauty and diversity of the countryside. These include payments for managing sand dunes. The Scheme is voluntary and competitive, and agreements under it run for 10 years. Similar measures apply in Scotland under the Countryside Premium Scheme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w27.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The main representations for free school milk have come from a parents pressure group called Milk For Schools. Farming and industry organisations have, however, called for various improvements in the present arrangements.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Milk can play an important part in a balanced diet but it is only one of many such foods. For this reason, and due to financial constraints, the Government have no plans to assess the benefits of reintroducing free milk in schools.

 Figures for the numbers of new confirmed herd breakdowns by county are not available on a quarterly basis.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to <i>(a)</i> restrict and <i>(b)</i> prevent the use of warfarin for pest control.  [66083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90118w27.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Warfarin is presently permitted in the UK for specified pest control uses under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986. However, it also falls within the scope of the emerging EU regulatory regimes for plant protection products and biocidal products.




<P>
<P><I>18 Jan 1999 : Column: 390</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90118w27.html_para2">The plant protection uses of warfarin are being reviewed by the EU Commission as part of a programme that will eventually cover all compounds used in such products. The rules for the review programme put the onus on companies, wishing to continue to market such products, to provide data to address possible risks to people and the environment. Despite several opportunities, we understand that no company has yet provided and adequate data package for warfarin. The Commission are therefore likely to propose the restriction or removal of plant protection uses of warfarin and the Government would be minded to support such a step. We are, however, aware of the implications for the forestry sector; the Forestry Commission is encouraging manufacturers to provide data and is urgently researching alternative control methods.
<P>

<a name="90118w27.html_para3">This would not have any direct implication for the use of warfarin to protect public health as opposed to crops. The Biocidal Products Directive applies to public health products and, although these will be reviewed in due course, that review is not yet under way.
