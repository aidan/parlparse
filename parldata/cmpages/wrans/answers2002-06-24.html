 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps her Department is taking to contribute to the Government's strategy to reduce crime among young people.  [61229]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w01.html_spnew0"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 My Department is playing a full part in the Government's drive to tackle street crime, the vast majority of which is committed by young people. My officials are working closely with colleagues at the Youth Justice Board to develop a programme of summer activities in the 10 police areas targeted by the street crime initiative. This will provide at least 48,000 places, for children and young people aged nine to 17 at risk of offending, in quality sports and arts provision. We hope to be able to announce the exact locations of all of the individual schemes shortly.
<P>
22. <a name="20624w01.html_wqn1"><B> Siobhain McDonagh: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what research she has commissioned on the role of sports and arts provision for young people in crime prevention.  [61239]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w01.html_spnew1"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 There is already an increasing body of evidence that engagement in sports and arts activity can have an important role in crime reduction. However, we are keen to build on this. The comprehensive programme of Splash Extra schemes being developed jointly by my Department and the Youth Justice Board in the street crime areas will provide an important opportunity in this respect. We will ensure that the impact of these new schemes on local crime levels is evaluated as fully as possible.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans she has to strengthen the regional input into the development of arts, sport and tourism policies.  [61230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Steps have already been taken to restructure the Arts Council to provide a more effective structure for delivering national priorities for the arts while enhancing regional input to arts policy. The Performance and Innovation Unit is currently undertaking a review of sports policy in England and is looking at the regional dimension building on the findings of the Quinquennial review of Sport England. While the preliminary findings of a review of tourism have identified the need for the Regional Development Agencies, and in the longer term Elected Regional Assemblies, to have a stronger role in tourism development.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w01.html_spnew3"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 The Arts Council's new Regional Councils are working with Local Authorities to develop the infrastructure for the performing arts in rural areas, this is in addition to support through the New Audience Programme and Lottery funding. Rural areas including Norfolk and Cornwall have also been included in Creative Partnerships, a &#163;40 million programme to bring creative professionals, teachers and young people together to work on sustained and innovative projects.

<a name="20624w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Two recommendations have already been implemented; and we are on course to implement a further six before the Recess. The majority will, however, need primary legislation. We are now working with interested parties on the preparation of a Bill.

<a name="20624w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 While my right hon.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what steps she is taking to ensure an equitable distribution of funds raised by the national lottery.  [61234]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The Government would like all parts of the country to experience the positive effects of Lottery funding. Reforms introduced under the National Lottery Act 1998 and targeted programmes introduced by Lottery distributors are designed to tackle inequity. We shall seek public views on what further steps might be taken in a consultation paper to be published shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w01.html_spnew7"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport, in partnership with the Department for Education and Skills, is keen to promote greater co-operation between schools and community clubs through a number 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jun 2002 : Column 641W</I><P>
of schemes and programmes that they, along with Sport England and other interested bodies, are running. These include the NOF PE and Sport Programme, where an ability to demonstrate community access to new facilities is one of the criteria that schools have to meet when bidding to LEAs for funding allocated to them by NOF, and the School Sport Co-ordinator Scheme, where Co-ordinators are responsible for&#151;among other things&#151;developing community outreach programmes.

 The Department for Culture, Media and Sport and Department for Education and Skills are working closely with the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit on a comprehensive plan to improve access to, and the quality of, PE, school sport and club links for 5 to 16-year-olds. Key activities associated with the plan will include; the expansion of the specialist sport college network and school sport co-ordinator programme; training for primary and special school PE co-ordinators and secondary school directors of sport; further incentives to encourage extra-curricular activities; and "Step into Sport", a leadership and volunteering programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Part of UK Sport's responsibilities is to encourage and maintain UK influence within international sports federations. To support this objective they operate an international Representatives Grant Aid Programme. This programme offers financial support and advice to elect British postholders and, in addition, supports governing body delegates attending formal meetings of international sports bodies.

 I am delighted that the Dorset and east Devon coast was awarded world heritage site status last December. I have no plans to meet the ETC specifically to discuss this issue. South West Tourism actively promotes south Dorset through its website, marketing campaigns

<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w01.html_spnew12"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
My right hon. and noble Friend the Minister for the Arts (Baroness Blackstone) has had several discussions with British Museum trustees and officials on a number of issues including the current financial position at the Museum. Grant-in-Aid to the British Museum has increased each year since 1997&#150;98 and in 2002&#150;03 will amount to &#163;36.5 million. In addition, since April 2001 the Museum has been able to recover VAT relating to its expenditure on free access, worth at least &#163;750,000 per annum. Funding is being further reviewed in the Government's 2002 Spending Review.

<P>
<a name="20624w02.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The existing regulatory bodies for communications (the Independent Television Commission, Radio Authority, Radiocommunications Agency, Oftel, the Broadcasting Standards Commission, the BBC and S4C) already have a duty under the Race Relations (Amendment) Act 2000, in respect of their public functions, to have regard to the need to eliminate unlawful racial discrimination and

<P>

<a name="20624w02.html_para4">The draft Communications Bill, which is currently subject to consultation, also contains provisions placing a duty on Ofcom to take appropriate steps for promoting equality of opportunity in relation to employment in broadcasting services and training and retraining for such employment; and a requirement on Ofcom to include in broadcasting licences appropriate conditions requiring licensees to make arrangements for promoting equality of opportunity, including between persons of different racial groups, in relation to employment with the licence holder.

 The last comprehensive review of the Accommodation for Residential Care concessionary television licence scheme was carried out in 1999, by the independent review panel on the future funding of the BBC. The panel recommended that the existing scheme be retained. The Government have since introduced free television licences for everyone aged 75 or over, the cost being met from public funds.

 Funding for the arts is a matter for the Arts Council of England and its regional offices. In 2002&#150;03 London Arts will provide revenue funding of &#163;1,021,248 to the Institute for Contemporary Arts (ICA) in the Mall which is adjacent to Carlton House Terrace. The ICA is an independent organisation which may use this money for artistic activity as well as other costs such as property.

The Government appreciate fully the importance of the radio spectrum in underpinning this activity.
<P>

<a name="20624w03.html_para3">The recent joint DTI/DCMS consultation process (Digital Television: The Principles for Spectrum Planning) sought views on the basis on which we should plan the use of this spectrum for digital television and other services once the analogue signals can be switched off. The responses will inform decisions about the amount of spectrum that might be dedicated to programme- making use after switchover, and also the future arrangements for the way that the programme-makers will share spectrum within digital TV networks. We will ensure, through careful planning and consultation with programme makers, minimal disruption.

 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2002]:</i> "Phytophthora ramorum"&#151;the causative organism of sudden oak death&#151;is not established in the United Kingdom, but has recently been detected on plants of viburnum and rhododendron in a targeted survey by the Plant Health and Seeds Inspectorate. Research is in progress to establish whether the "Phytophthora ramorum" found in the United Kingdom exhibits the same pathogenicity as that causing such serious damage in the USA and whether European tree species are susceptible to either the European or North American isolates. This work is being carried out by the Central Science Laboratory and the Forestry Commission Research Agency.
<P>

<a name="20624w04.html_para0">Possible Community-wide measures are being considered and there has already been an exchange of information and some additional survey work by member states. In the meantime, on the basis of a pest risk assessment, precautionary measures have been introduced to prevent susceptible material being imported into the United Kingdom from affected areas of the USA and to allow plant health inspectors to track commercial movements of host plants of any origin. Current controls on imported oak wood from the USA are also being extended to include wood derived from all host trees originating in affected areas.

However, the main cost to the RPA arises from cases where Section 1.5 is not completed appropriately, that is, information given is not clear, or is evidently incomplete. It is the processing of the cases which led the RPA to re-examine the wording of Section 1.5. It is not possible to calculate accurately the cost of dealing with these.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many farmers have fully completed Section 1, No. 5, on the Beef Special Premium Scheme 2002 claim form; and how many have not complied and are stating only the holding address.  [63627]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w04.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 All Beef Special Premium Scheme 2002 claim forms where the only anomaly concerns the completion of Section 1, question 5 are being accepted and lodged with the Rural Payments Agency.
<P>

<a name="20624w04.html_para2">To date, the Rural Payments Agency has received just under 39,000 Beef Special Premium Scheme 2002 claims. It estimates that the current proportion of the forms having either no, or incomplete, information entered at Section 1, question 5 is 35 per cent. The agency will seek the additional information from producers where required.

 Article 10 of Commission Regulation (EC) No.2419/2001, which came into effect on 1 January 2002, requires that a livestock aid application shall contain where applicable, an undertaking by the farmer to keep claimed animals on his holding during the retention

period and information on the location or locations where the animals will be held including the period or periods concerned. This requirement has not changed from the relevant previous regulation.
<P>

<a name="20624w04.html_para3">For operational reasons, the level of detail and the method of collecting it was changed for scheme year 2002. Following representations from industry representatives the Rural Payments Agency is currently reviewing Section 1, No. 5 of the Beef Special Premium Scheme 2002 form.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans she has to offer continuous advice to farmers for improvements to their countryside stewardship schemes.  [63625]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Staff from DEFRA's Rural Development Service operate a programme of visits to farmers with land under Countryside Stewardship Scheme agreement to advise them on technical aspects of management. However, provision of this advice is resource intensive and any decision to increase these advisory visits would need to balance the increase in resource costs against any increased environmental value for money which might result.
<P>

<a name="20624w04.html_para4">Advice on preparing new or upgraded applications to the scheme is available from various organisations including the Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group, local wildlife trusts, and National Park authorities in the relevant areas.

<P>
<a name="20624w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Countryside Stewardship is currently being reviewed as part of a wider review of English agri-environment schemes. An initial public consultation exercise, inviting views on a number of strategic questions, closed on 27 May 2002. 119 responses have been received and are now being analysed. The results from this consultation exercise will be used to help develop a revised framework for English agri-environment schemes, working closely with stakeholders. Any changes to the schemes will need to be submitted to the European Commission as a proposed modification to the England Rural Development Programme.
<P>

<a name="20624w04.html_para6">All aspects of the current Countryside Stewardship Scheme are under consideration in this review, including the length of agreements.

(2) if she will make a statement on variations in the pace of progress between CPS areas noted by HMCPSI.  [60211]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w05.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 It has been assumed that the question regarding the pace of progress refers to the establishment of criminal justice units and trial units.
<P>

<a name="20624w05.html_para0">All chief crown prosecutors and chief constables have submitted joint plans detailing their strategy to implement the Glidewell recommendations. These plans were reviewed by a joint CPS/police working group to ensure that they followed the agreed model for joint administration. The model aims to reduce duplication and delay; focus freed up resources towards the more serious casework; and improve the service to victims and witnesses. CPS areas and their police partners regularly review their plans, actively seeking opportunities to maximise use of the combined police/CPS buildings and provide regular updates to the centre as and when their plans have progressed.
<P>

<a name="20624w05.html_para1">All CPS areas not yet collocated have reorganised their front line operations into discrete units to deal separately with Crown court and magistrates court work, in order to deliver at least some of the benefits envisaged by Glidewell.
<P>

<a name="20624w05.html_para2">As at 31 March 2002, there were 42 collocated criminal justice units established in 20 areas and 54 trial units in 32 areas. The schedule shows the location and date of establishment of these units.
<P>

<a name="20624w05.html_para3">The pace with which areas have progressed the Glidewell recommendations has largely been influenced by the availability of either suitable CPS or police buildings.

 <i>[holding answer 14 May 2002]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20624w05.html_para5">The modernisation plans for London Underground require contractors to meet performance specifications. The contracts do not specify the details of each individual project. Instead, the performance regime has been designed to deliver faster, more reliable and more pleasant journeys for passengers, as quickly as possible.
<P>

<a name="20624w05.html_para6">The specifications include demanding targets for improvements in Journey Time Capability (JTC), an outcome measure which reflects passengers' experiences of a range of factors affecting how quickly they can travel through the underground system.
<P>

<a name="20624w05.html_para7">Improvements in JTC through line upgrades, as specified in the current contracts, are as follows:
<P>

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20624w05.html_para8">To meet these specifications, the contractors will need to deliver substantial improvements across the entire system infrastructure, including works to increase frequency and capacity, and the introduction of new trains. In addition, on all lines contractors will be incentivised to improve availability scores, which measure infrastructure reliability. This will help London Underground to deliver service improvements, such as increased train frequency, irrespective of the timing of line upgrades.
<P>

<a name="20624w05.html_para9">The contracts directly specify improvements to trains on all lines, which must be delivered by the dates are as listed:

<a name="20624w05.html_para10">All dates listed (except *) refer to contract years (ie 2005 ends on 31 March 2006). These are the latest dates by which improvements must be delivered. In practice, the infrastructure companies will need to start work on the upgrades many years in advance to meet these dates. Therefore many improvements will be delivered well before the contractual end-dates. The exact details of how the private sector companies intend to meet their contractual obligations are matters for the companies concerned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many regulations which cause additional burdens for small businesses have been introduced in the field of health and safety in the last three years.  [61143]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 During the period June 1999 to June 2002, 55 statutory instruments containing regulations relating to health and safety have been introduced. Not all of these will affect all firms, of whatever size; much depends on the nature of the business and the risks it creates. Some new legislation may indeed reduce burdens on small firms by simplifying existing legal requirements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps his Department intend to take to reduce administrative burdens in the field of health and safety for small businesses; and if he will make a statement.  [61142]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 HSE has long recognised the special needs of smaller businesses and the importance of ensuring that administrative requirements placed on them in the field of health and safety are kept to the minimum, while ensuring that they recognise and act on their duties to protect the safety and health of their own workers and others.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20624w07.html_para0">HSE consults widely on proposed regulations and guidance, although it recognises the need to ensure that small businesses are properly involved in developing its policies and practices and is currently looking at a variety of ways that will make it easier for small businesses to communicate with them.
<P>

<a name="20624w07.html_para1">Many of the problems come from incorrect interpretation of regulations, companies often believing that they need to take more complicated action than is actually necessary or not understanding what needs to be done. HSE, therefore, produces extensive guidance on most of its regulations, much of it targeted towards small firms.
<P>

<a name="20624w07.html_para2">HSE also continually looks for innovative ways to broaden its support to small businesses. For example, a pilot grant scheme is due to be launched shortly to provide some financial assistance for small businesses to access health and safety mentoring and training.

 <i>[holding answer 13 June 2002]:</i> The Health and Safety Executive published "New and Expectant Mothers at Work&#151;A guide for employer" in 1995.

 Our assessment is that a tax on aviation kerosene would have worthwhile environmental benefits in reducing climate change impacts from aircraft emissions but only if it were imposed internationally. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) concluded at its assembly last October that alternative measures such as an open emissions trading scheme or an emissions charge could be equally if not more environmentally beneficial than such a tax. The UK is currently assisting ICAO in following up these possibilities.

An exemption from the regulations can only be granted by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). The HSE is currently conducting a public consultation on an application for exemption to fit the safety modification received from the three Mark 1 train operating companies, South West Trains, Connex South Eastern and South Central. The HSE is expected to make a decision in the autumn.

 The Child Support Agency has wide information gathering powers, including being able to require that employers and accountants provide them with relevant information.
<P>

<a name="20624w10.html_para1">These powers have been buttressed by the creation, in section 13 of the Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Act 2000, of two new criminal offences, of failing to give information and of knowingly giving false information. These offences carry fines of up to &#163;1,000. The provision has been in force since January 2001.
<P>

<a name="20624w10.html_para2">Ministers have therefore taken the view that the Child Support Agency need not use the powers granted to the Department by its inclusion, as a relevant public authority for the purposes of sections 28 and 29 of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act 2000, in Schedule 1 of that Act. An important additional factor in that decision is that surveillance is intensely resource-intensive and diversion of resources into such activity cannot be justified when the Agency's focus must be on implementation of the new child support scheme. The position on the use of surveillance is kept under review.

Our publicity activity therefore focuses on the groups who may not automatically start building up state second pension and may need to take appropriate action, primarily carers and parents.
<P>

<a name="20624w10.html_para3">We have produced information both on our website and as a leaflet to inform these two groups about the state second pension and to outline any action they may need to take to build up entitlement. We are also currently conducting promotional activity for carers and parents about state second pension, which includes press advertising in national and local press and relevant magazines and direct mail to relevant advisory organisations.
<P>

<a name="20624w10.html_para4">We anticipate carrying out further promotional activity in the future to continue to ensure that people are aware of the action they need to take to benefit from the availability of the state second pension.

 Under Best Value, we have set a range of performance indicators for Housing Benefit which are designed to ensure that authorities provide their communities with a faster, more accurate service which is more secure against fraud, and which provides value for money and takes account of the views and needs of clients. Authorities are required to set challenging local targets against the indicators and, from April 2002, have been set aspirational targets for speed of processing.

 The preliminary needs assessment that was prepared for the Tokyo conference estimated, under a low case scenario, that Afghanistan's funding requirements over the next five years would be $8.3 billion, excluding humanitarian inputs. It is doubtful whether Afghanistan will have the capacity to absorb this amount in the short term: our estimate is that a total of $1 billion per annum will be required for a combination of humanitarian, recovery and reconstruction activities. Provided donors deliver on the pledges made at Tokyo, sufficient funds should be available.

 The term water conservation may refer to increasing storage of water resources, greater efficiency in the use of water resources, or to the conservation of valuable aquatic ecosystems. DFID has supported a substantial number of activities seeking to address all of these. The number is too great to list here, but the projects and programmes set out give an illustration of the type of engagement DFID are undertaking:

 For all water uses, the Department for International Development is fully committed to the Dublin Principles (from the International Conference on Water and the Environment in Dublin in 1992) that (i) fresh water is a finite and vulnerable resource, essential to sustain life, development and the environment, and (ii) water has an economic value in all its competing uses and should be regarded as an economic good. DFID are also committed to Agenda 21 (which was prepared at the Earth summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992) which provides that water resources must be managed for sustainable food production and development.

 The Department of Trade and Industry is working with the construction industry (including architects) to promote and embed the principles of rethinking construction. This initiative emphasises the need to integrate the construction team (including suppliers, contractors, professional advisers and clients) in order to deliver a high quality product that adds value to the client's activities. As part of this initiative, the Department has helped to fund the development of Design Quality Indicators which provide a means to assess the quality of a design as seen by architects, suppliers, clients and end users. These indicators will be launched jointly by the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) and the Construction Industry Council on 8 July. I, along with my Ministerial Design Champion colleagues, have also committed to the production of action plans to ensure that construction 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jun 2002 : Column 683W</I><P>
projects taken forward by this Department adhere to the principles of rethinking construction and take fully into account the need for high quality design.
<P>

<a name="20624w12.html_para3">The Department is also working very closely with CABE to promote understanding within both the public and private sector of how fundamental good design is both to the delivery of value for money and to the delivery of buildings which add to the quality of life of those using the building or living in the community around it. CABE undertakes a wide range of activities to encourage and facilitate improved design that are aimed at architects, suppliers and clients. These include: grants to develop and maintain architecture centres throughout the UK which provide a source of expertise and advice for both architects and clients; provision of training for both architects and clients to improve skills and improve understanding by clients of the sort of service they need from architects; design competitions to encourage small and new practices to develop projects and to showcase their skills; and the development of a digital website to showcase regeneration projects and projects covering a variety of different types of public buildings both to provide advice on how to deliver a good project and also to showcase the talents of architects.
<P>

<a name="20624w12.html_para4">The Office of Government Commerce, with CABE, has met with the Royal Institute of British Architects to discuss the issue of access of small and medium sized architectural firms to Government contracts. This dialogue is ongoing. In addition, CABE is working with individual Government Departments to promote a diversity of design firms on specific projects, most recently with the Department for Education and Skills on Neighbourhood Nurseries and SureStart.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer of 10 June 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 978W, on export finance, if she will list <i>(a)</i> the project name, <i>(b)</i> the country location, <i>(c)</i> the capacity in MW, <i>(d)</i> the estimated carbon emissions and <i>(e)</i> the value of the loan guaranteed for the seven coal-fired power stations for which the ECGD has provided Overseas Investment Insurance and other insurance.  [63324]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w13.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 It is ECGD policy not to publish details of cases involving Overseas Investment Insurance or other insurance facilities. This is to protect ECGD's own operations as there is a risk that knowledge by the buyer of the presence of export related insurance may increase the risk of action that may lead to a claim being paid. Details of insurance are also commercially sensitive on the part of the UK exporter or investor, as the presence of investment or export related insurance may harm their relationship with their buyer, local partner or the host Government. The same sensitivities do not apply so much to ECGD's guarantee or finance facilities as by nature these are usually more complex products and all parties will generally be aware of the presence of ECGD support. This approach is consistent with that adopted by export credit agencies in other countries.
<P>

<a name="20624w13.html_para2">According to information already published the insurance cases in respect of seven coal-fired power stations involved a total capacity of 4,960 MW and annual CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions of approximately 17.9 million tonnes per year.

<a name="20624w14.html_para7">The work of SCOEL is reported regularly to the Working Group on European Exposure Limits, a sub-committee of the Advisory Committee on Toxic Substances, which is one of the topic committees advising the Health and Safety Commission. All these committees include representatives of employers, employees, other stakeholding interests and independent experts.
<P>

<a name="20624w14.html_para8">The EC uses the scientific advice from SCOEL to make proposals for occupational exposure limits. Limits based solely on scientific considerations are considered as adaptations to technical progress, and are incorporated in proposals for Commission directives within the framework of CAD. Limits that take account also of socio-economic factors are included in proposals for Council directives amending CAD or the Carcinogens at Work Directive. Such proposals are referred to the two Parliamentary Scrutiny Committees.

 <i>[holding answer 21 June 2002]:</i> Under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, HMG's consuls will be informed of the detention of a British national by the detaining authorities, if that person requests it. On being informed, the Consul will contact the detainee as soon as possible and if necessary follow this with a visit. One of the Consul's main duties is to ensure that the detainee has legal representation; the Consul can provide the detainee with a list of English speaking local lawyers. The Consul will do whatever he can to ensure that the welfare of the detainee is adequately provided for, that his human rights are respected and that he is not discriminated against because he is a foreigner. He will also raise any specific medical needs with the detaining authorities.
<P>

<a name="20624w14.html_para9">Consuls visit convicted prisoners at least once a year, and more regularly if prison conditions are poor or if we have particular concerns about a prisoner. The Consul will continue to provide the same support as pre-trial. Furthermore, if we have concerns about a prisoner's health or are concerned that he did not receive a fair trial, we will consider making representations on his behalf or ultimately supporting a plea for clemency. We would look to our panels of pro bono doctors and lawyers to assist in such instances.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department with respect to the criminal conviction certificates to be issued by the Criminal Records Bureau, whether he will issue advice to employers requesting access to such certificates of job applicants; whether he plans to extend the statutory Code of Practice which cover other certificates to the criminal conviction certificate; 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jun 2002 : Column 694W</I><P>
whether he has undertaken research into the impact of the certificate on recidivism; if he will describe the activities, other than employment and visa applications, where the criminal conviction certificate is likely to be used; and if he will make a statement.  [59266]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w15.html_spnew11"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 While it is possible that uses will be perceived for them in other circumstances, criminal conviction certificates (or Basic Disclosures, as they will be termed) are essentially intended for the purpose of employment checks, and also in connection with visa applications (instead of the use of the right of subject access under the Data Protection Act 1998). It is essential that people are not unfairly discriminated against because of information revealed in Basic Disclosures that they have been convicted in the past&#151;not least because getting and holding down a regular job is likely to be a positive factor in preventing re-offending. In this, we have taken careful note of the results of recent research published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the National Institute for Economic and Social Research. The Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) will therefore be producing a range of advice urging employers to treat such information in a fair and reasonable manner. The CRB is also continuing to work closely with the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development and the National Association of Care and Resettlement of Offenders (Nacro) on the production of guidance for employers. The current provision on a statutory Code of Practice applies only to higher-level Disclosures. We shall consider making provision to cover Basic Disclosures when there is a suitable opportunity. Meanwhile, the CRB has been working on an equivalent "good practice guide".

 This is an operational matter for police forces and no central guidance is issued.

The increased use of video identification parades will help to minimise delays in the identification process and reduce burdens on witnesses' time.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland by what means he monitors joyriding as a specific aspect of vehicle crime; what recent studies have been conducted on the perpetrators of this crime; and how many <i>(a)</i> arrests and <i>(b)</i> prosecutions have been effected over the last 12 month period for which figures are available.

<P>
<a name="20624w16.html_spnew11"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The PSNI considers the term "joyriders" an inappropriate one to describe car thieves. The terms that best describe the activities of car thieves are: "casual car theft"&#151;where the opportunist criminal is casual about the car that they are intending to take, and will take any vehicle which is found to be vulnerable; "professional car theft"&#151;where the organised criminal targets a specific make, model, specification and colour of car or possibly a specific car.
<P>

<a name="20624w16.html_para4">Casual car crime is not monitored as a specific aspect of vehicle crime.
<P>

<a name="20624w16.html_para5">There is a growing understanding that many cars are not stolen but are in fact "runabouts". A "runabout" is an old vehicle, without current licence, normally uninsured, which has changed ownership several times since the last notification to DVLNI. These vehicles offer significantly less risk to drivers than the use of stolen vehicles, and it appears that many of the vehicles being used by "casual car thieves" are not stolen, but are "runabouts".
<P>

<a name="20624w16.html_para6">Concerned about the uses to which "runabouts" are put, the PSNI, from 19 March to 16 June 2002, undertook an operation known as "Clean Up". A substantial number of "runabouts" were seized. Some 943 vehicles were seized and owners reclaimed 145. Owners had to produce a vehicle licence or leave a surety of &#163;120 until they produced a vehicle licence. To date 550 "runabouts" have been destroyed and the balance will also be destroyed over the next few weeks, except for a small number, perhaps 20&#150;30, which are considered suitable for auction. The registration numbers, makes and models of all seized

<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w17.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what specialist resources are available for the investigation of domestic violence and sexual attacks; what action has been taken in this area in the past three years for <i>(a)</i> research, <i>(b)</i> education; <i>(c)</i> crime prevention and <i>(d)</i> officer training; and how many staff and how many staff hours were employed in these areas, and at what cost, in each of the last three years.  [60861]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w17.html_spnew2"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The PSNI currently has 35 Domestic Violence Liaison Officers. All received initial training in domestic violence procedures which was followed up during 2000 by a further accredited course from the university of Teesside through which each officer gained a certificate in Professional Policing (Domestic Violence). Each officer performs a minimum 40 hour week, working on a nine-to-five basis.
<P>

<a name="20624w17.html_para1">The work of these officers supports the front-line uniform response officers who are required to take decisive action at the scene of a domestic dispute. In addition, it is hoped that by autumn 2002 the PSNI will have completed work to enable uniform officers to access an Integrated Crime Information System (ICIS) database containing background information surrounding a potential violent incident prior to arrival at the scene.
<P>

<a name="20624w17.html_para2">The role of the Domestic Violence Officer is currently under review and it is intended that external agencies will be consulted as a basis of determining a multi-agency perspective on how to improve the service offered to victims of domestic violence. The PSNI makes use of research undertaken by its partners in the multi agency response to the problem.
<P>

<a name="20624w17.html_para3">Leaflets and posters have also been distributed by the PSNI throughout Northern Ireland on domestic violence. These have recently been translated into ethnic minority languages and are available in various areas of public contact.
<P>

<a name="20624w17.html_para4">All PSNI officers receive Child Abuse and Rape Enquiry (CARE) training. CARE unit detectives receive specialist training on child abuse and rape trauma syndrome. There are presently 12 CARE units, including five CARE suites staffed by a total of 85 highly trained officers. The CARE suites provide a non-threatening environment for the interview of children, comfortable interview rooms for victims of sexual offences and well equipped medical facilities where forensic medical officers can carry out examinations.
<P>

<a name="20624w17.html_para5">The Police Service of Northern Ireland, through its CARE Co-ordinator, carries out research into the various aspects of both child abuse and sexual offending. It works in liaison with the ACPO portfolio holders in relation to the development of educational lessons within the service provision.
<P>

<a name="20624w17.html_para6">In addition to the staff employed in CARE units, other officers from District Command Units and CID undertake work on sexual attacks.
<P>

<a name="20624w17.html_para7">Due to the variety of staff who provide support in both these areas of police work information regarding the number of staff hours and staff costs could be obtained only at disproportionate cost.

 The Exchequer benefits from not bearing the printing and destruction costs associated with non- Bank of England sterling notes in circulation.

At the price of gold at close on 19 June the 395 tonnes of gold would be valued at $4.1 billion (around &#163;2.7 billion at exchange rates at close on 19 June).

<P>
<P>
<a name="20624w18.html_spnew5"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Association of British Insurers reported on 13 May 2002 that there is now a significant or high risk that 61 per cent. of the current 10.2 million mortgage endowments (covering 6 million households) will not pay out enough to pay off the target sum, usually the amount of the mortgage loan. This is based on the first 1.25 million re-projection letters and cannot be taken as a representative sample. The percentages are likely to change.
<P>

<a name="20624w18.html_para3">FSA research conducted in spring 2001 indicated that only three out of 10 policyholders had taken action to remedy their potential shortfall. Of the seven out of 10 households that have taken no action, around half had good reasons. For example, they had repaid the loan by other means and were continuing to fund the endowment as a savings vehicle.

2002, some &#163;151 million in compensation has been paid to endowment policyholders following the complaints process. In addition, and as a result of the Financial Services Authority's (FSA) regulatory activities, some 20 firms have agreed proactively to compensate policyholders who were mis-sold their policies. This involves around 218,000 in policies, leading to total compensation of around &#163;315 million due to be paid.

 Reduced rate items are limited by agreements with our European partners.

However, in response to representations made by the Government, the European Commission has indicated that it will consider a reduced rate of VAT for listed places of worship in their general review of the reduced rates, which is due to take place in 2003.

 <i>[holding answer 10 June 2002]:</i> I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20624w19.html_para0">The Wanless report noted that 85 per cent. of prescriptions are dispensed free of charge and that the level of charges for those who have to pay is capped by the pre-payment certificate arrangements. We are taking steps to make pre-payment certificates more accessible. From 1 October, the prescription pricing authority (PPA) will take responsibility for issuing these certificates. The application form will be redesigned and carry the PPA's address, all patient material will be revised and pharmacists will be encouraged to publicise the availability of prescription pre-payment certificates. Once the new arrangements are in place, we can examine the opportunities for further improvements to access.

 My noble and learned Friend, the Lord Chancellor, is committed to a system of judicial appointments that is fair to applicants and ensures that vacancies are filled promptly by candidates who best meet the published criteria. To this end, he published a consultation paper in April of this year on ways in which the selection procedures for the Circuit Bench and Recordership might be restructured or streamlined. Competitions for these appointments in 2002&#150;03 have identified more suitable candidates than there are vacancies. The competitions for these appointments that would normally have begun in April 2002 have therefore been suspended for between six and 18 months. Any new vacancies that arise during this period will be made from reserve lists.
<P>

<a name="20624w19.html_para2">Similarly, in respect of the High Court Bench, there are many suitable candidates remaining from the 2000 selection round. Very few vacancies are expected over the next year. In the circumstances it would be both inappropriate and impracticable to mount a full scale recruitment exercise. The Lord Chancellor has, however, decided that people with appropriate judicial experience should not be denied the opportunity to be considered for these vacancies. Some 2000 holders of judicial office have therefore been invited to express interest in these appointments.

 As at 1 May 2002 all 107 High Court judges were of white origin, six of whom were women. The following table provides information on the Circuit Bench, District Bench and Recorders as at 1 May 2002. It shows the total number, the number and proportion of women judges and those judges who have stated on an ethnic monitoring questionnaire that they are of white origin. Applicants and part-time judges whose appointments have been renewed are asked to complete a questionnaire about their ethnic origin, but they are not obliged to do so. Many of those who have been appointed for some years will not have been asked to complete

The fee levels for each service have been determined according to the total costs for that service and in all cases have been set at a level lower than full cost recovery for that service. Thus in the first year of regulation by the Commission domiciliary care providers will only pay 24 per cent. of the actual cost of registration and inspection. In addition, we have agreed to make a concession to small agencies and set the annual fee at 50 per cent. of the level for other agencies. A small agency is defined in the regulations as one where no more than two members of staff, including registered persons but excluding someone employed solely as a receptionist, are employed at any one time.

 The Department commissioned the residential forum to produce the guidance. This was published on 27 March. On the same day I issued statutory guidance to the National Care Standards Commission, under Section 6 of the Care Standards Act. The guidance sets out how the Commission should apply the regulations and standards in relation to staffing levels in care homes, to ensure that the approach to staffing levels is not rigid and that it avoids placing additional burdens on care homes.

 The Government is providing records levels of funding for social services. Resources have increased nationally by 20 per cent. in real terms between 1996&#150;97 and 2002&#150;03, an average real terms increase of 3 per cent. per annum. In addition, as announced on 17 April, we are increasing the resources for personal social services by an annual average of 6 per cent. in real

terms from 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06. Councils have been incentivised to use some of their 6 per cent. annual increases to stabilise the care home market and fund home care services for older people.
<P>

<a name="20624w25.html_para2">Included within these additional funds are resources provided to meet the cost care homes incur in meeting the care standards. We expect local authorities to reflect this in the fees they pay homes, as laid out in the "Building Capacity and Partnership in Care" agreement. The Department will continue to review the progress that is being made in the implementing of the agreement.
<P>

<a name="20624w25.html_para3">The setting of fee levels are a matter for local decision and we have no plans to intervene in local negotiations.

 No. The report into Lynde House Nursing Home was commissioned independently by Kingston and Richmond health authority, which regulated Lynde House under the Registered Homes Act 1984, and is not the responsibility of the Department. Under the Health Authorities (Establishment and Abolition) (England) Order 2002, responsibility for the findings of the report will fall to Richmond and Twickenham Primary Care Trust and the South West London health authority, which replaced Kingston and Richmond health authority on 1 April 2002.
<P>

<a name="20624w25.html_para4">The National Care Standards Commission took over responsibility for the regulation of all care homes in England on 1 April 2002. The Commission will, of course, bear in mind the findings of the report and any other relevant information when inspecting the care home in future.

<a name="20624w25.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We currently have no plans to publish the review of "Feet First", nor to place a copy in the Library. Since the review was undertaken the focus on policy has shifted from professionally-led guidance to patient-led services. We want to ensure national health service organisations like the new primary care trusts make decisions on services based on their local populations' clinical needs. To help them make these decisions, and to ensure clinical input, chiropodists have been involved in the development of national service frameworks (NSF) for older people and diabetes. The NSF for older people, which was published in March 2001, sets performance measures for accessing chiropody/podiatry services.

<P>
<a name="20624w25.html_spnew6"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 At present, the Department does not hold statistics that would allow us to answer this question. Since the introduction of the quality protects programme, individual local authorities should be compiling their own data about the progress of young people who they were looking after on the sixteenth birthday from August 1998, so that they have information about the education and employment outcomes of young people who have been in their care.

<a name="20624w25.html_para5">The Children (Leaving Care) Act was commenced in October 2001. As part of the arrangements for monitoring the Act, local authorities are now required to submit details to the Department about the education, training and employment of 19-year-old care leavers, who had been looked after in their seventeenth year. The first set of data from this sample will be published in autumn 2002. It would then be possible to match this data with other information about young people's last placement prior to leaving care, to research whether for this cohort of young people there are significant correlations between placement type and education and employment outcomes.

<P>

<a name="20624w25.html_para6">These figures were considered too unreliable to publish at local authority level, because of confusion in some authorities as to whether to include all disabled children or only those who need services by virtue of their disability or disabilities.

<a name="20624w26.html_para0">We recognise that people with epilepsy can sometimes experience difficulty in receiving appropriate services and adequate treatment for their condition.

 The national minimum standards do not duplicate the rules of other agencies although they may refer to them for completeness. The national standards are designed to ensure care provision is fit for the purpose and meets the assessed needs of residents. It is for the National Care Standards Commission to decide in the particular circumstances of each individual home whether the home conforms to the standards necessary to meet the assessed needs of its residents.
<P>

<a name="20624w26.html_para5">The commission must take national standards into account when making a decision as to whether an establishment complies with statutory requirements under the Care Standards Act. However, providers and their representative organisations urged that the commission should be allowed to take a range of other factors into account and the commission may also take into account any other factors it considers reasonable or relevant to do so. For example, compliance with other statutory requirements, as assessed by the relevant regulatory body.
<P>

<a name="20624w26.html_para6">With the exception of environmental health issues, the responsibility for enforcement of health and safety requirements in care homes, as with all other establishments, rests with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). There is a degree of overlap in some areas between health and safety requirements and national standards but these are complementary rather than two organisations covering the same angle. The commission is currently working with the HSE and Local Government Association to develop a memorandum of understanding to clarify each other's roles and responsibilities in health and safety matters. The memorandum will be underpinned by locally agreed protocols. This will aid clarity in liaison with other bodies should adverse incidents arise and ensure protection of vulnerable people in care.

<a name="20624w27.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 We have no plans to develop a national programme of cosmetic prosthesis services. The national health service already provides silicone cosmesis coverings for prosthetic limbs free of charge to prosthetic limb users. We have made funding available for these coverings totalling &#163;4 million for three years from April 2001 and the full range of prosthetic limb components is now available from disablement service centres.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) pursuant to his answer of 17 June 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 168W, on hospital discharges, in which paragraph and page number in the NHS Plan the target to reduce the number of delayed discharges from hospital by 20 per cent. between March 2002 and March 2003 is set out;  [63871]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether his target to reduce delayed discharge by 20 per cent. in the period March 2002 to March 2003 is for <i>(a)</i> the number of people that experience delayed discharge and <i>(b)</i> the number of bed days that a person is kept in hospital awaiting discharge.  [63814]<P></UL>

<a name="20624w27.html_spnew1"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The NHS Plan target to reduce the total number of people that experience delayed discharge is in paragraph 12.9 on page 102 and states that we will end widespread bed blocking by 2004. The target to reduce the number of people that experience delayed discharges from hospital by 20 per cent. between March 2002 and March 2003 was set for the national health service as a milestone to progress to this overall target. This is expected to also reduce the number of bed days that people are kept in hospital awaiting discharge.

 The national strategy for carers, "Caring about Carers", gave advice to social services departments and to the national health service on promoting carers health and safety, including the need for training, and quoted studies about the effect of caring on people's health and safety. The Department also commissioned a report, recently published, from the Office for National Statistics on the "Mental Health of Carers". Earlier this year the Health and Safety Executive published guidance on manual handling, "Handling Home Care", which highlights issues for service providers and their care staff and for service users and their families.
