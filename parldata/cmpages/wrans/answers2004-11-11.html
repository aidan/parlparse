 Changes to the way Business Link organisations deliver their services mean that an increased part of their service is being provided free of charge. This has implications for VAT. It is a basic principle of VAT that when an activity is provided free of charge there is no supply for VAT purposes and the supplier therefore cannot recover the VAT incurred on purchases.

 Keeping animal testing to the necessary minimum is a prime objective of the UK Government in negotiating the REACH regulation. Our aim is to protect human health and the environment while

keeping bureaucracy to a minimum and keeping animal testing down both by use of alternative methods and by avoiding duplicates. Our proposal for &quot;one substance one registration&quot; commands support because it is designed to meet all these UK negotiating requirements and discussions in Council Working Groups are continuing on that basis.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41111w05.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_22">We welcome the fact that there is now widespread acceptance of the need to minimise animal testing. Concerns of the UK and others have led to several provisos being included in the legislative proposal to encourage maximum use of existing data, avoid duplication of testing and to require the use of alternative methods wherever possible and appropriate.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41111w05.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_23">The Commission proposal includes a pre-registration phase which should allow for data sharing. There are also incentives to encourage consortia formation through sharing fees incurred in the registration process. The UK has proposed a mandatory system of &quot;one substance, one registration&quot; to ensure data sharing and decrease the burden on regulators, and this is currently being discussed in Council Working Groups.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41111w05.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_24">The UK Government have in place a programme for work on improving animal welfare in research and in May 2004 we set up a New Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research with a doubling of the budget for the current year to &#163;660,000. The new centre will develop a UK strategy for the implementation of the 3Rs, fund high quality research that advances the 3Rs, provide advice on the 3Rs and animal welfare to the scientific community and work with regulators on the acceptance of alternative methods for regulatory toxicity testing. The work of the centre will help to reduce the animal experiments required under REACH.

[196822]</p>








<p><a name="st_39"><a name="41111w05.html_spnew1"><b> Alun Michael: </b> 
 The UK Government&#039;s approach to REACH is to achieve the best possible outcome in terms of protecting human health and the environment while keeping both the bureaucratic burdens on industry and the extent of animal testing to the necessary minimum. REACH is currently under negotiation in Council and in the European Parliament and is unlikely to be agreed before 2006. Once agreed REACH will phase in existing substances over 11 years. REACH is still being negotiated and any estimate of how many experiments would be needed over each of the next five years could be misleading.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41111w05.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_25">The information needed by REACH to provide the basis for protecting human health and the environment may come from a number of sources, of which animal testing is only one. The chemical industry already has some of this information while there are other sources of information such as mathematical modelling and read-across of data from one chemical to another which will reduce the number of new experiments that will be required.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Nov 2004 : Column 818W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41111w05.html_para4">
Another factor that will lead to further reductions in the number of experiments that will be conducted under REACH is the significant amount of testing that has taken place internationally over recent years and is ongoing on high production volume chemicals (those produced or imported in quantities over 1,000 tonnes per year) that will not need to be repeated.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41111w05.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_26">It is an overall objective for the UK Government, in negotiating the REACH Regulation, to ensure that animal testing is kept to the minimum necessary to protect human health and the environment.

<p><a name="st_102"><a name="41111w12.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 The trans-European energy network programme (TENs) provides assistance for feasibility studies and pre-construction development for infrastructure projects, particularly interconnectors, between member states and between the EU and its neighbours. Gas and electricity interconnectors make an important contribution to security of supply. The annual budget for TENs is small (currently &#8364;20 million) compared to the investment necessary to bring projects to fruition. TENs support can, however, be a catalyst for investment by supporting the initial stages of projects. Information from the Commission shows that in the period 1996&#150;2001 a total of 140 actions in 53 projects received assistance totalling &#8364;123 million, with 56 per cent. going to natural gas projects and the remainder to electricity projects. UK projects have received a proportionate level of support from the TENs energy programme.

Notes:<br>

1. The mortgage interest rates used in the calculations are the general rates that applied at the time that the first-time buyers made their purchase. And, for those years when MIRAS existed, they reflect the net interest rates after MIRAS.<br>

2. For consistency, it is assumed throughout that the type of mortgage was a &quot;repayment&quot; mortgage. In other words the repayments reflect both payments of both interest and part capital.<br>

3. Data up to and including 2002 are based on a 5 per cent. sample of mortgage completions. The 2003 figures are based on a significantly larger sample.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

3. Definition of selected group of diagnoses:<br>

Type I diabetes: 3 character primary diagnosis code = E10 or 4 character primary diagnosis code = 0240.<br>

Type II diabetes: 3 character primary diagnosis code = E11 or 4 character primary diagnosis code = 0241.<br>

Coronary heart disease: 3 character primary diagnosis code between 120 to 125.<br>

Stroke: 3 character primary diagnosis code between 160 to 164<br>

4. Figures have not (yet) been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to visit other countries to assess their immigration and asylum procedures.  [191272]</p>








<p><a name="st_226"><a name="41111w24.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 Formal discussion of immigration and asylum procedures takes place in a number of fora at both EU and international level. Myself and other Ministers also undertake bilateral visits to meet our counterparts in other countries, which provides opportunities to assess their immigration and asylum procedures.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41111w24.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_140">For example, along with other Ministers, I will be visiting other EU member states in the run up to the UK presidency, primarily in order to promote the justice and home affairs agenda. This will be combined with my usual ministerial duties and will give me an opportunity to assess the immigration and asylum procedures in the states which I visit. As part of this programme I have recently visited Hungary and the Czech Republic.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41111w24.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_141">The UK also maintains strong co-operation with the Governments of our key cross-channel partners on immigration and asylum issues. The Home Secretary leads on these contacts and meets with his counterparts when possible. He will be meeting with his French counterpart in mid-November.

<a name="stpa_142">In terms of visits further afield, at the end of October I visited China and Vietnam as part of the UK&#039;s continuing engagement with the Chinese and Vietnamese Governments on asylum and immigration

issues. China remains the source of a significant number of asylum applications and illegal entrants. During my visit I discussed with Chinese Ministers and senior officials how the number of unfounded applications can be reduced and how the UK and China can work together to dismantle the criminal gangs responsible for facilitating illegal entry to the UK. We also considered how we can improve the system for returning those who have no leave to remain in the UK. Asylum applications from Vietnam have shown year-on-year increases from 2001 to 2003, and we are working closely with the Vietnamese Government to address this. My trip included a day in Vietnam where I was able to discuss this further with Ministers and officials. While in Hanoi, I also signed a Memorandum of Understanding between the UK and Vietnam on migration issues which will facilitate the return to Vietnam of Vietnamese citizens residing illegally in the UK and also sets out a framework for future co-operation on migration.

The centre had served as a magnet for would-be illegal immigrants and a centre for people smugglers. This package of measures has formed the basis for much of the work that is currently ongoing of moving the UK&#039;s border controls to France.

These measures successfully prevented over 9,000 people reaching the UK from France during 2003.

<p><a name="st_235"><a name="41111w25.html_spnew6"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 A child in such a case has in fact been eligible for compensation since the scheme rules were changed with effect from 1 October 1979 to admit cases of intra-family violence (where the victim and assailant were living together as members of the same family), which had previously been excluded. Proposals to admit cases involving intra-family violence occurring before the 1 October 1979 rule change have been considered whenever amendments to the scheme have been mooted. However, successive administrations have decided not to change the rule because it would add a large and unacceptable burden to the costs of the scheme.

 Two surveys one in 1998&#150;99 and one in 2001&#150;02 provide estimates of the prevalence (long standing as well as new cases) of self-reported work-related stress, anxiety or depression since 1997. Data from these surveys indicates that the estimated prevalence of self-reported work-related stress, anxiety or depression among females aged 16 to 34 was 68,000 cases in 1998&#150;99 and 85,000 cases in 2001&#150;02.

<sup>(33)</sup> Data for 2003 is based on a different occupational coding structure to the other years.<br>

<sup>(34)</sup> Number of reported cases are too low in individual years to make individual year estimates reliable. For all years 1999&#150;02 there were in total an estimated 184 cases of work-related mental ill-health among prison officers.<br>

THOR comprises seven surveillance schemes for work-related ill-health. Each scheme has reporters from a specific medical specialty and new cases seen by the specialist are reported that the specialist believes are related to work. This network is run for HSE by Manchester university.<br>

Note:<br>

Where proceedings involve more than one offence dealt with at the same time, the figures relate to the principal offence. The basis for selection of the principal offence is laid down in rules by the Home Office. In summary these indicate that, where there is a finding of guilt, the principal offence is usually that for which the greatest penalty was imposed. Where there has not been a finding of guilt (e.g. on acquittal or committal for trial) it is usually that for which the greatest penalty could have been imposed.<br>

The Plan outlines a series of measures developed to specifically encourage the Protestant community to consider working for the Housing Executive in the future, and therefore apply for vacancies, whether permanent or temporary, when they arise. The measures put in place include:

 The Provisional IRA maintains its capability but as the recent IMC report states, there is no evidence of intent to return to a campaign of widespread terrorism and its paramilitary activities have declined in recent months. Dissident republicans have continued to carry out attacks although many of their activities have been thwarted, intercepted or nullified by the security forces. INLA&#039;s activities have been confined principally to &#039;civil administration&#039;. The report by the Independent Monitoring Commission published on 4 November gives further details of the activities of all republican terrorist organisations.

 In June 2004, the Department and Ofsted published &quot;A New Relationship with Schools&quot;, setting out our plans for a shorter, sharper school inspection system, based around a schools own self-evaluation. From September 2005 all school inspections will provide schools with less notice of an inspection, involve fewer inspectors, spending less time in schools. Hence all schools will experience a significantly reduced weight of inspection. The proposals will require that all schools be inspected at least once every three years, providing more relevant information for parents and their communities, but will operate such that higher performing schools can expect to receive fewer inspection visits. There are no plans to introduce further differentiation in inspection requirements at this stage.
