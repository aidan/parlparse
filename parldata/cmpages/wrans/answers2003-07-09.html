 This information is obtainable from the Votes and Proceedings and from the <i>Official Report</i>. It could be collated only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para0">I stressed to the House in my business statement on 3 July that I have already made it clear that I regard the decision of the House in respect of hours as one for the rest of the Parliament. I do not intend to make it a practice to go beyond the moment of interruption. My hon. Friend will be aware that the events in Iraq have had a considerable impact on the business of the House and it is for that reason that business may continue beyond the normal moment of interruption, allowing the House every opportunity fully to scrutinise and contribute to the business coming forward up to and including 17 July.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w01.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Following publication of the consultation paper "Safety and Justice" on 18 June, there will be a 12 week public consultation exercise, during which responses will be sought from numerous groups including the Women's National Commission who have organised several meetings across the UK with survivors of domestic violence. In addition, specialist groups are being consulted such as Imkaan, Southall Black sisters, Broken Rainbow, The Employers' Forum on Disability, Disability Rights Commission, the Employers' Forum on Age, Mencap, and Age Concern.

<P>
<a name="30709w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 During this critical phase in the reconstruction of Iraq, I am extremely concerned that women's rights are given adequate attention.
<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para1">Indeed, the Coalition Provisional Authority's gender equality team&#151;which includes a secondee from the DTI Women and Equality Unit&#151;is currently assessing women's rights in Iraq within the framework for a women's conference that will take place in Baghdad shortly. Officials are holding discussions with in-country Iraqi women, who are legal experts, on constitutional and legal reform aiming to assess and improve women's rights. These discussions will feed into two of the workshops of the women's conference, mirroring the emergent political process and feeding recommendations into the system.

<a name="30709w01.html_sbhd3"><H3 align=center>Work-Life Balance</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Minister for Women what measures she plans to introduce to achieve a better work-life balance for women.  [123330]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 We are committed to giving women&#151;and men&#151;the chance to improve their work-life balance. We have already increased maternity pay and leave, introduced paid paternity leave, extended these rights to adoptive parents, and introduced the legal right of parents of children under six and disabled children under 18 to get requests to work flexibly considered seriously.
<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para2">We will continue to promote best practice in flexible working through the work-life balance campaign. The campaign aims to persuade companies that they could see real business benefits through flexible working; for example, in a recent major work-life balance baseline survey by DTI, four fifths of employers who have work-life balance practices in place report a positive effect on employment relations, and three quarters said they had a more motivated and committed workforce as a result of these practices.
<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para3">We are also providing practical support through the work life balance challenge fund, which offers subsidised consultancy to develop flexible working projects. The current call for applications ends on 31 July 2003, and we are looking to support up to 200 projects this year.
<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para4">These measures, mean that women and men now have more choice and more support than ever before to balance childcare and work in ways that benefit everyone: employers, employees and their children.

<a name="30709w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Williams: </B> 
 At its meeting on 7 July the Commission approved the NAO's Corporate Plan for 2004&#150;05 to 2006&#150;07. In line with previous arrangements when devolved government in Northern Ireland is suspended, the Commission also considered the Corporate Plan for 2004&#150;05 to 2006&#150;07 of the Northern Ireland Audit Office. The Commission agreed to take note of this.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what estimate she has made of the impact of Alstom's decision to terminate train manufacturing at its Birmingham Washwood Heath Plant on jobs in <i>(a)</i> the supply chain and <i>(b)</i> the West Midlands region.  [124507]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w01.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 My Officials within the Government Office for the West Midlands are in discussion with officers from Birmingham City Council's Economic Development Department, the Regional Development Agency, Jobcentre Plus and Alstom's senior managers over the future of the Washwood Heath plant. Alstom's plans for the site are not yet clear but officials will continue to work closely with the company to support both Alstom and their supply chain as appropriate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w01.html_wqn7"><B> Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry when the Export Credits Guarantee Department first received allegations of corrupt practice by BAE Systems regarding the supply of a defence equipment package to Qatar signed in 1996.  [123019]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 ECGD did not receive allegations of corruption by BAE Systems in respect of the Qatari defence package signed in 1996. In May 2001, ECGD was made aware by the Serious Fraud Office of an investigation being carried out in relation to this project by the Attorney General of Jersey.

<a name="30709w01.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>Broadband</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Rosindell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent assessment she has made of the benefits of broadband access for small and medium-sized businesses.  [124256]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government believe that the key benefits of broadband for small and medium-sized businesses, as for all businesses, are speed and convenience. A broadband connection can carry 10 times more information than a narrow-band (dial-up) connection. Broadband services can change the way businesses operate, enabling new markets to be reached with potentially beneficial effects on productivity and competitiveness. Broadband allows businesses to respond faster to their customers' needs; supports greater flexibility in working practices; and with its fixed cost, allows businesses to budget more effectively.




<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 2003 : Column 790W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para5">Through UK Online for Business, we continue to look at the benefits provided by broadband connection when promoting the use of this important technology. Evidence of benefits has come mainly in the form of case studies, where individual experiences in the use of broadband are examined. These case studies have shown that small and medium-sized businesses achieve real benefits through faster transmission, constant connection and increased productivity. Installation and connection costs have been seen to be outweighed by the benefits achieved.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w01.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The information is as follows:

<a name="30709w01.html_para6"><i>Nursery Places</i>
<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para7">DTI staff in Central London have access to six nursery places. The weekly cost to the Department for a full-time place for an under 2-year-old is &#163;209.50 and &#163;178.00 for 2-years-old and over. Staff contribution is levied at a flat rate of &#163;112 per week for a full-time place irrespective of the age of the child. Children attending nursery on a part-time basis are charged pro rata. There are currently eight children using the six places.
<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para8"><i>Holiday Playscheme</i>
<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para9">DTI staff in Central London have access to a 32 place holiday play-scheme for a minimum of 54 days each year. Staff contribute &#163;14.00 per place towards the &#163;31.00 daily fee. DTI HQ staff in Cardiff have access to a local Easter and Summer holiday playscheme for a contribution of &#163;12.00 per place towards the &#163;24.00 daily fee.
<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para10">DTI's total expenditure on all child care costs for 2002&#150;03 financial year was &#163;58,525.
<P>

<a name="30709w01.html_para11">DTI's child care provision is set within the wider context of an ambitious programme to support flexible working at all grades. In a DTI child care survey parents and carers indicated that flexible working is the provision they value most highly, to help them balance their work and home-life. DTI is also participating in the Interdepartmental Group on Childcare.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what policies <i>(a)</i> initiated and <i>(b)</i> managed by her Department since 2001 have had an impact on Pendle; and if she will make a statement.  [124098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w02.html_spnew0"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 North West Development Agency's Pendle Economic Regeneration Programme is providing &#163;6.4 million over four years from 2002 to promote the economic infrastructure and boost business competitiveness in the area. This is in addition to ongoing policy initiatives that were in place before 2001, including Business Link East Lancashire, which

<P>
<a name="30709w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the <i>(a)</i> cost and <i>(b)</i> level of provision of electricity generated by (i) coal-fired power stations and (ii) environmentally friendly sources.  [123363]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Electricity generation from coal in the United Kingdom in 2002 amounted to 124.4 TWh, equivalent to 32 per cent. of total UK generation. Electricity generation from renewables and wastes amounted to 11.4 TWh, equivalent to 3 per cent. of total UK generation. Most recent estimates of generation costs from different types of plant are contained in a report, "Long-Term Reductions in Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the UK" by an Inter-departmental Analysts Group (IAG) which was published in February 2002. A copy of the IAG report is in the Libraries of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what efforts are being made to encourage the use of electricity generated by environmentally friendly plants.  [123364]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Government have put in place a range of measures to promote and encourage the use of energy from environmentally friendly plants using renewable forms of energy.
<P>

<a name="30709w02.html_para0">Chapter four of the Energy White Paper "Our energy future&#151;creating a low carbon economy" sets out the Government's policy on the increasing role renewable technologies will play in our overall energy policy, and highlights many of the successes that have already been achieved.
<P>

<a name="30709w02.html_para1">We have put in place a framework of measures to encourage the renewables generation and supply industry: our target is that 10 per cent. of the UK's electricity sales should be from renewable-sourced electricity by 2010. To help achieve the necessary growth to reach that target, we have introduced a range of important measures:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Renewables Obligation (and associated Renewables Obligation Scotland). Introduced in April 2001, these require all licensed electricity suppliers in Great Britain to supply a specified and growing proportion of their sales from renewable sources.
<P>
<BR>
The Obligation is underpinned by a package of funding worth nearly &#163;350 million, which will support our ongoing New and Renewable R and D programme, and extensive programmes of capital grants for new and emerging technologies such as energy crops and other forms of bio-energy, offshore wind, solar photovoltaics, wave and tidal power.

<BR>
In order to develop our offshore wind potential, last year we published a consultation entitled "Future Offshore", which sets out a strategic framework to support the development of that industry. That document proposed that future development should take place in three strategically significant areas&#151;namely the north-west (including Liverpool Bay), the Greater Wash and the Thames Estuary.
<P>
<BR>
The Renewables UK unit was set up last year with the specific aim of maximizing the benefits of renewables to UK industry, and to help that industry develop.
<P>
<BR>
Industrial users of renewable sourced electricity also benefit from exemption from Climate Change Levy payments. A proportion of the proceeds from the Climate Change Levy contributes to the New 2 Renewable R and D programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Key performance targets for the Department of Trade and Industry are agreed as part of the Spending Review. The latest set were published in "Spending Review 2002: Public Service Agreements 2003&#150;06" (Cm 5571). Progress towards these targets is monitored by the Department together with HM Treasury and the Prime Minister's Delivery Unit and is reported on regularly in DTI's annual Departmental Report (Cm 5916) and Autumn Performance Report (Cm 5731).
<P>

<a name="30709w02.html_para2">The Departmental Report also sets out and reports on the key targets for DTI's seven Executive Agencies (Companies House, Patent Office, Insolvency Service, Employment Tribunal Service, National Weight and Measures Laboratory, Radiocommunications Agency and Small Business Service). These are agreed and set by the responsible Ministers each year in the context of discussion and agreement to the agency's corporate plan. Performance against the agencies' targets is monitored by their steering boards, which include independent members and Departmental representatives, and reported annually to Ministers.

<P>
<a name="30709w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 July 2003]:</i> DUKES 2003 (to be published on 31 July 2003) lists 14 coal fired power stations with a total capacity of 23,214 MW; this excludes capacity which is mothballed or in receivership. In addition there exists dual fired plant (coal/gas or coal/oil) with a combined capacity 5,405 MW. The total UK coal fired plant including such dual fired installations hence comprises a total capacity of 28,619 MW; (28.6 GW).
<P>

<a name="30709w02.html_para5">Three stations are currently fitted with flue gas desulphurisation (FGD) equipment: Drax, and Ratcliffe (combined total 5,870 MW) and West Burton. West Burton is not yet fully operational but this is anticipated by early 2004 producing then a total FGD capacity of 7,802 MW; (7.8 GW).
<P>

<a name="30709w02.html_para6">Based on the full inclusion of West Burton, the percentage of UK coal fired plant capacity fitted with FGD is approximately 27 per cent. However the Environment Agency has also received applications for the installation of FGD at Cottam (2 GW), Eggborough (1 GW) and Rugeley (1 GW). Some additional

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how much has been spent on centrally funded projects and initiatives to reduce truancy in schools by his Department since 1997.  [119435]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </B> 
 The Department has directly funded publicity materials aimed at parents, a number of practitioner conferences and the commissioning of research into truancy. Spending in these areas totals approximately &#163;700,000. In addition it has supported a wide range of work at local level by local education authorities and schools to improve both behaviour and attendance through the Standards Fund. Local education authorities have made decisions about local priorities, and much of the funding has been delegated to schools.




<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 2003 : Column 802W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30709w05.html_para0">Since September 2002, the Department has also allocated &#163;50 million of Behaviour Improvement Programme funding to 34 local education authorities to support work with targeted groups of schools in improving pupils' behaviour. One strand of this programme is focused on improving attendance. From April 2003, under the national Behaviour and Attendance strategy, initial payments totalling around &#163;14 million have been made to all local education authorities in support of the strategy objective of providing training and support to every secondary school in England.
<P>

<a name="30709w05.html_para1">Because the aim of all these measures is to both improve behaviour and increase attendance&#151;and action in respect of one will often have an impact on the other&#151;it is not possible to identify separately the level of expenditure allocated to tackling truancy.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w05.html_wqn6"><B> Phil Sawford: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when contributory pensions were introduced for members of the armed forces; what criteria have to be met to qualify for a pension; and what changes have been introduced in these criteria since 1970.  [124509]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w05.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Members of the Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) pay no direct contribution towards their pension entitlement, although the independent Armed Forces Pay Review Body abates comparator pay, currently by 7 per cent. to take account of the value of the pension relative to those of selected comparator schemes. An individual qualifies for a preserved pension and tax-free lump sum of three times the pension at age 60, provided they have been members of the AFPS for 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 2003 : Column 805W</I><P>
at least two years. Immediate pensions are paid after 16 years (officers) or 22 years (other ranks) and a full pension after 34 and 37 years respectively, at age 55.
<P>

<a name="30709w05.html_para7">The only significant change to the criteria for members' pensions since 1970 has been the introduction of the preserved pension in 1975 for those leaving the Armed Forces too early to receive an immediate pension. Armed Service Pensions were awarded to those who served before 1975 but only to those who completed the necessary qualifying periods of 22 years (from age 18 for other ranks) and 16 years (from age 21 for officers). Prior to 1975 there was no requirement for pension schemes to preserve benefits for those who left the scheme early. The qualifying periods for the AFPS were much less than for most other schemes at that time and, in addition, those who left before qualifying for pensions, but who had completed nine years (for officers) or 12 years (other ranks), were paid a gratuity. The provisions were changed in 1975 to meet with the requirements of the Social Security Act 1973 but in keeping with the policy of successive Governments, the provisions were not made retrospective. A number of changes have been made to other scheme criteria, notably to the eligibility criteria for widows' pensions and recently those for unmarried partners.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w06.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps have been taken by principal personnel officers in the Army to identify best practice in dealing with bullying; in what form common procedures have been established; and what the agreed definition of bullying is.  [112620]




<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 2003 : Column 807W</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 The Army's zero tolerance policy towards bullying is reviewed regularly to ensure best practice in the light of experience and to take account of emerging legislation. The policy was re-emphasised when the new Armed Forces Code of Social Conduct was issued to all personnel in January 2000. The Armed Forces Diversity policy, issued subsequently in June 2002, strives to create an environment that is free from harassment, intimidation and unlawful discrimination. In this spirit, the Army, in common with the other two Services, has set up a confidential helpline for use by personnel who consider themselves to be the victims of bullying or harassment.
<P>

<a name="30709w06.html_para0">The Army's policy on bullying is promulgated extensively through the chain of command. Commanders at all levels are briefed specifically on it and the policy features widely in service literature. In addition each unit routinely publishes orders at least every six months reminding personnel of their rights as individuals and how to raise a complaint if they feel they are being bullied. The chain of command also issues reminders on bullying policy where it considers it necessary to do so.
<P>

<a name="30709w06.html_para1">There is no legal definition of bullying. However, the Army defines bullying as the abuse of physical or mental strength or a position of authority to intimidate, persecute or victimise individual(s).

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps have been taken to discourage the use of illegal drugs at Deepcut barracks since 1995.  [124174]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w06.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Drug misuse is unacceptable in the armed forces and the Services have vigorous education and training programmes aimed at deterring drug misuse. Steps taken include drugs awareness lectures and regular poster campaigns to promote awareness on the dangers and consequences of the misuse of drugs. In recognition of the growing drug problem within the society from which it recruits, the Army introduced a Compulsory Drug Testing programme in May 1995. All measures to deter the misuse of drugs have, and continue to be, applied at Deepcut as they are applied at all military units.

<UL>(2) what discussions have taken place between <i>(a)</i> the UK Government and <i>(b)</i> the EU with the US Administration concerning the proposed ESDP deployment to the Democratic Republic of the Congo. [119855]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w06.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The United Kingdom Government have on-going discussions on the situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo, including the ESDP deployment, with the US Administration. Under the European Security and Defence Policy the EU undertakes operations where NATO as a whole is not engaged. The EU Secretary General/High Representative, Mr Solana, briefed NATO Foreign Ministers, including US representatives, on EU discussions about the operation in the Democratic Republic of Congo on 3 June. NATO Foreign Ministers welcomed this transparency. There was no suggestion that NATO would become engaged. NATO and the EU are autonomous organisations. As such, they take decisions independently of each other, albeit in close consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w06.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Research programmes have been undertaken since the mid 1980s into the threat posed by electromagnetic energy, including high power microwave and radio frequency sources, to both military and civil electronics-rich systems. This research has produced guidelines and procedures to alleviate these effects, by using good equipment fabrication practice, shielding techniques and hardened circuit design.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary discussed reconstruction in the context of security sector reform with President Karzai and Foreign Minister Abdullah Abdullah during his recent visit. Without improved security, wider reconstruction efforts will not be possible. The UK is contributing &#163;16.6 million this year to security sector reform; and has spent more than &#163;170 million on development assistance to Afghanistan since September 2001.

 None. This is an issue for the two sides to discuss within the context of the measures introduced in response to the partial lifting of the restrictions on freedom of movement. We welcome all efforts to improve relations between the two communities, which have demonstrated that Greek and Turkish Cypriots can live together peacefully.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w09.html_spnew14"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Persons refused entry to the UK at the juxtaposed controls in France who claim asylum are served with a written Notice of Refusal of Leave to Enter, which tells them that the United Kingdom is under no obligation to consider their asylum claim and that they are to be handed over to the competent French authorities.
<P>

<a name="30709w09.html_para21">These procedures apply both to persons with no travel documents and to those holding invalid/improper travel documents.

 <i>[holding answer 7 July 2003]:</i> The Home Office press office does answer media queries on behalf of the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) and recently provided an answer to a question from a local newspaper about Clearsprings.

<a name="30709w09.html_spnew17"><B> Beverley Hughes </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 July 2003]:</i> The Government opened negotiations with the Afghan Authorities on return issues following the change of regime in Afghanistan. These negotiations resulted in the signing of a Tripartite Memorandum of Understanding by the UK Government, the Afghan Authorities and the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) on 12 October 2000. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) establishes a framework for returns from the UK to Afghanistan. We continue to have talks with the Afghan Authorities on the subject. Most recently, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary met President Karzai in London on 4 June 2003, and restated the Government's commitment to ensuring that returnees have access to reintegration assistance in Afghanistan. We will continue to work with the Afghan authorities to ensure that returns to Afghanistan are sustainable.

<P>
<a name="30709w10.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what rights Turkish Cypriots resident in occupied Cyprus will have to <i>(a)</i> visit the UK for work, <i>(b)</i> settle in the UK permanently and 



<P>
<P><I>9 Jul 2003 : Column 826W</I><P>

<P>
<a name="30709w10.html_spnew2"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Cypriot nationals, wherever they may reside, will have the same rights as current EU nationals to live and work in any of the existing member states from accession. Like current EU nationals, they will be able to remain in the UK for as long as they are exercising their EC Treaty rights&#151;for instance, by working, studying or being self-sufficient. In addition, UK law provides that EU nationals, except students, who have been exercising their Treaty rights in the UK for four years may apply for permanent residence. EC law obliges EU member states to admit EU nationals on production of their valid passport or identity card so the UK will not impose any visa requirements on Cypriot nationals from accession.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what assessment he has made of the contribution of the gambling industry to the British economy in terms of <i>(a)</i> jobs and <i>(b)</i> contributions to the Treasury; and if he will make a statement;  [124452]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="30709w10.html_para0">The partial regulatory impact assessment included in "A safe bet for success" (Cm 5397), which we published last year, estimated that the gambling industry supports about 125,000 (full-time or equivalent) jobs and contributes about &#163;1.5 billion a year in gambling taxation; and that implementation of the Government's legislative proposals could lead to an increase in net gambling expenditure of at least &#163;500 million a year (with consequential increases in both employment and taxation). The Department has commissioned no research itself since the report of the Gambling Review Body (Cm 5206) into difficulties faced by the gambling industry here or in other European countries, but in developing the proposals set out in Cm 5397 we have taken note of a number of economic and other assessments undertaken on behalf of business.

 No timber has been supplied so far for use in the new Home Office building. The developer has informed us that timber has been purchased by their sub-contractors for their use during construction in performing their obligations under the construction contract. This timber comprises 217 m <sup>3</sup>  of which 46 per cent. are softwoods from France, and the remainder plywood 30 per cent. from Indonesia, 23 per cent. Brazil and 1 per cent. Finland. In addition 2,917 pieces of sawn softwood have been sourced from forests in Austria. All this timber has been legally imported with UK Customs clearance.
<P>

<a name="30709w10.html_para4">The timber from Austria and Finland had PEFC (Pan European Forestry Certification&#151;European Ecologic Norms). The timber from France came from a forest with a sustainable forest management programme. Plywood from Indonesia and Brazil was legally imported but the developer has not yet been able to supply information about the exact sources within these countries. The plywood from Finland was a trial purchase of sustainable plywood sources made by the developer's sub-contractors seeking an alternative to tropical sources.
<P>

<a name="30709w10.html_para5">On 6 June the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs issued a clarification to Departments that it was policy to monitor the sourcing of timber purchased and used by contractors in the construction process, as well as timber purchased for use in the new building. The contract will in future be administered to include monitoring of the legal and sustainable sources of such timber.
<P>

<a name="30709w10.html_para6">I refer the hon. Member to the answer given by my hon. Friend the Member for Stretford and Urmston (Beverly Hughes) on 13 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 221W, on timber. An undertaking was given to place in the Library copies of certificates for the sustainable and legal timber sourcing. This is being done in respect of the Austrian, Finnish and French timber. Those from Brazil and Indonesia will be provided as soon as they are received from the developer.
<P>

<a name="30709w10.html_para7">I am satisfied that arrangements are in place to ensure that all future timber purchases whether for use in the construction process or for use in the new building will be shown to be obtained from legal and sustainable sources. The developer has informed us that it intends that no further plywood for use in 2 Marsham street will be sourced from Indonesia.

 The Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis informs me that at the end of May 2003 there were 28,602 police officers in the Metropolitan police service (MPS) against a budgeted workforce target for the policing year ending 31 March 2004 of 29,856 officers. There are therefore some 1,254 vacancies (although this changes on a weekly basis).
<P>

<a name="30709w11.html_para0">The recruitment target for the MPS in the current year is 3,440. This takes account of projected leavers from the service and continuation of the recruitment of additional officers as part of the safer City campaign. The MPS continues to attract applications and has in place the processes to ensure it meets its recruitment plans.

 Privatisation is not a pre-condition for countries to start receiving debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. In 1999, the UK pressed successfully for debt relief to be frontloaded, so that countries begin receiving relief at the start of the process, when they have developed an Interim Poverty Reduction Strategy&#151;a blueprint for a national strategy to tackle the causes of poverty and developed a satisfactory track record in economic management.
<P>

<a name="30709w13.html_para1">However, in order to receive an irrevocable reduction in their stock of debt, there are three types of conditions that countries have to,meet in order to complete the HIPC process. Firstly, they must demonstrate commitment to poverty reduction by developing and implementing a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper for one year. This is a nationally owned and led strategy, which analyses the causes of poverty, sets out how these will be tackled and specifies how government resources, including savings from debt relief, will be used. Secondly, countries must demonstrate sound economic management by remaining on-track with an IMF programme. Thirdly, countries must implement a set of reforms, known as Completion Point triggers, which are agreed between the government and the IMF at the start of the HIPC process. These reforms cover a range of measures. Among the 26 countries that have so far qualified for relief, there are a total of 317 Completion Point triggers. Of these, only 41 relate to privatisation and regulatory measures. The Government monitors progress towards meeting these triggers, including taking a view on whether the triggers are still relevant, through both the six-monthly progress reports from the IMF and World Bank, and through discussions at country level. Where overall progress is satisfactory but certain conditions are seen as no longer relevant, or delays have occurred that are beyond a country's control, countries can still complete the HIPC process. For example, Mauritania recently completed the process despite delays in the privatisation of their utility companies.

 DFID provides funds to support street children in Colombia (&#163;20,000), Ecuador (&#163;30,000) and Brazil (&#163;241,000). The money is given to local institutions and non-governmental organisations.
<P>

<a name="30709w14.html_para0">Funds are provided for projects such as addressing the issue of social exclusion by street children and their families, and helping disadvantaged street children attend formal schooling with a view to attaining circus qualifications. Funds are also provided to a 'From Street Children to all Children' project to improve the access of children from poor communities in Rio de Janeiro to education, health and other public services and promote a better understanding of the needs of children and youth in the community.

To ask the Solicitor-General how many cases were referred to the Crown Prosecution Service by the Thames Valley Police in each of the last three years; what percentage of referred cases were dropped by the Crown Prosecution Service; and what percentage of referred cases resulted in a criminal conviction.  [123912]<P>

<a name="30709w14.html_spmin0"><B>The Solicitor-General:</B> 
 The CPS holds records for each of the 42 Areas of the Service. These are not always coterminous with the boundaries of the 43 police forces; Thames Valley is an area where the police boundary differs from that of the Crown Prosecution Service. Further, cases may be completed in an area different from that in which they originated.
<P>

<a name="30709w14.html_para1">The following tables show the number of cases received by CPS Thames Valley in magistrates courts and in the Crown court for each of the last three years, and the eventual outcome of proceedings. The number of cases dealt with may differ from the number received because incomplete proceedings are carried over from year to year. Cases may result in a number of different outcomes: these are shown in full to provide a complete picture.

2. The figures have been rounded to the nearest thousand.<P>

3. The data refer to households claiming council tax benefit, which may be a single person, a couple or a family. More than one benefit household can live in one property, for example two or more adults in a flat or house share arrangement.<P>

4. The figures include estimates for local authorities that have not responded. These estimates are based on historical and regional data. This type of estimate is standard practice in reporting totals where there have been non-respondents.<P>

5. The figures exclude any second adult rebate cases.<P>

6. Council tax was introduced in April 1993. Figures for 1991&#150;92 and 1992&#150;93 refer to community charge benefit.<P>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. The data have been taken from FOD's FOCUS database and refer to the numbers of inspection contacts (which may not correlate precisely with the numbers of inspections) in the Bolton local authority.<P>

2. Data on numbers of inspections are not available.<P>

3. Data for years 1993&#150;94 and 1994&#150;95 are not available.<P>

4. The data exclude contacts to premises now inspected by HSE's Hazardous Installations Directorate, part of which was subsumed in FOD until 1996.<P>

5. The high number for inspection contacts in 1996&#150;97 is believed to be due in large part to a programme of management audits in the health services.<P>

 Page 44 of the document "Measuring Child Poverty&#151;Preliminary Conclusions" for example, two pieces of analysis can produce different figures for a minimum income necessary for a lone parent with one child aged 5 was not referring to two actual pieces of analysis, but using an example to illustrate a specific point. The point being made is that different methodologies can be used to calculate a minimum income, and as there are a number of subjective decisions in these research methods, two pieces of analysis can conceivably produce different answers for the same family type.

<P>
<a name="30709w16.html_spnew3"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Estimates of pension credit entitlement are not available at an individual constituency or county level due to insufficient sample cases in the survey data used. However, around half of all pensioner households across Great Britain will be eligible for pension credit. They stand to gain, on average, &#163;400 a year.
<P>

<a name="30709w16.html_para3">Pension credit, unlike the means tested benefits of the past, is simple to apply for, involving a straightforward phone call. Once awarded the majority of pensioners, aged 65 and over, will not have to notify changes in their financial circumstances for a period of five years. Pension credit rewards, not penalises saving, ensuring that those who have worked hard to save modest amounts gain from having done so. By ignoring any income from savings below &#163;6,000, 85 per cent. of pensioners getting pension credit will see any income they receive from their savings ignored completely.

<sup>(12)</sup> A positive median difference indicates that the rent referred to the rent officer is higher than the relevant standard local housing allowance.<P>

<P>

<i>Notes</i>:<P>





1. Properties with three or more rooms (excluding kitchens, bathrooms and toilets) are shown as a proxy for larger family units of accommodation. However, no information is collected on the type or size of household living in each property, so the figures may also include multiple adult households and house-sharers.<P>

2. Referrals where there is under-occupation (where a property is larger than the tenant qualifies for under the size criteria) have been excluded.<P>

3. Median gaps are uprated to 2003&#150;04 prices and rounded to the nearest 10p.<P>

4. The Rent Officer data relate to all referrals made over a year. They will differ from the Housing Benefit caseload in that some claims will not be successful (for example, because the person's income is too high) and because some people may claim more often than others (for example, because they move house, or leave and then return to benefit). The figures will therefore over-represent short duration claims.<P>

5. The estimates do not take account of any effect on behaviour caused by the SLHA scheme. E.g. some people may currently sign up for tenancies which are much more expensive than the local reference rent, since they do not know how the rules work and are unable to find out how much rent HB will pay for. But one of the main objectives of the Pathfinders is to make tenants aware of their budget in advance.<P>

6. Local reference rents can change over time, depending on the rent officer's judgment about the local housing market. Local reference rent figures from 2000&#150;01 (the latest currently available) may not give an accurate prediction of SLHAs in 2003&#150;04.<P>

7. The median differences between actual rents and local reference rents (LRRs) vary across the pathfinders depending on the impact of LRRs. Variations in median differences may be due to the type of area and availability of accommodation and will also depend on the calculation of the LRR and the judgment of Rent Officers as to the relevant local housing market.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what preparations he is making for the commissioning of dental services by primary care trusts, with particular reference to the support and training to be provided to primary cary trusts; and what estimate he has made of the levels of funding that primary care trusts will receive to fund local NHS dentistry services.  [123612]<P>

of these events, discussions are taking place with strategic health authorities about what form of support would best ensure a successful transition.
<P>

<a name="30709w19.html_para4">Subject to Parliament, funding for primary dental services will be allocated to PCTs. These funds, hitherto held centrally and administered by the Dental Practice Board, will then be part of PCTs' general allocation. Current spending will be protected and in the longer term, allocations will need to take health needs into account, as general allocationscurrently do. In some areas that may mean making additional funding for dentistry available to PCTs so that they can begin to address the long-term oral health inequalities that many of them face. That would be taken into account in future allocations within the framework of the funding formula.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what recent research he has commissioned on <i>(a)</i> the financial advantages for dentists who move to private practice from the national health service and <i>(b)</i> the reasons why dentists choose to move to private practice.  [124046]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30709w19.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Department has not commissioned research on the financial advantages for dentists who move to private practice from the national health service or the reasons why dentists choose to move to private practice.
<P>

<a name="30709w19.html_para5">It is widely recognised that some dentists initially chose to increase their proportion of private practice as a consequence of the new contract introduced in 1990. The contract was implemented without fully piloting many of the changes it contained. As a result of problems with the new arrangements, there was a reduction in dentists' fees in 1992 to stabilise the system.
<P>

<a name="30709w19.html_para6">It has been identified in successive reports from Bloomfield's "Fundamental Review of Remuneration" in 1992 to the Health Select Committee in 2001 that dentists' current main cause of disaffection with the NHS is the way in which they are paid. The Health and Social Care (Community Health and Standards) Bill puts in place a framework by which it will be possible to pay dentists differently and reward them for different types of work. This will mark a move away from the current item of service system, which many dentists complain of.
<P>

<a name="30709w19.html_para7">The Office of Fair Trading (OFT) published a report in March into the private dentistry market in the UK. The government welcomed the report and share the OFT's concerns about the market. One of the broad conclusions of the OFT's survey research was that dentists face very little competitive pressure. It is therefore relatively easy for dentists to enter the private market and retain their patients, who may "lack the information necessary to make informed choices", according to the report.

The interpretation of international coding rules in ICD-10, compared with the rules used in 1CD-9, has led to an apparent decrease of 40 per cent. in the number deaths coded to head injuries. The figures should therefore be interpreted with caution. The effect of the major changes to mortality statistics in ICD-10 compared with 1CD-9 were described in a report published in May 2002.<P>

<P>
<a name="30709w22.html_spnew7"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government have implemented a comprehensive strategy to advance its long-term goal of employment opportunity for all, including tackling the range of barriers that can stand in the way of people taking up work.
<P>

<a name="30709w22.html_para6">Delivered through Jobcentre Plus, the jobseeker's allowance regime provides individuals who are out of work and actively seeking employment with the advice and support they need to find jobs. For those who remain unemployed for longer, the Government's Welfare to Work strategy seeks to equip people with the skills and opportunities they need to compete successfully in the labour market, and this approach includes extending help to groups that may face particular barriers to work. For example, the New Deal for lone parents provides a comprehensive package of support including help with training, education and child care, and the New Deal for partners of benefit claimants will be enhanced from April 2004 to provide the same package of support. Participants in the New Deal for over 50s, who may have been out of the labour market for some time, are eligible for training grants to help update their skills. The New Deal for disabled people provides a national network of innovative job brokers to help disabled people locate and move into secure employment.
<P>

<a name="30709w22.html_para7">Support has also been extended to local areas with high levels of worklessness where residents may face multiple barriers to work. For example, Employment Zones in 16 areas of England, Scotland and Wales allow jobseekers and their personal advisers to use funds with complete flexibility to overcome individual barriers to work.
<P>

<a name="30709w22.html_para8">The Government have also reformed the benefits systems to improve work incentives and ensure that individuals are rewarded as they move into, and progress within, employment. The national minimum wage (NMW) provides fair minimum incomes from work, and the working tax credit, introduced in April 2003, is designed to tackle poor work incentives and persistent poverty among working people, providing support on top of the guarantee provided by the NMW.

 Entrust is a private, not-for-profit company limited by guarantee. It was appointed the regulator of the Landfill Tax Credit Scheme (LTCS) by the previous Government in 1996. It works to Terms of Approval agreed with Customs and Excise and is closely monitored to ensure that it is carrying out its regulatory function in line with these obligations. The current Terms of Approval took effect on 5 October 2001, and are available on the Entrust website at www.Entrust.org.uk
<P>

<a name="30709w23.html_para0">Part of Customs' stewardship of Entrust is to monitor its expenditure. A survey in 2000/01 established that its administrative costs are in line with similar bodies. Later this year Customs will complete another survey. Under the Terms of Approval the Board of Entrust submits its annual report to the Commissioners of Customs and Excise.
<P>

<a name="30709w23.html_para1">If Entrust were to cease to trade then the assets of the company would be transferred to a successor body or, where this does not exist, to a body with similar objectives. The company is financed through enrolment fees from approved environmental bodies and through an agreed percentage of qualifying contributions received by these approved bodies (currently 2 per cent.).
<P>

<a name="30709w23.html_para2">Details on the Directors of Entrust and their experience can be found on their website. Also to be found there are the Terms of Approval which cover the appointment of Directors. It is the policy of the Board of Entrust that any appointment takes place in accordance with the principles laid down by Lord Nolan.

 The Government have a PSA target to reduce by a quarter the number of children living in relative low-income households by 2004&#150;05, as a contribution to its long-term goal to halve child poverty by 2010 and eradicate it by 2020.

<a name="30709w24.html_para0">As a result of personal tax and benefit reforms introduced since 1997, from April 2003, on average, households with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be &#163;2,500 better off a year in real terms compared to 1997. This includes the effect of the child tax credit, introduced in April this year. Combined with child benefit, the child tax credit delivers up to &#163;54.10 a week in support for first child, compared to &#163;27.70 a week in April 1997.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what impact the New Deal programmes have had on <i>(a)</i> helping the long-term unemployed achieve a successful return to work, <i>(b)</i> supporting disadvantaged groups and areas that suffer from low levels of unemployment and <i>(c)</i> ensuring that individuals are rewarded in employment.  [124209]<P>

<P>
<a name="30709w24.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The New Deal for Young People (NDYP), for 18&#150;24 year olds, and the New Deal for those aged 25 and over (ND25+), provide comprehensive support for young and older long-term jobseekers. These programmes have helped to reduce both long-term and youth long-term unemployment by over three quarters since 1997. Almost 430,000 long-term unemployed 18&#150;24 year olds have found jobs through NDYP, while ND25+ has helped more than 145,000 people back into work. Independent research has confirmed the positive impact of the New Deal, Chapter 4 of Budget 2003 (HC 500) provides further information
<P>

<a name="30709w24.html_para1">The Government has extended this approach to support groups that experience particular labour market disadvantage. The New Deal for over 50s, introduced nationally in 2000, has assisted nearly 94,000 people into jobs and has helped increase the employment rate of those aged between 50 and state retirement age to 69 per cent. (winter 2002) from 65 per cent. in 1997.
<P>

<a name="30709w24.html_para2">All lone parents who are not working or working less than 16 hours a week are eligible for a comprehensive package of support through the New Deal for Lone Parents, which has assisted nearly 194,000 lone parents into jobs and helped to increase employment among lone parents from just over 40 per cent. throughout the early 1990s to 54 per cent. (summer 2002). The New

<P>

<a name="30709w24.html_para3">The Government has also taken steps to provide further support for local areas with high levels of worklessness. Action Teams have been introduced in 63 disadvantaged areas of England, Scotland and Wales, focusing resources on the long-term unemployed and economically inactive and using these resources in innovative ways to overcome specific local barriers to work. Employment Zones in 15 areas of England, Scotland and Wales allow long-term unemployed people aged 25 or over and their personal advisers to use funds with complete flexibility to overcome individual barriers to work, and have helped over 28,500 people into work. Budget 2003 announced details of further steps to extend the help provided by Employment Zones more widely and to encourage innovation among providers. In addition, the 2002 Pre-Budget Report announced the Government's intention to pilot a programme of intensive support, including accelerated access onto the New Deal after just three months of unemployment, in 12 neighbourhoods with very high concentrations of worklessness from April 2004.
<P>

<a name="30709w24.html_para4">The Government's welfare to work policies have been supported by reforms to strengthen work incentives. The National Minimum Wage (NMW) provides fair minimum incomes from work, and will be increased to &#163;4.50 an hour for adult workers aged 22 or over, and &#163;3.80 an hour for workers aged between 18 and 21 or in approved training, from October 2003. The Working Tax Credit, introduced in April 2003, is designed to help tackle poor work incentives and persistent poverty among working people, providing support on top of the guarantee provided by the NMW. The table below demonstrates how the Government's reforms have increased the minimum income that people can expect when moving into work since the introduction of the NMW in April 1999 and the Working Families Tax Credit in October 1999, including through the increases in the NMW in October 2003.

 Estimates for each of the years requested are not available. An independent analysis commissioned by the Royal Mint has shown that, of a sample of one pound coins collected in late 2002, just under 1 per cent. were counterfeit. However, there is uncertainty as to the extent to which this sample can be regarded as a reliable indication of all coins in circulation. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the true figure may be lower.
