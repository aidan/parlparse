To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what action he is taking to improve recruitment to the cadet branch of HM armed forces.  [105144]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Recruitment to the cadets is undertaken through the local and national initiatives of each individual cadet force. The three Services provide funding and advice to these national youth organisations, with the help of the Territorial, Auxiliary and Volunteer Reserve Associations.
<P>

<a name="00302w01.html_para0">Army funds support Army Cadet Force recruitment, including the recent "Attitude" marketing campaign. Phase 2 of this successful national campaign to recruit cadets and adult instructors will start later this year.
<P>

<a name="00302w01.html_para1">RAF funding and advice supports local recruiting initiatives by the Air Training Corps. Advice and support from the Services and MOD is available where required to units of the Combined Cadet Forces. Although the Sea Cadet Corps is an independent charitable body, the Royal Navy provides support and advice in the context of recruitment.
<P>

<a name="00302w01.html_para2">In addition, we fully expect that the additional &#163;3 million we have made available over a four-year period following the Strategic Defence Review, for a range of manpower, training equipment, and infrastructure enhancements for all cadet forces, will further encourage cadet recruitment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps he is taking to phase out the use of peat compost in gardens <i>(a)</i> owned and <i>(b)</i> tended by his Department; and if he will make a statement.  [110727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w01.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In line with the MOD's Departmental Plan on the Greening Government Initiative, my Department is looking at ways to ensure that any use of peat in the maintenance of its grounds is substituted by organic waste. This reflects the advice within the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions Greening Operations Guide.

<a name="00302w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence further to his answer of 24 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 63W, on the European Peacekeeping Force, what is his policy on the level of capabilities the European Peacekeeping Corps should attain, in terms of <i>(a)</i> operational deployment range and <i>(b)</i> optimal UK commitment.  [112387]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 As explained in my answer of 24 January, there is no intention of creating a "European Peacekeeping Corps". At the Helsinki European Council EU states committed themselves to being able, by 2003, to deploy rapidly and sustain up to 50,000-60,000 troops capable of the full range of Petersberg tasks.
<P>

<a name="00302w01.html_para3">The operational range of these forces and the question of national contributions are being discussed as part of the follow-up work to Helsinki under the Portuguese Presidency. No decisions have yet been taken.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The MOD in conjunction with the FCO carried out a detailed and comprehensive review of attache and adviser placement and their roles as part of the follow up work to the Strategic Defence Review. This review, which was approved by the Defence Council on 20 September 1999, determined where British Defence attaches and advisers should be accredited to best serve British Defence interests abroad. The Official Committee for Service Attaches and Advisers (OCSAA) subsequently scrutinised each post in every Defence Section prior to approving, on 20 October 1999, the implementation plan which will bring into effect the changes agreed in the review.

 No Royal Navy ships or submarines were within one hour's sailing distance from the site of the Solway Harvester disaster on 11 January. At the time the mayday was raised, the nearest vessel was the RFA Bayleaf, which was some 30 miles west of the Solway Harvester's position. HMS Vigilant was in the Atlantic Ocean conducting training in deep water. I am withholding her precise location under exemption 1 (Defence Security and International Relations) of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. HMS Vigilant returned to Faslane on 14 January for repairs to a defective seal on her radar mast, sailing again on 16 January.

 The Ministry of Defence (MOD) was approached by the Department for International Development (DfID) on Saturday 26 February as to the availability of British military equipment in and around Mozambique. We advised them that there were no military assets in the region. Since then we have been examining, in conjunction with DfID, options for the deployment of MOD personnel and equipment from beyond the immediate area. An MOD team was sent to the region on 29 February to carry out reconnaissance and planning work.
<P>

<a name="00302w02.html_para0">As a result, on Wednesday 1 March we jointly announced a decision to provide four Puma helicopters and around 100 aircrew and support personnel to assist in the immediate rescue operation. We are continuing to work closely with DfID to determine what further help we can provide.

 I have not initiated any research into child poverty in Wales. However, the Government are committed to tackling poverty and social exclusion in the UK.

<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 332W</I><P>
(Mr. Brake), of 21 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 524W, what comparators he used to calculate the PPP infrastructure companies' estimated efficiency improvement of 20 per cent.  [11592]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The briefing note PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) published in December 1999 assumed that under the Public Private Partnership for London Underground the private sector infrastructure companies will bring efficiency improvements of 20 per cent. The PwC note, which has been placed in the House Library, sets out the basis for assuming this level of efficiency savings, which is in line with the experience of other industries where the financing and management of infrastructure programmes has been transferred to the private sector.
<P>

<a name="00302w02.html_para5">Since the PwC briefing note was published, Arthur Andersen and the London School of Economics have completed a report for the Treasury Taskforce called "Value for Money Drivers in the Private Finance Initiative". This shows the PFIs of all types are, on average, delivering efficiency savings of 17 per cent.

[111591]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Under the terms of the Public Private Partnership (PPP) for London Underground, infrastructure companies will be required to implement a combination of specific projects and performance enhancements specified in output terms. The PPP will not, therefore, in general specify particular amounts of money to be spent, nor particular works to be carried out. It will be for bidders to decide what they have to do to meet the performance specification for each infrastructure company.
<P>

<a name="00302w02.html_para6">However, when the PPP competition was launched in June 1999 London Underground published a briefing document containing estimates of how much they then believed it would cost over the first 15 years to implement the performance regime under development for the PPP. This was broken down as follows:

 I am satisfied that financial assistance under the Bellwin scheme is justified in this case given the exceptional circumstances. A scheme will, therefore, be established under section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Grant has generally been paid to authorities at a rate of 85 per cent. of their eligible expenditure above a threshold. However, a Bellwin scheme was activated for Melton as a result of the 1998 Easter floods. Since Melton have already spent over their threshold for 1998-99 in dealing with that emergency, it seems reasonable that they should not have to do so in dealing with further incidents in the same financial year. I therefore propose to waive the threshold.

 On 13 October 1998, I attended the most recent meeting of the Shipbuilding Forum which comprises representatives of management and trade unionists in the shipbuilding industry, its suppliers and customers, as well as key Government Departments. At the Forum, I discussed a wide range of topics including the domestic and international ship market, UK competitiveness, productivity and employment, improvements the Department had made to the Shipbuilding Intervention Fund and the Home Shipbuilding Credit Guarantee Scheme and individual prospective orders. I also received reports on the projects which my Department is supporting to enhance the competitiveness of the industry.

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2000]:</i> A reduction of duty on bio-diesel produced through recycling waste edible oils, from the current diesel duty rate to the rate applicable to road fuel gas, would cost &#163;35 million in a full year if 90,000,000 litres were to be produced. This is the maximum estimated UK production capacity, and does not take account of any possible imports. There is little information available to support the case for a duty reduction to the same level as road fuel gas.

 We continue to see a case for reforming the industrial injuries scheme to reflect better the needs of today's labour market and to improve incentives for prevention of work-related accidents and diseases, and incentives for rehabilitation back into work. Initial discussions with key stakeholders last year have confirmed our belief that there is scope for reform. However, much work remains to be done to decide the best way forward. Against the background of the current major programme of reform to other parts of the Social Security system, the work cannot be completed quickly.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Information is derived from the Households Below Average Income (HBAI) data sets. 1979 is the earliest year for which DSS statistics are available.<P>

2. Estimates for 1979 and 1988-89 are derived from the Family Expenditure Survey and relate to the United Kingdom. Estimates for 1997-98 are taken from the Family Resources Survey and relate to Great Britain. All estimates are subject to sampling error. Results for individual years are sensitive to the precise way in which household incomes are adjusted for household size and composition; the picture of changes over time is generally not sensitive to this.<P>

3. Individuals are classified by the family types in which they live. Pensioners are here defined as a single person is of State pension age or over, or a couple where the man is of State pension age or over. A child is defined as an individual aged under 16 or an unmarried 16 to 18-year-old on a course up to and including 'A' levels or 'Highers' in Scotland.<P>

4. The estimates are presented on household income both Before Housing Costs and After Housing Costs in line with HBAI conventions. Figures are also provided including and excluding the self-employed reflecting concerns over the accuracy of income information for the self-employed at the bottom of the income distribution. All figures for the bottom decile should be treated with caution; the bottom decile of reported incomes cannot safely be construed as the bottom decile of living standards. <P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a further statement on the case of Senator Pinochet.  [110637]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have today decided that I will not order the extradition of Senator Pinochet to Spain. I made this decision under section 12 of the Extradition Act 1989. I have referred the case to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration of a domestic prosecution, in accordance with Article 7 of the United Nations Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. I have also decided not to issue Authorities to Proceed in respect of the extradition requests from Switzerland, Belgium and France. Full reasons for my decisions are contained in the letters to the parties concerned from one of my officials as set out:
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para1"><i>Letter to the Spanish Ambassador:</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para2">2. I am writing to inform you that the Secretary of State has this morning decided pursuant to section 12 of the Extradition Act 1989, to make no order for the return of Senator Pinochet to Spain. This letter sets out the Secretary of State's reasons. He reserves the right to expand on them should it become necessary to do so.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para3"><i>The Secretary of State's approach to his decision</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para4">3. On 14 April 1999, the Secretary of State issued an Authority to Proceed under section 7 of the Act on certain of the charges made in Spain's extradition request. On 8 October 1999, Senator Pinochet was committed by the Bow Street Magistrate on all charges covered by the Authority, to await the decision of the Secretary of State as to whether he should be extradited to Spain. A habeas corpus application was made on Senator Pinochet's behalf on 22 October 1999, which has not yet been heard.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para5">4. The Secretary of State is precluded by the Act from making an order for Senator Pinochet's extradition while his habeas corpus application is still pending. In the ordinary course, the Secretary of State would not make a decision to refuse such an order until all proceedings arising out of the habeas corpus application had been completed. However, he has a discretion to do so in appropriate cases and a duty to consider whether this is such a case. In approaching that discretion, he has proceeded on the basis that he should not at this stage decide against making an extradition order unless it is already clear that there is some decisive factor which would lead him to refuse such an order at the end of the day. The only factor militating against the extradition of Senator Pinochet which is potentially decisive at this stage is the state of his health, and in particular his mental fitness to stand trial.




<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 358W</I><P>

<i>Representations</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para6">5. On 11 January 2000, the Secretary of State informed those acting for Senator Pinochet and the Kingdom of Spain that he had commissioned a medical report on Senator Pinochet, which had been delivered to the Home Office on 6 February 2000. He informed them that the report indicated that Senator Pinochet was unfit to stand trial, and that no significant improvement to that position could be expected. Subject to representations to be received at the Home Office by 5 pm on Tuesday 18 January 1999, he said that he was minded to conclude that no purpose would be served by continuing the current extradition proceeding arising from the Spanish request. Similar letters were sent to representatives of Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and other human rights organisations, which invited them to make such representations if they wished. A statement to the same effect was made to the press on 11 January 2000, and in the House of Commons on the following day.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para7">6. The Secretary of State has received representations from most of those who were expressly invited to make them, as well as from a large number of other parties. He has taken careful account of them. He has also taken account of the points in recent judicial review proceedings in the High Court. In addition, he has reminded himself of the representations which were made to him on the two occasions, in December 1998 and April 1999, when he considered whether an Authority to Proceed should issue under section 7 of the Act in respect of Spain's extradition request.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para8">7. On 15 February 2000, the High Court decided that the Secretary of State was bound to disclose copies of the medical report in confidence to the authorities of Spain, Belgium, France and Switzerland, all of whom have made requests for the extradition of Senator Pinochet. Copies of the report, together with certain ancillary material, were supplied to the Crown Prosecution Service on behalf of Spain and to the embassies of Belgium, France and Switzerland later on the same day. They were invited to make any representation on the report by 5 pm on Tuesday 22 February 2000. Representations were received in response to this invitation from all four requesting states. In the case of Spain, Belgium and France these included opinions from medical practitioners about the material sent to them on Tuesday 15 February 2000. In addition, some other representations on the medical report have been received. The Secretary of State has carefully considered these representations and the opinions annexed to them, with the benefit of expert advice.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para9"><i>Senator Pinochet's health</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para10">8. At the time when the Secretary of State was considering his first and second Authorities to Proceed, he received representations and a certain amount of information about Senator Pinochet's state of health from his solicitors. The tenor of this material was that Senator Pinochet was in some respects frail, as was to be expected in a man of his age. It did not, however, suggest that he was either physically or mentally unfit to stand trial. The Secretary of State did not regard this information as justifying the refusal of either of the Authorities to Proceed which he then issued.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para11">9. The first sign that a serious problem about Senator Pinochet's health might be developing came on 6 October 1999, when, two days before judgment was given in 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 359W</I><P>
the committal proceedings, the Bow Street Magistrate excused him from attending the judgment in person. This decision was based on evidence given to the court by the general practitioner attending Senator Pinochet.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para12">10. On 14 October 1999, shortly after the decision of the Magistrate to commit Senator Pinochet, the Secretary of State received through diplomatic channels representations from the Chilean Embassy, supported by medical reports, which suggested that there had been a recent and significant deterioration in Senator Pinochet's health. The Secretary of State did not regard this material as conclusive. It did, however, suggest the possibility that Senator Pinochet might be unfit to stand trial. He therefore decided to invite Senator Pinochet to submit to a medical examination by a team of clinicians appointed by him. The object was to obtain an independent, comprehensive and authoritative report on the relevant clinical facts. Senator Pinochet consented to undergo an examination, and the Secretary of State then selected, with the assistance of the Chief Medical Officer's advice, a team of clinicians to carry it out, having the required range of specialisations and no inappropriate personal interest in the case. They were:

<a name="00302w09.html_para17">11. The clinicians were instructed to undertake the examinations and procedures which they judged desirable in order to provide the Home Secretary with a fully comprehensive report on the state of Senator Pinochet's health. In particular, they were asked to advise the Secretary of State whether, in their view, there were any aspects of Senator Pinochet's state of health which, separately or together, suggested that he was not then fit, or was likely to become unfit, to stand trial in Spain. They were told that the Secretary of State was particularly interested in Senator Pinochet's ability to follow a line of questioning, to recall events, some of which took place as long ago as the 1970s, and to give coherent evidence. To the extent that any of the contents of their report were influenced by observation of Senator Pinochet's conduct and manner, they were asked to advise the Secretary of State on the extent to which that conduct and manner were capable of being consciously influenced by the Senator himself.

<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para18">12. It should be pointed out that the clinicians were not expected, in reaching their conclusions, to take responsibility for the legal test of fitness for trial, nor does the Secretary of State consider them to have done so. Their function was to ascertain the clinical facts. The test of fitness for trial which has been applied, both in framing their instructions and in assessing their report, is the responsibility of the Secretary of State, who in turn has drawn extensively upon the opinions of his legal advisers.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para19">13. The medical examination was conducted in Spanish at the Northwick Park Hospital in London over a period of some six hours on 5 January 2000, and the report was delivered to the Home Office on the following day. Certain information supplementing the report was supplied afterwards. This comprised (i) a short account of the procedures followed at the examination, which was supplied by Professor Grimley Evans on 7 January 2000; (ii) a copy of the neuropsychological report of Dr. Wyke, which had been summarised in the principal report but not annexed to it; and (iii) an explanation of neuropsychological testing by way of introduction to Dr. Wyke's report. This material was supplied to the four requesting states with the principal report on 15 February 2000. In addition, the Secretary of State has referred to Professor Grimley Evans and his colleagues the representations received on their report, and medical opinions annexed to those representations, and he has received their comments.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para20">14. As the Secretary of State disclosed in his announcements on 11 and 12 January 2000, the conclusions of the medical report indicated that Senator Pinochet was unfit to stand trial and that no significant improvement to that position could be expected. The Secretary of State has considered the matter afresh in the light of all the material referred to in the preceding paragraph, and in the light of representations which he has received on the subject. Having done so, he is satisfied that the conclusions of the original report were correct and that it is right to regard Senator Pinochet as unfit to stand trial.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para21">15. The critical facts are as follows:
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para22">(1) Senator Pinochet was born on 25 November 1915. He is 84 years old. The Secretary of State does not regard Senator Pinochet's age as being in itself a sufficient basis for his present decision. But he has taken account of it in assessing the significance of other aspects of his state of health.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para23">(2) The clinicians instructed by the Secretary of State concluded that Senator Pinochet would not at present be mentally capable of meaningful participation in a trial. In reaching that conclusion, they were obliged to make assumptions about what kind of participation in a criminal trial would in law be regarded as "meaningful" in determining the fitness of an accused. Those assumptions are apparent from the conclusion of their report and are considered in sub-paragraphs (3) and (4) below. So far as the Secretary of State has attached weight to them, he is satisfied that they are appropriate.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para24">(3) The clinicians expressed their opinion about Senator Pinochet's capacity for meaningful participation in a trial on the basis of (i) Senator Pinochet's memory deficit for both recent and remote events; (ii) his limited ability to comprehend complex sentences and questions 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 361W</I><P>
owing to memory impairment and a consequent inability to process verbal information appropriately; (iii) his impaired ability to express himself audibly, succinctly and relevantly; and (iv) easy fatiguability. The Secretary of State considers that all of these factors are potentially relevant to Senator Pinochet's mental capacity to participate in a trial. In this context, he attaches particular importance to Senator Pinochet's memory deficit for recent events, which would affect his ability to relate and understand items of information given to him at a trial, and to his limited ability to comprehend complex sentences and questions and to process verbal information. The Secretary of State has not attached weight to the impairment of Senator Pinochet's capacity to remember remote events, save in so far its recent deterioration is symptomatic of brain damage having a wider significance: see sub-paragraph (6) below.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para25">(4) With these impediments Senator Pinochet would be unable to follow the process of a trial sufficiently to instruct Counsel. He would have difficulty in understanding the content and implications of questions put to him and would have inadequate insight into this difficulty. He would have difficulty in making himself understood in replying to questions.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para26">(5) In assessing the significance of the above matters, the Secretary of State has considered the nature of the issues which would be likely to arise in a criminal trial on the serious charges for which Senator Pinochet has been committed. He has also assumed that at any trial reasonable steps would be taken to mitigate Senator Pinochet's disabilities, for example, by attending to his physical comfort and medical needs, by adjusting the timetable of hearings, and by endeavouring to simplify the proceedings so far as their nature permitted. He has reminded himself that the burden of proof at any trial would be on the prosecution. The Secretary of State does not consider that these matters are capable of mitigating to a significant degree the difficulties to which Senator Pinochet's disabilities would give rise.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para27">(6) The disabilities identified in the medical report are due to widespread brain damage, the major episodes of which seem to have occurred during September and October 1999 when Senator Pinochet suffered a number of strokes. They are not due to the ordinary processes of ageing.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para28">(7) The examination took place on a single day, but the clinicians had access to reports prepared by reputable British general practitioners and specialists attending Senator Pinochet who had examined him on a number of occasions in September and October 1999. These enabled them to cross-refer their observations on 5 January 2000 to earlier observations and to evaluate a characteristic pattern of illness as it had evolved over a period of several months.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para29">(8) The clinicians considered that further deterioration in both his physical and his mental condition was likely to occur, but were unable to express an opinion on the effect (if any) which a trial would have on the rate of deterioration. Their view was that although some day-to- day fluctuation in functional abilities was characteristic of brain damage due to cerebrovascular disease, further sustained functional improvement of a significant degree was unlikely.




<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 362W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para30">16. The Secretary of State has always attached great importance to being able to satisfy himself that the results of the medical examination were not influenced by feigning of any kind. His instructions to the clinicians drew attention to the point and he is satisfied that they have been conscious of it throughout. They have advised him that there was no evidence that Senator Pinochet was trying to fake disability. The impediments were coherent in nature and consistent in manifestation, and the neuropsychological testing showed none of the features of deliberate exaggeration. In particular, those neuropsychological tests which were indicative of original intelligence and educational level showed superior performance. The Secretary of State is advised that there is no practical possibility that the results of the neuropsychological tests were influenced by coaching. He is also advised that while it is possible to simulate with drugs the symptoms of a global impairment of cognitive functions, (i) this is a problem with which geriatricians are particularly familiar, and (ii) Senator Pinochet's cognitive impairment was focal rather than global, a pattern not seen in drug-induced impairment. It is important to point out that the outward manner of Senator Pinochet is not necessarily a reliable guide to his mental condition. It is characteristic of persons with a high level of original intelligence that they are able to mask superficially a significant impairment of cognitive functions.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para31">17. The report of the clinicians who examined Senator Pinochet has been criticised by a number of medical practitioners whose opinions have been transmitted by the examining magistrates responsible for criminal investigations of Senator Pinochet in Spain, Belgium and France, and by certain other parties. In considering these criticisms, the Secretary of State has borne in mind that those who have made them have not examined Senator Pinochet, as the authors of the report of 6 January 2000 did, nor have they had the advantage which the clinicians enjoyed of studying records of Senator Pinochet's recent medical history. The Secretary of State is advised that most of the criticisms made of the report are irrelevant to its conclusions, and certainly to the conclusions that are critical to Senator Pinochet's fitness for trial (see paragraph 15). He is advised that those criticisms which are relevant are medically unjustified. The Secretary of State is satisfied that the advice he has received on these points has been based on a careful and objective analysis of the criticisms. He accepts that advice.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para32">18. The medical report on Senator Pinochet of 6 January 2000 is an entirely independent report by highly qualified specialist practitioners on the relevant clinical facts. In commissioning it, the Secretary of State did not set out to prove any particular point and had no expectation of any particular outcome. He is satisfied that the clinicians who prepared it undertook their task in the same spirit.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para33">19. Letters of request from the examining magistrates in Belgium and France have been transmitted to the United Kingdom, each of which seeks a further medical examination. In addition, Judge Garzon, the examining magistrate in Spain, has called in his representations for a further examination of Senator Pinochet. Senator Pinochet has consistently declined to comply with the invitations addressed to him by requesting states for a further medical examination. The Secretary of State, having taken advice on the point, does not consider that a 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 363W</I><P>
further examination would yield further material of significance. He does not therefore regard it as either necessary or appropriate to commission one in order to determine whether Senator Pinochet is fit to stand trial.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para34"><i>Unfitness to stand trial</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para35">20. The conclusions to which the Secretary of State has come mean that in a criminal trial in England, Senator Pinochet would be found unfit to stand trial, and there would not therefore be any trial of the charges against him on their merits. If this were a peculiarity of English criminal law, the Secretary of State would not attach as much weight to it as he does. However, in the view of the Secretary of State, the principle that an accused person should be mentally capable of following the proceedings, instructing his lawyers and giving coherent evidence is fundamental to the idea of a fair trial. He is advised that the attempted trial of an accused in the condition diagnosed in Senator Pinochet, on the charges which have been made against him in this case, could not be a fair trial in any country, and would violate Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights in those countries which are party to it.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para36">21. After receiving the initial representations of Spain, the Secretary of State asked for further information from those representing Spain about the principles governing these matters in the Spanish system of criminal justice. This information has satisfied him that while the procedure differs in significant respects from that which would be followed in England, the underlying principle is substantially the same. The test of fitness to stand trial in Spain depends mainly on whether the accused is capable of understanding and following the charges against him, answering questions put to him, understanding the oral and documentary evidence for the defence and the prosecution, defending himself and instructing his lawyers. This is consistent with the representations as to Spanish law made on behalf of Senator Pinochet and on behalf of human rights organisations represented by Bindman & Partners. If Senator Pinochet were to be extradited to Spain, his fitness for trial would be assessed there by an objective process of clinical examination and testing. There is no reason to believe that that process would lead to conclusions any different in substance from those of the medical report commissioned by the Secretary of State in England. The Secretary of State is conscious that in Spain as in England, a "trial" may include the process of assessing the Defendant's fitness for trial. However, on the material before him, it is reasonable to assume that if Senator Pinochet were to be extradited to Spain, a trial there on the merits of the charges against him would be found impossible.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para37">22. In considering whether to decide against extradition on account of Senator Pinochet's unfitness to stand trial, the Secretary of State has given careful thought to the alternative possibility of leaving that question to be determined in accordance with Spanish judicial procedures in Spain, in the event that there was no other objection to extraditing him there. He has been advised and has concluded that on the basis of English law he is bound to form a view of his own on Senator Pinochet's fitness to stand trial, and that he cannot refrain from reaching a concluded view on this point on the basis that the question can be determined in Spain. In the light of his conclusion that no improvement in Senator Pinochet's condition can be expected, he considers that no purpose 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 364W</I><P>
would be served by the continuance of the current extradition proceedings in England. These would involve the continued detention of Senator Pinochet here for a period which, allowing for the habeas corpus proceedings and any appeal arising out of them, might be substantial. Any order for the extradition of Senator Pinochet which might then be made would involve the compulsory removal to another country of a man of 84 years of age who must at this stage be presumed innocent, for the purpose of a trial which could not result in any verdict on the charges against him, for reasons that are already apparent to the Secretary of State as the extradition authority in the United Kingdom. The Secretary of State considers that that course would serve no purpose of any substantial value to the interests of justice and that it would be oppressive to Senator Pinochet.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para38">23. The Secretary of State would not necessarily have taken the same view if there had been any realistic prospect that Senator Pinochet's condition would improve, either spontaneously or as a result of treatment. He is aware that in Spanish law the effect of a finding that an accused is unfit to stand trial is to suspend a prosecution for as long as that state of affairs subsists, but it is not tantamount to an acquittal.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para39"><i>Section 12 of the Extradition Act 1989</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para40">24. Section 12(2)(a) of the Act provides that the Secretary of State may not order the extradition of the accused in relation to any alleged offence if it appears to him that: (i) by reason of its trivial nature; or (ii) by reason of the passage of time since he is alleged to have committed it . . . ; or (iii) because the accusation against him is not made in good faith in the interests of justice, it would, having regard to all the circumstances, be unjust or oppressive to return him.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para41">25. The Secretary of State considers that this provision has no application to the present question. Although it would in his view be oppressive to order Senator Pinochet's extradition given his unfitness to stand trial, this state of affairs has not arisen by reason of the passage of time since he is alleged to have committed the offences. But for the lapse of time since the alleged offence, a decision under section 12 might possibly have fallen to be made before Senator Pinochet became unfit, but the cause of his unfitness is the supervening brain damage which appears to have occurred in September and October 1999. That damage was not itself either caused or aggravated by the lapse of time since the alleged offences. Neither of the other two factors identified in the sub-section is relevant.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para42">26. It follows that Senator Pinochet's unfitness for trial is not an absolute bar to his extradition. It is a matter to be addressed as part of the general discretion of the Secretary of State under section 12(1).
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para43"><i>The European Convention on Extradition</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para44">27. The United Kingdom and Spain are parties to the Convention.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para45">28. The Convention requires extradition in all cases to which it applies, subject only to specific and limited exceptions, and to any reservations made by particular contracting states on their accession. In cases falling outside these exceptions and reservations, there is no general discretion. There is no express exception applicable to this case, nor is there any relevant 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 365W</I><P>
reservation of the United Kingdom or Spain. The Secretary of State is advised that it is open to argument whether the Convention is subject to an implicit exception for cases where the primary purpose of any extradition, namely the trial of the charges alleged against the accused, could not be served. In the circumstances of this case, the Secretary of State considers it unnecessary to form a concluded view about that. He has assumed, in reaching his decision, that the Convention does not allow for the refusal of extradition on the ground that the accused is and will remain unfit to stand trial in the requesting state.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para46">29. The Convention is not incorporated into English domestic law save to the limited extent provided for by the European Convention on Extradition Order 1990, SI 1990/1507. This provides simply for the Extradition Act 1989 to apply as between the United Kingdom and other parties to the Convention, and for it to do so on the basis contemplated in section 9(8)(a) of the Act that a prima facie case need not be shown on the committal hearing. Section 12 of the Act therefore applies, as a matter of English law, to extradition proceedings arising out of requests from states party to the Convention. The discretion conferred by it on the Secretary of State must be exercised in such cases.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para47">30. Although the Convention is not part of English domestic law, the Secretary of State attaches great importance to the international obligations of the United Kingdom, and in the exercise of his discretions under the Extradition Act he regards those obligations as both relevant and entitled to considerable weight. In most cases to which the Convention applies they will be decisive. However, the Secretary of State recognises that given the breadth of his discretion under section 12 of the Act there may be some occasions on which the requirements of the Convention are outweighed by other compelling considerations peculiar to particular cases. The Secretary of State considers that they are outweighed by such considerations in this case, having regard in particular to the nature of Senator Pinochet's condition in a man of his age, to its probable permanence, and to its impact on the possibility of a trial of the charges against him.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para48">31. The experience of the Home Office has been that in practice parties to the Convention operate its provisions in a more flexible fashion than its absolute language suggests, and in accordance with basic principles of justice which are common to all of them. It is consistent with this approach that Belgium should have been recorded in the judgment of the High Court on their recent application for judicial review as having
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para49"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>clearly stated that they would support the Secretary of State's decision if only they could be satisfied that Senator Pinochet is indeed shown by the report to be permanently unfit to stand trial;
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00302w09.html_para50">and that Spain should have informed the Secretary of State that they will respect any decision made by the Secretary of State in the exercise of his discretionary powers. In making his decision, the Secretary of State has not attached weight to the matters summarised in this paragraph, but he considers it right that they should be recorded.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para51"><i>Other countervailing considerations</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para52">32. The main consideration which has been urged upon the Secretary of State in favour of allowing the current extradition proceedings to take their course is the importance of ensuring <i>so far as possible</i> that the 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 366W</I><P>
allegations made against Senator Pinochet should be tried. The Secretary of State agrees that this is important. The scope of the charges against Senator Pinochet was substantially reduced as a result of the decision of the House of Lords in R <i>v</i>. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate ex p. Pinochet (No. 3) [1999] 2 WLR 827, but the remaining charges are extremely serious. The Secretary of State attaches great importance to the principle that universal jurisdiction against persons charged with international crimes should be made effective, and he is aware that the practical consequence of refusing to extradite Senator Pinochet to Spain on account of his unfitness to stand trial is that he will probably not be tried anywhere. The Secretary of State is also mindful of the sense of injury which will be felt by those who suffered from breaches of human rights in Chile in the past, as well as their relatives. All of these are matters of legitimate concern, and he has had them very much in mind when considering the evidence about Senator Pinochet's state of health. They are among the reasons why he has required the evidence of Senator Pinochet's condition to satisfy a high standard of expertise, thoroughness, objectivity and cogency before he was prepared to act on it. Ultimately, however, the reservation "so far as possible" cannot be brushed aside. A trial of the charges against Senator Pinochet, however desirable, is no longer possible.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para53">33. The Secretary of State has considered other factors, including a wide variety of matters raised in representations received at the Home Office. This letter has dealt in terms only with those matters which have had a significant bearing on the Secretary of State's decision. It is, however, right to mention the following further points:
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para54">(1) The Secretary of State understands that if Senator Pinochet were convicted in Spain of the offences charged against him, victims of those offences might be entitled to recover civil damages in proceedings ancillary to the criminal trial. The Secretary of State doubts whether this point could be relevant to a decision whether to extradite a person on a criminal charge, but he has reached no concluded view on its legal relevance, because he does not in any event feel able to attach significant weight to it. It is right to add that the point assumes the possibility of a verdict on the charges.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para55">(2) The Secretary of State has not had regard to the possibility, if indeed it is a real one, that Senator Pinochet might be tried in Chile.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para56">(3) The Secretary of State considers that in some circumstances it may be appropriate for him to have regard to political, economic or diplomatic interests of the United Kingdom in exercising his discretions under the Extradition Act. He has not had regard to such factors in making his present decision.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para57"><i>Referring the decision to the Court</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para58">34. The Secretary of State has been urged by a number of those who have made representations to him to leave to the Courts the question whether Senator Pinochet should be discharged on account of unfitness to stand trial. He has considered this possibility but does not propose to adopt it.




<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 367W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para59">35. The High Court has power to discharge accused persons who are being unlawfully detained, and such further powers as are specifically conferred on it by the Extradition Act 1989. It has no inherent supervisory power over extradition. Under section 11(3) of the Act, the High Court on the hearing of a habeas corpus application has a duty similar to that of the Secretary of State under section 12(2)(a) to discharge an accused if by reason of the lapse of time since the offences are alleged to have been committed it would in all the circumstances be unjust or oppressive to order his extradition. If the Secretary of State had regarded these provisions as applicable he would have been bound to refuse to extradite Senator Pinochet. However, the facts making it oppressive to extradite Senator Pinochet do not arise from the lapse of time since the alleged offences. Therefore neither section 11(3) nor section 12(2)(a) applies. The Secretary of State is the only authority on whom a general discretion is conferred whether to order extradition. He has had regard in exercising it to the principle expressed by the courts on a number of occasions that the proper exercise of that discretion by the Secretary of State is the principal safeguard for the accused against oppression.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para60">36. The Secretary of State would not, even if the Court had concurrent jurisdiction in the circumstances of this case, have thought it right to refrain from performing a duty or exercising a discretion conferred on him by statute, which he was in a position to exercise on material which he had commissioned for that purpose, simply because at some future stage another authority might take the decision instead.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para61"><i>Domestic prosecution</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para62">37. Article 7 of the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment requires the Secretary of State, if he does not order the extradition of a person accused of torture, to submit the case to the United Kingdom prosecuting authorities for the purposes of a domestic prosecution. The Secretary of State has supplied papers in advance to the Solicitor General and the Director of Public Prosecutions for that purpose and has this morning referred the case to them under Article 7. Their functions in the matter are entirely independent of his.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para63"><i>Letters rogatory</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para64">38. The only additional matter is the application of Judge Garzon by letters rogatory of 15 January 2000 for Senator Pinochet to be required to appear in court to respond to a request for a statement. The Home Secretary has decided not to give effect to this request on the grounds that Senator Pinochet is not a compellable witness as a matter of English law.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para65"><i>Letter to the Belgian Ambassador:</i>
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para66">39. The Secretary of State has today made a final decision not to issue an Authority to Proceed under section 7 of the Extradition Act 1989 in respect of the two requests of Belgium for Senator Pinochet's extradition, transmitted on 15 December 1998 and 11 November 1999. In making this decision, the Secretary of State has treated the "Elaborative Memorandum" transmitted on 3 February 2000 as supplementing those requests and has had regard to the full range of offences alleged against Senator Pinochet in all three documents.




<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 368W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para67">40. Under 7(4) of the Extradition Act 1989, the Secretary of State is required to refuse an Authority to Proceed if an order for the extradition of Senator Pinochet could not lawfully be made or would not in fact be made in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Under those provisions, extradition is available only in respect of extradition crimes. The Secretary of State has directed himself on this point in accordance with the decision of the House of Lords in R <i>v</i>. Bow Street Metropolitan Stipendiary Magistrate ex p. Pinochet (No.3) [1999] 2 WLR 827. An offence committed outside the United Kingdom is not an extradition crime unless it was punishable in the United Kingdom at the date when it is alleged to have been committed. Torture outside the United Kingdom and conspiracy to torture outside the United Kingdom first became punishable in the United Kingdom on 29 September 1988 when section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 came into force.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para68">41. None of the matters set out in the two extradition requests of Belgium and the Elaborative Memorandum disclose offences of torture or conspiracy to torture committed after 29 September 1988. In the Elaborative Memorandum, attention is drawn to three cases in which persons disappeared in circumstances which have never been disclosed to their families. It is alleged that their disappearance constituted torture of themselves and their families, which in the absence of news of them continued, or must be treated as continuing, to the present day. It is an essential requirement of the offence of torture in English law that the accused should, by some act or omission, have intentionally inflicted severe physical or mental pain or suffering on another person or been party to the infliction of such pain or suffering. The Secretary of State does not regard the two extradition requests or the Elaborative Memorandum as alleging (i) any act or omission inflicting severe pain or suffering and occurring on or after 29 September 1988, or (ii) that any intention to inflict pain or suffering was continuing until 29 September 1988 or any later date, or (iii) an intention existing at any time to inflict pain or suffering on any one other than those who disappeared. Furthermore, the Secretary of State does not regard any such allegations as being implicit in the facts alleged.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para69">42. There are no offences other than torture or conspiracy to torture disclosed in the two extradition requests or the Elaborative Memorandum which have at any time been punishable in the United Kingdom if committed outside the United Kingdom. The requirement that offences alleged in an extradition request should be punishable under the law of the requested state is of course reflected in the European Convention on Extradition.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para70">43. If the Secretary State had regarded the two extradition requests and the Elaborative Memorandum as disclosing extradition crimes, he would nevertheless have refused to issue an Authority to Proceed in this case because he is satisfied that Senator Pinochet is unfit to stand trial and that there is no likelihood of significant improvement. He has today decided on that ground that he will not order the extradition of Senator Pinochet to Spain. It appears to him that even had the Belgian extradition requests and the Elaborative Memorandum disclosed extradition crimes Senator Pinochet's unfitness to stand trial would have precluded his extradition to Belgium for the same reasons as it precluded his 



<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 369W</I><P>
extradition to Spain. The enclosed copy of my letter this morning to the Spanish Ambassador sets those reasons out.
<P>

<a name="00302w09.html_para72">45. I refer to the three letters of request issued by the examining magistrate Mr. Vandermeersch and transmitted on 19 and 24 January and 22 February 2000. The first of these seeks a further medical examination of Senator Pinochet. It has been executed in accordance with English law by inviting Senator Pinochet to submit voluntarily to the examination sought. He has declined to comply. In the light of the judgment of the High Court on 15 February 2000, the second letter of request has been executed so far as it seeks disclosure of the medical report. The Secretary of State does not propose to give effect to the second letter of request to any greater extent, having regard to the terms of that judgment and to his decision to refuse an Authority to Proceed in respect of Belgium's extradition requests. If Senator Pinochet were at some future stage to enter Belgium or to be extradited there from a third country, the Secretary of State will consider what further assistance might be appropriate. The third letter of request invites the Secretary of State or other competent authority to carry out an assessment of the frontal functions and of the autobiographical recall capacities of Senator Pinochet with the latter's consent. This letter has been executed so far as it can be by inviting Senator Pinochet's consent. He has declined. There is accordingly nothing more by way of execution to be done.

An offence committed outside the United Kingdom is not an extradition crime unless it was punishable in the United Kingdom at the date when it is alleged to have been committed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w10.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Olner: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the sale of the Tote and the future of the Levy Board.  [111812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The futures of the Horserace Totalisator Board (The Tote) and the Horserace Betting Levy Board have, for different reasons, been under review. I am now able to set out the Government's conclusions.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para0">I announced in my reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Leigh (Mr. Cunliffe), on 12 May 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns 159-160W, that the Government had decided to sell the Tote and that further work would be put in hand to determine the most appropriate method of sale. That work, which included the evaluation by independent financial advisers of a range of sale options, has now been completed. The options included flotation of the Tote on the stock market, its sale by open competitive auction and a sale to horseracing. Consideration of the best option was helped by the agreement of all relevant horseracing interests to support a single proposal to buy the Tote on behalf of racing, in order to maintain the position under which all the Tote's profits are used for the benefit of racing.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para1">Following careful consideration of all the available sale options, I have concluded that a sale to racing represents the best match, in principle, with the Government's objectives for the sale as a whole, as set out in my May 1999 statement. While the price to be paid by racing for the Tote will need to be the subject of commercial negotiation, it will be important to ensure that it is a fair one which strikes the right balance between the respective legitimate interests in the Tote of both racing and the taxpayer.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para2">Racing's proposal to Government aims to ensure that those who are responsible for managing and developing the Tote's business do so within a fully commercial operating environment. I believe that this represents the best options for the Tote and its staff, not forgetting, of course, all those who bet with it.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para3">We therefore propose to bring forward legislation, at the appropriate time and when Parliamentary time allows, which would enable the sale to proceed on this basis. However, a final decision will need to take account of circumstances at the time, including the outcome of commercial negotiations and relevant legal considerations.




<P>
<P><I>2 Mar 2000 : Column: 372W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para4">I have also today published the report of the quinquennial review of the Horserace Betting Levy Board; copies have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para5">The Levy Board was set up in 1961 to collect a levy on horserace bets from bookmakers and to disburse it for the benefit of racing.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para6">The Report concludes that the Levy Board is an efficient body which carries out its statutory functions well, but that most of those functions no longer need to be carried out in the public sector. In particular, the arrangements under which racing receives income from bookmaking should become a matter for settlement between the parties on a commercial basis.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para7">The Report recommends that the Government, in co-operation with the Levy Board and the industries involved, should take forward detailed consideration of all of the associated issues including the Board's important role in the provision of integrity services and its regulatory functions.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para8">The Government agree with these conclusions, and propose to bring forward, once again at the appropriate time and when Parliamentary time allows, legislative proposals for the abolition of the Levy Board. We shall now be discussing with the Board, the British Horseracing Board and other representatives of the racing and bookmaking industries, the steps needed to put alternative arrangements in place. As part of this process I shall be asking the British Horseracing Board, as racing's governing body, to prepare a realistic plan which shows how racing will be run as a national sport without a statutory levy.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para9">I should make it clear that the decision to abolish the levy system is no reflection on the performance of either the Board or its staff. Both have made a significant contribution to the administration of racing over many years, which we gratefully acknowledge.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para10">The sale of the Tote and the abolition of the levy system will together mark an important change in the relationship between the Government and horseracing. The Home Secretary is responsible for policy on the regulation of gambling, which requires consideration of its social impact and measures to ensure protection against crime and exploitation. For reasons of history, this responsibility has involved the Government in the administration and financing of British horseracing to an extent and in ways which are no longer needed.
<P>

<a name="00302w10.html_para11">My recent announcement that the Government are to establish an independent review of gambling offers racing, and others, an opportunity to put forward their ideas for the future control and regulation of betting on horseracing. Meanwhile, the sale of the Tote and the abolition of the Levy should enable racing to take more control of its own affairs and finances, as befits a mature sport. In preparing the legislation needed to give effect to these changes, the Government are committed to working closely with racing, bookmaking and other relevant interests to ensure that the results which are delivered match up to our aspirations. Horseracing is an important and successful national sport which gives employment and pleasure to many people. We want it to prosper.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the impact on the confidence of <i>(a)</i> the general public and <i>(b)</i> members of the ethnic minorities in the criminal justice system of his proposals under the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill; and if he will make a statement.  [112519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Bill is part of the Government's programme to modernise the criminal justice system, to make it more responsive to the needs of victims of crime and the public at large. It is designed to prevent defendants from manipulating the system by demanding Crown Court trial in trivial cases just to delay proceedings. It does not prevent cases from being tried by jury where Crown Court trial is appropriate, and there is no reason why there should be any diminution in public confidence. Rather, it is likely to enhance public confidence.
<P>

<a name="00302w11.html_para0">The Government have given careful consideration to the concerns that the changes could adversely affect minority ethnic defendants. They are satisfied that this is not the case. Home Office data published on 9 December 1999 show a higher conviction rate for white defendants (67 per cent) than for black defendants (57 per cent) in the magistrates courts. A similar pattern emerges from a separate study (to be published on 3 March), which shows that both in magistrates courts and in the Crown Court white defendants are more likely (by about six percentage points) to be convicted than black defendants.
<P>

<a name="00302w11.html_para1">Under the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill, magistrates courts would consider the circumstances of the offence but not the circumstances of the defendant. They would therefore be precluded from taking account of the effect of conviction on an accused's reputation (or livelihood), which under the original Mode of Trial Bill they would have been required to consider. The change was made in response to the widely-expressed concern that such considerations might discriminate in favour of certain categories of defendant and against others. The criteria in the new Bill will ensure that the courts make an objective decision on where a case should be tried.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the <i>(a)</i> number and <i>(b)</i> cost of additional appeals to the Crown Court against the (i) verdicts and (ii) sentences of magistrates, if the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill is enacted.

 I refer the right hon. Member to my reply given on 16 February 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 544W. There would be no significant change under the (No. 2) Bill.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w11.html_wqn7"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to issue national guidelines to magistrates in England and Wales on the nature of the circumstances for each type of either-way offence which would normally lead to that offence being tried <i>(a)</i> summarily and <i>(b)</i> on indictment if the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill is enacted.  [112534]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w11.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 National Mode of Trial Guidelines were issued in 1995 by the then Lord Chief Justice, setting out the circumstances in which magistrates should consider committing an either-way offence for trial in the Crown Court. Although the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill is not intended significantly to change the basis on which magistrates make their decisions on mode of trial, some amendments to the guidelines would be necessary to bring them into line with the Bill.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the effect of the requirement in <i>(a)</i> the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill and <i>(b)</i> the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill for magistrates courts to state the reasons for their decision as to mode of trial on the percentage of appeals to the Crown Court against the magistrates' decision.  [112530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The requirement (which is in the (No. 2) Bill only) for magistrates to give reasons is not expected to affect the number of defendants exercising the right of appeal to the Crown Court on mode of trial.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w11.html_wqn9"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the number of defendants who will exercise the right of appeal to the Crown Court on mode of trial, under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill; and what estimate he has made of the percentage of appeals that will be successful.  [112538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 It is assumed that 3,500 defendants (25 per cent. of those who would have elected and whom the magistrates have decided to try) will appeal; that 17.5 per cent. of these cases will proceed to an oral hearing; and that 12.5 per cent. of appeals considered on the papers, and 27.5 per cent. of oral appeals, will be successful.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what factors underlay his estimate of <i>(a)</i> the cost savings that would be made and <i>(b)</i> the number of defendants who would be tried in the magistrates' courts rather than the Crown court under (i) the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill and (ii) the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill;  [112528]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will provide a breakdown of the estimated savings to the criminal justice system from the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill by each principal category of expenditure; and if he will make a statement.  [112533]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w11.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 For the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) Bill it was assumed that 12,000 fewer defendants would be tried in the Crown Court annually, resulting in resource savings to the criminal justice system of &#163;105 million a year. For the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill it is assumed that 14,000 fewer defendants would be tried in the Crown Court annually, resulting in resource savings to the criminal justice system of &#163;128 million a year.
<P>

<a name="00302w11.html_para2">The &#163;128 million estimated annual resource savings are made up as follows:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if it is his policy that appeals to the Crown Court against magistrates' decisions as to mode of trial under the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill should be heard (1) by circuit judges only; and if he will make a statement;  [112536]

<P>
<a name="00302w11.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The intention is that the appeal should be heard by the Resident Judge or by a deputy nominated by the senior presiding Judge. The Government believe that most appeals will be determined on the basis of the papers. It would however be open to the parties to seek to make oral representations, which the judge could agree to hear if he considered it necessary in the interests of justice; the arrangements for such an oral hearing would be a matter for the judge's discretion.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the length of the average waiting time for a trial in a magistrates court if the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill is enacted.  [112517]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w11.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The magistrates courts deal with over 400,000 either-way cases annually and will have no difficulty in absorbing the additional cases which it is expected that they will retain as a result of the Bill.

 I am pleased to announce that I received the Prison Service's report on searches of the person last week. Copies have been placed in the Library and are available on the Prison Service website at www.hmprisonservice.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="00302w13.html_para1">The report makes 16 recommendations, all of which have been accepted by the Prison Service.
<P>

<a name="00302w13.html_para2">The review was co-ordinated by one senior executive officer in the Prison Service's security group who consulted and involved many staff of a variety of grades both in the Prison Service headquarters and in prison establishments. As this was an internal review, non-governmental organisations were not consulted, but publications on the subject by several such organisations were taken into account.
<P>

<a name="00302w13.html_para3">Five Parliamentary Questions have been received from my hon. Friend, and one from hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak (Dr. Jones). In addition, a letter was received from my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Selly Oak.

<a name="00302w13.html_para4">The emerging findings were then subjected to rigorous competitive analysis by other staff across the Service, including senior managers. This process has taken a long time, and other priority tasks prevented the earlier completion of the report. But I am satisfied that the Prison Service took the completion of this report very seriously.

Press Office. The Home Office Press Office is now being restructured and a number of additional posts have been created. It is not possible to fit it into its existing accommodation in Queen Anne's Gate, which in any case is considerably substandard. It is therefore proposed to move it and some other parts of Communication Directorate to another floor in the same building some time in May.

<a name="00302w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In the short term, the Home Office Press Office is taking part in the pilot running of a Briefing and Reference Database (BARD). This combines published information such as news releases, speeches, Parliamentary business and basic facts and figures about Home Office business so that press officers can answer quickly and accurately media inquiries. In the long term the Communication Directorate, along with the rest of the Home Office, will benefit from new working practices and Information Technology (IT) systems under a proposed Private Finance Initiative project called IT 2000. No detailed costs are available.

 At present there are 14 press officers (including three trainees and one Chief Immigration Officer on secondment) employed in the main Home Office Press Office, with three unfilled vacancies. The restructuring of the Press Office could involve the appointment of up to 10 further press officers.

 The planned restructuring of the Home Office Press Office will enable it to separate the functions of dealing with breaking news from those of more medium to long-term communications planning. The plan involves the setting up of a team of press officers who would operate from roughly 6 am to about 10 pm on weekdays in order to deal with the growing 24-hour demands of the media. This team would deal with today's stories in the media, handle media bids for interviews with Ministers and urgent media statements when these are needed.

 <i>[holding answer 28 January 2000]:</i> Since its start in 1998, to the end of December 1999, &#163;550.8 million has been spent on the New Deal for young people. Expenditure on the New Deal is planned over the lifetime of this Parliament; any unspent resource in one year is therefore available in future years. Independent research published last year indicates that the impact on the economy of the New Deal for young people is likely to be of a sufficient scale to largely offset the cost of the programme.

 In the period ending December 1999, 2,245 young people in Cumbria had found employment through the New Deal for Young People. Over the last two years, the numbers of 18 to 24-year-olds unemployed for six months or more has fallen by 74 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list the proposed annual university <i>(a)</i> fees and <i>(b)</i> repayable grants for tuition at universities in each part of the United Kingdom for students who are (i) UK citizens, (ii) other EU citizens, (iii) Commonwealth citizens, (iv) Irish and (v) other, (A) educated and (B) resident in the previous four years in (1) England, (2) Scotland, (3) Ireland, (4) other European Countries, (5) Commonwealth countries and (6) other places.  [111996]<P>

<P>
<a name="00302w16.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The maximum tuition fee contribution for "home" (including other EU students) studying in England, Wales and Northern Ireland (and for students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland, who are studying in Scotland), if they are assessed as eligible for fee support, will be &#163;1,050 in the next academic year (2000-01). Universities may charge fees to other students at higher rates. To qualify for "home" fee status, a student must normally meet certain conditions, including having been ordinarily resident in the United Kingdom (or the European Economic Area for EU nationals) for three years on the relevant date closest to the beginning of their course. However, no part of that three year-period can have been wholly or mainly for the purpose of receiving full-time education.
<P>

<a name="00302w16.html_para4">Public support towards tuition fees is not repayable. Because of the system of income-assessment around a third of home and EU students make no contribution to tuition fees.
<P>

<a name="00302w16.html_para5">This answer covers Northern Ireland (given the suspension of devolved government there) but tuition fees for Scottish-domiciled and EU students studying in Scotland are a matter for the Scottish Executive and Scottish Parliament.

In Inverclyde and Renfrewshire 417 employers have signed Agreements (Agreement figures are not broken down below the level of New Deal Delivery Units).

 The evidence, including that from Ofsted, indicates that class size is most important at Key Stage 1. That is why we have pledged to reduce the size of infant classes. The pledge will ensure that all children benefit from infant classes of 30 or below, and will help to give young pupils the important start they need.

 Information on class sizes is not available in the form requested. The available information on class sizes from January 1996 to 1999 is shown in the table. A class size count for January 2000 is currently being undertaken and national estimates are expected to be published in a Statistical First Release in April.
<P>

<a name="00302w16.html_para6">The most recent count of infant classes was carried out in September 1999. Figures derived from this count show that the average size of infant classes taught by one teacher in maintained primary schools in the Hereford Parliamentary constituency was 23.7 pupils per class. The Government have pledged to limit to 30 the size of infant classes for five, six and seven-year-olds by September 2001 at the latest. We are well on course to deliver that pledge.

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2000]:</i> The information sought is not held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost. However, reinstatement is the return to work of former established civil servants in the same permanent grade as when they left the Civil Service. All former established staff have the right to apply for reinstatement.

 The FCO's Chevening Scholarships programme in China is the largest in the world, with more than 100 Scholars in 1999-2000. The Scholars (future "leaders, decision makers and opinion formers") come from a wide variety of backgrounds, including government, business and NGOs. Our survey of departing students shows that 97 per cent. of Chinese Scholars in 1999 rated their academic experience in the UK as "excellent" or "good", and 97 per cent. rated the experience of their stay in the UK as "excellent" or "good". Chevening Scholars coming to the UK from China acquire new knowledge and skills, and learn more

about our way of life and values. In future, as their careers progress, we hope they will tend to look to the UK for ideas, technology, trade and investment. China has been designated as one of the target countries for the Prime Minister's initiative to attract more international students to the UK. As a result, we plan to expand the Chevening programme in China in the coming academic year, by at least 15 scholars.

 The UN Secretary-General has estimated the international policing requirement for Kosovo as 4,718 officers. We accept this. We have agreed to double our own contribution as part of the international effort to meet this requirement.

 I am satisfied with the progress being made on the re-establishment of an independent, impartial, multi-ethnic and effective judiciary in Kosovo and that it is being given a very high priority. The UN Mission in Kosovo has changed the basis of applicable law to that which applied in 1989, before Milosevic removed Kosovo's autonomy, as the Kosovo Albanians and others were reluctant to accept the discriminatory Yugoslav and Serbian laws. This helps recruit local multi-ethnic judges and prosecutors and 130 were appointed in January alone. Council of Europe legal experts are reviewing Kosovo's laws to establish whether they are in conformity with internationally recognised standards. The OSCE's Judicial Training Unit is providing intensive training to local judicial personnel.

 Responsibility for the subject in question has been delegated to the Training and Employment Agency under its Chief Executive. Mr. Ian Walters. I have asked him to arrange for a reply to be given.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State has asked me, as Chief Executive of the Training and Employment Agency, to reply to your question about the future of Ballymena Training Centre, the steps being taken to re-deploy staff, and the likely number of redundancies.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Following a review of training centres and Further Education colleges, the then Minister, Mr. McFall, confirmed in September 1999 that planning would proceed on the merger of the training centres and FE colleges. Plans are underway for Ballymena Training Centre to become fully integrated into the North East Institute of Further and Higher Education and the aim is for the merger to take effect in September 2000.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To help facilitate the merger process, the Department, acting through the Agency, has introduced a voluntary redundancy scheme for training centre staff in the instructional and industrial grades. In Ballymena, 11 staff out of a total of 30 staff have applied for and been granted voluntary redundancy. There will be a further opportunity for staff in these grades to apply for the voluntary redundancy scheme in the next few months.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Arrangements are being discussed for instructional and industrial staff who prefer to transfer to employment with North East Institute, to do so with appropriate protection of their employment rights.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I expect that all administrative staff in the training centre will be re-deployed to other parts of the Department or, perhaps, the wider Northern Ireland Civil Service. There is no need for a voluntary redundancy scheme for this group of staff.</FONT></UL>

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Revised Spring Supplementary Estimate the Departmental Expenditure Limit for the Northern Ireland Office will be increased by &#163;4,221,000 from &#163;1,025,277,000 to &#163;1,029,498,000. This is to fund

<P>

<a name="00302w19.html_para3">This increase will be offset by a reduction in expenditure of the Northern Ireland Departments and will therefore not add to the total of planned Public Expenditure.

 My Department deployed two humanitarian specialists to the region during the initial stages of the flooding on 11 February. They conducted rapid assessments and liaised with the Mozambican authorities and humanitarian organisations to help identify priority needs. We despatched a consignment of over 400 tents on 12 February from the UK to Maputo for the Red Cross to distribute for emergency shelter to those made homeless. We also supported the United Nations Disaster Assessment and Coordination Team who are assisting the Mozambican authorities with the targeting and coordination of the relief efforts. Given the deteriorating situation over the last week we redeployed a humanitarian specialist to Mozambique to work alongside permanent DFID staff in Maputo.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The number of dentists in the General Dental Service in England at December 1999 (the latest date for which figures are available) was 17,746, an all time high and an increase of 480 from the previous year. Access problems are largely attributable to increases in the proportion of the time which dentists spend treating private patients and in the numbers of dentists working part-time. We therefore believe that we need to increase the level of dentists' commitment to the National Health Service. The Government will discuss with the profession a scheme to encourage and reward commitment to the NHS, paying out about &#163;17 million a year.
<P>

<a name="00302w19.html_para5">Plans for the future direction and development of NHS Dentistry have been made taking into account past, present and future trends in registrations and demand for NHS dentistry.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what progress has been made in implementing the recommendations made by the Independent Review Group set up to examine the health risks of silicone gel breast implants relating to <i>(a)</i> information about benefits and risks of surgery for patients undergoing cosmetic breast augmentation surgery, <i>(b)</i> advertisements promoting breast implant surgery, <i>(c)</i> a consent form which incorporates the issues to be discussed between surgeons and women considering breast implantation, <i>(d)</i> measures to ensure that standards of care in private clinics, <i>(e)</i> registration of details of each breast implant and explant, <i>(f)</i> reporting breast implant-related adverse incidents, <i>(g)</i> information to patients on the likely financial implications of breast implant surgery and <i>(h)</i> a steering group to organise research.  [112549]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00302w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 A group chaired by the noble Baroness Emerton of Tunbridge Wells is producing an information booklet for women who are contemplating having breast implants. The booklet will provide expanded information on the issues identified by the Independent Review Group, including consent and financial implications. This will be available shortly.

<P>

<a name="00302w20.html_para3">The use of such forms is good practice, and in 1992 the Department issued model consent forms which can be adapted by National Health Service trusts for any procedure. This will be supported by the information leaflet which will give advice to women on the questions they will need to ask surgeons before giving consent.
<P>

<a name="00302w20.html_para4">We are committed to introducing new and modern regulatory arrangements for independent healthcare provision through the Care Standards Bill, which is currently before Parliament. Copies of the Government's response to the Health Committee report of the regulation of private healthcare are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00302w20.html_para5">The group's recommendations on registration were about ensuring good clinical practice. Measures are also in hand, through initiatives such as the Care Standards Agency and the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, to increase compliance with good clinical practice in both the public and the private sector.
<P>

<a name="00302w20.html_para6">The Medical Devices Agency guidance was published last year on the reporting of adverse incidents. This was circulated to liaison officers in the public and the private sectors, to all members of the British Association of Plastic Surgeons and the British Association of Aesthetic Plastic Surgeons, and to manufacturers. Copies are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00302w20.html_para7">A steering group has been established within the Department to identify suitable approaches that could lead to research of high scientific quality into breast implants and cosmetic surgery. The group's membership includes a consultant plastic surgeon, an Emeritus Professor of immunology, a representative from industry and the Chairman of the NHS Health Technology Assessment programme.

 The breakdown of the ambulance carrying a patient from London to Wales was regrettable, but I understand that another vehicle was speedily provided and the patient suffered no adverse effects from this incident. It is policy among all ambulance services not to carry a spare wheel. A replacement vehicle was sent to ensure proper transport for the patient.

The data show that in England (i) 8.4 households per 1,000 head of population aged 65 or over received intensive home care (more than 10 contact hours and 6 or more visits during the survey week) in England in 1998-99. Comparable data are not available for 1997-98 due to changes in the data collection. (ii) 71 people aged 65 or over per 1,000 head of population aged 65 or over received community based services in 1998-99. The comparable number for 1997-98 was 81.
