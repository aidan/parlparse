 Of bodies within my Department's area of responsibility, the regional office structure of English Partnerships is being reorganised to match the boundaries of the Government Offices for the Regions, in order to facilitate the transfer of functions from English Partnerships to Regional Development Agencies in April 1999. There will similarly be some reorganisation of the regional office structure of the Rural Development Commission.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action his Department is taking <i>(a)</i> to encourage the spread of gas-powered vehicles and <i>(b)</i> widening of access to LPG.  [44799]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 The Government have already undertaken a number of measures to promote the use of road fuel gases including freezing the duty on road fuel gases in successive budgets and providing &#163;6.5 million to the Energy Saving Trust's Powershift programme to help stimulate the market for alternative fuels. The Government have also announced the introduction from January 1999 of an incentive of up to a &#163;500 reduction in VED for lorries and buses meeting stringent emission standards.
<P>

<a name="80611w01.html_para0">These measures are significantly reducing the operating costs of gas-powered vehicles in order to make them competitive with conventional petrol and diesel fuelled vehicles. By stimulating demand in this way the Government anticipate that refuelling facilities will

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the environmental impact of propane as a fuel; what steps he proposes to encourage its use; and if he will make a statement.  [45129]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w01.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Vehicles powered by liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), of which propane and butane are the primary constituents, can make a contribution towards meeting our air quality objectives, particularly when used in well engineered applications by commercial fleets operating in urban areas. The steps being taken to encourage the use of LPG were the subject of my reply today to a question from the hon. Member for Taunton (Jackie Ballard).

<a name="80611w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Blaby (Mr. Robathan) on 19 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>693</i>, if he will include in the information to be collected centrally under the Hedgerow Regulations 1997 the lengths of hedgerow for each local planning authority in England that have been the subject of <i>(a)</i> notification under the regulations, <i>(b)</i> hedgerow removal notices and <i>(c)</i> hedgerow retention notices.  [44808]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w01.html_spnew4"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 My Department's consultation with representatives of local government on what information should be collected centrally in relation to the operation of the Hedgerows Regulations 1997 sought views on whether this should include data on the length of hedgerow for each local planning authority in England or Wales subject to hedgerow removal notices (served by those wishing to remove a hedge), and subject to hedgerow retention notices (served by the local authority). It also sought views on whether the information collected should include data on length of important hedgerow for each planning authority in England and Wales in respect of which retention notices were not issued. We are considering the results of that consultation.
<P>

<a name="80611w01.html_para1">This information is currently held at the local level. Each local planning authority in England and Wales is required, under the Hedgerows Regulations 1997, to compile and make publicly available a record containing, among other items, a copy of every hedgerow removal notice received by it; every notice given by it stating that a hedgerow may be removed; and every hedgerow retention notice issued by it.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what was the outcome of consultation on the final report of the Interdepartmental Working Group on Blight; what proposals he has to change the law relating to compulsory purchase and blight; and if he will make a statement.  [45538]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The results of the consultation have shown that blight is just one issue which needs to be reviewed in relation to compulsory purchase and land compensation. I have, therefore, commissioned a fundamental review of the law and procedures which relate to the compulsory acquisition of land. I have placed a copy of the terms of reference of the review in the Library of the House. I would expect to have an interim report on this by the end of the year.
<P>

<a name="80611w01.html_para2">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Scotland will consider separately the case for reform of the law in Scotland.

The objectives are to ensure that investment in social housing is based on sound long term strategies and to reduce the amount of wasteful competition between RSLs for ADP funds each year.

 The Civil Aviation Authority is responsible for the safety regulation of UK civil aircraft and airports. They constantly monitor the civil aviation industry and seek to improve safety standards by systematically defining and addressing safety risks. Consequently the UK has one of the best civil aviation safety records in the world.
<P>

<a name="80611w02.html_para0">The UK also plays a leading role in raising international aviation safety standards through its active membership of the International Civil Aviation Organisation and the joint Aviation Authorities. In addition, as part of the Presidency of the EU we are progressing proposals to establish a European Aviation Safety Authority.

 We have today published our consultation document on a strategic London road network. Copies have been placed in the Library and sent to the London local authorities, the Association of London Government, London Transport and others with an interest in the movement of people and goods in London.
<P>

<a name="80611w02.html_para1">This fulfils an undertaking in the White Paper--<i> A Mayor and Assembly for London</i> (Cm 3897 published on 25 March 1998) to consult about precisely which roads should be part of the strategic London road network. The White Paper made clear that we start from the presumption that this network should be based on the present primary and red route networks. This comprises about 220 miles of trunk roads and 105 miles of borough roads. The transfer of the trunk roads to the GLA will represent a major shift in responsibilities from central to local Government.
<P>

<a name="80611w02.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Geraint Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the Government have reached a decision on the future of the national air traffic services.  [46057]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w02.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 We have been considering the future of the National Air Traffic Services (NATS) taking account of the views expressed in the Report by the Environment, Transport and Regional Affairs Committee on Air Traffic Control published in April.
<P>

<a name="80611w02.html_para3">Safety is paramount. The Select Committee raised major concerns about the current arrangements in their report. The Civil Aviation Authority is currently responsible both for the provision of air traffic control services through NATS and for regulating the safety of those services. The Government will bring forward proposals to ensure that air safety regulation will be conducted independently from NATS. We will ensure that regulation is open and transparent and that the aviation industry and its employees can play a full part. The regulator's remit will be to enforce the toughest safety standards in the world.
<P>

<a name="80611w02.html_para4">We have looked at a number of options for the future of NATS, including those mentioned in the Select Committee's Report.
<P>

<a name="80611w02.html_para5">In the planned multi-billion investments in the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and London Underground, we have demonstrated our ability to mobilise private capital to serve the public interest through public/private partnerships.
<P>

<a name="80611w02.html_para6">The Government believe that the level of investment and efficiency that we need in our National Air Traffic Services can best be achieved through a partnership between the public and private sectors. A partnership of this kind would help NATS to finance the investment it needs to operate effectively and would mobilise private sector resources.
<P>

<a name="80611w02.html_para7">Our preference is that 49 per cent. of the shares, and a golden share, are held by the Government; and 51 per cent. by private investors including employees.
<P>

<a name="80611w02.html_para8">This package, taken together, will guarantee the highest safety standards as air transport increases in the future. It will retain a large public stake and golden share in NATS. And it will ensure that NATS can finance its future investment effectively within a secure framework of safety and economic regulation.
<P>

<a name="80611w02.html_para9">The Government will consult interested parties further on the implementation of their decision in principle and will then bring forward the necessary legislation.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what changes are planned by the Government to free local authority airports from borrowing controls.  [46056]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w03.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Strang: </B> 
 All borrowing via local authority airports currently counts against the public expenditure control total. This is not conducive to the proper commercial management of these airports.




<P>
<P><I>11 Jun 1998 : Column: 638</I><P>

<P>

<a name="80611w03.html_para0">We now intend that local authority airports whose finances are sufficiently sound should be given the flexibility to borrow to finance airport related capital investment in the UK, where the lending would be genuinely commercial. This will allow airports such as Manchester, Newcastle, Leeds Bradford and Norwich to compete for business on a level playing field with private sector airports, while safeguarding the interest of the taxpayer.

 The cost of repairs to the damage sustained to the hull of HMS Ocean during her launch on 11 October 1995 amounted to &#163;1.125 million and was paid by the MOD under its Indemnity scheme. The ship also underwent repairs, by VSEL sub contractors, to her tail shaft bearings while in dry dock at Portsmouth in May 1998.

 The amount of low flying training undertaken throughout the United Kingdom is already limited to that strictly necessary for aircrews to achieve and maintain operational effectiveness. We remain committed to achieving as equitable a distribution of low flying activity as practicable, taking into account geographical, climatic and operational considerations. Since 1988, low flying in Wales has reduced by about half accordingly. There are no plans to reduce military low flying training carried out in the Brecon Beacons.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if it is his policy to maintain a network of probation offices outside the largest towns and cities.  [45331]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w03.html_spnew18"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The probation service needs to provide supervision programmes and facilities which are reasonably accessible to offenders who are required to attend. The number and location of offices are for probation committees to determine within the grant provision they have. In reaching decisions, I look to committees to take account of the potential additional costs and savings which more centralisation of accommodation could bring; the potential effect on operations and enforcement; and the potential contribution which other, more flexible, arrangements (such as mobile offices) might make in their circumstances.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the British Government's policy towards asylum seekers who have been active in opposition parties and are from the English speaking regions of Cameroon.  [44930]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Every application for asylum is decided in accordance with the provisions of the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. Anyone who demonstrates a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion would be

<P>

<a name="80611w04.html_para0">The Government's assessment of the conditions prevailing in Cameroon is based on information from a variety of sources, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the United States Department of State and international organisations, such as Amnesty International. A country assessment on Cameroon, prepared by the Country Information and Policy Unit of the Immigration and Nationality Directorate, has been produced and will be revised and updated approximately every six months.
<P>

<a name="80611w04.html_para1">The Home Office country assessment reports concerns about human rights abuses in Cameroon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Costs directly attributable to asylum seekers are not separately identified within spending figures, hence only a broad estimate is available. This estimates that the costs to public funds of provision for asylum seekers is around &#163;500 million for 1997-98. This cost includes processing costs of asylum applications and appeals, and costs for providing support to asylum seekers via Department of Social Security benefits, support provided by local authorities under the National Assistance Act 1948, legal aid and health and education.
<P>

<a name="80611w04.html_para2">Recent claims that the total cost of asylum is in excess of &#163;2 billion are wildly misleading.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w05.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The previous administration had already removed, in 1994, embarkation checks for passengers departing from ferry ports and small airports for destinations within the European Union/European Economic Area, with the consequence that some 40 per cent. of all departing passengers were not seen by an immigration officer. This meant that those seeking to evade embarkation controls could do so by using these ports.
<P>

<a name="80611w05.html_para2">Implementation of the new embarkation arrangements, which I announced on 16 March 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>506-07</i>, commenced on 14 April at Heathrow Terminal 3, Gatwick North and Stansted. Gatwick South started on 7 June. These arrangements are due to come into place at the remaining major ports--Heathrow Terminals 1, 2 and 4, Birmingham, Glasgow and Manchester--on 1 July, or as soon as possible thereafter.

A guide relating to the valuation of public houses, entitled "Public Houses--Approved Guide to Valuation", is available to the general public as part of the Tolley's Tax Link CD-ROM from Tolley Publishing Co.

The guide forms part of the Valuation Office Agency's Rating Manual and sets out the agreement between the Valuation Office Agency and the Brewers and Licensed Retailers Association as to the method and broad levels of the value to be adopted for public houses as part of the revaluation of non-domestic property for business rates purposes, which came into effect on 1 April 1995.

<a name="80611w06.html_para0">The rateable value of a public house, in common with other non-domestic property subject to business rates, is an estimate of the amount of rent for which the property might reasonably be expected to be let. The capital value of the property is not taken into account. In arriving at the rateable value for public houses, the Valuation Officer, an employee of the Valuation Office Agency, has regard to turnover when estimating fair maintainable receipts. This yardstick is adopted to analyse rents and to compare properties.
<P>

<a name="80611w06.html_para1">The Valuation Officer has a statutory power to request information which is required to compile and maintain lists of rateable values for business rates purposes. Those supplying the information, usually the occupiers/owners of the property or their representatives, sign a declaration of authenticity. The supply of false information can lead to prosecution. The accuracy of information given on forms will be considered at both the valuation stage and when dealing with appeals.

 As a result of the lower than expected outturn in government borrowing in 1997-98, and taking account of the Government's latest forecast for Central Government net borrowing in 1998-99, the Government have reduced their financing requirement to &#163;12.1 billion in 1998-99. This is a reduction of &#163;3.1 billion, compared with previous plans. The revised financing requirement is expected to be met from gilt sales of &#163;11.6 billion, and a net contribution from National Savings of &#163;&#189; billion. The revised financing arithmetic is set out in the table, followed by revisions to paragraph 4 of the Debt

The compromise of 3&#189; years secured the necessary qualified majority and was accompanied by a commitment that in 1998 the number of vessels licensed to fish with drift nets in each Member State will be at least 40% below the number that fished in 1995, 1996 or 1997 in that Member State. In a joint statement the Council and Commission agreed to decide before the end of 1998 on compensatory measures to help fishermen adapt to the ending of the drift net fishery.

As chairman, I concluded that there was agreement that the Commission's proposal addressed key areas where enforcement can be enhanced and a decision should be taken at the Council's next meeting in October. The action plan will be used as a framework for improving control standards.

In a wide ranging discussion, delegations, including the UK, generally shared the Commission's view that it is important to maximise the value of scarce fish resources, maintain competitive catching and processing industries in an increasingly global market and take account of consumers' concerns.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w09.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Humble: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he intends to proceed with the introduction of fixed-quota allocations; and if he will make statement.  [45991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 From 1 January 1999, the annual allocation of fish quotas to producer organisations, the non sector and other groups will be linked to fishing activity (catches) that took place in the reference period 1994 to 1996. These arrangements, referred to as fixed quota allocations (FQAs), will apply to all quota stocks caught in domestic waters except for North Sea herring taken as a by-catch in industrial fishing, and to certain stocks taken in external waters. The Fisheries Departments are writing to the owners of over 10 metres vessels, producer organisations and other interests to advise them of the new arrangements.
<P>

<a name="80611w09.html_para4">A consultative paper setting out proposals for the introduction of fixed quota allocations for domestic waters was issued by the Fisheries Departments last November and was sent to the owners of some 2,300 fishing vessels over 10 metres, as well as producer organisations and 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jun 1998 : Column: 661</I><P>
other interests. Almost 300 replies have been received. There was strong support for a system of fixed quota allocations from producer organisations who, together, represent some two thirds of the over 10 metre fleet and catch more than 90 per cent. of the UK's quota. That was not the case with individual responses, although the vast majority of individual fishermen offered no comment. After careful consideration of all the arguments we have come to the view that there would be significant benefits to be gained from moving to fixed quota allocations although we would wish to review such a system in 3 years' time in the light of the experience gained.
<P>

<a name="80611w09.html_para5">Producer organisations will have a key role to play during the introduction of fixed quota allocations. There is apprehension among fishermen that moving to a fixed quota allocation system may disadvantage those whose fishing activities were curtailed during the reference period 1994 to 1996. The arrangements that are being introduced will provide scope for POs, acting with their members, to undertake internal adjustments to take account of anomalies that may have arisen in the reference period. Separate arrangements are also being made to cater for those fishermen that belong to the non sector.
<P>

<a name="80611w09.html_para6">Concern was expressed during the consultation exercise that fixed quota allocations would pave the way to the introduction of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) and separately could lead to increased pressure on non quota stocks. On the first point, the Government have no plans to introduce ITQs and no such action would be taken without full and proper consultation with the industry. On the second point, the Fisheries Departments will be monitoring the impact of fixed quota allocations and if necessary action to safeguard the position of non-quota stocks will be considered. In this context, and given more general concern over growing pressure on scallop stocks, we shall be consulting the fishing industry and other interests about proposals to limit future access to the scallop fisheries.
<P>

<a name="80611w09.html_para7">The proposals would involve the introduction of new licensing arrangements with effect from 1 January 1999. From that date, in the case of vessels over 10m in length, permission to fish for scallops would be granted only to vessels which met the qualifying criteria at 31 May 1998. These criteria may include both a track record of scallop landings prior to that date and the use of appropriate fishing gear during the corresponding period. No activity in the scallop fishery after 31 May 1998 would be taken into account. The arrangements for fishing by under 10 metre vessels would not be affected by the proposed licensing changes, although they will continue to be required to comply with the technical conservation rules applying to scallop fisheries. These rules are under separate review.
<P>

<a name="80611w09.html_para8">A separate consultation exercise on the application of fixed quota allocations to external waters stocks at North Norway, Svalbard and Greenland met with unanimous support. Fisheries Departments therefore intend to introduce fixed quota allocations for these fisheries on 1 January 1999 as part of the process of applying fixed quota allocations more generally. Detailed aspects will be explained in a forthcoming consultative letter on proposals for the future licensing of fishing opportunities in external waters.

 In accordance with Section 10 of the Intelligence Services Act 1994, and after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition, I have appointed the Right Honourable the Lord Archer of Sandwell QC to be a member of the Intelligence and Security Committee as a replacement for Baroness Ramsay, who was appointed as a Minister on 2 December 1997.

 I have received representations on the impact of the minimum wage from a number of companies and associations in the tourism, hospitality and leisure industry. The Independent Low Pay Commission, in formulating its recommendations, received written and oral evidence from a large number of individuals and organisations, including many of the industry's representative bodies. I am very impressed by the response from the tourism industry to the initiative on the New Deal. Neither at the conference my Department, the Department for Education and Employment and the British Hospitality Association hosted last November, nor in my frequent contacts with the tourism industry since, has specific representation been made to me about the impact of the minimum wage on the New Deal.

 The number of suspected cases of BSE reported in Wales in 1998 up to 29 May was 139, of which 49 cases had been confirmed.
<P>

 <i>(a)</i> An additional &#163;20 million will be spent in 1998-99 on reducing inpatient and day case waiting lists to below the level which the Government inherited. This supports the Government's commitment to reduce waiting lists over the lifetime of this Parliament by 100,000.
<P>

<a name="80611w12.html_para1"><i>(b)</i> &#163;4.124 million of this is available to North Wales Health Authority to reduce waiting lists in its area. The Authority is also considering establishing an ophthalmic treatment centre to provide additional capacity to treat patients with cataracts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 Psychological therapies are provided on the NHS as appropriate to the needs of the individual. A wide range of therapies are available; the most common interventions include supportive psychotherapy, dynamic individual psychotherapy, group therapy, cognitive and behavioural therapy.

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how many ECT treatments were carried out in the Bro Taf Health Authority in each of the last five years; and how many of these were carried out without the consent of the patient.  [45000]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w12.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 Centrally held statistics are not robust for the years in question. The best indication of the number of ECT treatments comes from a Welsh Office-funded survey of the first 6 months of 1996. This showed that in the Bro Taf area over that period a total of 90 patients received this treatment. The mean number of treatments per patient was 6.75 per completed course of treatment.
<P>

<a name="80611w12.html_para2">ECT treatment may not be administered to informal patients without consent, and may only be administered to formally detained patients in very exceptional circumstances. The Mental Health Act Commission monitors the proper use of the Act, including the administration of ECT. The survey quoted above shows 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jun 1998 : Column: 673</I><P>
that in the first 3 months of 1996, in all of Wales, 161 patients commenced ECT treatment, of whom 12 received it without their consent.

[45155]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend and I have received a number of objections, in particular, to our proposals for the creation of a single trust in Carmarthenshire and a new trust for Powys and Ceredigion. We have also received a smaller number of objections to our proposals affecting other areas of Wales. I refer my hon. Friend to my previous reply to my hon. Friend the Member for Alyn and Deeside (Mr. Jones) on 14 May 1998, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>159-60</i>, in which I gave details of the number of these objections.
<P>

<a name="80611w12.html_para3">Formal consultation on our proposals will commence later this month and will last for three months. My right hon. Friend and I hope that many groups and individuals will take this opportunity to make their views on these matters known. We shall consider all views we receive during this formal consultation period carefully before making final decisions, which we expect to do in the autumn.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w12.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 I have received over 2,800 representations in respect of our plans to restructure NHS trusts in Wales. Eighty-seven of these have been from hon. Members. I have also received over 15,000 petition signatures on the same matter. Of these views expressed, some have opposed any restructuring, while others have opposed individual options and supported alternatives. A small number have expressed full support for the process of particular proposals.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Peter Hain: </B>

<a name="80611w14.html_para0">The purpose of the new UK/Japan Agreement is to provide the necessary secure framework for ensuring that trade in civil nuclear materials and equipment is carried out only in conformity with the UK's nuclear non-proliferation obligations. In particular, it updates commitments concerning the application of safeguards and physical protection measures to nuclear material transferred between Japan and the UK.
<P>

<a name="80611w14.html_para1">Irradiated fuel from Tokai Mura and other safeguard magnox reactors has, since December 1986, been reprocessed in campaigns which are separate from those for unsafeguarded fuel. These safeguards arrangements for such sequential campaigns were agreed with the Euratom Safeguards Directorate in June 1986. Article 12(g) of the UK/Japan Agreement defines the term "unclassified information" as meaning information not classified as restricted, confidential, secret or top secret; such a term is used in the context of article 1(b) of the Agreement.

<a name="80611w15.html_para6">Between 2 May 1997 and 3 April 1998, one Standard Individual Export Licence was issued covering the export to Sierra Leone of goods subject to export control by being listed in Part III of Schedule 1 to the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994, the so-called Military List. This licence covered goods controlled under entry ML1 of the legislation. It was revoked by the Secretary of State on 16 October 1997, because of the introduction of the arms embargo against Sierra Leone in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1132 (1997). No Open Individual Export Licences covering such exports were issued in that period.

 The Department encourages joint training between health and social services and fosters projects for staff from both services to share practice placements in the early years of training. We expect that the Social Services white paper, due in the summer, will further develop the theme of joint training. The proposed establishment of National Training Organisations in both the health and social care sectors offers an additional opportunity for working together.

<a name="80611w16.html_para0">The National Health Service White Paper calls for co-operation between the services on service delivery. In particular the establishment of Primary Care Groups, from 1 April 1999, will enable primary care and social services to call on their different local knowledge and agree programmes with local people to improve services for users, thereby ensuring closer working and cooperation between health and social care professionals and the community served by the group.

 Surplus National Health Service land is sold on the open market in accordance with the advice contained in the Department's Estatecode, which follows Her Majesty's Treasury rules. The criteria are that surplus NHS property should be sold as quickly as possible, at the best price which can reasonably be obtained on the open market. In order to obtain the best price, consideration should be given to obtaining planning permission for the highest value alternative use. All proceeds from sales are re-invested in the NHS.

 A publicity committee, including clinicians and people from the relevant voluntary organisations, has been set up to help the Department develop a new organ donation publicity campaign to start in the autumn. We are watching with interest a postal campaign being conducted by the British Kidney Patients Association. My noble Friend the Minister of State, Department of Health, Baroness Jay of Paddington, had discussions recently with the newly appointed chairman of the United Kingdom Transplant Support Service Authority (UKTSSA) who is giving urgent consideration to this problem with health officials. A review of UKTSSA is due this year. We will continue to consider options for the way forward in organ transplantation, working with the professional and voluntary organisations involved.

<a name="80611w17.html_para6">2,788 solid organ transplants were performed in the United Kingdom in 1997, of which 1,523 involved the transplantation of kidneys. At the end of May 1998, 6,474 people were awaiting organs, 5,684 of them for kidney transplants.

However, details of our new procedures for the appointment of non-executives and chairmen to trust and health authority boards are available in the Library. The Secretary of State has regular meetings with representatives of health authorities and NHS trusts at which the appointments process, among other issues, is discussed. Since we took office we have received a number of letters from hon. Members and others about different aspects of the NHS appointments process.

 Certain aspects of drug education remain a statutory requirement of the National Curriculum at all key stages, including the primary key stages. In support of the Government's recently published new 10-year anti-drugs strategy, the Department will be issuing further guidance on the provision of drug education to teachers, youth workers and other professionals later this year. The guidance will outline the vital role that primary schools can play in the very early stages of a child's school career in concentrating on the development of the skills they need to resist drugs before they are drawn into experimentation.

<a name="80611w20.html_para0">Clinically assessed need for severely disabled people to have access to indoor/outdoor powered wheelchairs is a matter for the Department of Health. Between 1996 and 2000, the Department of Health is making an additional &#163;50 million available to NHS wheelchair services to enable them to provide electrically powered indoor/ outdoor wheelchairs for those severely disabled people who can benefit from them.

 Cumbria education authority has been allocated &#163;146,000 to keep 600 infant pupils out of classes over 30 from this September. For future years, the LEA will have to submit to the Secretary of State in the autumn an implementation plan setting out, among other things, the number of extra teachers needed to reduce infant class sizes in the schools in its area by September 2001. Funding for the authority to reduce class sizes in those years will be determined in due course.

 All maintained mainstream schools in Cumbria submitted 1997 Key Stage 2 and Key Stage 3 National Curriculum Assessment results. It is not possible to determine the number of special schools which will not submit results, as it is impossible to differentiate between those schools whose pupils were all disapplied from the National Curriculum Assessments, and therefore had no results to return, and those schools which chose not to return results. Participation by independent schools in the National Curriculum Assessment tests is voluntary and, therefore, they have not been included in this analysis. It is not possible to differentiate between results and papers.

<a name="80611w21.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will estimate how many young people aged 18 to 24 years regarded by the Government as socially excluded are not eligible for the New Deal.  [43969]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80611w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 No such estimate is available. However, the Government believe that their Welfare to Work policy, of which the New Deals form part, together with the work of the Social Exclusion Unit, provide extensive help for those at risk of social exclusion. Depending on their circumstances, individuals may have access to help as part of the New Deal for the Young Unemployed, or the New Deals for Lone Parents or People with Disabilities.
<P>

<a name="80611w21.html_para7">Under the New Deal for the Young Unemployed, individuals likely to be particularly disadvantaged in the labour market--such as those with disabilities; returners to the labour market; ex-regulars in HM forces; ex-offenders; lone parents; people whose first language is not English, Welsh or Gaelic; those with reading, writing or numeracy problems; those who have become unemployed due to large-scale redundancies; and those who have recently left local authority care--can get early access if they are claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. The Employment Service will also have discretion to enable early access to others where their New Deal adviser believes they are at particular disadvantage in their search for work.
<P>

<a name="80611w21.html_para8">There are also a range of other policies being developed to tackle disadvantage and social exclusion, including the New Deal for Partners and the New Deal for Communities.

<a name="80611w22.html_para11">During 1997-98, Lewisham received funding of &#163;73,500. &#163;19,000 of this amount was required for the implementation of video-conferencing links between the Benefits Agency (BA), the Local Authority and Public Video Booths. The remainder was required for information technology development, project management, communications and training costs. A similar bid has been submitted for 1998-99 and is currently under consideration.
<P>

<a name="80611w22.html_para12">No other specific initiatives have been announced since these, although Local Authorities can apply for funding to be provided in relation to a number of initiatives. These include, for example, funding to assist with the resourcing of fraud investigation work, joint BA/LA anti-fraud activities and improved liaison/information sharing (e.g. installation of terminals with access to this Department's systems within LAs).

 The Government support a strong family-friendly culture in the workplace. Family-friendly employment policies are good for parents--mothers and fathers--good for children, good for business and good for the economy. We are working with employers, voluntary organisations and trade unions to promote family-friendly policies and encourage best practice. We are also introducing for the first time a framework of

rights for employees--these rights will include time off for mothers and fathers at the time of the birth, as well as time off for parents when their children are taken ill. We are reviewing maternity pay and considering the introduction of statutory paternity pay as part of our wider review of family-friendly working arrangements.

 We have received no recent representations from people with laryngectomies or from any organisations representing laryngectomy patients.

Entitlement to Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance is based not on specific disabilities, but on the effects that a person's disability has on their need for help with personal care and/or mobility.
