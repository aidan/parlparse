To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will estimate the costs incurred by each local authority in England in preparing provisional local transport plans. [109700]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 February 2000]:</i> The move to a five-year planning cycle will produce administrative savings for local authorities (by offering greater certainty of future funding and removing the need to prepare plans annually). The wider public participation, more effective partnership working and better monitoring associated with local transport plans will lead to some additional costs, but we have no information on which to base an estimate of their scale.

<P>

<a name="00214w01.html_para1">The Transport Bill currently before Parliament will enable local authorities to levy a charge on workplace parking to tackle traffic congestion as part of a Local Transport Plan.

<a name="00214w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 EU Environment Ministers regularly discuss the importance of introducing effective national, co-ordinated and Community level policies and measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In October 1999, the Council agreed that it was essential for further common and co-ordinated policies and measures to be implemented rapidly and asked the Commission to put forward a priority list as early as possible in 2000. Discussion on any new measures proposed will be informed by best practice in Member States.

 After consultation with interested parties last year, I have today published the proposals on the regulatory changes required to implement aspects of the Basic Safety Standards Directive 96/29/Euratom concerned with the control of radioactive waste. The proposals involve the minimum of change to the existing regulatory framework under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (RSA 93) and fulfil the Government's commitment that implementation of the Directive would not lead to a weakening of existing controls. Copies of the document, entitled "The Proposals for the Radioactive Substances (Basic Safety Standards) (England and Wales) Regulations 2000 and the Radioactive Substances (Basic Safety Standards) (England and Wales) Direction 2000" can now be found in the Library.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will ensure that paper and timber products purchased by his Department are independently certified by the Forest Stewardship Council as coming from a sustainable source.  [110187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The FSC label is accepted by buyers as demonstrating that timber and timber products have come from sustainably managed sources. However, it is not practicable to require that all paper and timber products purchased by the Department are independently certified by the Forest Stewardship Council because this might discriminate against any equally valid schemes and therefore be against public procurement rules. It might also result in us failing to meet our full requirements as currently only a tiny percentage of timber products are FSC certified. This is why DETR's Greening Operations policy statement suggests that evidence of sustainability might take the form of a certificate issued under a credible, preferably independent, verification scheme; or other documents which demonstrate the operation of an environmental management system incorporating forest management criteria that conform with internationally recognised principles such as the Helsinki Guidelines.

 Among the key aims of DETR's Greening Operations policy statement are: to conserve resources and minimise waste by reducing our reliance on virgin materials and ensuring that any products derived from wildlife--such as paper and timber--are from sustainable sources and comply with EU and international trading rules such as the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. The Department's policy statement also requires the purchase of 100 per cent. recycled paper for non-specialist use comprising at least 80 per cent. genuine post consumer waste with any virgin pulp coming from sustainably managed woodlands. It also promotes the purchase of sustainably produced timber and timber products by, for example, requiring buyers to specify in orders and contracts that:

<a name="00214w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Where vehicles are used or kept unlicensed on the public road, the detection is carried out by police and traffic wardens, who pass offence reports to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) for enforcement action.
<P>

<a name="00214w03.html_para4">Last year, DVLA took successful action against 475,000 evaders, bringing in &#163;57.9 million in fines and penalties from out of court settlements or prosecution. A further 125,000 evaders or potential evaders relicensed their vehicles as a direct result of this enforcement activity, bringing in a further &#163;15 million which would not otherwise have been paid. There are indications that for the first time the level of VED evasion is starting to fall.

<a name="00214w03.html_para5">We have significantly increased the number of joint DVLA/police campaigns against VED evaders.

<P>
<a name="00214w04.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2000]:</i> The north-east regional investment fund has been supported by European funding as part of the region's Objective 2 Programme for 1997-99. As the Berwick-upon-Tweed area did not have Objective 2 status under this programme, enterprises in that part of the region can not qualify for assistance. However, the area will enjoy Objective 2 status under the Programme for 2000-06. It will be for the north-east regional partnership to determine whether a similar project should be included in the new Programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w04.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 We asked the independent Low Pay Commission to report on the impact of the introduction of the minimum wage and the Commission's report, with the Government's response, will be published shortly. Definitive estimates of the number of people who had benefited from the national minimum wage are not yet available. But the latest Office for National Statistics figures indicate that at least 700,000 employees in the United Kingdom, 70,000 of them in the west midlands, had already had their pay raised above the national minimum wage rates in spring last year. However, these data were gathered before the full effect of the new law had been felt (March-May 1999).

<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w04.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 I have made no decision on future changes to the level of the national minimum wage. The Government have always made it clear that there would be no automatic uprating mechanism for the national minimum wage. Any future changes to the national minimum wage rates will be made sensibly, taking account of the prevailing economic circumstances and feedback on the effects of the new law since April 1999. The Low Pay Commission's second report, which the Government will publish shortly, considers its impact in great detail.

 15 proposals amounting to some 6 GW of new gas-fired capacity have been refused clearance under the stricter consents policy.

<P>

<a name="00214w05.html_para0">If all the proposals had proceeded to development and expected to reach 80 per cent. load factor, then they would have produced some 42,000 million kilowatt hours per year once they reached full operation.

However, the nature and level of its involvement will vary according to the stage of the project, from initial studies, procurement, through-life support and disposal. This does not affect MOD policy on competition. Making the best use of competition at prime and sub-contract level remains the MOD's preferred means of supplier selection for defence requirements and achieving value for money.

 The &#163;9 million being made available to health authorities to support the meningococcal Group C immunisation programme referred to in my Answer of 11 January is new money and has not come from the BCG programme.

 Funding for the central purchase of BCG vaccine remains available for when vaccine supplies are reinstated.

 The precise term "notifiable disease" is defined in section 10 of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 as being one of five specific diseases. Regulation 3 and Schedule 1 of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Regulations 1988 list further diseases "which are required to be notified". The first criterion which determines that a disease is required to be notified is that it is subject to the International Health Regulations. If not in those Regulations, the criteria would depend on expert assessment of the impact of the disease.

<a name="00214w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 We estimate that the cash cost of abolishing fees would be &#163;110 million in 2001-02. The full economic cost, taking account of lower loan repayments in future years (on a resource accounting and budgeting basis), would be &#163;270 million as the assessed contribution towards students' tuition fees would instead be taken into account in determining the level of student loan a student could apply for. Both costs are in current day prices. Figures beyond the end of the current CSR period would depend on student numbers on which decisions have not yet been made.

 The available published data from the 1991 Census of Population show that the proportion of people aged 18 and over with higher education qualifications was 13.3 per cent. in Wakefield, and 10.3 per cent. in Hemsworth. A higher education qualification is defined as any academic, professional or vocational qualification above A-level standard. The published census data do not separately identify persons who have degree-level qualifications. Similar data will be available when the results of the 2001 Census are published.

<i> [holding answer 7 February 2000]:</i> The latest available data are given in the tables. Mature students are defined as postgraduates aged 25 and over and undergraduates aged 21 and over. 1997 entrant numbers may have been inflated because entrants were influenced by the knowledge that fees would be introduced with effect from 1998. Comparable data for entrants and graduates in 1999-2000 will be published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency in April 2000 and February 2001 respectively.
<P>

<a name="00214w12.html_para6">Information published by the Universities and Colleges Admissions Service (UCAS), covering full-time and sandwich undergraduate courses only, shows that the number of applicants (young and mature combined) accepted for entry increased by 1.5 per cent. between autumn 1998 and autumn 1999.

<P>
<a name="00214w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
<i> [holding answer 9 February 2000]: </i>The Schools Standards and Framework Act 1998 allowed Further Education colleges to provide secondary education at key stage 4. In addition, regulations made under section 363 of the Education Act 1996 allow schools to disapply parts of the key stage 4 National Curriculum for certain pupils to enable them to spend more time on work-related learning.
<P>

<a name="00214w13.html_para1">Many schools are now working in partnership with colleges and taking advantage of this flexibility to deliver work-related learning and vocational courses. For example, we have launched a programme to support local work-related learning projects. There are over 180 projects, and around two-thirds of these include school-college links. Such links can: help pupils acquire the skills and knowledge needed in employment; enable schools to enhance their curriculum with vocational options (G/NVQs and Key Skills); and make Further Education facilities and teaching expertise available to schools. Further measures are being introduced to promote work-related learning through college links with Fresh Start schools.
<P>

<a name="00214w13.html_para2">The Department has commissioned the National Foundation for Education Research to carry out an evaluation of how the regulations are being used in practice. The evaluators will interview schools, FE colleges and others involved in delivering extended work-related learning and vocational courses. The final evaluation report is due at the end of 2000.

Most of the recommendations are for higher education institutions and their representative bodies. Ministers have asked the funding and representative bodies, who co-sponsored the report, to consider what more they can do to encourage institutions to make progress towards greater equality of opportunity for all groups of staff.

<P>
<a name="00214w13.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 On 14 June 1999 we published a Code of Practice on Age Diversity in Employment, developed with key partners such as the TUC, CBI and Age Concern. It covers all aspects of employment, for men and women of all ages, including men aged between 60 and 65. It has sections covering recruitment, selection, training, development, redundancy and retirement, and provides detailed guidance and case studies to help employers to tackle age discrimination in their organisations. This is being backed by a publicity campaign and practical help for employers wanting to adopt the principles set out in the Code. The effectiveness of the Code is being evaluated through a large scale research project which looks in detail at employer policies and practices in recruitment

 Teachers who are successful at the threshold will receive a salary increase of &#163;2,000, and will be placed on the new upper pay range. Teachers on point 9 of the pay scale and currently earning &#163;23,193 will see their salary rise to &#163;25,959 in September if they pass the threshold--a rise of 11.9 per cent. In future years, teachers who have passed the threshold will have opportunities to gain a further four points on the upper pay range, worth approximately &#163;1,000 each. This could take their salary to over &#163;30,000 for high performance in the classroom. Taking on additional responsibilities could take a teacher's salary to over &#163;37,000.

 Funding for Surrey Police in 2000-01 will increase by 22.7 per cent. to &#163;112.8 million. This large increase takes account of the expansion of the Surrey police area as a result of the boundary changes with the Metropolitan police in April. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced on 9 February the allocation of funding under the Crime Fighting Fund for the recruitment of extra police officers over and above the number that would otherwise have been recruited over three years. Surrey police will receive funding to enable in total 78 extra officers to be recruited.

 While there has been no Home Office research solely addressing the effectiveness of community beat officers in preventing crime, research has demonstrated the important role that community beat officers can play in fighting crime, whether by identifying and tackling local crime problems, providing intelligence, or combating fear of crime. Further, the contribution of community beat officers will be an important factor in some of the projects being funded under the crime reduction programme.

ethnic backgrounds fare under the criminal justice system, including the police service. The key findings for 1998-99 include a substantial increase by 66 per cent. of the number of racist incidents recorded by the police; against a history of under-recording of racist incidents this appears to reflect improved recording practices by the police and the higher priority the service is giving to its response to racist crime. Black people were, on average, six times more likely than white people to be stopped and searched by the police. The Department has set in hand a wide-ranging programme of research to help broaden understanding of these powers and how their use can be improved. The report found under-representation of ethnic minorities in the police service as in other parts of the criminal justice system. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has set targets for forces on recruitment, retention and progression of ethnic minority officers and has published a 25 point action plan to help forces meet them.

<a name="00214w15.html_para5">Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Constabulary's report of the inspection of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS), which my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary directed should be carried out in response to recommendation 4 of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry, was published on 10 January. The inspectors found significant progress within the MPS in their response to the community and race relations issues raised in the Inquiry's report, and while there were still areas to be addressed there were grounds for confidence that there would be significant improvements when the inspectors return in 12 months' time.
<P>

<a name="00214w15.html_para6">My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary undertook during the debate on the report of the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry last March that I would publish an annual report on progress of the implementation of the Action Plan I published in response to the Inquiry's report; my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary will publish the first such report shortly.

<P>
<a name="00214w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Partnerships were set up in all the London boroughs and the City of London, making 33 in all, as part of the work under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 which places a statutory requirement on the boroughs to produce a joint strategy to reduce crime and disorder. The detail of these and the way in which they are being taken forward varies to some extent but they all actively engaged in the work against crime and disorder.

 It is for the Metropolitan Police Commissioner to determine overall police numbers within the resources available.
<P>

<a name="00214w15.html_para7">The strength of the Metropolitan Police fell by 2,060 officers between 1992 and 1998 under budgets set by the previous Administration. Numbers fell by a net 209 between March 1998 and September 1999.
<P>

<a name="00214w15.html_para8">We announced on 9 February that the Metropolitan Police has been allocated funds from the Crime Fighting Fund for 2000-01 which will enable them to recruit and train 1,113 officers over and above the levels planned for financial years 2000-03. This includes 242 officers in the next financial year and the Commissioner tells me that in the light of this, he hopes to maintain police officer numbers at a constant level through 2000-01.

 The Reducing Burglary Initiative, a major component of the Crime Reduction Programme, is expected to prevent 15,000 burglaries by 2002 and 25,000 burglaries in the longer term.

<a name="00214w15.html_para9">In addition, the scheme to provide improved security to low-income pensioners should prevent 2,500 burglaries and, just as importantly, will reduce the fear of crime.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w15.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 All police authorities and police forces have been told that statutory guidance under the Best Value regime (Section 5(7) of the Local Government Act 1999) will indicate that specific targets should be set by all police authorities for domestic burglary and for vehicle crime. In addition, five forces are being asked to set a target for robbery.
<P>

<a name="00214w15.html_para10">The table shows the five-year targets for each force area, based on our latest information. It will be for each police authority to decide what targets should finally be set and published.

 There is no requirement for this information to be provided by police officers. Most forces in England and Wales are compiling statistics of freemasonry membership among officers and civilian staff from information provided on a voluntary basis, and the following figures are currently available for 26 forces. Of the 38,875 individuals who made returns, 417 indicated that they were freemasons.

 I consider very carefully each application for a warrant submitted to me under the Interception of Communications Act 1985. The average time taken for this scrutiny, depends on the complexity of the application. An average would not be meaningful. The Interception of Communications Commissioner, currently Lord Nolan, stated in his annual report for 1998 that he had found no case where I had issued or renewed a warrant without adequate justification.

<P>
<a name="00214w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I informed the House on 12 January 2000, Official Report, columns 277-78, of the conclusions of the medical report on Senator Pinochet which I had commissioned. I have passed a copy of the report to my hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department with responsibility for extradition matters, Lord Bassam, and another copy to my hon and learned Friend, the Solicitor-General. The report has also been copied to the Government's Chief Medical Officer; the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP); a member of the Treasury Solicitor's Department; and the separate sets of officials and Counsel advising the Solicitor-General, the DPP (in his capacity as domestic prosecuting authority) and me on this case. I sent a copy to Senator Pinochet's legal representatives on 11 January. I have not disclosed the report to any foreign Government.
<P>

<a name="00214w17.html_para0">I have also received medical information, from Senator Pinochet's legal representatives when I was considering the first Authority To Proceed in the case in December 1998, and from the Embassy of Chile in 1999. I have made this material available within the Government on the same basis as the report I commissioned. The material from the Embassy of Chile was passed to me by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and therefore was also seen by officials advising on the case and in some cases by my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and other Ministers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I will do so as soon as possible, but not before the High Court gives judgment in the current judicial review proceedings. I propose to give notice to the parties to the case, on the day before I expect to make my decision, and will notify the parties and this House immediately when the decision has been taken. It also remains my intention to make a full oral statement to the House when I am clear that it is appropriate to do so.

<a name="00214w17.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Under Section 30 and Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998, responsibility for the special powers and other special provisions for dealing with terrorism is reserved. Six organisations representing Scottish interests offered responses to the Government consultation paper "Legislation Against Terrorism" and their views, along with those of all other contributors, were taken into account in preparing the Terrorism Bill, Officials from this Department have been in regular contact with officials from the Scottish Executive about the contents of the Terrorism Bill.

 It is not possible to make an estimate at this stage.

<P>
<a name="00214w17.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Gerald Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy not to entertain asylum applications from the hijackers of the Ariana Airlines aircraft; and if he will make a statement on the status of applications for asylum by hijackers who arrived in the UK during the last five years.  [109818]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w17.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The United Kingdom is bound to entertain asylum applications made here under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, a legally binding international agreement. However, we also have the clearest possible obligations in respect of the prevention and deterrence of hijacking and other international terrorism. We condemn all hijackings unequivocally. The United Nations Convention provides that those convicted of or suspected of being involved in certain criminal acts shall be exempt from its provisions.
<P>

<a name="00214w17.html_para2">Asylum applications made by the Iraqi hijackers of the Sudanese Airbus in August 1996 remain under consideration.

 [holding answer 27 January 2000]: Under paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 2 to the Immigration Act 1971 the power of the Secretary of State to give instructions to Immigration Officers is limited to instructions which are not inconsistent with the Immigration Rules. In addition, the Secretary of State may give advice to Immigration Officers which they would take into account when exercising their power to grant or refuse leave to enter outside the Immigration Rules. No record is kept of the number of occasions on which such instructions or advice are given and this information could only be obtained at disproportionate cost, but I can personally recall only two occasions where I have given a specific instruction under paragraph 1(3).

Some of the goods were clearly labelled as having been donated to Iraq by third countries. The concern of those governments for the well-being of the Iraqi people is not shared by the Iraqi regime.

<a name="00214w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 In the early 1970s the southern marshes of Iraq covered 5,200 square km west of the Tigris river. Following concerted efforts by the Iraqi government to drain the wetland, including the construction of an east-west dam and a north-south canal, by 1993 very little standing water remained in the area. I have arranged for photographs of the area in 1972 and 1993 to be placed in the Library of the House.

 No. The distribution plan for "oil for food" is drawn up by Iraq and approved by the UN Secretary-General. Iraq's last three distribution plans have included allocations for bank note counting machines. On each occasion the Secretary-General has refused to approve this allocation on the grounds that bank note counting machines are not consistent with the objectives of "oil for food".

 We have raised our concerns about the escalation of violence in Lebanon with the Israeli government. We urge all parties to exercise restraint and respect the April 1996 Understanding.

<P>
<a name="00214w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 I met London representatives of major oil companies active in Angola on 30 November. I made it clear that I was concerned that Angola's oil revenues should be used for the benefit of all the people of Angola. I am particularly concerned that such revenues contribute to enhancing the Angolan skill base and reconstructing her shattered infrastructure.

 I and my officials are in regular touch with the Ambassador in Luanda and her staff about all aspects of the current situation in Angola, including the need to ensure rigorous implementation of UN sanctions against the UNITA rebel movement and the identification of individual and corporate sanctions breakers. There are no sanctions targeted against the Government of Angola.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w20.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 UN Security Council Resolution 864 of 15 September 1993 imposed an embargo on the sale of arms and petroleum products to Angola except through specific entry points named by the Government of Angola. The aim of this was to prevent arms from reaching the UNITA rebel movement. Ukraine has made clear its commitment to increasing the effectiveness of UN sanctions. It is currently a member of the UN Security Council. We have been in regular touch with the Ukrainian authorities, both in London and Kiev, about the problems of equipment of Ukrainian origin reaching the UNITA rebel movement in Angola. Ukrainian Government sales of equipment to the Angolan Government are not covered by the UN sanctions against UNITA. I am sending a team of officials to Kiev between 14 and 17 March for detailed discussions with the Ukrainian authorities on how we can co-operate to prevent this.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w20.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 Between 1993 and 1998, the United Nations Security Council adopted a range of targeted sanctions against UNITA to reduce Savimbi's ability to rebuild his military capability and encourage him to return to the negotiating table. To ensure the sanctions are as effective as possible, UNSCR 1237 of 7 May 1999 established two expert panels to investigate reports of violations of the arms and oil embargoes, diamond ban and freeze on UNITA funds. They will submit their findings shortly, including recommendations on tightening implementation of these measures.
<P>

<a name="00214w20.html_para1">On 15 October 1999 the Security Council adopted Resolution 1268 to establish a UN office in Angola (UNOA) to liaise with the political, military, police and other civilian authorities with a view to exploring effective measures for restoring peace, assisting the Angolan people in the areas of capacity building, humanitarian assistance, the promotion of human rights

The UN has been working closely with the Government of Angola to agree the Status of Mission Agreement to establish UNOA as mandated by the Resolution. We expect the head of UNOA to be appointed in the near future.

 DFID pays staff appointed in-country overseas according to good employer practice in the conditions prevailing in local labour markets. Pay rates are established by wage surveys among embassies, high commissions and major international companies and organisations. The UK minimum wage was set in relation to UK conditions and has no particular relevance in the overseas context--especially in those economies where inflation may be substantially greater than the low rates prevailing in Britain and where fluctuating exchange rates would make any sterling benchmark figure a continuously variable target.

 We are strongly committed to the elimination of child labour. We have actively supported the development of the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) new Convention on Worst Forms of Child Labour. We are providing core and project funding to ILO's International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour (IPEC).
<P>

<a name="00214w21.html_para9">Activities to end child labour need to address the main cause--poverty. Parents do not let their children work in dangerous and exhausting industries by choice. Any sustainable solution will have to include alternative income-earning opportunities for poor families. However, in many places finding alternative forms of income is difficult. The best outcome for many children may be to combine work with education. This may be the first step in breaking the inter-generational cycle of poverty.
<P>

<a name="00214w21.html_para10">Much of our work is aimed at promoting economic growth, improving access to education and increasing job opportunities. We are also supporting a number of initiatives which focus specifically on child labourers and their families including significant programmes in both India and Pakistan and, through ILO, in Indonesia. We are developing a strategic approach to child labour in Asia which will look at key international, regional and national stakeholders with interests in or influence on child labour. These strategies are looking at not just child worker specific projects but also the need for special efforts in wider education, rural livelihoods and urban-based programmes, to include children who work. We hope through these projects to develop successful approaches

<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about what plans he has to ensure that training for Benefits Agency doctors draws attention to the need for sensitivity in their dealings with vulnerable claimants, and that they receive appropriate training in the working of the benefit system.
<BR>
All examining doctors, employed by Sema Group and engaged by Nestor Disability Analysis (NDA), receive training in the Professional Standards of Medical Services. These standards include a requirement for doctors to be accessible, punctual, reliable, presentable, approachable, courteous, and friendly. Other specified standards include the requirement for the doctor to introduce him or herself to the person to be examined; to allow the claimant time to give their history, asking any questions in a non-adversarial manner; to explain the purpose of the examination; and to carry out the examination gently to avoid any unnecessary discomfort to the claimant.
<BR>
The Chief Medical Advisor to the Department is responsible for setting the standards which all doctors, undertaking medical examinations, must achieve, and approves all training material.
<BR>
The subject of professional standards is discussed during initial training and the standards are listed in full in the guidance notes that are given to each doctor. The training currently in place, ensures that all examining doctors are fully aware of the need for sensitivity whilst carrying out medical assessments on vulnerable claimants with disabilities.
<BR>
As part of their training doctors are made aware of how their role fits into the overall benefit process. However, they do not make decisions on benefit claims nor do they offer advice on the technical details of the benefit concerned, these are matters for the Benefits Agency Local Offices.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

The Secretary of State has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about how many members of BASIS's Business Development Team are (a) under investigation for suspected fraud and (b) not discharging duties for some other reason.
<BR>
The Business Development Team provides a number of support services for the rest of BASIS and currently has 27 staff.
<BR>
All allegations and suspicions of fraud on the part of Benefits Agency (BA) staff are properly considered and fully investigated. Whilst some investigations do unearth irregularities on the part of the staff and result in various penalties for those involved, many establish that the individuals have acted with propriety and are not involved in inappropriate activities.




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>14 Feb 2000 : Column: 434W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>
<BR>
It is important that investigations of this kind remain confidential, not only to protect innocent staff, but also to avoid alerting fraudulent staff to the fact that their activities are being examined.
<BR>
I hope you will accept therefore that it would be inappropriate to provide you with any details of investigations of suspected fraud by BA staff that may currently be underway. Information on fraud detected on the part of BA staff is available in Her Majesties Treasury Return published in January 2000.
<BR>
There are no members of the BASIS's Business Development Team that we would regard as not discharging their duties.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

 Local authorities are involved in a number of initiatives aimed at improving the administration and delivery of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, including several pilots. Through initiatives such as the pilot ONE service, local and central government are working together to streamline the operation of the benefit system and help clients move from welfare into work.
<P>

<a name="00214w22.html_para2">A range of benefits for clients of working age, including Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, are assessed via a single point of contact as part of the ONE service. This offers an opportunity to move away from the duplication and inefficiency of the present system, with customers providing information only once. Clients take part in a work-focused interview where they receive in-depth, individual help from a personal adviser. This puts work, and helping people overcome barriers to work, at the heart of the benefit system.
<P>

<a name="00214w22.html_para3">Twelve pilots are testing three variants of the ONE service over three years. The first four basic model pilots were launched on 28 June 1999. A further eight pilots, four assessing the use of call centre technology and four led by private and voluntary sector organisations, commenced on 29 November 1999.
<P>

<a name="00214w22.html_para4"> Fifty-six local authorities are working in partnership with the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service to trial this new way of working. Local authority involvement in ONE is important not only because of the authorities' responsibilities for delivery Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, but also because of their expertise in providing a wide range of local services and information. Local authorities have also provided valuable input to the design and development of the ONE service.
<P>

<a name="00214w24.html_para0">This is to provide for increased expenditure of &#163;8,600,000, partly funded by draw down of &#163;2,761,000 of Departmental Unallocated Provision, for meeting the settlement of final accounts on the completion of the St. Pancras building; a transfer of &#163;2,000,000 from the Department for Education and Employment (Class I, Vote 1) for awards to dance and drama students; a transfer of &#163;592,000 from the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (Class III, Vote 1) for the maintenance of Marlborough House; increased expenditure of &#163;400,000 on DCMS gross running costs offset by an increase in refunds of eligible deductible input VAT; and to provide for the receipts of &#163;3,200,000 from the National Lottery operator's licence fees and from the National Lottery Distribution Fund to meet the administrative costs of the National Lottery Commission to be appropriated in aid of the Vote.

In 1999 the Department for Culture, Media and Sport issued 315 press releases. The average cost of distributing a press release via the COI was &#163;50.76, including post, fax, packing, copying, and stationery costs.

The Director of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) has been asked to reply to your parliamentary question regarding the average earnings of the wards in Peterborough and Cambridge. I am replying in Dr Holt's absence.

The New Earnings Survey (NES) can only provide ward level earnings data based on where people work, rather than where they live. Additionally we can only provide data where we have a sufficiently large sample of employees, and have an acceptable level of accuracy.

I have provided the only available data in the table below. These are based on the 1999 NES, the latest survey for which data are available.

 The Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC) will become payable to employees by their employer along with their wages or salary from April 2000. Couples applying for WFTC are able to choose which partner applies for and receives their tax credit. From April 2000, if they opt for a partner who is self-employed, or not working, to receive the tax credit, they will be paid direct by the Inland Revenue.

<a name="00214w26.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 I have confidence in the ability of the current management of the Legal Aid Board to deliver the legal aid reforms successfully. My view is supported by the work of Mr. Victor Benjamin, who agreed in December 1998 to act as the Lord Chancellor's Independent Business Adviser on Legal Aid Reform. Mr. Benjamin was asked to form a view of the Board's ability to develop the managerial and strategic systems to implement the new arrangements and monitor them in the future. Mr. Benjamin visited a number of the Board's area offices, including Reading, and has expressed confidence in the ability of the Board to deliver the reformed scheme.

<P>
<a name="00214w26.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 I am, of course, willing to listen to any concerns by past, present, temporary and permanent staff about allegations of impropriety at any of the Board's offices. Where such complaints give rise to matters of legitimate concern, I will ensure they are properly investigated within the constraints inherent in anonymous complaints. The Board has in place established procedures for staff to raise concerns regarding any illegal, improper or unethical behaviour within the Board. These procedures provide for concerns to be raised in confidence with the Board's Head of Internal Audit.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what assessment he has made of the measures in place at Legal Aid Board offices to prevent computer fraud and consequent abuse of public funds.  [110018]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w26.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Chief Executive of the Legal Aid Board, as Accounting Officer, is responsible for ensuring that an adequate control framework is in place to ensure that public funds are suitably protected from fraud and abuse. The Legal Aid Board's Annual Accounts, which are published in its Annual Report, contain a statement by the Accounting Officer giving assurance on the Board's system of internal financial control.

 Section 38 of the Legal Aid Act prevents disclosure of information concerning an application for legal aid to any unauthorised third party. On the information before me at present, I am satisfied that the Board takes its responsibilities seriously and is careful to comply with section 38.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what measures he plans to take to ensure the Legal Aid Board prevents double payments and payments to fraudulent and fictional clients.  [110017]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w26.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Board has in place controls to reduce the risk of duplicate or fraudulent payments being made. The Chief Executive's statement on internal financial control, which is informed by the ongoing work of the Board's internal and external auditors and executive managers, has provided assurance to the Government and Parliament that the procedures being operated give an adequate level of control over the Board's financial systems. The Government will remain vigilant to ensure that every reasonable step is taken to prevent double payments and payments to fraudulent and fictional clients.

<a name="00214w26.html_wqn14"><B> Mr. Salter: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if he will investigate reports that staff at the Reading Area Legal Aid Board office are required to make up missing details on legal aid application forms.  [110015]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w26.html_spnew14"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The Board's computer system provides a facility for the collection of a great deal of information, not all of which is essential for the purposes of assessing legal aid applications. Where supervisors are otherwise satisfied about the validity of an application or claim, and where the cost of obtaining any missing information could not be justified they may authorise certain information not to be entered. For example, in some cases where the client's date of birth is omitted from a form, staff may be authorised to enter a notional date on the computer, but only where this will not compromise proper control over legal aid expenditure.

 The Government have already consulted professional bodies and others. We published our consultation paper "Conditional Fees: Sharing the Risks

of Litigation" on 23 September 1999. The paper sought views on the regulations and rules of court required to give effect to its policy on conditional fee agreements. It received 91 responses. These included responses from consumer groups, the Civil Justice Council, the Association of District Judges, the Senior Costs Judge, the legal professional bodies (including those with a specialist interest in conditional fees such as the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers), the trade unions and their legal representatives, individual judges, practitioners and the insurance industry. On 1 February, in the light of responses to that consultation paper, the Government published a report entitled "The Government's Conclusions Following Consultation on Conditional Fees: Sharing the Costs of Litigation". The report announced the principles to be set out in regulations applying to conditional fee agreements. The report also contained recommendations to the Civil Procedure Rule Committee concerning the detailed guidance in rules of court governing the recovery of success fees under conditional fee agreements and premiums for after the event insurance policies. Copies of the report have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses. The regulations giving effect to the changes announced in the report will be laid before Parliament in time for them to be approved and come into force on 1 April. The Rule Committee will, before making rules of court, consult such persons as they consider appropriate.

<P>
<a name="00214w27.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to review the indemnity principle in the light of the court decision in the case of Awwad <i>vs</i> Geraghty; and if he will make a statement.  [109373]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00214w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 The issue in Awwad <i>vs</i> Geraghty & Co. was whether an oral agreement between a solicitor and client to charge a reduced fee if the case was lost and the normal charging rate if the case was won, was enforceable. The Court held that the agreement (at the time at which it was made) was unlawful and in breach of the Solicitor's Practice Rules 1990. Awwad <i>vs</i> Geraghty considered the position as it stood in 1993. Since then amendments have been made to the legislation and to the Solicitor's Practice Rules and further amendments will come into force on 1 April 2000 as a result of the commencement of section 27 of the Access to Justice Act. After 1 April 2000 agreements to work for no, or a lesser, fee if unsuccessful and a normal or higher fee if successful will be enforceable, provided they comply with the regulations currently being drafted.
<P>

<a name="00214w27.html_para0">No consideration of the indemnity principle, relevant to the present position took place in Awwad <i>vs</i> Geraghty. The Government are conscious of the impact the indemnity principle can have on the recovery of costs, and had, prior to Awwad <i>vs</i> Geraghty, included a provision in the Access to Justice Act to amend section 51 of the Supreme Court Act 1991.
