 From time to time, the Department receives representations about the mental health services provided for members of the armed forces. I am not aware of any recent representations specifically on psychometric testing of personnel prior to deployment. The Department&#146;s evidence-based view is that such selection processes do not work and would be counter-productive.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_108"><a name="90508w0005.htm_para9"><a name="09050836000733">Recent research is summarised in the King&#146;s Centre for Military Health Research &#147;Ten Year Report&#148; published in 2006 by the University of London and covering a decade's worth of research concerning the health of UK service personnel and veterans. This explains that selecting out individuals who might be at increased risk of developing mental health difficulties prior to recruitment or deployment is a flawed strategy because, whether one uses clinical interviews or questionnaire-based methods, it is impossible to distinguish reliably between those who will go on to experience psychological difficulties and those who will not. An ineffective selection programme would not just be costly and labour intensive but is likely to have adverse consequences both for individuals who would unnecessarily be prevented from deploying when doing so is part of their job, and for the operational efficiency of the armed forces by unnecessarily reducing the numbers of personnel available to carry out operational tasks.</p>

The current market value of the asset is different, but difficult to assess, given current market conditions.

 It is impossible to quantify leakage in this way. Where leaks occur, they can be potentially very serious and lead to breaches. British Waterways therefore acts quickly to plug any leaks when they are identified. Some seepage is, however, natural on both canals and rivers. With regard to erosion, canals are by definition man-made, engineered structures which do not suffer from erosion&#151;as opposed to wear and tear&#151;in the same way as rivers. This is in part due to the materials used in their construction, the slower flow of water and the strict speed limit imposed on waterway craft.</p>

 I am very concerned by the political situation in Kenya, particularly the current disputes between the coalition partners and the detrimental impact this is having on implementation of the National Accord. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister wrote to President Kibaki and Prime Minister Odinga on 9 April 2009 to relay our concerns and to encourage them to intensify their efforts to deliver reforms. He underlined that unless more rapid progress was made on constitutional and electoral reforms, on improving security and on addressing corruption and impunity, there was a serious risk of a return to violence in Kenya. The Government will continue to work with the Kenyan government and our international partners to promote full delivery of the National Accord, providing practical and financial assistance where we can.</p>

The Department is also working with the NHS Alliance to deliver a series of workshops to general practitioners and practice staff on social enterprise and the benefits that it can bring to patients receiving primary care services. Furthermore, the National Programme for Third Sector Commissioning is a Government-backed training initiative to help develop public sector commissioners' skills, expertise and understanding of the third sector that aims to ensure that both third sector organisations and commissioners get the best results for people using public services.</p>

 For reasons of cost, I am only able to answer this question on behalf of the Home Office. It is Home Office policy to ensure that all recruits satisfy identity, background, right to work and unspent criminal conviction record checks including, for UK nationals, details of criminal convictions for recordable offences which have been notified to the UK authorities by either EU member states or through Interpol channels. This fully complies with the Baseline Personnel Security Standard (BPSS) issued by the Cabinet Office. In addition, using Home Office records, details are verified to ensure that any applicant has the right to work and that there are no integrity concerns. In addition, enhanced disclosures provided by the Criminal Records Bureau or Disclosure Scotland are required for those Home Office staff who work with children or vulnerable adults. We require information about both spent and unspent convictions for staff that are employed in a National Security Vetting (NSV) post.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="90508w0008.htm_para1"><a name="09050836001162">When a foreign national seeks employment with the Home Office we seek to establish whether the individual has a criminal record in the UK as well as in their country of origin. It is not always possible to obtain this information from overseas. As set out in the Government Response to Sir Ian Magee's Review of Criminality Information published on 4 December 2008, we aim to improve the sharing of electronic information and to prioritise agreements on the sharing of criminality information for employment vetting and barring purposes with other EU countries.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="90508w0008.htm_para2"><a name="09050836001163">Outside the EU we are taking a risk based approach to identify those countries that need to be a priority for information exchange for this purpose. However, in most cases where individuals have lived abroad during the preceding three years, if we cannot obtain a confident assessment about the absence of criminal records, the individual concerned will not be permitted to work in the Home Office and will be rejected on residency grounds.</p>

 We are confident that the range of initiatives announced in The Learning Revolution White Paper will both increase the number of learning opportunities and help people access the many and varied kinds of learning that are already available. Adults want to learn in different ways&#151;through structured classes and through libraries, museums, self-organised groups, membership organisations and on-line.</p>

The &#147;Learning Revolution&#148; sets out proposals that will help achieve this goal, including increasing the availability of free and low cost spaces for learning, launching a &#163;20 million transformation fund to reach out to new and different learners through partnership and innovation, setting up a support package for local learning champions and harnessing the potential of broadcasting and technology to support and enhance learning.</p>

 No. In the current economic climate it is more important than ever for HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to manage its business and estate as efficiently as possible so as to achieve the best possible value to the taxpayer.

 The closure of the HM Revenue and Customs office in Shrewsbury will contribute to improved efficiency through the concentration of function into a smaller number of sites. These efficiencies will be realised at a department-wide level rather than at individual office level. The closure will also contribute to cumulative overall accommodation cost savings of some &#163;230 million by 2011-12.</p>
