and Essex county council for the section beyond to Basildon. Plans for
future improvements to the road, and details of any which have already

Hanson:</b> The average domestic rate for households in
Northern Ireland consists of the average of the 26 district council
domestic rates plus the domestic regional
rate.</p><p><a name="06071722000526">The formula for
calculation of the average rate for households is as follows: Each
year, district councils' estimated net expenditure is reduced by
anticipated general grant payments and any balance that councils have
indicated they wish to apply, to determine the net amount to be raised
from district rates. This figure is divided by the total penny product
(the income from one penny in the rates) to give the average
non-domestic rate. The average non-domestic rate is then multiplied by
the Northern Ireland growth factor to determine the average domestic
rate. The average domestic rate for 2006-2007 is 157.33
pence</p><p><a name="06071722000527">The regional
domestic rate is a single rate applied uniformally across Northern
Ireland. It is determined by dividing the domestic rate revenue
required in the Budget by the domestic tax base, currently defined in
rental values.</p><p><a name="06071722000528">The
average domestic rate in 2006-07 is 355.50 pence, which is the sum of
the uniform regional domestic rate of 198.17p and the average district
rate of
157.33p.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071722000021">Redundancy</h3><p><a name="06071722000529"><b><a name="06071722002674">David

strategy on development and trade as outlined in the Trade and
Investment White Paper 2004 (in which we supported improved trade
opportunities for developing countries in line with their broader
development strategies), the Government have responded to the EPA
negotiations. We published a policy statement in March 2005 on how we
think EPAs should be designed if they are to help the ACP countries
develop. This policy determines how we will influence the EPA
negotiations and assess their
outcome.</p><p><a name="06071722000999">Secondly, at
ACP countries' request, DFID has provided substantial financial and
independent technical assistance to help inform their positions in the
negotiations. This includes support for the west African, eastern and
southern African and Caribbean countries as well to the regional bodies
which negotiate on their behalf. The UK is the largest bilateral donor
in the EU providing such assistance for
EPAs.</p><p><a name="06071722001000">Thirdly, UK
international development assistance will also respond to the needs and
priorities of the ACP arising from EPAs in order to help them develop
their ability to trade. DFID will provide funding through the European
Development Fund. Support for developing countries, including the ACP,
will also be provided through our own bilateral initiative, Aid for
Trade, to which we have committed &#163;100 million per year by
2010.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071722000049">Fast Track

of our bilateral general health sector spend by country for the
financial years 1997-98 to 2004-05. This totalled nearly &#163;267

validating expenditure data for 2005-06 and cannot release this under

Protocols.</p><p><a name="06071722001006">DFID also
supports work to improve health through our regional and central
programmes (including research programmes) that complement the work of
our country programmes. In 2004-05, this additional support brought our
total bilateral spend on the health sector to some &#163;363
million.</p><p><a name="06071722001007">In addition,
we provide funding to UN agencies such as the World Health Organisation
(WHO) and UNICEF, and bodies such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and
Malaria, which are all primarily concerned with helping countries
improve their health services. In 2004-05, expenditure on multilateral
organisations that have a significant focus on health was &#163;108.6
million.</p><p><a name="06071722001008">DFID also
provides general Poverty Reduction Budget Support to several developing
countries to help build basic services. Some of this funding goes on
health services, but is not captured within our sector specific
spending figures which therefore somewhat underestimate our overall
contribution to improving health in developing
countries.</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="6"><i> DFID

assessed for value for money and their potential for impact by the
PPIAF. Once approved, all activities follow World Bank procurement
rules that require open and transparent competition to ensure value for
money. A sample of activities are systematically evaluated by the
Technical Advisory Panel of independent experts that reports to the
Programme Council. PPIAF evaluations have confirmed that 84 per cent.
of its activities have satisfactorily achieved their original
objectives.</p><p><a name="06071722002444">In 2004,
PPIAF donors also commissioned an independent evaluation&#151;the
'Strategic Review', of the first five years of PPIAF's operations. The
objective was to evaluate PPIAF's progress against its original
objectives and identify ways for improving its performance. The report,
issued in the final quarter of 2004, was very positive, concluding that
the PPIAF is making an important contribution to
development.</p><p><a name="06071722002445">A number
of recommendations were made that the PPIAF has since implemented. The
recommendations included strengthening the strategic direction of the
programme; increasing stakeholder involvement in the Program Council,
more focus on outcomes ratherthan outputs; enhancing PPIAF's
identity as an autonomous multi-donor facility and improving impact
measurement.</p><p><a name="06071722002446">Changes
facilitated by the PPIAF often take a few years to deliver the
anticipated improvements to the enabling environment. This has made it
difficult to assess direct poverty impact to date. Improving impact
measurement is an issue that is currently being addressed. One proposal
is that PPIAF activity should be more closely anchored to planned
infrastructure projects. Further work is in hand to gauge the impact of
PPIAF activity on the International Financial Corporation's national
'doing business' ratings that address various aspects of the enabling
environment.</p><p><a name="06071722002447">Country-specific
activities may be undertaken only where governments seek the assistance

PPIAF.</p><p><a name="06071722002448">Consensus
building is essential if reforms are to be successful. Governments are
responsible for leading the process. The PPIAF has played an important
supporting role. For example, the PPIAF has supported the development
of a series of training courses on utility regulation and finance that
have been targeted at key stakeholder groups including Ministers and
senior Government officials, journalists and consumer associations. The
aim of the training courses is to equip stakeholders with a sound
knowledge on which to appraise reforms. Two training workshops have
also been held for stakeholders. The first workshop was held in South
Africa in June 2005 and the second was held in Costa Rica in February
2006. Feedback provided to PPIAF on the workshops has been very
positive.</p><p><a name="06071722002449">DFID last

a request for continued 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>17 July 2006 : Column 55W</b><br>support. This review drew heavily on the findings of the independent
strategic review and progress on implementing its recommendations. The
strategic review reported that the PPIAF has a comparative advantage
over other facilities by demonstrating clear focus, global reach,
strong donor support and efficient management. It confirmed that demand
for PPIAF services by governments of developing countries is growing
and that continued DFID support is critical to growth and increasing
the leverage of funds required for scaling up. On this basis, DFID
agreed to continue its contribution to PPIAF for a further three-year
period&#151;July 2005 to June
2008.</p><p><a name="06071722002450">Donors are asked
annually to consider a financial plan incorporating an estimate of
future calls on donors based on the anticipated demand by governments.
The PPIAF then considers requests for funding from governments once a

<p><a name="06071722002527">All
project proposals are assessed for value for money and their potential
for impact by the PPIAF. Once approved, all activities follow World
Bank procurement rules that require open and transparent competition to
ensure value for money. A sample of activities are systematically
evaluated by the technical advisory panel of independent experts that
reports to the Program Council which is composed of representatives of
the 14 donors members. PPIAF evaluations have confirmed that 84 per
cent of its activities have satisfactorily achieved their original
objectives.</p><p><a name="06071722002528">In 2004,
PPIAF donors also commissioned an independent evaluation the 'Strategic
Review', of the first five years of PPIAF's operations. The objective
was to evaluate PPIAF's progress against its original objectives and
identify ways for improving its performance. The report, issued in the
final quarter of 2004, was very positive, concluding that that PPIAF is
making an important contribution to development. A number of
recommendations were made that the PPIAF has since implemented. The
recommendations included strengthening the strategic direction of the
programme; increasing stakeholder involvement in the PPIAF's Program
Council, more focus on outcomes rather than outputs, enhancing PPIAF's
identity as an autonomous multi- donor facility and improving impact
measurement.</p><p><a name="06071722002529">Changes
facilitated by the PPIAF often take a few years to deliver the
anticipated improvements to the enabling environment. This has made it
difficult to assess direct poverty impact to date. Improving impact
measurement is an issue that is currently being addressed. One proposal
is that PPIAF activity should be more closely anchored to planned
infrastructure projects. Further work is in hand to gauge the impact of
PPIAF activity on the International Financial Corporation's national
'doing business' ratings that address various aspects of the enabling
environment.</p><p><a name="06071722002530">DFID is
an active member of the PPIAF's Program Council and we are involved in
discussions about the strategic direction of the PPIAF. Over the past
couple of years, DFID and other donors have sought to encourage the
PPIAF to make better progress on measuring the impact of its activities
on poverty alleviation and to better co-ordinate its activity with
others.</p><h3 align="center"><a name="06071722000057">Rotavirus</h3><p><a name="06071722002531"><b><a name="06071722002762">Mark

obtain legal aid for legal advice and information, investigative help,

funding, as set out in the Funding Code. Housing cases are considered a
priority for funding, and the Funding Code criteria for legal
representation in housing cases reflect this. Cases in which the roof
over the applicant&#146;s head is directly at issue are considered to
be of &#147;overwhelming importance&#148; to the applicant and can

Baird:</b> The Department for Constitutional Affairs (DCA) has
an important role in the social exclusion agenda. We are promoting the
benefits of good early advice services for those most in need. Evidence
shows that this can prevent relatively simple civil legal issues
spiralling into more complex problems. We are also encouraging closer
working across Whitehall. Our role is crosscutting in highlighting the
worth of advice services to Government colleagues. DCA is also the
facilitating Department for other Government Departments that require a
final remedy to be decided upon by a court or
tribunal.</p><p><a name="0607186001489">Specialisation
and innovation in the courts systemis also relevant. We are
looking at both preventing crime through community justice initiatives,
and re-integrating offenders into society. The Community Justice Centre
in North Liverpool is spearheading such an approach.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>17 July 2006 : Column 90W</b><br><p><a name="0607186001490">Another main area of influence is
the role of family courts. The recent Review of the Child Care
Proceedings System in England and Wales (produced jointly with DfES)
aims to achieve better lives for children and their families by
improving the care proceedings system and eliminating unnecessary delay
in care cases, while ensuring that the process remains a fair one. The
DCA is also a key player on the Domestic Violence Inter-Ministerial
Group. There are currently 25 Specialist Domestic Violence (DV) courts.
A bidding process is currently under way to establish a second tranche
of these courts by 1 April
2007.</p><p><a name="0607186001491"><b><a name="0607186001682">Keith

simple civil legal issues developing into more complex and numerous
problems. This is evidenced by the recent Legal Services Research
Centre&#146;s &#147;Causesof Action&#148; publication,
which also highlights the tendency for inter-related problems to
develop around a key theme (broadly around &#145;family&#146;,
&#145;homelessness&#146; and &#145;economic&#146; clusters).
The Legal Services Commission&#146;s new Community Legal Service
Strategy is informed by this research, and proposes that newly created
Community Legal Advice Centres are located in areas of high deprivation
in order to target the most vulnerable. My Department&#146;s recent
Getting earlier, better advice to vulnerable people document underlines
the need for ensuring advice is people focussed, with problems not
being considered in isolation. It also highlights the importance of
getting advice right first time, and ensuring more effective referral
networks are in place so that people get the service they need
regardless of their point of access to the
system.</p><p><a name="0607186001493"><b><a name="0607186001684">Keith

[84583]</p><p><a name="0607186001494"><b><a name="0607186001685">Vera
Baird:</b> As part of its role in delivering legal aid, the
Legal Services Commission (LSC) considers the need for its services to
help prevent social exclusion. The LSC can play its part by ensuring
that services are better co-ordinated, focussed and effective, and that
acts of advice/assistance increase. The new Community Legal Service
(CLS) Strategy proposes that Community Legal Advice Centres (CLACs) are
located in areas of high deprivation in order to target the most
vulnerable. In less densely populated areas Community Legal Advice
Networks (CLANs) will ensure that clients are able to access a range of
high quality advice services regardless of their geographic location.
Community Legal Service Direct also allows easy access for clients. The
new CLS Strategy, in proposing that CLACs and CLANs will cover all five
areas of social welfare law (Community Care, Housing, Debt, Employment
and Welfare Benefits), will further promote social
inclusion.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>17 July 2006 : Column 91W</b><br><h3 align="center"><a name="0607186000053">Special

Leigh:</b> To ask the Chairman of the Public
Accounts Commission what progress the Commission has made in
considering the proposal by the National Audit Office for the
refurbishment of its headquarters building in London.
[86119]</p><p><a name="06071818000542"><b><a name="06071818000679">Mr.
Alan Williams:</b> At its meeting in December 2005 the
Commission gave outline approval to the NAO's proposed refurbishment of
its headquarters building in Buckingham Palace Road, London, subject,
however, to three conditions. First, that the NAO should produce a
detailed, fully costed business case for the project. Second, that the
NAO should carry out a cost-benefit analysis of an alternative approach
to its accommodation requirements, namely moving its headquarters to a
North of England location. And third, that the NAO should provide a
fuller explanation of its decision to rule out the possibility of
acquiring alternative accommodation in London as part of the Government
estate.</p><p><a name="06071818000543">At its meeting on 4 July
2006, the Commission considered the NAO's response under each of those
headings.</p><p><a name="06071818000544"><i> The Business
Case</i></p><p><a name="06071818000545">The business
case produced by the NAO gives the total cost of the project as
&#163;77.44 million, spread over five years starting in 2006-07. In
the longer term, there will be a small increase in annual resource
costs to the NAO, resulting from higher business rates, capital charges
and depreciation, partially offset by reduced running costs through
greater building efficiency. Since submitting its original proposals
the NAO has revised its approach to the decanting of staff which will
be necessary while the building work is in progress. It is now hoped to
carry this out in a single rather than a two or three stage process,
depending on the availability of suitable decant accommodation. On the
basis of the business case, the NAO made a persuasive argument in
support of refurbishment as the most cost-effective way of avoiding
what would otherwise be&#151;because of the building's current
deficiencies&#151;an unacceptable risk to the Office's continued
ability to function efficiently. The Commission was, however, 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>17 July 2006 : Column 107W</b><br>conscious of the sensitivity surrounding the timing of the project,
since, under the NAO's plans, the bulk of the expenditure would occur
in the year's covered by the next, and potentially difficult,
comprehensive spending review. We therefore pressed the NAO on the
implications of deferring the project (which, because of the need to
avoid coinciding with the competing demands on the construction
industry from Olympics-related activity, would entail a delay until
2013). The NAO satisfied the Commission that, given the deteriorating
condition of the current building, waiting a further seven years before
undertaking remedial work would pose an unacceptable risk to the NAO's
operations and therefore to the service it provides to
Parliament.</p><p><a name="06071818000546"><i> The Possibility
of Relocating to the North of
England</i></p><p><a name="06071818000547">In
response to the Commission's request, the NAO examined Manchester as a
possible location for a provincial headquarters building. Of a number
of cities considered, Manchester was judged to come nearest to meeting
the Office's principal requirements: good transport connections; and a
sufficiently large local pool of qualified accountants to enable the
NAO to recruit and retain key professional staff. On the latter count,
the available pool in Manchester, though large in comparison with other
provincial cities, is much smaller than London's and is insufficient to
support the NAO's requirements. The cost-benefit analysis carried out
by the NAO indicated that the basic costs associated with relocating
would be broadly similar to those for the option of staying on in a
refurbished Buckingham Palace Road. On the other hand, the analysis
suggested that the uncertainty over the number of staff who would be
willing to relocate posed a risk both of additional, but unquantifiable
costs of redundancy and resettlement packages, and of disruption of
core business activity. The Commission was satisfied that, for these
reasons, relocation was not a realistic option. The NAO is, however,
proposing to expand its presence in the North, concentrating on its
existing team in Newcastle.</p><p><a name="06071818000548"><i> Alternative Accommodation in
London</i></p><p><a name="06071818000549">As part of
its consideration of alternative sites in London for its headquarters
building, the NAO has examined the portfolio of vacant, or about to
become vacant, properties maintained by the Office of Government
Commerce. The NAO's assessment, which the Commission accepted, is that
there is at present no building available of a size and configuration
to meet the NAO's requirements on a long term basis, and at a cost
competitive with the headquarters refurbishment option, taking account
of the resultant loss of the current peppercorn rent. Taking all these
factors into account, and having carefully considered the NAO's
business case, the Commission gave its formal approval to the proposed
refurbishment of the Buckingham Palace Road building. The Commission
noted that, depending on how quickly the refurbishment work can begin,
it may be necessary for the NAO to submit a supplementary estimate for
the financial year 2006-07. The Commission will consider any such
request if and when it is received. In the meantime, the Commission
looks to the Treasury to make room within the public expenditure
envelope for the relevant years for the 
<br><notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>17 July 2006 : Column 108W</b><br>resources needed for the refurbishment. For its part, the Commission
will monitor carefully the progress of the project against both time
and
budget.</p><h3 align="center" style="text-transform:uppercase"><a name="06071818000003">Duchy of

Hodge:</b> The Government introduced statutory controls on
spam emails by means of the Privacy and Electronic Communications (EC
Directive) Regulations 2003, which was enacted on11 December
2003. The regulations provide a first line of defence against spam
originating in the EU where the recipient has no knowledge of the
advertiser of the products being marketed. The regulations require that
spam must not be sent to an individual subscriber without prior
permission or unless there is a previous relationship between the
parties. The regulations can be enforced against an offending company
or individual anywhere in the EU. There is regular contact between my
Department, the Department of Constitutional Affairs and the
Information Commissioner&#146;s Office on the operation of these
regulations.</p><p><a name="06071821001037">The
Government recognise that most spam does not come from the UK and has
therefore extensively promoted international co-operation. A Memorandum
of Understanding was agreed on 2 July 2004 between the enforcement
authorities of the United Kingdom, United States and Australia, to
reduce the problem by working together to investigate those sending
spam. The UK also plays a leading role in Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD)&#146;s Anti Spam Task Force and
other multilateral initiatives. In late 2004, the UK launched the
world&#146;s first and only anti-spam enforcement network, the London
Action Plan, which now spans five continents and includes authorities
and industry from countries particularly affected by this issue, such
as Nigeria, China and India.</p><br><notus-date day="17" month="7" year="2006" textMonth="July"></notus-date><b>17 July 2006 : Column 145W</b><br><p><a name="06071821001038">The end user has a role to play

[85097]</p><p><a name="06071821001058"><b><a name="06071821001382">Malcolm
Wicks:</b> Despite sustained benefits from liberalised energy
markets over the past decade, the Government fully appreciates that
high energy prices do create problems for the competitiveness of
industry, and takes very seriously the potential loss of jobs and
investment. The Government are leaving no stone unturned, working
closely with industry, to find solutions and reduce the impact. The new
Business Energy Forum, co-chaired by the Secretary of State and Richard
Lambert of the CBI, met for the first time on 5 July and is monitoring
this work and looking at other strategic energy issues impacting on
business. Higher energy prices in the UK reflect higher global prices,
caused by rising demand and supply constraints (for oil and gas), the
lack of EU energy market liberalisation, and domestic factors, such as
the tight winter supply demand balance in the UK gas market.</p><p><a name="06071821001059">The importance of the
Government&#146;s activity in pushing for European energy market
liberalisation was highlighted in a Global Insight report in 2005. The
report estimated that the lack of effective liberalisation and the
dominance of oil-linked long-term supply contracts in Europe would cost
UK industrial consumers of gas some &#163;2.6 billion over the
following year. Ofgem analysis suggests that the cost to UK gas
consumers of Interconnector flows not always being in line with price
signals during the last winter was&#163;1.5 billion and
would cost &#163;3 billion if repeated during the coming winter. The
European Commission has been active in reviewing competition in gas and
electricity markets.</p><p><a name="06071821001060">During the past two years there
have been several investigations and reports into competition in UK gas
and electricity markets. These include the Ofgem gas price probe, and
two inquiries from the Trade and Industry Select Committee. The Ofgem
gas price probe found no evidence of anti-competitive behaviour in the
UK gas market. More recently, Ofgem published a &#147;Domestic Retail
Market Report&#148;, which concluded that, &#147;competition
remains effective and vigorous in all segments of the domestic energy
market.&#148; Independent research by Oxera concluded that in 2004
the UK had the most competitive electricity and gas markets
inthe EU and G7 (available at

UK-Zimbabwe trade in recent years. In 2000, UK and Zimbabwe two-way
trade amounted to &#163;143 million. Imports from Zimbabwe were
mainly agricultural products with tobacco, making up
approximately31 per cent. of the total imports. Exports were
mainly manufactured goods, with office machines and ADP equipment
topping the table at &#163;5.3 million.</p><p><a name="06071821001073">By 2005, two-way trade had
fallen to &#163;66 million. The principal change was in tobacco
imports, which fell to &#163;4.8 million from &#163;31 million in
2000 down85 per cent. Exports also fell, with the leading
export, road vehicles, topping the table at &#163;3.5 million. The
decline in trade can be attributed to the policies of the Government of
Zimbabwe which have brought about the fall of both imports and
exports.</p><p><a name="06071821001074">A breakdown
of UK exports and imports by sector for 2004 and 2005 is shown in the

our view that economic sanctions would harm the people of Zimbabwe at a
time of humanitarian crisis, while having very little impact on the
ZANU (PF) leadership. The people of Zimbabwe have suffered
enough.</p><table border="1"><tr valign="top"><td class="tabletext" colspan="2"><i> UK
