<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if his Budget in March 1998 will be unified to include public expenditure plans. [7709]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Darling </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 1997]:</i> In the Budget, my right hon. Friend the Chancellor announced revised spending allocations for 1998-99. The timing of announcements for the years 1999-00 and beyond will depend on the progress of the Comprehensive Spending Review which is due to conclude in the middle of next year.

<a name="70714w01.html_sbhd1"><H4><center>Employer Pension Funds</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what estimate he has made of the cost to <i>(a)</i> local authorities and <i>(b)</i> the national health service of making good the shortfall in employer pension funds arising from his Budget measures. [7772]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Darling </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 1997]:</i> There are around a hundred local authority pension funds. The position will vary depending on factors such as financial circumstances and the make up of investment portfolios. For example, many funds have surpluses which can be used to help cushion the effect. Pension schemes should also benefit from improved company performance as a result of quality long term investment being encouraged. Although the loss of tax credits will have some impact on the income of local authority pension funds, the extent to which these changes feed through to authorities' budgets will depend on the overall judgements made by the funds' actuaries as they undertake revaluations due from next year. Their conclusions will not be reflected in contribution rates before 1999-00 at the earliest. The Budget changes will not adversely affect the NHS scheme on present assumptions, since it is based on a notional fund assumed to be invested entirely in Gilts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Home Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if <i>(a)</i> funding for house building by local authorities from borrowing against their own housing revenue accounts, <i>(b)</i> funding of developments by public authorities for water and sewerage services if such authorities are constituted as mutually owned businesses and <i>(c)</i> funding of support for agriculture which is fully refunded by the European Union, are regarded as part of the public sector borrowing requirement in (i) the United Kingdom and (ii) other individual members of the European Union; and if he will make a statement. [7694]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Darling </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 July 1997]:</i> The public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) measures total borrowing by the public sector--by central 



<P>
<P><I>14 Jul 1997 : Column: 2</I><P>
government, local authorities and public corporations--from the private sector and overseas. Any spending by a public sector body that is not covered by receipts will add to the PSBR. The PSBR is a UK measure and is not used by other EC member states, although they may measure their borrowing requirements in a similar fashion to the United Kingdom.

<a name="70714w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Strategic Defence Review</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Key: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many of his officials, and at what grades, are assisting <i>(a)</i> the Ministry of Defence and <i>(b)</i> the Foreign and Commonwealth Office with the Strategic Defence Review. [6756]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The number and grade of the officials involved in the Strategic Defence Review will depend on the issues that arise and the nature of their responsibilities.

<a name="70714w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Windfall Tax</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Colvin: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will publish the representations he has received from the privatised water companies about the windfall tax; and if he will make a statement. [8535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 Treasury Ministers are treating representations from companies and other bodies as confidential. If companies wish to make their views public, that is for them.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Colvin: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is his definition of excess profit for the purposes of the windfall tax. [7252]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Robinson: </B> 
 Details of the windfall tax are set out in the Finance Bill. Clause 1 and Schedule 1 of the Bill set out how the amount of a company's windfall is to be calculated.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Dafis: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will list the new control totals of spending, by Department, for 1988-89 on the format produced in the Red Book for 1997-98. [7154]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 Figures for planned spending in 1998-99 for each department were published in table 1.2 of the <i>Public Expenditure Statistical Analyses 1997-98,</i> Cm 3601. Apart from some minor technical changes discussed in the <i>Financial Statement and Budget Report</i>, paragraph 4B.14, these have been updated only to take account of the allocation of the existing Reserve to the Government's priorities of health and schools. The spending announced in the Budget on the Welfare to Work package and investment in housing under the Capital Receipts Initiative is additional to the Control Total.

<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 I expect the Comprehensive Spending Review to last approximately 12 months. The costs of the Review will be absorbed in the relevant departments running costs as would any similar review to look at improving efficiency and effectiveness.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if the reductions in Customs anti-smuggling staff planned under the Department's 1994 fundamental expenditure review are to be proceeded with. [8760]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I have reviewed with Customs the previously planned intention to reduce the number of frontier anti-smuggling officers by some 300 posts during the current year. We face a growing world-wide threat of drug smuggling which is increasingly diverse and cunning. In the light of this I have decided that in the present circumstances it would not be prudent to go ahead with these cuts and the posts are to be retained. Customs' target for the value of drugs prevented from entering Kingdom in the current year will be increased by &#163;50 million.
<P>

<a name="70714w01.html_para0">This Government takes the threat of drugs very seriously, and we recognise that Customs anti-smuggling staff play a vital role at our frontiers in combating not only drug trafficking but also in detecting the smuggling

<P>

<a name="70714w01.html_para1">The Government is determined to maintain and strengthen the co-ordinated enforcement action against these evils in which Customs play a key role. Customs have a consistently strong record in the detection and investigation of drug trafficking, not only in the UK but in their contribution to the European and international effort.

<a name="70714w01.html_para2">Funding for these posts will be contained within Customs' existing provision in accordance with the Government's commitment to work within the Departmental spending limits we have inherited for this year and next.

<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Lansley: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the tax gained or forgone on expenditure on the National Lottery relative to alternative forms of consumer expenditure. [3425]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The rate of duty on the lottery was originally set on the basis that it was expected to be broadly revenue-neutral--that is the revenue raised would broadly offset the indirect tax loss from expenditure diverted from other goods and services. We know of no evidence as yet to suggest that the Exchequer is gaining or losing substantial revenues as a result of the Lottery.

 Sections 198 and 199 of the Water Industry Act 1991 require water and sewerage companies to keep records, in the form of maps, of the location of every water main and adopted sewer vested in them and to make this information freely available for inspection at their offices at all reasonable times. The companies are also required to provide local authorities with copies of sewer maps and any modifications to them.

 The provision and availability of information relevant to health and safety is a fundamental requirement of the Construction (Design and Management) Regulations 1994. It is therefore an important consideration of Health and Safety Executive (HSE) inspectors when determining compliance with the Regulations. Inspectors already give advice or take formal enforcement action in support of this requirement, when appropriate.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment he has made of the impact of the recent reduction in VAT on domestic fuel on the Government's environmental obligations; and if he will make a statement. [7660]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w02.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We estimate the reduction in VAT on domestic fuel to 5 per cent. will result in an annual increase in carbon dioxide emissions of about 0.24 million tonnes of carbon by 2010, (about 0.15 per cent. of current carbon dioxide emissions). We shall take account of this effect in developing the programme to meet our target to reduce total carbon dioxide emissions by 20 per cent. by 2010.
<P>

<a name="70714w02.html_para0">Protection from the effects of global warming and the development of sustainable environmental policies cannot proceed in isolation from considerations of social equity. We are developing policy options which will contribute towards our 2010 target and which will include improvements in domestic and industrial energy efficiency, an integrated transport policy to tackle the projected growth in emissions from road transport, and an increase in the amount of electricity generated from renewable sources and combined heat and power schemes.

 We will be considering the need for any changes to existing targets for the recovery and recycling of household waste in the light of progress made so far. It is important to improve recycling and increase the proportion of waste managed by the options towards the top of the waste hierarchy. We will be looking carefully at the options for doing this as part of our wider assessment of waste management and recycling policy.

 On 29 May the Government announced that a group would be set up, including representatives of statutory agencies, local authorities and the main farming and conservation bodies, to review how the Hedgerows Regulations 1997 might be strengthened.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The Local Government Pension Scheme Regulations 1995, which control this statutory scheme in England and Wales, requires actuaries, as part of each triennial valuation of the 87 separate local authority funds, to set an employer contribution rate to ensure solvency having regard to existing and prospective liabilities and the desirability of maintaining as constant a rate as possible. At the last valuation in 1995, all local authority pension funds complied with this requirement, and at that time the actuaries were able to report that 20 funds were actuarially assessed as having assets in excess of their liabilities.

<P>

<a name="70714w02.html_para2">Mandatory standards for petrol and diesel were agreed for the year 2000 as follows: petrol--a sulphur content of 150 ppm, a benzene content of 1 per cent. and an aromatics content of 42 per cent.; diesel--a sulphur content, set at 350 parts per million. Other parameters for 2000 were agreed as proposed by the European Commission. The UK also supported, and Ministers agreed, the Dutch Presidency's proposal of indicative standards for the year 2005 of 50 ppm sulphur in both petrol and diesel (the latter to be phased in from 2005), and 35 per cent. aromatics content in petrol. These figures will be subject to review and the Commission will bring forward proposals by mid-1999 either to confirm or adjust them.

 I attended the inaugural meeting of the United Nations Environment Programme's High-Level Committee of Ministers and Officials in New York on 28 June. I am glad to be able to report that this was a successful meeting. The Committee gave advice to UNEP's Executive Director on the main priorities for UNEP's Programme of Work. Given the positive outcome, especially on the way forward for UNEP, I announced at the close that the United Kingdom would, forthwith, lift the suspension of its annual voluntary contribution to the Environment Fund. I have, therefore, arranged for a payment of &#163;4.35 million to be made as soon as possible to UNEP's Environment Fund.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to curb the development of unlicensed and unregistered private households offering bed and breakfast facilities to visitors outside the six-bed rule.[7713]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 The "six-bedspace" exemption from rates was designed to ensure that those who provide extra accommodation in peak periods during the summer, or in out of the way places, are not put off doing so by the threat of a rates bill. However, we see no reason to exempt from rates anyone who offers accommodation when the use of property for this purpose is clearly non-domestic so, to qualify, the use of such property for bed and breakfast must be subsidiary to its use as a residence.
<P>

<a name="70714w03.html_para0">The Valuation Office Agency have issued guidance to their local offices on interpretation of the subsidiary use test to ensure that it is being applied correctly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 Local housing authorities set their own rent levels, reviewing them from time to time as circumstances require. In setting their rents they have regard to their statutory duty to balance the housing revenue account, taking account, among other things, of any housing revenue account subsidy payable to them for the year. We are currently examining the financing of local authority housing as part of our comprehensive review of spending.

<P>
<a name="70714w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My Department is currently preparing to commission research which will examine the relationship between the planning system; the advice currently provided to Government Departments by the Treasury on the disposal of redundant property; and the need to maximise the disposal value of such property, whilst taking full account of the wider economic and social regeneration considerations. The Government Offices in the Regions and the MOD are together drawing up, and intend to publish, guidelines on the disposal of redundant defence establishments. Our objective is to maximise their potential in order to mitigate the impact of closures on local communities, and to reduce the demand for development on greenfield sites, while at the same time protecting our historic heritage and general environment.

 My Department has no knowledge of any case involving a challenge to a local authority's policy towards the removal of unauthorised campers. There have, however, been three cases of which we are aware where an authority's decision to evict, using powers in the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, has been challenged in the courts. In the case of R <i>v</i> Wealden District Council ex parte Wales and others, the direction issued by the local authority under section 77 of the 1994 Act, and the magistrates' court order, were both quashed by the judge. In the parallel case of R <i>v</i> Lincolnshire County Council ex parte Atkinson the judge exercised his discretion not to quash the direction and the eviction order, and those travellers were evicted. R <i>v</i> Wolverhampton MBC ex parte Dunne followed, and approved, the Wealden judgment. There may also be other cases in which a local authority's use of either planning enforcement powers, or of possession proceedings to remove trespassers, has been challenged, or where an application by travellers for leave for judicial review has been refused by the courts. My Department would not necessarily be notified of these.<i></i>

Those responsibilities exist independently of the Circular, and would apply even if it had not been issued.

 I have today laid before the House the draft Council Tax Limitation (England) (Maximum Amounts) Order 1997, under section 57 of the Local Government Finance Act 1992, setting out our decisions on the final caps for Oxfordshire, Somerset and Warwickshire County Councils.
<P>

<a name="70714w05.html_para0">We have considered very carefully all the available relevant information, including the case made by the authorities in support of a higher cap, before taking our decisions. We have decided to confirm the caps proposed for Oxfordshire and Somerset, but Warwickshire will be permitted to budget at the level it has proposed to reflect the pressures it is facing following capital investment in its schools programme.
<P>

<a name="70714w05.html_para1">The caps are, in our view, reasonable and achievable in all the circumstances of the authorities concerned. These decisions will reduce public expenditure and the burden on council taxpayers in the areas concerned by &#163;9.4 million in 1997-98. This will result in a council tax reduction (at Band D) of almost &#163;28 in Oxfordshire, and &#163;20 in Somerset.

<P>
<a name="70714w06.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Jackson: </B> 
 Changes to operating procedures relating to action to be taken in the event of a fire alarm on board an HGV shuttle, arising from the implementation of recommendations contained in the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority's Inquiry Report, have meant that the risk to the overhead power line, the catenary, has been reduced. However, in response to Recommendation 4 of the Safety Authority Report, Eurotunnel are employing consultants to examine the feasibility of reducing the chances of the catenary tripping.
<P>

<a name="70714w06.html_para1">Under the changed procedures the operators--Eurotunnel--no longer operate a drive-through policy or one in which the locomotive and amenity coach is de-coupled and driven through. Consequently the preservation of the integrity of the overhead power line is of less importance to the safety of people in an emergency. In the event of a fire on board an HGV shuttle the running tunnel systems will be configured for an emergency and the train will be brought to a controlled stop alongside a cross passage door for evacuation into the service tunnel.

 This is a matter for the Channel Tunnel Intergovernmental Commission, advised by the Channel Tunnel Safety Authority. In its Inquiry Report into the incident on 18 November 1996 the Safety Authority concluded that the semi-open design of HGV shuttles could be used in a way that secured the safety of people. Before approval was given for the resumption of HGV shuttle services, the Commission and the Safety Authority examined a detailed submission by the operators of the Channel Tunnel, Eurotunnel, and satisfied themselves that the operating procedures proposed were such that semi-open HGV shuttle wagons were able to be operated safely.

The Government is undertaking a transport policy review which will cover, amongst other things, the potential for a shift to short sea shipping, particularly for freight, as part of a policy to promote a progressive shift to less environmentally damaging modes; the environmental impact of ports, including surface access arrangements; and the role of ports in promoting regional development.

 The independent assessment of a final claim for compensation is made on the basis of written submissions from the claimant or his or her solicitor, setting out the information which he or she would like the assessor to take into account. Based on this material, a memorandum is prepared by the Home Office which sets out the background to the wrongful conviction and summarises the claim. The claimant receives a draft of the completed memorandum and, subject to any comments which he or she may wish to make on its content, or to clarification of any points arising from his or her representations, it is then submitted, with the representations, to the assessor--currently Sir David Calcutt QC.

 The special secure unit (SSU) operating standards were reviewed following the receipt of Sir Donald Acheson's report in June 1996. The standards were amended to implement recommendations covering health reviews of prisoners, transfer of prisoners requiring emergency treatment in national health service hospitals and sentence management.
<P>

<a name="70714w08.html_para7">Careful consideration was given to Sir Donald's recommendation that prisoners in SSUs should have access to open visits with members of their immediate family. The Prison Service has made numerous improvements to the security of SSUs but closed visits represent the only guaranteed means of preventing the passage of unauthorised items between prisoner and visitor. The policy of mandatory closed visits for exceptional risk prisoners will be kept under review, however, to ensure that it remains the appropriate response to the threat posed by such prisoners.

 We are currently examining the policies operating in this area, with a view to ensuring that we have an effective strategy against domestic and sexual violence.

<a name="70714w09.html_para0">Domestic violence is a serious and widespread crime which threatens many people in society, mainly women. Domestic violence is unacceptable in itself.

An intimate search consists of the physical examination of a person's body orifices other than the mouth. Provisional figures for 1996 show that 132 intimate searches were recorded by police forces in England and Wales. The confirmed figure will be published later this year. Statistics held centrally do not show how many of those subject to intimate searches were charged with an offence.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy to ensure that prison officers are subject to the same search policy before coming on duty as applies to visitors to prisoners.[8568]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w09.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 No. Where rub-down searches are deployed, my right hon. Friend has just announced that professional visitors, including prison officers, will be subject to a modified search, while general visitors will continue to be subject to the full rub-search procedure. This is following a Prison Service assessment that while there are exceptions, professional visitors and staff generally pose a lower level of risk.

Of these, five persons were sentenced at the same court appearance for drug offences and seven persons were sentenced for driving etc. after consuming alcohol or drugs. There were no persons sentenced for drunkenness.
<P>

<a name="70714w10.html_para2">In 1995, a further 185 prisoners were recalled by the Parole Board under section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991, of which 84 had committed further offences. Information on their offences is not readily available.

<P>
<UL>(2) how many instances of illegal drug taking and alcohol consumption in prisons were discovered in the most recent year for which figures are available; and how many resulted in disciplinary action. [8569]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 In 1996-97 some 21,700 mandatory drug test samples were positive for drugs. This figure includes results from both random and targeted tests which led to 16,757 adjudications for misuse of controlled drugs. Information on the number of instances of alcohol consumption is not available and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. Knowingly consuming alcohol became a disciplinary offence in February this year. The first use of this charge in disciplinary proceedings occurred in May.
<P>

<a name="70714w10.html_para4">The Government are fully committed to reducing the level of substance misuse in prisons. We intend to build on existing measures to reduce the supply of drugs in prisons by a combination of mandatory drug testing and drug treatment programmes. The Prisons (Alcohol Testing) Act was enacted in March this year. The Prison Service is currently considering the implementation of a pilot programme of mandatory alcohol testing.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 All prisons provide detoxification, education and counselling facilities to prisoners with substance misuse problems via the prison health care centre, probation department or community drug agencies. Many provide additional drug treatment programmes, for example, rehabilitation units or drug free areas supported by voluntary testing. The Prison Service is also spending &#163;6.09 million this year on pilot drug treatment projects at 59 establishments. These include therapeutic communities, three-month treatment programmes, enhanced detoxification units, intensive counselling and education services and community-linked throughcare programmes.

make in his procedures to search prison visitors to ensure that no illegal drugs or alcohol are brought into prisons.[8566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 The Prison Service is implementing a range of measures to improve searching procedures which will minimise the smuggling of contraband into prisons. The most important one is the issuing of the new security manual at the turn of the year. This will publicise new standardised procedures for searching prisoners, visitors and vehicles, and will reinforce messages on good local supervision and audit of procedures. Recent increases in local training time should also contribute towards the improvement in searching procedures.

<P>
<a name="70714w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Howarth: </B> 
 We have not as yet had the opportunity for substantive talks on these particular topics. We are fully committed to reducing the level of drug and alcohol misuse in prisons and we will discuss developments with the trade unions as they arise.

 Available data for maintained secondary schools in these local education authority (LEA) areas, as published in performance tables in November 1996, are shown in the following table. Figures for numbers of 15-year-old pupils and for the percentages of such pupils achieving five or more GCSE grades A*-C relate to examinations in academic year 1995-96. Figures for numbers of pupils on roll and numbers with statements are taken from the Annual Schools Census in January 1996, with schools listed by the LEA in whose area they were located as at November 1996. Information on numbers of statements by age of pupil is not collected centrally, so it is not possible to correlate between numbers of 15-year-olds with statements and percentages of this age group achieving examination successes.

 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) made it clear that, when Members are meeting Ministers or others on topics in which they have an interest, the onus is on the Member to declare that interest not the Minister to know (paragraph 63 of Cm 2850). It is not practicable for Ministers and officials to vet requests for meetings against the Register of Members' Interests. Should evidence of non-declaration emerge, or contravention of the Resolution of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, the matter would be brought to the attention of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards.

 The First Report from the Committee on Standards in Public Life (Cm 2850) recognised the value of enabling Members to retain interests outside the House, provided these were properly declared, both in the Register of Members' Interests and on other occasions. Subject to these requirements, and to the rules of the House relating to delegations to Ministers, Members are free to seek meetings with Ministers and officials, who will consider such requests alongside the many other approaches from individuals and organisations concerned to press their own interests or those of others.

 The Defence Medical Services (DMS) is an efficient organisation staffed ny dedicated personnel who provide a high standard of medical care. I am well aware that there are, however, serious shortages in manpower and we are looking urgently at measures to improve recruitment and retention. In this context, I hope very soon to be in a position to respond to the recent report by the House of Commons Defence Select Committee.
<P>

<a name="70714w14.html_para0">The Government have recently accepted the recommendations of the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB) which bring medical and dental officers' pay more closely into line with that of their NHS colleagues. In addition, pensions will, from April 1997, be based on the new medical and dental pay scales rather than combatant pay. We hope that these changes will improve the attractiveness of a career in the DMS. The future structure and organisation of the DMS, will of course, need to reflect the outcome of the Strategic Defence Review.

<a name="70714w14.html_para1">The figures given are for individual training to ensure that our people are fully equipped to meet the tasks placed upon them. They do not include collective continuation training, which is an ongoing requirement to maintain operational effectiveness. The training requirement is carefully planned to allow for flexibility without wastage and is being met through the single service training agencies and by some tri-service defence schools.

<i>(b)</i> the number of hospital personnel who would deploy on operations, in 34 Field Hospital's current role in support of the Joint Rapid Deployment Force (JRDF), would depend on the composition of the force that is to deploy and the size of the hospital that is required to support that force. The following table illustrates the number of medical personnel that deploy with a hospital according to the number of beds and surgical teams the force will require, which in turn is dependant on the nature of the operation. The different requirements for beds and surgical teams are grouped into four categories.

 Information on the numbers of personnel engaged in humanitarian projects is not held centrally. However, in the former Yugoslavia 26 Service personnel work full-time on a range of humanitarian projects funded by the Department for International Development. Other humanitarian tasks are undertaken as the need arises. According to available records, on 1 July 1997 approximately 100 service personnel were assisting in flood relief operations in the Moray area of Scotland. On the same date HMS Liverpool and RFA Black Rover were in the vicinity of the island of Montserrat to provide any necessary assistance in the wake of the volcanic eruption. Parties were put ashore to assist in the construction of additional emergency facilities. It is likely that individual or small groups of service and civilian personnel were also taking part in humanitarian projects as a result of local initiatives.

MOD occupation is planned to cease in mid-1999 on completion of the decommissioning of JASON, the small teaching reactor. The Greenwich Foundation for the Royal Naval college is negotiating with the Director of Greenwich hospital on the terms of a lease by which it will hold the site, with potential occupants, and is working closely with staffs in my Department and in the Department of National Heritage, with the aim of taking over the site progressively as MOD use ceases.

 Article 48 of the International Telecommunication Union Convention allows members complete freedom with regard to military radio installations, except that these should as far as possible observe statutory provisions relative to giving assistance in case of distress and to measures to prevent harmful interference, and regulations concerning the types of emission and the frequencies to be used.

 There is no security of tenure agreement in place at RAF Menwith Hill. The assurances that were given to the US authorities in 1955 and again in 1976 that the site would be made available to the US Forces by Her Majesty's Government for a period of 21 years, and which are known as the security of tenure arrangements, were given to facilitate the commitment of US funding to the station.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w16.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Under the terms of the agreements that we have with the US authorities, the US visiting forces are subject to the laws of the UK in the same way as their British counterparts and this includes respecting the provisions of the Interception of Communications Act.

 RAF Menwith Hill is a Crown freehold site belonging to the Ministry of Defence. The designation RAF Menwith Hill came into effect on 19 February 1996. This was simply an administrative change to bring the base into line with other RAF sites made available by the Ministry of Defence to the United States Government.

[7616]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The NATO Status of Forces Agreement establishes a mutual waiver under which Contracting Parties will not claim from each other if the damaged property was owned and used by its Armed Forces. If, however, such damage results from reckless acts or reckless omissions, wilful misconduct or gross negligence of a contracting party, the costs of any liability will be borne by that party alone.
<P>

<a name="70714w16.html_para3">The cost of claims for damage from third parties are shared between the relevant contracting parties on a ration of 75 per cent. : 25 per cent.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mrs. Beckett: </B> 
 Lord Simon's trust holdings have been in a discretionary trust since they were established. He has had no sole right of decision on these investments, and will have no power of decision in future. Lord Simon decided to transfer his non-trust holdings into a blind trust in accordance with guidance in "Questions of Procedures for Ministers" on his appointment as Minister for Trade and Competitiveness in Europe and set in hand the necessary arrangements. The legal structure of this transfer was proposed on 18 June. Legal finalisation is now proceeding. Lord Simon refrained from giving any trading instructions to his bank in respect of any of these investments following his appointment.

1. All figures are derived from the NHS Executive's Quarterly Monitoring system. Figures for 1995-96 have been adjusted to estimate the effects of definitional and boundary changes to allow direct comparison with 1996-97 information.<P>

2. The figures relate to activity commissioned using NHS funds by health commissions in 1995-96 and health authorities in 1996-97. This includes activity in private hospitals and NHS hospitals outside England, but excludes private patients and patients from outside England treated in English hospitals.<P>

3. The figures are on a different basis to the long standing series published annually in "Ordinary and day case admissions for England". This annual series is based on activity reported by NHS hospital and community Trusts and includes private patients and patients from outside England.<P>

4. Quarter 1 covers the three-month period of April, May and June. The subsequent quarters cover each three-month period thereafter.<P>

5. Non-elective finished consultant episodes comprise largely of all episodes during a patient spell in hospital which began either with an emergency admission or with a transfer from another hospital.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w20.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Jack: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what factors underlie the rise in his Department's expenditure on medical negligence between 1996-97 and 1997-98. [6802]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 It is too early in the financial year for there to be any figures for 1997-98 with which to make comparisons. Estimated costs to the National Health Service of clinical negligence claims in fact fell in 1995-96 to &#163;149.1 million from &#163;160 million in 1994-95.
<P>

<a name="70714w20.html_para0">Increases in clinical negligence expenditure in previous years should not be taken as an indication that the National Health Service is failing. Rather, patients are developing a better understanding of the treatment and services available to them, and a greater awareness of their rights to compensation when something does, unfortunately, go wrong.

[7133]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w20.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 The Department has conducted an audit of all its computer systems and produced a high level plan to address the problem. The Department is committed to having all business critical systems fully compliant by the Central Information Technology Unit recommended deadline.
<P>

<a name="70714w20.html_para1">The work programme is being co-ordinated by the Department's head of applications development and support who reports to the Departmental Information Systems Steering Committee on the Year 2000 issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if money released in the budget Statement for the financial year 1998-99 for NHS expenditure can be used directly or indirectly so as to enable <i>(a)</i> health authorities and <i>(b)</i> NHS Trusts to (i) reduce their deficits in 1997-98 and (ii) carry such deficits forward. [7723]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 Health Authority allocations for 1998-99 will be announced in the autumn. These cannot be spent in 1997-98. However, knowledge of the resources available in 1998-99 will help health authorities and trusts to plan their financial management of 1997-98 with more confidence and influence their decisions.
<P>
<P>

<a name="70714w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 National Health Service trusts have the one statutory duty to break even taking one year with another. If a trust reports a deficit in its accounts it will be expected to recover the deficit over an agreed timescale.

[7757]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The factors which underlay the health authority deficits reported in 1996-97 include overspends resulting from extra-contractual referrals, general practitioner fundholder overspends and the need for service changes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70714w20.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Jack: </B>

<a name="70714w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is health authorities rather than National Health Service trusts who are responsible for joint commissioning with social service departments. Social care, health and housing are becoming increasingly inter-related and this needs to be reflected both in the planning and commissioning of services and in the care package delivered to individuals.

1. All figures are derived from the NHS Executive's Quarterly Monitoring system. Figures for 1995-96 have been adjusted to estimate the effects of definitional and boundary changes to allow direct comparison with 1996-97 information.<P>

2. The figures relate to activity commissioned using NHS funds by health commissions in 1995-96 and health authorities in 1996-97. This includes activity in private hospitals and NHS hospitals outside England, but excludes private patients and patients from outside England treated in English hospitals.<P>

3. The figures are on a different basis to the long standing series published annually in "Ordinary and day case admissions for England". This annual series is based on activity reported by NHS hospital and community Trusts and includes private patients and patients from outside England.<P>

4. Non-elective finished consultant episodes comprise largely of all episodes during a patient spell in hospital which began either with an emergency admission or with a transfer from another hospital.<P>

 People are not liable to pay national insurance contributions for the period of their imprisonment, but they can maintain their record for a basic state retirement pension by paying voluntary contributions for that period at any time before the end of the sixth year following the year in which it ended. The cost of the contributions may be included in claims for compensation under the statutory or ex gratia schemes for people who have been wrongfully imprisoned.

 The use of these beans in Europe have been approved on safety grounds following a thorough scientific assessment. There is therefore no reason to restrict their import. Under World Trade Organisation rules it is not possible for Governments to demand the segregation of genetically modified (GM) crops which have been approved as safe. However, we will be pressing at a European level for all foods which may contain GM ingredients to be labelled to indicate this even where, as in the case of these soya beans, segregation has not taken place.
