The Agricultural Wages Board as a non-departmental public body was last reviewed in 1999. There is no longer a requirement to undertake reviews at regular intervals and further reviews will be undertaken by this Department as necessary to confirm that the Board is delivering high quality services efficiently and effectively.

Following the last review of the Board we announced that some aspects of the Board&#039;s operation would be modernised. We plan to introduce these changes through a Regulatory Reform Order. We do not intend 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jul 2004 : Column 240W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
to reduce the protection given to agricultural workers. However, one of our objectives will be to align the operation of the Agricultural Minimum Wage legislation and general employment law as closely as possible. This will lessen the burden on employers in agriculture and allow them to benefit from the more flexible approach available under the National Minimum Wage legislation (including the revised output work provisions that will be introduced in October).

The Food and Farming Minister Lord Whitty met representatives of the NFU and the Transport and General Workers Union to discuss detailed proposals in January 2003 and November/December 2004. This issue was also raised in a meeting with members of the Transport and General Workers Union on 24 June. A consensus on the way forward is now emerging and we hope to bring forward more detailed proposals for changes to the Agricultural Wages legislation before the end of the year.

 Sir Don Curry estimated that implementation of the recommendations in the report of the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food would cost in the region of an extra &#163;500 million over the following three years.

<p>
<a name="40721w01.html_para6">
The Government&#039;s Strategy for Sustainable Farming and Food (SSFF), which builds on the work of the Curry Commission, was launched in December 2002. As part of the 2002 Spending Review, the Government announced a sum of &#163;500 million to implement the strategy. This is in addition to existing spending by Defra and other Government Departments which is already being used to deliver aspects of the strategy.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w01.html_para7">
The additional funding provided covers a number of major aspects of the strategy. These include the new Environmental Stewardship Scheme (Entry Level and Higher Level) and the IT system to underpin all the England Rural Develop Programme (ERDP) schemes; improvements in livestock traceability and other major animal health and welfare measures; and new food chain initiatives such as the Food Chain Centre and English Farming and Food Partnerships.
</p>

<a name="40721w01.html_para8">
Regional delivery of the strategy will be facilitated by many public body and industry representatives and these organisations will work together with both resource and funding support to deliver the vision set out in the strategy. They are making use of Government grants, industry support and the resources of Government Offices and Regional Development Agencies, as well as other Government bodies participating in regional steering groups. Existing support programmes, including the ERDP have been targeted to deliver SSFF regional action plans. Hitherto, land-based scheme budgets have not been managed on a regional basis, but they will be in future when the new ERDP IT system is rolled-out next year.

Given the number of public and industry bodies contributing to regional delivery, it is not possible to quantify precisely the level of support available to fund regional delivery. Implementation of SSFF is one of the core tasks of the Government Offices and Regional Development Agencies, and their funding from Defra reflects this. Funding for the Government Offices is provided directly by Defra. The current Defra contribution to the RDA &#039;single pot&#039;, administered by DTI, is to enable RDAs to address rural productivity issues, which are a key factor in achieving the outcomes of the national Sustainable Food and Farming Strategy. In addition, Defra is making a further &#163;1.5 million available to the RDAs in the current financial year to assist with the implementation of regional delivery plans. New tasking arrangements for RDAs, which will take effect from April 2005, will include specific reference to contributing to delivering a customer-focused, competitive and sustainable farming and food industry.

 Defra has received over 3,000 inquiries from small-scale egg producers on the Registration of Laying Flocks Order and the Egg Marketing Regulations. All producers must register with departments in order to obtain an identifying code. Currently small producers with less than 350 birds are exempt from this requirement, provided that the eggs are ungraded and sold direct to the final consumer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w02.html_para1">
Because of enforcement difficulties in other member states, it was agreed in November 2003 that part of the derogation from marking for ungraded eggs be removed. From 1 July 2005 farmers selling eggs from their own farms at local public markets will no longer be exempt from the requirement to mark their eggs, irrespective of the number of laying hens kept A Partial Regulatory Impact Assessment was prepared on this in November 2003.

The cost for small producers to purchase the necessary equipment is low. A hand stamp can be bought for around &#163;30. The time required to register as a producer and then to stamp eggs is unlikely to be significant. The majority of small producers appear to be satisfied that the costs are reasonable and can be borne comfortably.
</p>


<p>

Some producers with fewer than 350 laying hens will therefore have to register for the first time, in order to obtain a distinguishing number. This measure had the support of the majority of other member states. Sales in farm shops and door-to-door do however remain exempt.

</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w06.html_para3">
The first fact finding exercise took place last year and investigated the wood packaging waste sector.

However, some assumptions were being made, for example about the tonnages of packaging waste in mixed loads, that were unrealistic or were made on the basis of insufficient evidence. The team therefore recommended that the amount of wood packaging waste recycled in 2002 should be reduced by 76,400 tonnes. This was done.

The system will provide more timely, efficient and accessible data than is currently available, helping to monitor progress against landfill directive targets. The Environment Agency has played an important role in helping to steer this project.

<p>
<a name="40721w06.html_para16">
Our medium-term aim is to develop an accessible central database of current (and where available historic) data on all waste streams, working closely with the Environment Agency.

 The issue of state aid has been raised in the negotiations between the European Community and the United States over a transatlantic Open Aviation Area.

<p><a name="40721w07.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 In 1996&#150;97 the Department&#039;s restaurant services were provided by an outside contractor and the contract attracted a subsidy of &#163;25,000. The Department also paid the accommodation and utilities costs. These were borne within the overall costs for the building (so separate figures are not available). The contract was re-let in 2000, it was let on a self-financing basis. This gave the contractor freedom to operate commercially and it obviated the requirement for a cash subsidy. The Department still pays the accommodation and utilities costs. Another contract has recently been let still under the same self-financing principle.

[184129]</p>








<p><a name="40721w07.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Neither we nor the CAA maintain a central record of complaints about the safety of particular airlines. We receive very few complaints from the public about the safety of airlines and these are dealt with as they arise. Appropriate action is taken if a complaint reveals any non-compliance with required standards.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w07.html_para2">
Article 117 of the Air Navigation Order establishes a Mandatory Occurrence Reporting (MOR) scheme for safety related incidents. The purpose of the scheme is to 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jul 2004 : Column 264W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
ensure that the CAA is advised of hazardous or potentially hazardous incidents and defects, and that knowledge of these occurrences is disseminated so that other persons and organisations may learn from them. This enables an assessment to be made by those concerned of the safety implications of each occurrence.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w07.html_para3">
Occurrence reports are an important part of our open reporting culture and the fact that an occurrence report has been made is not necessarily an adverse indication about the safety standards of an airline. The MOR scheme aims to ensure the safety of the UK industry but some reports, mainly relating to occurrences en route in UK airspace, do involve foreign aircraft.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w07.html_para4">
The tables, which have been placed in the Libraries of the House, set out the number of aircraft the subject of mandatory occurrence reports by state of registry and aircraft type for the years 2002 to 2004. Slight discrepancies exist between the figures because of the way data is recorded. Section 23 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982 constrains the Civil Aviation Authority&#039;s ability to release information relating to individual companies that it receives under the MOR scheme. I therefore consider that it would be inappropriate for me to undermine those constraints by publishing a list of airlines whose aircraft have been the subject of mandatory occurrence reports.

<p><a name="40721w11.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 20 July 2004]:</i> DFID is addressing the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Haiti primarily through its contribution to the Global Fund for AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, and through its shareholding in the World Bank. Both organisations provide grants to Haiti&#039;s National Programme for HIV/AIDS.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w11.html_para0">
The Global Fund approved two grants to Haiti amounting to US $25 million in late 2002. As a result, the National Programme accelerated its delivery of treatment and care to a target group of 500,000 poor people. So far, US $17 million has been disbursed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w11.html_para1">
The World Bank agreed a US$ 2.9 million grant to Haiti in early 2003 for the prevention and control of infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS. The grant is being implemented with the support of the Pan-American Health Organisation (PAHO) and the World Health Organisation (WHO). In addition, DFID has provided support to WHO/PAHO to help kick-start the provision of affordable Anti-Retro-Viral medicines globally, from which Haiti will benefit.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development by how much and by what proportion UK international aid spending on water and sanitation will change in the next three years.  [185473]</p>








<p><a name="40721w11.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 Total bilateral expenditure on water and sanitation represents approximately 6 per cent. of the Department for International Development&#039;s (DFID&#039;s) total bilateral aid budget&#151;about &#163;85 million per year over the last three years. DFID channels a significant proportion of its assistance 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jul 2004 : Column 278W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
through multilateral channels such as the European Union, the World Bank and UN organisations (&#163;1.3 billion in 2001&#150;02): of this DFID&#039;s contribution to water and sanitation is estimated at around &#163;40 million per annum. DFID supports international initiatives aimed at raising the profile of water and sanitation and achieving better coordination. These include the Water Supply and Sanitation Collaborative Council; the Water and Sanitation Programme (attached to the World Bank); and the Global Water Partnership.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w11.html_para5">
DFID does not budget on a sectoral basis. DFID&#039;s work and resource allocation is shaped by developing country priorities, notably through support to their poverty reduction strategies; by what other donors are doing; and by our comparative advantage. It is therefore not possible to predict with accuracy water and sanitation sector expenditures for future years. DFID recently published a Water Action Plan that outlines our commitment to ensuring that the water and sanitation targets are given the same international priority as the other MDGs.

<p><a name="40721w11.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID is planning to spend &#163;7.1 million during the next financial year to tackle HIV/AIDS. Most of this is to support the Government of Kenya&#039;s National Strategic Plan for HIV/AIDS. This strategy will work alongside non-governmental agencies to ensure that HIV/AIDS concerns are considered in all relevant Government activity. Among other initiatives, DFID is supporting the equitable delivery of Anti Retroviral Treatment (ART), including a communication strategy to reduce misuse, and Home Based Care especially for orphans. Alongside the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), DFID is also funding the social marketing of condoms, especially in rural areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w11.html_para6">
In education, DFID has been training teachers to teach children about HIV/AIDS. This programme was found to delay the age at which both girls and boys have sex and increased the use of condoms by girls. DFID is therefore increasing this activity and expects to cover 5,000 schools over the next year.

 Last year, DFID&#039;s development assistance to Kenya was &#163;29 million. This year our allocation has increased to &#163;37 million. DFID&#039;s Country Assistance Plan makes provision to increase our development assistance to &#163;50 million by 2005&#150;06, but final decisions will depend on progress on the Kenyan Government&#039;s Economic Recovery Strategy, including its efforts to tackling corruption.

 DFID supports development work in North West Kenya through partners such as Oxfam and Water Aid Kenya (locally known as Maji na Ufanisi). This work includes long-term development and short-term humanitarian assistance carried out in close collaboration with the Kenya authorities and with local communities. The long-term development approach involves strengthening local organisations to press the Government to provide basic services, including roads and water, and at the same time building community capacity to provide services such as bore hole maintenance at local level.

Part of Oxfam&#039;s current work in response to the famine in the North West (which is supported by DFID) is the provision of water for domestic use (construction and rehabilitation of bore holes and pan/dams, well protection and other water points) for both domestic and livestock use. As a result of this, the pressure on water in the North West has been reduced even during this period of drought and famine.

Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8 million out of 3.8 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2002.

 The complex array of more than 100 DTI business support schemes that existed at the time of the DTI Review in 2001 has been replaced with a tighter, more targeted package of support based on nine business support products. The Department&#039;s work to transform its support to business specifically looked at the issue of overlap and duplication and this was addressed so that the new product set are broad in their scope and avoid duplication. The Department&#039;s externally led Investment Committee continues to provide independent scrutiny to ensure our investments in business support products deliver the economic and customer benefits we intend, and that we take action to address any weaknesses identified through rigorous evaluation. This work extends to ensuring that there is no overlap or duplication in DTI&#039;s business support offering.

With regard to regional development agencies (RDAs), DTI and the RDAs are working together with the specific aim of avoiding any overlap on the provision of business support products.

<i>Procurement</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para8">
DTI will aim to achieve savings by improving procurement through a combination of developing and implementing better purchasing practice, making better use of resources within technical and economic research, centralising marketing operations and moving to e-procurement, and savings on rent increases and building service costs by rationalising DTI&#039;s estate. This rationalisation involves reducing headquarters in London from six to three buildings over the Spending Review period.

<i>Back Office Rationalisation and Abolition of Posts</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para10">
My Department has developed plans that will enable it to deliver more efficiently DTI&#039;s priorities and responsibilities, as reflected in the spending plans announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer last week. These plans will drive forward efficiencies in all areas of my Department&#039;s work, including:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">the rationalisation and streamlining of all our &#039;back office&#039; services, including the processing of routine financial and personnel work and a reduction in the number of office support service posts following rationalisation of the Department&#039;s London estate from six buildings to three; and</p>

<i>Business Support</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para13">
DTI has conducted a review of its Business Support schemes ahead of the Spending Review with a view to working to clear high-level strategic objectives, increasing value created through the investment of taxpayers&#039; funds, rigorous monitoring and evaluation, and improving the customer experience in dealing with DTI. Over 100 schemes have been rationalised into 10 new products, the last one of which will be introduced in 2005. The effectiveness of the new products and resultant efficiency savings will be realised over the Spending Review period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para14">
Savings in the order of &#163;20 million are projected by the end of the Spending Review period, as a result of closing inefficient schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para15">
In addition, DTI is rationalising its use of third party contractors to deliver the new Business Support products. By consolidation of the contractor portfolio and more effective procurement, further cost savings of approximately &#163;4 million a year are anticipated over the Spending Review period as the DTI&#039;s commitment to legacy schemes is exhausted. The level of support provided to business is expected to remain unchanged at around &#163;500 million per annum.

<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para16">
<i>Agencies and NDPBs</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para17">
All of DTI&#039;s agencies and non-departmental public bodies are tasked with delivering efficiency gains over the Spending Review 2004 period. Over the Spending Review period, DTI expects the agencies and NDPBs to achieve some &#163;15 million savings, the majority of which is cashable. It is anticipated that these savings will be achieved through a combination of continued delivery and increased output within a climate of reduced funding, reduced estate expenditure and reduced unit cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para18">
As Companies House, Patent Office are trading funds, and NWML is a net funded agency, they do not appear on DTI&#039;s Expenditure Limit and their savings are not claimed against the Department&#039;s 2.5 per cent. annual efficiency savings target. These bodies are, however, still expected to generate efficiency gains which 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jul 2004 : Column 291W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
they intend to achieve through a number of measures i.e. e-delivery, reduced staff costs, and increased output/reduced processing times.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para19">
Other than a very small number of Office of Science and Technology posts moving to the Research Councils in Swindon, there are no plans to meet DTI staff reduction targets by relocating posts from the core Department to sponsored agencies.

<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para20">
<i>Audit of inefficient spend</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w14.html_para21">
DTI is committed to ensuring that all aspects of the Department, including its agencies and non-departmental bodies operate efficiently both now and going forward. We have just completed an efficiency project, reviewing efficiency in DTI, which was scrutinised by the Gershon Review. We continually review our activities as part of annual business planning to deliver greater value for money. We therefore have no plan to commission an in-depth audit of past activities&#151;to do so would be an inefficient use of resources.

 Sir Peter Gershon&#039;s report on his review of public sector efficiency &quot;Releasing resources to the front line&quot; sets out agreed efficiency targets for all Government Departments including DTI.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para6">
<i>Procurement</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para7">
DTI will aim to achieve savings by improving procurement through a combination of developing and implementing better purchasing practice, making better use of resources within technical and economic research, centralising marketing operations and moving to e-procurement, and savings on rent increases and building service costs by rationalising DTI&#039;s estate. This rationalisation involves reducing headquarters in London from six to three buildings over the Spending Review period.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para8">
<i>Back Office rationalisation and abolition of posts</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para9">
My department has developed plans that will enable it to deliver more efficiently DTI&#039;s priorities and responsibilities, as reflected in the spending plans announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer last week. These plans will drive forward efficiencies in all areas of my Department&#039;s work, including:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">the rationalisation and streamlining of all our &quot;back office&quot; services, including the processing of routine financial and personnel work and a reduction in the number of office support service posts following rationalisation of the Department&#039;s London estate from six buildings to three; and</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">the adoption of a new approach to policy work involving the more effective prioritisation of policy projects and the centralised handling of routine policy inquiries and correspondence.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para10">
In conjunction with our estate rationalisation strategy, staff will also operate within a flexible workspace arrangement whereby there will be eight desks available for every 10 staff.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para11">
<i>Business Support</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para12">
DTI has conducted a review of its Business Support schemes ahead of the Spending Review with a view to working to clear high-level strategic objectives, increasing value created through the investment of taxpayers&#039; funds, rigorous monitoring and evaluation, and improving the customer experience in dealing with DTI. Over 100 schemes have been rationalised into 10 new products, the last one of which will be introduced in 2005. The effectiveness of the new products and resultant efficiency savings will be realised over the Spending Review period.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jul 2004 : Column 295W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para13">
Savings in the order of &#163;20 million are projected by the end of the Spending Review period, as a result of closing inefficient schemes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para14">
In addition, DTI is rationalising its use of third party contractors to deliver the new Business Support products. By consolidation of the contractor portfolio and more effective procurement, further cost savings of approximately &#163;4 million a year are anticipated over the Spending Review period as the DTI&#039;s commitment to legacy schemes is exhausted. The level of support provided to business is expected to remain unchanged at around &#163;500 million per annum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para15">
<i>Agencies and NDPBs</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para16">
All of DTI&#039;s agencies and non-departmental public bodies are tasked with delivering efficiency gains over the Spending Review 2004 period. Over the Spending Review period, DTI expects the agencies and NDPBs to achieve some &#163;15 million savings, the majority of which is cashable. It is anticipated that these savings will be achieved through a combination of continued delivery and increased output within a climate of reduced funding, reduced estate expenditure and reduced unit cost.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para17">
As Companies House, Patent Office are trading funds, and NWML is a net funded agency, they do not appear on DTI&#039;s Expenditure Limit and their savings are not claimed against the Department&#039;s 2.5 per cent. annual efficiency savings target. These bodies are however still expected to generate efficiency gains which they intend to achieve through a number of measures i.e. e-delivery, reduced staff costs, and increased output/reduced processing times.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para18">
Other than a very small number of Office of Science and Technology posts moving to the Research Councils in Swindon, there are no plans to meet DTI staff reduction targets by relocating posts from the core Department to sponsored agencies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para19">
<i>Audit of inefficient spend</i>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w15.html_para20">
DTI is committed to ensuring that all aspects of the Department, including its agencies and non-departmental bodies operate efficiently both now and going forward. We have just completed an efficiency project, reviewing efficiency in DTI, which was scrutinised by the Gershon Review. We continually review our activities as part of annual business planning to deliver greater value for money. We therefore have no plan to commission an in-depth audit of past activities&#151;to do so would be an inefficient use of resources.

Where central and local government departments and their agencies are holding public meetings as a service to the public, they are covered by the service provider provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) and have legal duties under Part 3 of the Act to make reasonable adjustments to enable disabled people to make use of them. In some instances, public meetings may form part of the function of a central or local Government department or its agencies. Currently, the access duties under Part 3 of the DDA do not extend to functions of public bodies. However, a proposal in the draft Disability Discrimination Bill would bring all such functions within the scope of Part 3 of the Act.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w26.html_para5">
The Government are currently running a campaign to remind service providers of their duties under the DDA. The campaign focuses on the new duties being introduced from 1 October 2004, which require service providers to make reasonable adjustments to physical features of premises which make access to the service impossible or unreasonably difficult for disabled people.

The Disability Rights Commission (DRC), which is a non-departmental public body of the Department for Work and Pensions, published a revised statutory Code of Practice in 2002 explaining the service provider provisions, including the new duties from October 2004. In addition, the DRC has been working in partnership with the Local Government Association to raise awareness of the implications of the service provider duties for local authorities and to develop guidance on implementing the DDA duties within local authority service provision.

 The identity cards scheme will be an inclusive scheme, designed to cover everyone who has the right to be in the United Kingdom. It will show that everyone belongs to our society whether they were born here, have chosen to make their home here or are just staying for a while to study or work. It will help people prove their identity to access services such as free health treatment or benefits and give everyone confidence that legal migration will not result in increased fraudulent use of hard-pressed public services. If our communities have confidence in our immigration controls, they will be more welcoming of new arrivals, helping to promote a more cohesive society.

<p>
<a name="40721w27.html_para2">
The identity cards scheme itself is non-discriminatory as it is intended to cover everyone in the United Kingdom for longer than a specified period (three months). The scheme will not, in general, require people to obtain a specific, additional document as it will be designed to make use of existing documents that will be designated as identity cards. Most members of the identity cards &quot;family&quot; will be enhanced versions of existing identity documents which are very widely held familiar documents that are already used as proof of identity.

A partial race impact assessment was published with the draft Bill (CM 6178). This was developed following consultation with representatives of black and minority ethnic groups and research undertaken with these groups. Further assessments will be made as the design of the scheme develops, focusing mainly on how the introduction of ID cards affects the use of existing police powers, how the scheme is administered and its use in relation to access to services and employment.

 Yes, all payments for passport services are processed as soon as the application is received. There are good reasons for this.

 The compensation policy of the UK Passport Services (UKPS) which reflects good practice guidance issued by the Cabinet Office and the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, is to reimburse the reasonable out of pocket expenses incurred by customers as a direct consequence of clear errors or omissions by its staff. It is not UKPS&#039;s normal policy to make compensation payments for loss of enjoyment, distress or inconvenience arising from such errors.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what progress was made at the recent talks at Hassop Hall with his European counterparts on anti-terrorism measures.  [184265]</p>









<p><a name="40721w28.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w28.html_para0">
This question has been referred to me as I hosted the meeting at Hassop Hall with my Interior Ministry counterparts from France, Germany, Italy and Spain. We discussed a range of issues that relate to co-operation on counter-terrorism. It was a very useful meeting covering a number of areas of joint interest.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w28.html_para1">
ID cards can allow travel throughout the EU, so we need to ensure that security standards are on a par with those relating to EU visas, residence permits and passports.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w28.html_para2">
We felt that it would be important to look at strengthening ID card security, specifically measures on the incorporation of biometric identifiers, and methods to ensure a more robust issuing procedure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w28.html_para3">
Following on from this we felt that strong support should be given to the Commission&#039;s proposals for further action in facilitating the exchange of information on lost, stolen and forged passports between member states and Interpol. This would be on a basis consistent with G8 and ICAO initiatives.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w28.html_para4">
We discussed how there could be benefits in Europol focusing on a number of clearly defined tasks in the counter-terrorism field. This could be in addition to its main role on organised crime. Analyses of the links between organised crime and terrorism, and the flows of finances that support terrorist organisations were considered. We particularly welcomed presidency ideas concerned with the disruption of these flows.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w28.html_para5">
Ensuring our security through co-operation is a key goal for all member states. I believe that through discussion and working together closely we can give impetus to these important areas of work in the EU and deliver real practical outcomes.

 The national health service improvement programme, &quot;Putting People at the Heart of Public Services&quot;, sets out the commitment that the NHS will build a responsive service tailored to people living with long-term conditions including allergies. There are already substantial initiatives which will help patients with long term diseases, including:

<a name="40721w31.html_para5">
It is the role of primary care trusts, in partnership with local stakeholders, to decide what services to provide to meet the health needs of their populations, including those with allergies. They are best placed to understand local health care needs and commission services to meet them.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40721w31.html_para6">
Information on the average length of time a patient waits to see a NHS allergy specialist is not held centrally. This is because a patient with an allergy can be seen by a range of specialists including dermatologists, immunologists and respiratory disease physicians, as well as allergists. We expect that any patient being referred for a first outpatient appointment by their general practitioner should be seen within the national 17 week maximum waiting time.

<p><a name="40721w33.html_spnew0"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 The implications of setting up an expert patients programme in the United Kingdom were assessed by the expert patients taskforce set up in 2000. It concluded that such a programme had the potential to create a cadre of expert patients&#151;people who have the confidence, skills, information and knowledge to play a central role in the management of life with chronic diseases and to minimise the impact of disease on their lives. From the evidence base available it also concluded that the tangible benefits would include:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">reduced severity of symptoms;</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">significant decrease in pain;</p>

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>21 Jul 2004 : Column 373W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
a survey of non-contracted VHCCC cases in order to establish a benchmark to compare with contracted VHCCC cases. However VHCCC cases are by their nature, long and complex and their attributes vary greatly from case to case. It will therefore be some time before a sufficient number of contracted cases have been completed before sensible comparisons can be made between contract and non-contract cases and before a reliable estimate of the savings can be made. However, the LSC calculates that during 2003&#150;04 savings of around &#163;26.5 million were achieved.

<p>
<a name="40721w36.html_para5">
Prior to 2003&#150;04 a pilot scheme was operated. While relatively few contracts were managed during this period the LSC estimates that savings of around &#163;7 million were realised.

 Our estimate for the annual running cost of the Judicial Appointments Commission is &#163;8.5 million per year, reducing to &#163;8 million, from 2008&#150;09 due to its planned partial relocation out of London and the south-east.

 The Constitutional Reform Bill, currently before Parliament, will establish a Judicial Appointments Commission for England and Wales.

The Legal Services Commission cannot separate the cost of immigration and nationality cases from asylum cases, but the vast majority are thought to relate to asylum. The substantial increase in legal aid expenditure has been due, in large part, to the introduction of legal aid for representation at appeal, efforts to reduce the backlog of asylum cases and increases in asylum seeker numbers. Cash figures are expected to remain high in 2004&#150;05 as work continues to clear immigration and asylum backlogs.

We expect that costs will fall in subsequent years as a result of the current lower intake of asylum seekers and measures to control spending.
