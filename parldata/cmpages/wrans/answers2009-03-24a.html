 We welcome the steps the government of Nepal has taken towards the establishment of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) as mandated by the Comprehensive Peace Agreement. We have urged them to ensure that the TRC bill is drafted on a consensus basis, so that all those involved in and affected by the conflict share ownership of the process, and that it is compliant with international human rights standards. Facing up to and dealing with the human rights abuses committed by both sides during the conflict is the key to concluding the peace process and laying the foundations for a sustainable democracy based on the rule of law and respect for human rights.

We and other international partners have voiced our concerns about this and about the recent recruitment campaigns by both the Nepal Army and the PLA in violation of the CPA. We acknowledge that integration of the two armies will be a difficult issue to resolve, but have told the government that a failure to make progress risks endangering the peace process and that we, UN agencies and other donors stand ready to assist.</p>

 We continue to have concerns about the human rights of Tibetans both in Tibet and the surrounding regions. Most recently, my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary took up the question of Tibet with Foreign Minister Jang Jiechi at the UK-China Summit in February. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister also raised it with Premier Wen Jiabao at that Summit. As Minister of State for Asia I have also raised Tibet during talks in Beijing with both Assistant Foreign Minister Wu Hongbo and Vice- Minister Sita of the United Front Work Department on 20 January.

 We consider that it would have been inappropriate to negotiate on this matter with the Chinese Government before setting out the position to this House. The change of policy reflects practical reality and is justified in its own right. By setting out our position unambiguously on the status of Tibet it allows us to speak clearly on the subject of human rights there, without allowing others to claim that we are denying China sovereignty over a large part of its territory.</p>

This is completed on a monthly basis with information being passed to the central finance teams and subsequently, in a summarised format, to the Department&#146;s Executive Committee.</p>

The workforce subgroup has developed a survey of neonatal workforce, which it has sent to the national health service. The survey results are currently being analysed and the taskforce is due to report in June 2009.</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_403"><a name="90324w0011.htm_para6"><a name="09032470000287">This assessment will include a dating scan that will be used to calculate the gestational age of the foetus during pregnancy and at birth. As more women benefit from these assessments the accuracy of recorded information on gestational age should improve and together with this the plausibility of weight for age data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_404"><a name="90324w0011.htm_para7"><a name="09032470000288">A maternity data quality dashboard was published by the NHS Information Centre for health and social care (IC) in February 2009 for use by national health service trusts and commissioners, enabling them better to monitor progress using the data they have submitted. The dashboard specifically identifies gestation length and birth weight as data fields. Increased local scrutiny of this data should also encourage improvements in data quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_405"><a name="90324w0011.htm_para8"><a name="09032470000289">In addition, the NHS IC is taking steps to improve the accuracy of maternity data in hospital episode statistics (HES). This should have a positive effect on other information in this area such as that used by the Office for National Statistics to link to registration data.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="90324w0011.htm_para9"><a name="09032470000290">The IC now contacts NHS trusts directly when they submit data for HES which contains a high proportion of blank or unknown values in key maternity fields. The IC encourages trusts to investigate why these fields are not being populated and to resubmit data with correct values. The IC has also begun introducing improvements to the annual NHS Maternity Services publication, which includes data on gestational age and birth weight, while ensuring that data problems are transparent so that there is an incentive to improve data quality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="90324w0012.htm_para10"><a name="09032470000533">As at 31 March 2007, 3,400 people aged 0-17 years were registered as deaf in England (4,100 were registered as hard of hearing).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_418"><a name="90324w0012.htm_para11"><a name="09032470000534">Registers of Deaf and Hard of Hearing People (SSDA910) are collected by the NHS Information Centre every three years, and was last collected in 2006-07. This collects the number of people registered as deaf or hard of hearing with councils with social services responsibilities (CSSR).</p>

1. Assignment of episodes to years: Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br>
2. Finished admission episodes: A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
3. Cause code&#151;blunt object, sharp object and gunshot wounds: The cause code is a supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. HES has used the following ICD-10 external cause codes when assault by sharp object and contact with knife, sword or dagger.<br>
X99&#151;Assault by sharp object<br>
W26&#151;Contact with knife, sword or dagger<br>
4. Data quality: hospital episode statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts in England. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
5. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
6. Ungrossed data: Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

This showed the level of local resources used in these services and provides a helpful benchmark for PCTs. However, the resources used for &#145;generalist&#146; palliative care, that is, care which could be provided by any health or social care practitioner, are impossible to determine.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_449"><a name="90324w0015.htm_para1"><a name="09032470001016">Work to develop the strategy showed that money spent in end of life care is not always as well used as it might be. A key aim of the strategy is, therefore, to ensure better use of existing resources. In addition, the Government are investing an extra &#163;286 million in end of life care services over the two years 2009-10 and 2010-11. This will help support those areas, such as training and the development of community services, that need special attention.</p>

 Rent officers review and notify local housing allowance rates for a range of property sizes to local authorities each month. When a person living in the deregulated private rented sector claims housing benefit the local authority will use the appropriate local housing allowance rate, based on the area where the person lives and the size of their household, to determine the maximum amount to be included in the benefit calculation. That maximum amount will not be reviewed until the anniversary of the claim unless the person changes address or a change in the composition of the household affects the number of bedrooms it requires. At the point the maximum amount is reviewed, the local authority will apply the latest local housing allowance rate appropriate to the claim.

Security sector reform helps create a secure environment conducive to other political, economic and social developments, through the reduction of armed violence and crime.

 Security sector reform is a central pillar of the Department for International Development&#146;s (DFID) work on conflict prevention and a key component of our support for post conflict recovery and peace-building. Making people&#146;s lives safer, ending wars, and preventing new wars from starting or re-starting requires a joint effort. To achieve these objectives we work closely with other parts of the UK Government including the FCO and MOD. For example, in Sierra Leone, major DFID, FCO, and MOD investments have built the capacity of the armed forces, police and other bodies to deliver security on the ground.

This estimate is close to the &#163;5 total costs per bed net quoted during the recent Comic Relief appeal. However, costs vary depending on the delivery agent and the quantities being ordered: for example, UNICEF, which buys a very large number of bed nets globally, can command very favourable prices.</p>

However, an example where figures are available is Nigeria, where we are funding the supply of 2.5 million bed nets through the Malaria Consortium. In this case, each bed net costs US$4.46 to buy and ship, with distribution and associated costs of US$1.40 per unit, totalling US$5.86 (about &#163;4 at current exchange rates).</p>

Demand for bed nets is very dependent on the level of knowledge about malaria that prevails in a community, often something that can be encouraged through health education programmes. People in malarial areas need to be informed about the benefits of using bed nets before increased demand develops.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"><a name="90324w0019.htm_para3"><a name="09032470001481">There is a huge need for bed nets across Africa. In 2006, an average of 27 per cent. of African households owned an insecticide treated bed net, but only 17 per cent. of children slept under one. Where malaria is endemic, it is important for all children to sleep under a net. There is wide variation among countries however; around 49 per cent. of children sleep under a net in Gambia whereas in Kenya coverage has, with our help, increased from 7 per cent. in 2004 to 67 per cent. of children in 2006. It is intended that our various programmes that supply bed nets, and similar programmes by national governments and by other donors and NGOs, will considerably increase the availability and usage of bed nets with the aim of making a positive impact on the incidence of malaria in Africa over the next few years.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate he has made of the percentage of the defence budget which will be spent on running costs of the current Trident nuclear deterrent and the procurement of a successor system in the years immediately following the main gate decision to procure new submarines.

 As the December 2006 White Paper, "The Future of the UK's Nuclear Deterrent" (Cm 6994), made clear, our current estimate is that the total procurement costs of the new submarines and associated equipment and infrastructure will be in the region of &#163;15 to 20 billion (at 2006-07 prices) for a four-boat fleet, mainly spread over the period 2012-27.

It is not therefore possible to be sure what the size of the defence budget will be over the timescales involved, but procurement costs are likely on average to be the equivalent of around three per cent. annually of the current defence budget over the main period of expenditure. This is around the same as for the Trident programme.</p>

Coefficients of Variation have been calculated for the latest period as an indication of the quality of the estimates. See Guide to Quality below.<br>
<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220<br>

 The National Centre for Social Research Omnibus Survey asked members of the public about their perceptions of safety from crime while using public transport, personal experiences of antisocial behaviour or crime on public transport. The survey was published on 18 September 2008. In addition we undertook a review of the tools and powers. We are planning to hold events for transport stakeholders and antisocial behaviour to make more effective use of tools and powers. As part of the recently launched Violence Against Women and Girls consultation, we are surveying women's and girls personal safety at night, including local streets and public transport.</p>

 It is not possible to provide a comprehensive figure for the overall cost of removals and deportations in 2008 because there are many different factors which may or may not be involved in the cost of a case (such as detention costs, travel costs, and the cost of escorting the individual in question). We are unable to disaggregate the specific costs and any attempt to do so would incur disproportionate cost.</p>

 The Government wrote to a range of interested organisations on 26 September to seek their views on proposed legislation. We received 67 responses from a variety of organisations representing the voluntary sector, statutory partners, local authorities and representatives of persons involved in prostitution and the lap dancing industry. This was not a formal consultation and we did not indicate to potential respondents that their responses would be published, we therefore do not feel it appropriate to do so, although individual organisations are, of course, free to publicise their own views.</p>

 There is currently no national dedicated identification system for ex-servicemen held in custody, although there are areas of good practice, such as in the case of Everthorpe prison. This will change with the introduction of P&#151;NOMIS IT system which contains specific data entry field for ex-service offenders and trials are underway.

 No prison buildings have actually been assessed as non-compliant with the DDA. All new prisons constructed after the introduction of the DDA have been commissioned to be DDA compliant.

 For the incident on 25 February I was informed on the same day that it had taken place and was ongoing, and then informed it had ended. For other incidents I am always informed about &#145;incidents at height&#146;, whether inside the establishment or on a rooftop. The seriousness of the incident determines how quickly I am informed. There have been two further rooftop incidents at Wymott since 1 January 2006. These took place on 28 June 2007 and 6 October 2008. Measures are in place to further restrict access to the roof. All three prisoners involved in the incidents are subject to disciplinary procedures.</p>

It detailed our plans for a &#145;triple track&#146; approach of tough enforcement, non-negotiable help and support, and early intervention and prevention. It also states our ambition to reduce the rate of young people entering the criminal justice system by one fifth by 2020. This is supported by close to &#163;100 million over the next three years, in addition to the existing investment in children&#146;s and youth services, to support local authorities in making inroads into youth crime locally.</p>

The HPA tested a sample of CFL light bulbs and found that some emitted ultraviolet radiation which could, under certain conditions, expose people above international guidelines. As a result of its findings the HPA issued precautionary advice on 9 October 2008 to the general public concerning the use of open CFLs in close-working situations. The HPA&#146;s advice can be found at:</p>
