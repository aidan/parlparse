<a name="90621w01.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Officials in my Department and other Government Departments are meeting today with representatives from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the International Organisation for Migration, the Refugee Council, the British Red Cross and Refugee Action to discuss how best to facilitate the voluntary return of Kosovar Albanians back to Kosovo. A number of these organisations in the voluntary sector have played a leading role in the reception, care and resettlement of the Kosovar Albanians and are, therefore, clearly well placed to advise on a number of the issues involved in returning them home. I believe we will be in a better position to devise a strategy for return once these initial discussions have taken place.

 The Prison Service does not calculate separately the cost of imprisonment by category of prisoner.
<P>

<a name="90621w01.htm_para0">The information in the table shows the average establishment cost per place in 1998-99 broken down by category of prison. Prisons with multiple functions (for example an adult male prison with a separate young offender wing) are categorised according to their dominant category.
<P>

<a name="90621w01.htm_para1">Establishment costs exclude capital expenditure and head office overheads. For this reason, the figures in the table are not comparable with the provisional Prison Service cost per place Key Performance Indicator figure for 1998-99 of &#163;25,096.
<P>

<a name="90621w01.htm_para2">Figures are provisional and subject to validation by prisons.

 The Government are committed to making sure that policies are inclusive and take full account of the needs and experience of all those affected by them.

<P>

Within this Department we increasingly make use of consultation, research projects and disaggregated statistics to identify the impact of policy upon women.

The UK officials who participated were drawn from the DTI, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Directorate of Civil Nuclear Security.

 We do not expect to change the membership of the Oil and Gas Industry Task Force, which is now preparing its report for publication in September. The Task Force has agreed that a successor group will be needed to ensure that continuing progress is made with the initiatives it is pursuing and it will be discussing what membership would be appropriate for its successor. The discussions will involve those with an interest in the Task Force's work. The Task Force will of course take account of representations made about membership.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures are in place to ensure representation on the Oil and Gas Industry Task Force of parties working in the southern sector of the North Sea oil and gas industry.  [87511]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w02.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The persons invited to join the Task Force were chosen to ensure the membership included a wide range of oil companies, contractors, supplies companies and trade unions active in all sectors of the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). This certainly includes the southern North Sea, where a number of the members have significant interests.
<P>

<a name="90621w02.htm_para8">The Task Force is developing proposals for reducing the cost base of UK oil and gas operations against the background of low oil prices and the particular characteristics of the various sectors of the UKCS. The initiatives developed and advantages gained will be relevant to oil and gas activity in all sectors and, furthermore, will improve the international competitiveness of the UK industry.

 The Task Force has a high level membership drawn from industry and key Government Departments, including oil companies, contractors, suppliers, unions, DTI, Treasury, DETR and the Scottish Office. The membership was intended to reflect the broad spectrum of interest, while also being of manageable size.
<P>

<a name="90621w02.htm_para9">A key objective of the Task Force is to stimulate new oil and gas projects on the UK Continental Shelf; it was therefore necessary to ensure the participation of different types of oil companies with significant UK interests. The choice of the contractors and supplier companies reflects the breadth of the industry, with large, medium and smaller companies contributing at managing director level.

 All House of Commons rates of pay are higher than the national minimum wage. Therefore, no staff of the House have benefited from the introduction of the national minimum wage.

[87466]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w03.htm_spnew2"><B> Mr. Kirkwood </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 June 1999]:</i> There are four groups of House of Commons staff covered by separate pay settlements each year. They are the Senior Commons Staff (SCS), staff in the main structure (Pay Bands A to E), the Refreshment Department Catering Staff and the Works Directorate Craft Staff.
<P>

<a name="90621w03.htm_para0">The pay of the Senior Commons Staff is directly linked to that of the Senior Civil Service. The pay of the other groups is kept broadly in line with civil service rates of pay. The pay awards for staff in the SCS and Pay Bands A to E are performance related, whereas staff in the Craft and Catering Bands are paid a rate for the job.
<P>

<a name="90621w03.htm_para1">In the years 1997-98 and 1998-99, the percentage increases for most of the staff in Pay Bands A to E were higher than those for the SCS Staff. No staff in the SCS pay bands received a percentage increase higher than the highest percentage increases paid in Pay Bands A to E.
<P>

<a name="90621w03.htm_para2">In 1997-98 and 1998-99, the average percentage increases for staff in the Catering and Craft pay bands were higher than the average non-performance (new money) increases, excluding the self-financing performance elements, for the SCS and Bands A to E. Because of the operation of the performance systems, it is not possible to make meaningful comparisons of percentage increases on an individual basis.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer provided on 22 June 1998, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>397.</i> Balances of all Indonesian aid loans were written off in 1979. This was in support of a resolution by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) in 1978, a statement on which was made to the House on 31 July 1978, <i>Official Report,</i> column 25. However, the consequential amount of annual debt relief is currently reported as expenditure in the year in which the payments would have been due. Details are set out in the publication 'Statistics on International Development', a copy of which is available in the Library of the House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w03.htm_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The list of countries eligible for the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt Initiative was agreed by the international community in 1996, and identified the 40 poorest, most indebted countries. However, others may be included in HIPC if a good case can be made. For example, Malawi will now be considered for HIPC debt relief. Being on the list, however, entitles a country only to be considered for HIPC debt relief. Countries which are not part of HIPC can still obtain debt relief from official bilateral creditors who form the Paris club.

 The Driving Standards Agency closely monitors demand for driving tests. The forecast level of demand for practical driving tests in 1999-2000 is similar to 1998-99, at 1.4 million. However, the introduction of the longer driving test, with examiners conducting seven rather than eight tests a day, means each

 The Driving Standards Agency currently employs 157 contract driving examiners nationally, on a variety of three-yearly contracts.

 It is presumed that the question relates to the release of allergenic material to air.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made on the review of the definition of wood recovery in respect of the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 from 1 January 2000.  [87683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w06.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 From 1 January 2000, wood packaging--including pallets and tea chests--will be covered by the Regulations. Obligated businesses will be required to recover a specified amount of wood packaging based on the quantity which they handled in the preceding year. There is no separate recycling obligation for wood.
<P>

<a name="90621w06.htm_para1">The Environment Agency is currently considering the types of activity which may be regarded as 'recovery' in respect of wood packaging. It is anticipated that from 1 January 2000, a number of wood reprocessors will be accredited by the Agency and be able to issue Packaging Waste Recovery Note (PRNs) as evidence of recovery.
<P>

<a name="90621w06.htm_para2">The Environment Agency is working with the Timber Packaging and Pallet Confederation (TIMCON) to establish the weight of wood packaging, providing an average figure for each of the common pallet types. Such agreement is necessary because of the moisture content of a pallet varies throughout its life sometimes by as much as 50 per cent. An agreement on weights will help to make the Regulations easier to work with for obligated businesses and regulators alike. It is anticipated that a protocol will be agreed during the summer.

 The Department has not directly commissioned national research on autism recently but a new research initiative on learning disabilities will be launched in the autumn which may attract proposals for research into autism.
<P>

<a name="90621w06.htm_para7">The Department also manages the National Health Service research and development levy which is used to support research and development to the NHS in hospitals, general practice and other health care settings, and to fund the NHS research and development programme.
<P>

<a name="90621w06.htm_para8">Management of much of the research supported by the NHS research and development levy is devolved and details of expenditure at project level are not collected routinely by the Department.
<P>

<a name="90621w06.htm_para9">Project details of work directly funded by the Department or supported through the NHS research and development levy can be found on the National Research Register (NRR), copies of which are available in the Library. The NRR lists over 30 projects concerning autism for which the Department will be providing support funds.
<P>

<a name="90621w06.htm_para10">In addition, the Medical Research Council (MRC)--which receives most of its income via grant-in-aid from the office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry--funds medical research as part of the Government's funding of the science and engineering base.
<P>

<a name="90621w06.htm_para11">The figures for the expenditure by the MRC on autism over the last 3 years are:

Jacobs (Universities of Cambridge and Southampton) &#163;1,100,000 over five years; and Professor A. Bailey (Institute of Psychiatry) &#163;1,800,000 over four years.
<P>

<a name="90621w06.htm_para13">The Department does not specifically allocate resources for the treatment of autism. It is for health authorities to decide how best to use the resources that have been allocated to them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w06.htm_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 I understand that Secretin has been used by a number of professionals in the treatment of autism particularly in the United States. However, it is not licensed for use for that purpose either here or in the United States. We are keeping the developing situation in the United States under review.

 The Government fund health and medical research in a number of ways.
<P>

<a name="90621w07.htm_para0">The Department funds research and development to support their work on policy development and evaluation in health and social care. The Department also manages the National Health Service research and development levy which is used to support research and development of relevance to the National Health Service in hospitals, general practice and other health care settings, and to fund the NHS research and development programme. In addition, the Medical Research Council (MRC)--which receives most of its income via grant-in-aid from the office of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry--funds medical research as part of the Government's funding of the science and engineering base.
<P>

<a name="90621w07.htm_para1">Priorities for departmental research and development support for the development of policy are determined through discussion with policy colleagues, the Departmental Research Committee and Ministers. In the NHS research and development programme, priorities take account of widespread consultation with those using, delivering and managing services, within a framework overseen by the Central Research and Development Committee for the NHS. In all cases, priorities for our budgets reflect analysis of the burden of disease, potential benefits and Government priorities, and take account of the responsibilities and work of other funders.
<P>

<a name="90621w07.htm_para2">The MRC has recently made a number of substantial investments in the area of dementia. A new centre Development Grant in Brain Ageing has been awarded in partnership with the University of Newcastle and will examine the pathology and diagnosis of dementia--this will commence next year. In addition, the Multicentre Study of Cognitive Function on Ageing is an on-going major 10 year study funded in collaboration with Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="90621w07.htm_para3">In addition the MRC has supported 53 projects on Alzheimer's/dementia in the last three years. Copies of the list have been placed in the Library. MRC spend has been as follows:

 The Royal College of Ophthalmologists, the College of Optometrists and the Royal National Institute for the Blind were among the first bodies to advise us of the need for guidance on viewing the eclipse. We agreed to help them with the production and distribution of a leaflet, "Observing Solar Eclipses--Taking care of your sight", which is published on 23 June for distribution to tourist information centres, libraries, optical practices and other places to which the public have ready access.
<P>

<a name="90621w07.htm_para15">In summary, the leaflet warns that looking directly at the sun is very dangerous. The radiation could permanently damage the eye. The safest way to view the eclipse is indirectly with, for example, a pinhole projection viewer. If people ignore this advice and decide to use a solar filter or a pair of eclipse spectacles, they do so at their own risk. They would be well advised to buy the device from a reputable outlet and ensure that it had a CE mark to show it had been approved under the Personal Protective Equipment Directive and also ensure that it came with full instructions for use, that it fitted closely to the face and that the lenses were not scratched or

damaged. Even with covers for the eyepiece, binoculars and telescopes are dangerous because they can still expose the eye to excessive radiation.
<P>

<a name="90621w07.htm_para16">We have arranged with the Department for Education and Employment for a summary of the advice to be included in the July edition of the "Spectrum" journal, which is sent to all heads of schools and chairs of governors. A summarised version of the leaflet has already been made available to all general practitioners and hospital doctors.
<P>

<a name="90621w07.htm_para17">The College of Optometrists will publish the leaflet on their web site: www.College-optometrists.org and see that reference to it is included in the main Internet indexes.
<P>

<a name="90621w07.htm_para18">We recognise that the media have a key role in educating the public on the risks to sight from the sun and we are collaborating on a series of news items in the period up to 11 August.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of the August solar eclipse will be visible in each county in the UK; and what plans he has to publicise this information more widely.  [87477]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w07.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Royal Greenwich Observatory has, by way of illustration, calculated the percentage of eclipse as follows: Cornwall and Devon 100 per cent., London 95 per cent., Manchester 90 per cent., Newcastle 85 per cent., Dundee 80 per cent., Western Isles 75 per cent., West Orkneys 70 per cent. The leaflet which the optical professions are producing notes the variable effect, but the risks from viewing the sun directly are the same whatever degree of partial eclipse.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w07.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The information requested is not available centrally, but I am confident that the contingency planning undertaken by health authorities and National Health Service trusts will ensure that hospital eye departments are appropriately staffed on 11 August. However, it would be misleading to give any impression that radiation damage to the eye is treatable. In most cases there is some recovery of sight in the months which follow the injury but, if visual acuity is permanently affected, the only help available is through the prescription of an optical appliance.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Figures are based on a 1 per cent. sample in May 1993 and a 5 per cent. sample thereafter.<P>

2. Figures are based on an average of payments and numbers of claimants in the inquiry week using an average of the four quarters of the financial year.<P>

3. Figures have been rounded to the nearest thousand, and the estimated annual expenditure is rounded to the nearest million pounds.<P>

4. Prior to November 1995 figures on amounts of Income Support Mortgage Interest paid to claimants were published in the Quarterly Statistical Enquiry. From November 1995 onwards these have been replaced by figures on housing costs payable to claimants with mortgage interest payments. This change is due to alterations in Income Support rules and provides a more accurate reflection of the help actually provided to claimants under the housing cost rules. From 1993-94 onwards, the estimates that have been used for this answer have been based on amounts of housing requirements payable to claimants with mortgage interest payments, and will include amounts for ground rent and other miscellaneous housing costs, although the majority of the amount is paid for mortgage interest.<P>

5. Income Support figures exclude the unemployed from October 1996, as Income Support for the unemployed was replaced by Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance from this point.<P>

6. The February 1998 quarterly figure used in the annual 1997-98 Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) figure include nil mortgage cases (i.e., cases with housing requirements only). JSA estimated expenditure for 1996-97 represents a six month estimate from the introduction of Income-based JSA, the 1997-98 is an annual estimate.<P>

7. Lone parents have been defined as single people with dependants not in receipt of a disability or pensioner premium.<P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I should explain that the War Pensions Agency uses the medical services of the Benefits Agency with the exception of hearing tests which are arranged by contractors working direct to the War Pensions Agency. The arrangements for paying travelling expenses to medical examinations for War Pension claimants are the same as those for benefits administered by the Benefits Agency. At present medical examinations are arranged by SEMA Group Medical Services who are responsible for paying travelling expenses. The Benefits Agency took a decision from 1 July 1998 to amend the expenses rate 6.5 pence per mile for claimants using their own vehicles to attend examinations.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The change was made in order to correct the wide variations in the interpretation of previous instructions. It was concluded that the Benefits Agency was paying rates which were not consistent with existing policies and that expenses payments should be reduced from 22.5p per mile to 6.5p per mile to cover actual fuel costs. This level was consistent with paying actual public transport costs and was introduced in order to ensure that all claimants are treated in the same way regardless of where they live. The new rate was not introduced as a result of the contracting out of the Benefits Agency Medical Services but was introduced by the Benefits Agency before the private sector took over the delivery of the service.</FONT></UL>
<P>

 We have no plans to introduce such a target for employers. The 3 per cent. quota scheme, established under the Disabled Persons (Employment) Act 1944, was appropriate before there was any specific legislation to give disabled people individual rights not be discriminated against in employment. Under Part II of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 disabled people can now seek redress through Employment Tribunals if they believe they have been discriminated against at work.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what his assessment is of the consequences of a ban for the time being on the placing of genetically modified seed varieties on the National Seed List.  [87022]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w09.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Rooker </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 June 1999]:</i> The purpose of the National List system is to establish that varieties of agricultural seeds, which are proposed for addition to the List, are distinct, uniform and stable as well as showing an improvement in agronomic performance over varieties already on the List.
<P>

<a name="90621w09.htm_para9">The Government's policy is not to accept entry of any genetically modified variety on to the National List unless it has obtained the necessary clearances under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and regulations made under it, relating to environmental and safety aspects. It would, however, be outside the scope of the National List system to introduce a general ban on the addition of genetically modified varieties.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what studies have been undertaken into the possible effects of antibiotic resistance gene markers retained in foods produced by the genetic modification of crops on <i>(a)</i> humans and <i>(b)</i> animals; and if he will make a statement.

 As well as its two reports on the use of antibiotic resistance markers (ARMs) in foods (published in 1994 and 1996), as part of its rigorous assessment of individual GM foods, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) always looks very carefully at the use of ARMs. It recommends against approval in those circumstances where it considers that there is a theoretical finite risk that their use might give rise to an increase in resistance against clinically important antibiotics. Studies are currently in progress to try to ascertain the exact size of such a risk, although this is expected to be very small.

 The good health and physical well-being of all Service personnel is a priority for my Department, and personnel undergoing training are no exception.
<P>

<a name="90621w11.htm_para1">As far as soldiers are concerned, the Army Training and Recruiting Agency, which is responsible for the initial and skill training of soldiers and officer cadets, takes all possible steps to ensure that both new recruits and trainees are carefully shown how to avoid injury while training. This includes briefing before and after specific training exercises, and a carefully graded introduction to the training regime. The Agency conducts a careful risk assessment and takes steps to ensure that appropriately trained personnel are available at all times to monitor exercises and training to reduce potential risks to a minimum. The details of any injuries that are sustained are the subject of a continuous audit to try to prevent repetition.

 The Strategic Defence Review identified that our less stable world will require more international peace support operations. The UK will play its full part in such international efforts, as we are in KFOR in Kosovo.
<P>

<a name="90621w11.htm_para2">UK forces have particular experience and expertise in peace implementation missions such as IFOR and SFOR in Bosnia. Many of the enhancements to our military capability following the Strategic Defence Review will have a direct application in peace support operations.

 The tasks which drive our force structure are more demanding than those currently envisaged under the EU's Common Foreign and Security Policy. The MOD is committed to the further development of forces that are joint, modern, inter-operable, rapidly deployable and flexible enough to tackle a wide range of militarily demanding, potentially concurrent tasks.

 Under the plans announced as a result of the SDR, the regular Army will be strengthened by the creation of some 3,200 new posts. We are creating a sixth deployable brigade, a powerful new Air Assault Brigade, and we are strengthening our logistic support capability. New equipment entering service now and in the next few years will greatly improve our ability to conduct the hard hitting, mobile land operations of the future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w11.htm_spnew10"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 During Operation Allied Force, the threat posed to low-flying NATO aircraft from man-portable air defence systems has been significant. These systems have a capability from well below 100 feet to over 14,000 feet and from a quarter of a mile to over two miles. NATO has taken appropriate counter measures which have been successful.
<P>

<a name="90621w11.htm_para3">Reports from NATO pilots indicate that around 100 man-portable SAMs were launched by the Serb military during the now suspended air campaign. Man-portable air defence systems, by their nature, are very difficult to track. We believe that a number of these systems were

<P>

<a name="90621w11.htm_para4">Under the terms of the Military Technical Agreement (MTA), all MANPADS held by the Serb military should now have been withdrawn from Kosovo. The risk to NATO forces from MANPADS is currently assessed to be very low.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence, pursuant to his answer of 10 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>13-14</i>, on manning levels, on the assumption that (i) progress towards full manning was as predicted in the Strategic Defence Review, (ii) the level of operational commitment was as deployed in Bosnia currently and (iii) 5,000 troops were deployed in Kosovo indefinitely, how many additional <i>(a)</i> major units and <i>(b)</i> trained soldiers the Army would require to sustain 24 month tour intervals.  [86277]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 This is a hypothetical question. It is impossible at this stage to say what the long-term force levels will be either in the Former Republic of Yugoslavia or in Bosnia. If we were to conduct planning on the basis of the assumptions in this question, as I indicated in my previous answer, many variables could affect the calculation of the number of major units and trained soldiers required.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_wqn2"><B> Mr. Spring: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what is the total amount which has been contributed annually to the charitable sector <i>(a)</i> overall and <i>(b)</i> through the gift-aid scheme since the scheme's introduction; what these are as proportions of the total turnover of the charitable sector; and what is the total cost to his Department of the tax refunds resulting from the gift-aid scheme.  [86690]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 June 1999]:</i> Charities received some &#163;760 million under the Gift Aid scheme in 1997-98, of which &#163;177 million were repayments of basic rate income tax, on donations by individuals and companies. Additional relief claimed by higher rate taxpayers for donations under the Gift Aid scheme is provisionally estimated at &#163;40 million for 1997-98.
<P>

<a name="90621w12.htm_para12">Consistent and reliable annual estimates for total donations to charities and for the income and expenditure of this sector are not available centrally. However, the Charities Aid Foundation estimates overall income donated by individuals to be around &#163;5 billion to &#163;6 billion per year. In addition to this charities also benefit from donations by companies and other organisations.
<P>

<a name="90621w12.htm_para13">The Charity Commission's Register showed at the end of March 1999 that the total annual income of all registered charities in England and Wales was about &#163;21 billion. This does not cover charities in Scotland and Northern Ireland, nor does it include non-registered charities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 June 1999]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer detailed current vehicle excise duty policy in his March Budget Statement, 9 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 173-90. He announced that from June 1 vehicles of 1100cc. or less would pay a reduced rate of vehicle excise duty of &#163;100. Around 1.8 million cars will have qualified for the &#163;55 reduction in their vehicle excise duty from the start of this month.




<P>
<P><I>21 Jun 1999 : Column: 311</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90621w12.htm_para14">The Chancellor also announced that a system of graduated vehicle excise duty for new cars would be introduced in Autumn 2000. This will be based primarily on their carbon dioxide emissions, which are the most accurate indicator of fuel efficiency.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what discussions his Department has had with British investors on their role and responsibilities in financial crises in emerging markets; and what part British investors have agreed to play in preventing and resolving future financial crises.  [86943]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 June 1999]:</i> We have been working with our G7 partners to develop a new approach to the involvement of the private sector in financial crisis prevention and resolution. This is designed to help promote more orderly crisis resolution and therefore be of mutual benefit to debtors and creditors. Methods of achieving this could include establishing investor networks and the inclusion of collective action clauses in sovereign bond issues. Private sector investors have been involved in the debate on this issue and we expect an appropriate response from them to any proposals which are agreed.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to introduce a tax on currency speculation; and if he will make a statement.  [85620]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government have received proposals for a tax on international currency exchange. This idea has a number of practical difficulties, including the problem of achieving global coverage and the scope for avoidance. We have considered carefully whether these difficulties can be overcome, but our work so far suggests that they cannot. Consequently, we have doubts that the tax would achieve our shared objective of a stable international financial system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government currently have no plans to introduce a new tax to encourage recycling.
<P>

<a name="90621w12.htm_para15">However, the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions has commissioned work on the policy instruments which might be used to correct market failures in the demand for secondary raw materials, and products made from secondary raw materials.
<P>

<a name="90621w12.htm_para16">In addition, the Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations which set targets for recovery and recycling of packaging waste, will almost double the UK's packaging recovery rate (including recycling) to 50 per cent. by 2001.
<P>

<a name="90621w12.htm_para17">Finally, in the Budget, 9 March 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 173-90, the Government announced increases in the rate of landfill tax which will provide an incentive for further recycling. To promote further the development of

<P><I>21 Jun 1999 : Column: 312</I><P>

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if it is his policy to support the expenditure covered in the EU budget lines listed under the heading <i>(a)</i> social contacts between staff, <i>(b)</i> early childhood centre and other creches and <i>(c)</i> entertainment and representation expenses; and if he will make a statement.  [86657]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_spnew7"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government's policy on all spending by the institutions of the European Communities is to push for the same principles of rigour and cost-effectiveness as we apply to the UK budget.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what recent representations he has received on the proposed tax on pesticides; and if he will make a statement.  [87293]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_spnew8"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Chancellor of the Exchequer has received a number of representations on the design of a possible tax or charge scheme for pesticides. Many of these have been received through the current consultation exercise. The deadline for responses to that consultation is 24 June.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_wqn9"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what discussions he has had with IMF officials concerning the sale of IMF gold stocks in order to finance debt relief; and if he will make a statement.  [85720]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w12.htm_spnew9"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The UK has taken the lead in calling for the sale of $1 billion-$2 billion (approximately 10 million ounces) of IMF gold to meet the costs of an enhanced HIPC initiative falling to the Fund and to deliver faster, wider, deeper debt reduction to the world's poorest countries.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the tax yield resulting from imposing duty on aviation fuel at the same rate as on motor vehicle fuel, assuming a similar rate of tax is imposed by other countries.  [86698]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90621w13.htm_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Imposing duty on aviation fuel at the same rate as unleaded petrol would raise approximately &#163;5 billion, assuming no alteration in demand.

 The former Occupational Pensions Board was first notified on 22 December 1994 that the employer had gone into liquidation and that the Lund Humphries Pension scheme was to be wound up. However, it was not until 2 February 1996 that the Receiver contacted the former Occupational Pensions Board confirming the discontinuance date of 14 October 1994. Formal action to cancel the scheme was finalised on 23 April 1996. The former Contributions Agency supplied the relevant scheme membership listings and guaranteed minimum pension calculations to the scheme administrator on 9 September 1996. It is normal practice to supply the scheme membership listings and guaranteed minimum pension calculations to the scheme administrator appointed by the trustees unless otherwise instructed.
