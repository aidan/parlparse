<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer, how much has been contributed annually to the charitable sector (a) overall and (b) through the Gift Aid scheme, since the scheme's introduction; what these sums are as proportions of the total turnover of the charitable sector; and what the total cost is to his Department of the tax refunds resulting from the Gift Aid scheme.  [79111]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_spnew11"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Figures on Gift Aid are published in the income tax section of Inland Revenue Statistics at: www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/index.htm. Consistent and reliable estimates for total donations to charities are not available centrally, nor are figures on turnover. However, a survey by NCVO/NOP estimates that the value of individual donations was #6.8 billion in 2001. In addition charities benefit from donations from companies. The Charity Commission shows that at the end of the second quarter of 2002 the annual income of registered charities in England and Wales was #28.5 billion.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask Mr. Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what his estimate is of the amount of tax forgone as a result of tax allowances granted to charities in England and Wales in <i>(a)</i> the last financial year and <i>(b)</i> each of the previous six financial years;  [79135]
<P>
<UL>(2) what the total amount of tax relief for charities has been since 1997; and how much was relief on <i>(a)</i> income tax, <i>(b)</i> corporation tax, <i>(c)</i> capital gains tax, <i>(d)</i> inheritance tax and <i>(e)</i> stamp duty.  [79092]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_spnew12"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The available estimates, which relate to the United Kingdom, for the total cost of tax forgone are about #2 billion in each of the last six financial years. This includes income tax, inheritance tax, business rates and VAT. Figures for the first two categories were published in various issues of the FSBR and in Table 1.5 of Inland Revenue Statistics at: www.inlandrevenue.gov.uk/stats/index.htm. These figures will be updated in the Tax Ready Reckoner published at the time of the Chancellor's Press Budget Report. Estimates for relief on corporation tax, capital gains tax and stamp duty are not available.

<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_wqn13"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what plans he has for the Payroll Giving scheme providing tax relief for charitable donations; and if he will make a statement.  [79093]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_spnew13"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 In April 2000, the Government abolished the maximum amounts that could be given under Payroll Giving. To boost the scheme, the Government announced a three-year publicity campaign to promote the scheme to more employers and their employees and a 10 per cent. supplement on all Payroll Giving donations until April 2003. The cost of the supplement is met from public expenditure. The amount given under Payroll Giving has increased from #29 million in 1998&#150;99 to about #73 million in 2001&#150;02.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_wqn14"><B> Mr, Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment his Department has made of the level of charitable donations since the abolition 



<P>
<P><I>6 Nov 2002 : Column 287W</I><P>
of the minimum limit on donations through the <i>(a)</i> Payroll Giving scheme and <i>(b)</i> Gift Aid scheme. [79110]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_spnew14"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 In April 2000, the Government set a target to raise the amount given through Payroll Giving to #60 million by April 2003. The total given in the year 2001&#150;02 was around #73m. In 2001&#150;02 nearly #450m was repaid to charities under Gift Aid. The Government looks forward to the continuing success of both schemes.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_wqn15"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has to prevent suspended shares being given as part of the Gift Aid scheme. [79104]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_spnew15"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Gift Aid scheme only covers gifts of money. The relief for giving listed shares, introduced in April 2000, allows individuals and companies to deduct the market value of gifts of listed shares from their income or corporation tax calculation. Where shares are being actively traded, the value will normally be easily ascertained by reference to published prices. However, where trading is suspended, the value will be the price which might have been paid in a transaction at arm's length. Any relief would therefore reflect the suspension of trading in the shares. The shares would still, of course, be of value to the charity, when trading resumed.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. Stephen O'Brien: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what plans he has for the Gift Aid scheme tax relief for charitable donations; and if he will make a statement.  [79094]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w01.html_spnew16"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 In April 2000, the Government abolished the minimum donation of #250, so that every donation, no matter how large or small, can come within the Gift Aid scheme, providing the donor meets the scheme's conditions. From April 2003, donors will be able to carry back Gift Aid donations made before they make their self assessment tax returns into the previous tax year, thereby obtaining any higher rate relief earlier. From April 2004 taxpayers will be able to nominate a charity to receive part or all of a tax repayment that is due to them.
<P>

<a name="21106w01.html_para5">The Government continue to support The Giving Campaign, a charity sector-led body, which has done a great deal to raise awareness of the Gift Aid scheme among both charities and donors.

 There is no cost to the Exchequer from the introduction on 1 October 2002 of new pension arrangements for the Civil Service. Members participating in those arrangements will meet the full costs of all the benefit improvements, including the introduction of survivor pensions for unmarried partners, through higher employee contributions.
<P>

<a name="21106w02.html_para0">Our policy is that public service pension schemes may introduce unmarried partner pensions only if members want the change and are prepared to pay for it through higher member contributions or a rebalancing of other benefits which is cost neutral overall to employers and the taxpayer. Death lump sum benefits may be provided, however, to unmarried partners in schemes where members are able to nominate the recipient.

Taxpayer confidentiality prevents the disclosure of specific details on how much tax the Government has collected from payments from the Thalidomide trust to thalidomide victims. As with other discretionary trusts, the trustees account for tax at 34 per cent. on the income they pay out. The beneficiaries are then subject to tax on this income in the normal way, and they may claim credit for the tax paid by the trustees.

 Ron Sandler's report was wide-ranging and contained recommendations for Government and the regulator, as well as for the retail savings industry. The Treasury is planning to consult on the Sandler recommendation for a suite of regulated products early in the new year. The consideration of Sandler's tax recommendations are being taken forward as part of the normal budget process. The FSA is considering the recommendations that touch on its responsibilities.

<P>
<a name="21106w04.html_spnew6"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Details of progress against specific recommendations of PAT14 were set out in the <i>National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal: Policy Action Team Audit</i> report, published in January 2001. Although most proposed actions that were listed have been completed, the report recognised that the work to eliminate financial exclusion is on-going. While we have made important progress across the areas identified by PAT14&#151;credit unions, banking and insurance services, financial education and ethnic minority issues&#151;we need to continue to work with the financial services industry, voluntary and community groups to end financial exclusion.

<P>
<a name="21106w04.html_spnew7"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Government welcome the contribution of the mutual sector, including credit unions and friendly societies, to increasing choice and widening access in financial services.
<P>

<a name="21106w04.html_para8">Following the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, the Financial Services Authority has assumed responsibility for the regulation of credit unions and friendly societies. The Act also introduced an independent ombudsman scheme and single financial services compensation scheme. These measures should increase confidence in those considering membership of either credit unions or friendly societies.
<P>

<a name="21106w04.html_para9">We are in the process of delivering a programme of deregulatory measures with the aim of increasing the operational flexibility of credit unions. For example, four measures were introduced in July this year, including enhancement to credit unions' ability to borrow from external sources and more flexibility in the way credit unions can pay dividends to members.
<P>

<a name="21106w04.html_para10">Measures such as the introduction of the Saving Gateway and the Child Trust Fund are intended to encourage saving by low-income groups, which should benefit credit unions and friendly societies.

<a name="21106w05.html_para0"><i>Letter to Mr. Matthew Taylor from Len Cook, dated 6 November 2002:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question concerning an estimate of the cost of measuring inflation rates between regions.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The development of regional inflation measures would require a major expansion of existing data collections and a substantial development programme to resolve a number of conceptual and technical issues. This would involve significant additional expenditure involving many millions of pounds.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There are several reasons why the current available data is not suitable for the compilation of reliable regional indices. The selection of locations is not designed to be representative of individual regions; the locations would have to be resampled, increased in number, and substantially more prices collected. In addition, many of the centrally compiled indices (e.g. housing, cars, PCs) are designed as national indices; the possibility of developing these to produce regional indices would need to be investigated.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The data used for the weights (such as the Expenditure and Food Survey) would also have to be significantly enhanced to ensure that detailed regional expenditure categories (by type of good or service, and by type of outlet) were being weighted appropriately and represented in the sample of prices being collected. Finally, there will be a significant cost arising from the development of computer systems to produce regional indices.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The conceptual issues to be resolved include whether the items to be priced should be representative of national or regional baskets (different users will have different needs), and also the treatment of regional boundaries. Households do not necessarily restrict their shopping to the region where they live; they may physically cross regional borders for shopping or do so via Internet or mail order shopping.</FONT></UL>

 We are currently taking forward one of the largest organisational changes in the history of the civil service. We are integrating the whole of the old Employment Service and the Benefit Agency's services for people of working age to form Jobcentre Plus whilst simultaneously launching the new Pension Service.
<P>

<a name="21106w05.html_para9">A key aim of the programme is to improve access to services providing active work-focused help to people of working age through Jobcentre Plus and an expert pensions advice service through The Pension Service. We are currently reviewing the facilities available to us to provide these services across the country. We are looking to make the most efficient use of these facilities whilst maintaining a high standard of service to all our customers. Both agencies are extending access to their services with, for example, the innovative use of new technology, the use of contact centres staffed by expert advisers, the extension of face-to-face services into communities and the sharing of facilities with our local partners such as local authorities.
<P>

<a name="21106w05.html_para10">In spring 2003 Bath Pension Centre is scheduled to take over benefit processing and the telephone advice service for the Gloucestershire area. Pensioners will still be able to meet an adviser face to face at local advice surgeries or by arranging a home visit. This will be backed up by local services delivered in partnership with local authorities and voluntary sector organisations. Pensioners will receive letters explaining the changes fully and giving them all necessary contact details.
<P>

<a name="21106w05.html_para11">The Coleford Jobcentre will be moving to new premises in the near future, as the current premises do not meet the requirements of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. Jobcentre Plus are also considering moving delivery of Social Security services from Cinderford to this new Coleford office. We will be reviewing the delivery of Jobcentre Plus services as part of the roll out the new integrated offices throughout Gloucestershire by 2005&#150;06. No decisions have yet been made on their location.
<P>

<a name="21106w05.html_para12">All of these changes will be managed so as to ensure that high quality public services can be maintained throughout the transition to the new arrangements.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what strategies his Department has to ensure that there is no ageism in recruitment and retention processes.  [79294]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Equality of opportunity for all staff is a key feature of all Civil Service employment. As part of this, ageism is not tolerated. Our Diversity and Equality policy statement specifies age as an area where we ''will provide equality of opportunity''. This equality of treatment extends also to the new external recruitment system where potential recruits will be selected on the basis of competencies.
<P>

<a name="21106w07.html_para0">The Department includes age as part of its equality proofing of policies and procedures. Our current HR Change Programme is continuously reviewing its recruitment, development, performance management and retention policies. Alongside this work we are implementing the outcomes of the Performance and Innovation Unit's ''Winning the Generation Game'' report.
<P>

<a name="21106w07.html_para1">All applicants and employees are treated fairly to enable them to develop and fulfil their potential, valuing the contribution each person can make to the organisation. Vacancies are open up to everyone up to the age of 65 and a person's age is not taken into account at any stage of the selection process.
<P>

<a name="21106w07.html_para2">In addition to its usual recruitment procedures the Department also recruits employees through the New Deal programme, both for Young People and 25 and 50 plus.
<P>

<a name="21106w07.html_para3">All staff in the Department, below the Senior Civil Service, are able to choose to remain beyond 60, up to the age of 65. Staff over 60 are subject to the same terms and conditions as staff under 60 with no special reviews of performance applied. The Department's flexible approach to age retirement allows staff to continue to work in their current grade and, subject to business need, to seek promotion to a higher grade or voluntarily to downgrade. Subject to business need staff may also choose to work full or part time.

 The Department's Public Service Agreement (PSA) for the period 1999&#150;00 to 2001&#150;02 (published as Command Paper 4315) set out a number of value for money measures.

<a name="21106w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Reintroducing the earnings link does nothing to help poorer pensioners. To do so would cost around #410m net in 2003&#150;04 in today's prices. However, we will be spending an extra #6bn a year in real terms on pensioners as a result of policies introduced since 1997. This includes #2.5bn more on the poorest third of pensioners. This is three times more than an earnings link since 1998 would have given them.

<P>
<a name="21106w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 Regulations laid before Parliament on 24 October will permit winter fuel payments to be made, where Income Support or income-based Jobseeker's Allowance is in payment for a couple, to the partner who is claiming for both, even if that person is aged under 60 and it is the other member of the couple who is entitled to the winter fuel payment. This will ensure that around 15,000 households continue to receive winter fuel payments automatically and timeously, without the need to claim. Such payments to the non-eligible partner made for the last two winters (#3 million per year) were not supported by legislation and the Department's relevant accounts will be noted accordingly.

 The double debt rule is designed to ensure that people do not become over indebted by borrowing additional amounts from the Social Fund until they have repaid a reasonable proportion of the original loan. Further loans are refused to applicants who have an outstanding budgeting loan debt of more than half the maximum amount available to them. Once their existing debt drops to less than half they can reapply, although the amount of further loan available to them could still be affected by any outstanding debt.
<P>

<a name="21106w08.html_para3">It is estimated that the cost of abolishing the rule while broadly maintaining maximum amounts available, would be around #100m in the first year. The cost would fall to #25m in the second year and #10m in the third  <sup>1</sup> .

 The Fuel Direct scheme is designed to protect the fuel supplies of people receiving income-related benefits&#151;particularly families&#151;who have run up arrears, by making payments direct from their benefit to the supplier until the debt is cleared. The scheme works well and there are no plans for a radical overhaul.
<P>

<a name="21106w09.html_para0">As part of the Government's Fuel Poverty Strategy the Department has been working with the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) to make a number of operational improvements to the scheme for the benefit of both customers and suppliers. The first stage of these improvements was introduced in March 2001 and work is underway to further modernise the scheme.

<i>Notes:</i>
<BR>
Winter Fuel Payments can only be made to people living in Switzerland from this coming winter. This is because, while Switzerland is not a member of the EEA, a formal agreement between Switzerland and the European Community (EC) countries will enable the EU Social Security coordination regulations to apply between Switzerland and the EC countries. The agreement came into force from 1st June 2002 and therefore, for Winter Fuel Payments, applies from winter 2002&#150;03, but not before.
<BR>
However, the agreement does not extend to the three countries who are not part of the EC but who are part of the EEA, namely, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Therefore in some circumstances, Winter Fuel Payments may continue to be paid to people who are Swiss nationals who live in Switzerland or one of the EC countries, but not when they live in Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway. Similarly Winter Fuel Payments may continue to be paid to people who are nationals of Iceland, Liechtenstein or Norway who live in an EEA country, but not when they live in Switzerland.

 Two organisations can close a motorway: the police, under the emergency powers granted to them by the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 Section 67, and the relevant highway authority under Section 14, of the same act. The police use their powers to prevent obstruction of, or danger to or from, traffic as a result of extraordinary circumstances. In such an emergency, the police notify the highway authority that an incident has taken place, and ask for traffic management and diversion routes to be put in place. By their nature, closures by the police cannot be foreseen.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para0">As far as the trunk road network is concerned, the Highways Agency, in its role as Network Operator, is working pro-actively with its maintaining agents and the police forces in England to better manage incidents and help reduce the knock-on effect of congestion.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para1">Highway authorities are allowed to close roads where works on or near the road are likely to cause danger to the public or damage to the highway. Before closing a road, the authority is required to take account of the availability and suitability of alternative routes and, because closures are planned, advance warning is given.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para2">On the trunk road network the Highways Agency is working closely with its contractors to introduce more effective construction and maintenance techniques leading to fewer hold-ups while essential repairs are carried out.

Compared to all road accidents on motorways and dual carriageway trunk roads, there are relatively few deaths directly caused by accidents on the hard shoulder. Road accident figures are constantly monitored to identify where road improvements would be effective.<P>

 The National Roadside Survey of Vehicle Excise Duty evasion which took place in June 1999 showed the level of evasion as 3.9 per cent. of revenue due which equates to #191 million in 2001&#150;02. This was offset by #110 million recovered through enforcement activities. The number of unlicensed vehicles at any one time is around 1 million vehicles.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para6">We have introduced legislation which will make the registered keeper of a vehicle remain liable for it until a formal change of keepership is notified to DVLA. This system of continuous registration will help to improve the accuracy of the vehicle register which will lead to more efficient tax collection, and more effective enforcement. The legislation will be brought into force by regulations.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para7">In addition DVLA is working closely with the police and local authorities to target unlicensed and abandoned vehicles. Last year, DVLA took successful action against 800,000 evaders recovering some #110 million in fines, penalties and re-licensing revenue.

 It is extremely difficult to provide a precise estimate of the number of vehicle keepers who failed to notify a vehicle transfer. The main problem is

<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w10.html_wqn7"><B> Lawrie Quinn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, if he will make a statement on rail franchising policy.  [79825]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority has announced today a new approach to franchising. Under it the SRA will be much clearer what it expects from each train operating company. Train companies will not just be judged on whether trains run on time but also on the cleanliness of trains and stations, accurate travel information and passenger security.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para10">The nature of the franchising structure put in place at privatisation has contributed to the difficulties in the railway industry&#151;especially poor performance and variable quality of service.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para11">Today, with the Government's support, the SRA has announced a new approach to franchising that puts passengers first. It intends to do so through: tighter specification of services, station standards, train cleanliness and journey quality; and robust incentives and penalties that will influence positively the behaviour of operators. These include: changes to the performance regime; quantified performance indicators for service and station quality, with payment by results; and a new approach to the award and management of franchises. The first franchise awarded under the new basis is expected to start operating in 2004.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para12">The SRA has also announced proposals to make better use of the railway by combining franchises at key London stations&#151;from 3 to 1 at Liverpool Street, from 2 to 1 at Waterloo and from 3 to 2 at Paddington.




<P>
<P><I>6 Nov 2002 : Column 320W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para13">Transitional arrangements are being put in place as it is not practical to award all of the franchises due to expire by 2004 simultaneously. The SRA has therefore made a number of detailed announcements on individual franchises today. These include: an invitation to Connex Transport UK Ltd and First Group/Keolis SA to proceed to detailed negotiations on Heads of Terms for the TransPennine franchise; negotiations with Arriva Trains Northern on an interim franchise to operate services until the Northern Rail franchise commences in 2004; a one-year extension to the current South West Trains franchise to February 2004; and the agreement of principles with Stagecoach Holdings plc for a new South West Trains franchise extending to 2007.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para14">Further adjustments to franchise periods may be necessary to facilitate an orderly transition from the existing franchise regime to the new one. I shall be prepared to use my powers of direction under section 26 of the Railways Act 1993 for this purpose.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para15">This announcement is another step towards delivering a reliable and safe railway and builds on the SRA's consultation on its Capacity Utilisation Strategy launched on 5 September.
<P>

<a name="21106w10.html_para16">Copies of the SRA's Franchising Policy Statement have been placed in the Libraries of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will ensure that individuals on secondment from the private sector in embassies are marked as such in the Diplomatic List, listing the firm from which they originated and the dates of their secondment.  [78156]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The Diplomatic Service List normally includes only established members of the Diplomatic Service. Although secondees from the private sector and other Government Departments may be entitled to diplomatic privileges when abroad, they are not established members of the Diplomatic Service. The relatively short duration of secondments from the private sector means that, if included, entries for secondees could well be out of date by the time the list was published.

<P>
<a name="21106w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 We are very concerned about recent reports of arms sales from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia to Iraq. My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I raised this with the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Dr. Goran Svilanovic, when he visited the UK on 30&#150;31 October. We urged the Yugoslav Government to investigate the matter fully and bring criminal prosecutions against those responsible. We will continue to press for a thorough investigation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w12.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, if he will make a statement on the NATO operation in the Bosnia entity of Republika Srpska related to the sale of military equipment to Iraq.  [79550]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Macshane: </B> 
 NATO Stabilisation Force troops carried out a two-day search of the Bosnian Serb government owned Air Force Institute, Orao, on 11&#150;13 October. The search uncovered evidence that Orao had been providing spare engine parts for Iraqi MiG fighter jets, as well as technical assistance in repairing the engines.
<P>

<a name="21106w12.html_para3">Lord Ashdown, the High Representative in Bosnia, made a statement on 27 October demanding an immediate end to such assistance to Iraq and a full enquiry. He called for all those responsible to be brought to account, and for new controls to prevent any recurrence.
<P>

<a name="21106w12.html_para4">A number of officials have since been dismissed. On 30 October, the State government announced a total ban on all arms imports and exports. We strongly support Lord Ashdown's proposals, and will continue to make clear to Bosnian leaders the need to address this as a matter of urgency.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w13.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 All recruitment to the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) is on merit on the basis of fair and open competition. This is in line with the Civil Service Commissioners' Recruitment Code. It means that all applicants are treated equally regardless of age, gender or marital status, ethnic origin or disability.
<P>

<a name="21106w13.html_para0">There are upper age limits for application to join the Diplomatic Service. Applicants must be able to complete at least one overseas tour before the normal retirement age. This allows us to achieve a sensible return on recruitment and training costs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the extent of human rights abuse in Zimbabwe; if he will list the human rights abuses perpetrated in Zimbabwe that have been <i>(a)</i> reported to and <i>(b)</i> investigated by his Department; and if he will make a statement.  [79327]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w13.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 Zimbabwe's human rights record is appalling. In its latest report on political violence dated 9 October, the Zimbabwe Human Rights NGO Forum recorded 223 cases of abduction/kidnapping, 7 of rape, 1057 of torture and 58 of murder, in the period 1 January to 30 September 2002. Most of the violence has been perpetrated by Zimbabwe's ruling party, ZANU(PF). The vast majority of victims are opposition supporters, or those suspected of being such.
<P>

<a name="21106w13.html_para1">The international community, including the UK, has consistently condemned these abuses and called on the Zimbabwe Government to respect their obligations under international human rights conventions. The EU, the US and others have imposed targeted sanction on the Mugabe regime and the Commonwealth has suspended Zimbabwe from its Councils.

[79326]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The food situation in Zimbabwe remains of serious concern. We, and other donors, are doing all we can&#151;through the UN World Food Programme and Non-Governmental Organisations&#151;to ensure that international aid reaches the needy regardless of their political views. There is credible evidence however that other sources of food, controlled by the ZANU PF regime, are being used in support of its political objectives. We deplore this, as well as the obstruction of the work of certain Non-Governmental Organisations, which also appears to be politically motivated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the prospects for foreign investment in Zimbabwe.  [79329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 The prospects for foreign investment in Zimbabwe are poor. Figures show that it has declined by 99 per cent. since 1998. The reasons are obvious. Zimbabwe is one of the world's fastest shrinking economies. It has lost the support of major donors and international financial institutions. Its skilled labour force, faced with over 70 per cent. unemployment, food shortages and 140 per cent. inflation, is leaving the country. On top of this, the current regime in Harare has undermined the rule of law and the right to hold private property.

 At the request of the Association of Chief Police Officers, which believes that the improved accuracy of the L21A1 baton round means it is suitable for use in serious public disorder and also in dealing with individuals posing an immediate threat to life in circumstances where use of a conventional firearm may otherwise be necessary, we have sought and received a medical statement from the Defence Scientific Advisory Council on the use of the L21A1 baton round at ranges from 1 to 19 metres. This supplements their earlier assessment of the injury potential over longer ranges published on 2 April 2001.
<P>

<a name="21106w13.html_para10">The statement confirms that the probability of unintentional impact to the most vulnerable parts of the body remains low when the round is discharged at ranges of less than 20 metres and that there is no significant change in the probability of rounds striking the potentially vulnerable chest area. This means that the likelihood of serious injury or death occurring as the result of the impact of an L21A1 baton round is no greater at ranges between 1 and 19 metres than at the longer ranges which were the subject of the earlier statement by the Defence Scientific Advisory Council.
<P>

<a name="21106w13.html_para11">I will today be placing a copy of the statement in the Library.

 The Protection from Harassment Act 1997 provides the legal framework for the prevention of offending, and punishment of those pursuing a course of conduct which is alarming or distressing to another, or in the worst cases causes another to fear violence. The Government are committed to reducing this type of crime, as with all violent crime, particularly when it is perpetrated against vulnerable individuals.

<a name="21106w14.html_para1">Following the 1997 legislation we commissioned the guide ''Stalking and other forms of harassment: An investigator's guide'', written by Hamish Brown from the Metropolitan Police.

I will be bringing forward new proposals in relation to any additional public authorities under Chapter II of Part I of RIPA following detailed public consultation. However, the RIPA does not provide for access to communications data for purposes relating to industrial action. A strict test of ''necessity'' must be met before any communications data is obtained under RIPA. An authorising officer must not only consider the communications data to be necessary but must also consider the conduct involved in obtaining the communications data to be ''proportionate'' to what it seeks to achieve. The grounds on which it is necessary, for example, include: in the interests of national security; for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime or of preventing disorder.

For the time being, even without the CRB check, the regulations and national minimum standards will help to improve standards and protect service users.

I have since increased this amount by #25 million, to help meet the increased humanitarian needs over the coming winter, and to help clear Afghanistan's arrears to the International Financial Institutions so that they can receive new concessional credits from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.

 Much has been achieved in Afghanistan over the last 10 months. There is peace and security in Kabul, a legitimate transitional Government, a new national currency, nearly 2 million refugees have returned home and 3 million children are in school.
<P>

<a name="21106w15.html_para4">But the situation remains fragile. Afghanistan is a desperately poor country and the south is facing its fifth year of drought and between 4 million and 6 million people are still dependent on food aid. The situation outside Kabul remains insecure, warlords control large militias and large parts of the economy are dependent on narcotics.
<P>

<a name="21106w15.html_para5">Further progress requires the establishment of security outside Kabul and an increase in the capacity of the Government to deliver services across the country. The UK will remain engaged to support continuing progress and development.

There is also an important role for UK civil society in strengthening civil society capacity within developing countries. The main channel of support to UK groups is through the Civil Society Challenge Fund which spends some #10 million a year. The aim is to support initiatives, implemented through an effective partnership with a developing country civil society organisation, which strengthens the capacity of that organisation to engage in local, national and international decision-making processes.<P>

 During 2002 it is estimated that between 20&#150;30 per cent. of the opium poppy crop was destroyed through a UK led eradication and compensation scheme. However a more permanent solution to the problem of poppy crop production will only come about once alternative livelihood opportunities have been identified for poor people, and the law is enforced against opium traders and other criminal elements. My department is working closely with the Afghan authorities to strengthen law enforcement, interdiction and eradication capabilities, and supporting a number of initiatives to improve security and the overall environment for the generation of alternative livelihoods. I also recently approved #1 million of support to a UNDP administered National Area Based Programme that is expected to generate thousands of jobs in rural areas, and #1 million of support to the Aga Khan Foundation for a rural support programme in Badakhshan, a major poppy producing province in Afghanistan.

 At the Annual Meetings Ministers recognised the special challenges faced by Africa in meeting the Millennium Development Goals.

They recognised that aid will be more effective where is it well co-ordinated and aligned with country-owned strategies. Further pledges to the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Trust Fund would benefit the 32 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa that receive debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative.

<P>

<a name="21106w16.html_para0">We welcome the positive steps that have been taken to reform EC development assistance in the past few years. These are beginning to show results in some areas, but significant improvements are still needed. We are pressing the EC to pursue its reform efforts vigorously in order to implement the November 2000 EC Development Policy, which for the first time makes poverty reduction the central objective of EC development programmes. Reform needs to produce speedier delivery, better impact and more capacity for policy dialogue in the field. Harmonising and simplifying the EC's cumbersome administrative and financial procedures is also a priority, along with work to establish a more coherent policy framework for EC aid.
<P>

<a name="21106w16.html_para1">My Department is also working for agreement that a much greater share of EC aid should be allocated to low income countries where it will have the greatest impact on poverty reduction. In 2000, only 38 per cent. of EC aid was spent in low-income countries compared to 70 per cent. in 1990. This is far too low and indicates that EC aid is having a much less impact than it should on reducing poverty and contributing to building stability and prosperity worldwide.

 DFID, the UN, and other donors in Zimbabwe work in close unison, and share the fundamental principle that humanitarian assistance should be provided on the basis of need alone. Donor funded programmes are closely monitored, and where problems are found or reported, the UN and donors are working together to seek to resolve them through mediation and complaints procedures. In a few cases, food distribution has been suspended until agreements have been reached that allow programmes to resume according to plan. The UN's view is that so far, very little food has been lost or diverted from its intended beneficiaries. We have not had any problems of this nature in our bilateral programme.

 UK assistance to Kosovo began in June 1999, immediately after the NATO intervention.

 The CITES Convention imposes strict controls on trade in bears and bear parts but does allow trade in captive bred species.

 Energy conservation authorities have identified their own targets, based on the measures in their energy conservation reports. The reports show measures that, if implemented, have the potential to achieve an overall improvement of 30 per cent. over twelve years from 1996. These targets are not statutory and it is for authorities, working in partnership with others, to implement the measures in order to meet them.

 The Government plan to use benchmarking of individual buildings against national standards in order to set a new energy consumption target for 2010. This target will require the central Government estate to be performing better than the national average. The analysis required to set a specific target is still underway but it is hoped that it will be in place in the coming year.

 It would be helpful to be able to make better comparisons between comparable authorities' performance. But this could only be achieved by having a single monitoring method. Defra has provided software to all authorities in England, free of charge, to help them monitor improvements in domestic energy efficiency. This is just one of a number of energy efficiency monitoring tools available. We believe that authorities should have the choice of which software package or monitoring method they use. They do, however, have to provide evidence as part of their annual progress reporting that they are using a robust monitoring method.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer of 26 September 20002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 247W, on GM crops, how many tests for unauthorised genetically modified organisms have been undertaken by the GM Inspectorate; and what proportion of them showed a presence of unauthorised genetically modified organisms.  [75838]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w20.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 21 October 2002]:</i> The GM Inspectorate has the authority to carry out testing for the presence of GMOs in two contexts: first, as part of inspection of authorised releases of GMOs into the environment, and, secondly, in support of the audit of seed importers and producers to ensure that non-GM seed stocks are free from unauthorised GM events.
<P>

<a name="21106w20.html_para2">Testing as part of the inspection of authorised releases of GMOs is carried out whenever there is reason to believe that material in addition to that for which consent is held has been released or to confirm the GM status of volunteer plants and bolters. However, the issue of testing of released GMOs is being considered as part of the proposed review inspection and enforcement activities. Since June 2000, there have been 3 tests (comprised of 41 analytical tests) of seed prior to sowing to confirm its purity and 32 tests of volunteers and bolters. None of these tests showed the presence of unauthorised GMOs.
<P>

<a name="21106w20.html_para3">Since June 2000 the GM Inspectorate has carried out a total of 86 audits of seed companies. These audits have monitored the precautions that seed companies have taken as regards the adventitious presence of GM events in seeds. As part of this process a series of tests (18) have been carried out to clarify results presented by seed companies. In no case was the presence of an unauthorised GMO detected.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In Lancashire, in common with the rest of the country, the sustainability of many dairy farming enterprises has been adversely affected by low farmgate milk prices. The reasons for these low prices are complex, but include high levels of production earlier in the year combined with the effects of low world prices for dairy commodities. The average farmgate price of milk has recovered from its seasonal low in May, but it is still too low for many dairy farmers to be able to maintain the level of investment required to sustain their businesses.
<P>

<a name="21106w21.html_para3">The prices negotiated between farmers and purchasers, or indeed processors and retailers, are private commercial matters in which the Government cannot get involved. Nevertheless, I do welcome the recent price rises announced by major retailers and dairy processors and hope that these will help alleviate some of the difficulties faced by dairy farmers. The Government can influence the environment in which price negotiations take place through the mechanisms of the dairy CAP and, during the period of lowest prices, we actively supported measures taken in Brussels to support Community markets and encourage exports.

Member States are required under European legislation to cross-check all animals subject to bovine subsidy against their cattle tracing databases. The Rural Payments Agency (RPA) has accordingly cross-checked 



claimed animals against the British Cattle Movement Service (BCMS Cattle Tracing System (CTS)). All cross checks have been completed and RPA has discovered a large number of discrepancies. Many of these arise because of the failure by cattle keepers to notify the CTS when animals are born, die or are moved. This has resulted in RPA being unable to meet the statutory payment deadlines in all cases on bovine schemes, although it is making every effort to ensure all outstanding payments are made as soon as possible. The RPA regrets the delays and the impact on farmer's cash flow, but cannot ignore the discrepancies discovered.<P>

 In June, my Department issued the results of a risk assessment on the use of composting to dispose of catering waste and animal by-products. The objective of this study was to determine the risks to public and animal health from the land-spreading of the catering wastes after treatment by composting or in a biogas plant and to compare these with the risks from existing disposal routes.
<P>

<a name="21106w22.html_para6">In summary, the project determined whether current composting processes give a sufficient degree of pathogen destruction such that the risks to humans and animals are acceptably low and the material may be safely spread to land. The composting route for catering waste potentially presents lower risks to grazing animals than disposal through land-fill. This is because composting offers extra control points. First, the raw catering waste could be delivered to enclosed receptions where birds and animals cannot gain access. Second, a no-grazing period could be enforced after application of the compost to land. Following the risk assessment, we hope to consult shortly on amendments to the Animal By-Products Order which would allow catering waste to be composted and used on land as a soil conditioner rather than going to landfill.

The funding available from the Bio-energy Capital Grants Scheme could deliver about 100MW of generating capacity. Discussions are continuing on the future of ARBRE and there are a number of lessons from the project that can be applied to future high efficiency biomass plants. The project has shown that short rotation coppice can be established and grown at the scale required to form an important element of the fuel supply.

 The UK has consistently opposed the registration of feta cheese as an EU protected food name on the grounds that we believed that the name ''feta'' had become a generic product and so not eligible for protection. However, in the absence of a contrary decision by the Council, feta was registered by the Commission as a protected food name on 15 October. While disappointed with this particular outcome, we are satisfied in general with the protected food name scheme and the procedures for registration of products. The scheme was highlighted by the Curry Commission Report on the Future of Farming Food as being a useful opportunity for UK producers to protect the character of their product and secure a premium price for it.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what action the Government are taking to stop imports of Brazilian mahogany.  [79000]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w24.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 International trade in Brazilian mahogany is controlled under the terms of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) to which the UK is a party. Brazilian big leaf mahogany is listed in Appendix III of the Convention which requires that mahogany exported must have been acquired in accordance with the national laws for the protection of fauna and flora. Where importers of mahogany present an export permit issued by the Management Authority in Brazil confirming that the mahogany has been legally acquired, imports are allowed.
<P>

<a name="21106w24.html_para6">However, we are concerned about the current position with relation to mahogany imports from Brazil. A proposal is currently under discussion at the Conference of the CITES Parties to list Brazilian big leaf mahogany on Appendix II. The UK along with the rest of the European Union is supporting this proposal which would allow importing states to reach their own scientific judgement as to the sustainability of the trade.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs in which areas of the country flood insurance cover is not available; and if she will make a statement.  [76281]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Association of British Insurers have stated that all properties defended to at least a standard of 1.3 per cent. (1 in 75) annual probability, should be able to obtain cover. Properties currently protected to a lesser extent, but where defences to meet the above standard are planned for the next 5 years, should also be able to get cover. The ABI have assured us that undefended properties or ''exceptional cases'' will be assessed on an individual basis and consideration given as to whether some form of insurance cover can be given. Many of the properties which the ABI estimate will not be able to obtain cover, have never have been able to get flood insurance.
<P>

<a name="21106w24.html_para7">The decision to move away from the existing agreement means that, in the majority of cases, people can and should shop around for the best deal. However, it must be recognised that insurance companies need to take a commercial decision as to what risk they will cover and on what terms. It is impossible to make a generalisation about areas where flood cover will be unavailable as in a competitive market as what is unacceptable to one company may well be acceptable to another.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what opinions the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment has received from the Advisory Committee on Feedingstuffs (ACAF) on the dossier of evidence presented by Aventis in support of its application for marketing consent for T25 GM maize, with particular reference to their opinion on the chicken

feeding study; and if she will place a copy of ACAF's opinion in respect of <i>(a)</i> the whole dossier and <i>(b)</i> the chicken feeding study in the Library.  [4932]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 July 2002]:</i> At the request of the department, The Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) has, since November 2000, been considering the criticisms of the safety of Aventis' (formerly AgrEvo and now Bayer Cropscience) GM maize, T25, which has been raised at the hearing into the addition of CHARDON LL (a variety of T25) to the national list of seeds. ACRE subsequently requested advice from ACAF on the animal feed aspects of the criticisms.
<P>

<a name="21106w25.html_para0">AgrEvo applied in 1995 through the French authorities for approval under EU directive 90/220 to place its GM T25 maize on the European market for cultivation and use as animal feed. In June 1995 France circulated the dossier to the other member states with the recommendation that T25 maize be given approval. After due consideration European Union member states approved the marketing of T25 maize in 1998. As part of this process ACRE considered the French opinion and dossier supporting the application and gave its advice to the government in June 1996. This was prior to the formation of ACAF. The chicken feeding study was not part of the original dossier submitted in 1996 and so was not considered by ACRE. A summary of the study was circulated by the French in 1997 as supplementary information on the nutritional qualities of the maize. The French authorities were of the view that the study did not add any significant new information to the dossier. Officials in MAFF considered the study, but as it was a nutritional rather than a safety study, it was not sent to ACRE.
<P>

<a name="21106w25.html_para1"><P>

<a name="21106w25.html_para2">In reconsidering aspects of the T25 maize dossier ACRE has asked ACAF to look at the available data and advise on the substance of the criticisms raised at the CHARDONLL hearing in relation to animal feed and in particular the mortality rate in the chicken study. The growth rates in the two groups were broadly equivalent, but of the 140 fed T25 maize grain, 10 chicks (7 per cent.) died, whereas only 5 of the 140 (3.5 per cent.) died in the control group. In this type of experiment up to 8 per cent. would be expected to die. So the mortality rate is within the expected range. The question raised in the CHARDONLL is whether this is of concern and worthy of further investigation.
<P>

<a name="21106w25.html_para3">A copy of the letter of 5 September 2001 from ACAF to ACRE setting out the committee's views on the whole dossier and the chicken feeding study has been placed in the Library. A copy is also on the public register held by my Department in Ashdown House
<P>

<a name="21106w25.html_para4">In summary, ACAF is satisfied that, on the basis of the information presented by AgroEvo, there is nothing to indicate that T25 maize grain or its products pose any more risk to animals or humans than non-GM maize varieties if used in animal feed. I have asked ACAF for their reasons for this conclusion. However, ACAF advised ACRE that the data in the dossier are not sufficient to conclude at this stage, that T25 silage (rather than grain) is substantially equivalent to other maize varieties. Although it is unlikely that T25 maize silage is unsafe to feed to animals, its equivalence should 



<P>
<P><I>6 Nov 2002 : Column 377W</I><P>
be confirmed. The UK regulatory authority has subsequently written to Aventis to request further data on the composition of T25 silage.
<P>

<a name="21106w25.html_para5">ACRE has given preliminary advice that nothing has been raised that warrants taking immediate action under the directive to withdraw T25 maize from the market. ACRE will shortly be issuing its advice on concerns raised during the CHARDON LL hearing, including criticisms of the chicken feeding study. This advice will also include ACRE's response to points raised at its T25 maize open hearing held in February 2002. At their hearing the Committee, in conjunction with ACAF, invited a number of witnesses and experts including Dr. Kestin and Dr. Knowles. Guided by the evidence taken at this meeting, any subsequent comments on the evidence from the public and the background information that is already available, ACRE will advise Ministers further on the validity of the T25 risk assessment.

Within this, companies are being asked how many geoscientists are currently working for their organisation on the UKCS and how this compares with 3 years ago. The survey will conclude by December 2002, and the results will then be analysed and presented to PILOT in due course.

 I am pleased to say that the Department and four Regional Development Agencies (East Midlands, South East England, East of England, and West Midlands) jointly funded a major industry-led initiative called Energy Efficient MotorSport (EEMS). An EEMS working group was established, consisting of a number of companies and individuals with relevant interest and expertise which resulted in a feasibility study published in August 2002, which was commissioned through the Motorsport Industry Association (MIA).
<P>

<a name="21106w26.html_para4">The aim of the study was to assess the role that motorsport could play in the promotion and development of energy efficiency automotive technologies. A follow up EEMS presentation was recently made by the MIA to the world governing body of motorsport to explore how the proposals of the study could be demonstrated in a motor racing context. DTI, RDAs and other involved in the EEMS initiative are planning an industry showcase event and other activities to encourage industry to implement its findings.

 <i>[holding answer 4 November 2002]:</i> Earlier this year I commissioned a study into the resilience of the electricity transmission and distribution systems in Great Britain. The study focussed on the measures that are in place to reduce the risk of an emergency from major supply interruptions and the ability to manage the restoration of supplies in the event of widespread disruption. One conclusion arising from the report was that the electricity companies are generally better prepared and equipped to handle emergencies than was the case a decade ago.
<P>

<a name="21106w28.html_para5">On 29 October 2002 I announced that another study will be commissioned to review how the electricity companies handled the emergency commencing on 27 October 2002. The preparation for the storm and response of Aquila Network Services, which distributes electricity to homes in Gloucestershire, will be included in the study.

 My Department, together with DfT, DEFRA and HMT, published the Powering Future Vehicles Strategy on 31 July. This declares Government targets for the introduction of low-carbon vehicles. The strategy not only seeks to achieve environmental improvements, but to engage UK industry in the development of new technologies and products such as hybrid and fuel cell vehicles. As part of the process, my department is supporting the creation of the Low Carbon Vehicles Partnership (LowCVP), with Professor Jim Skea of the Policy Studies Institute as Launch Director.
<P>

<a name="21106w28.html_para7">One of the first tasks of the LowCVP will be to advise on the role and remit of a new Centre of Excellence for ''Low Carbon and Fuel Cell Technologies'', to implement one of the recommendations of the Automotive Innovation and Growth Team, which reported earlier this year. My Department has announced #15 million support over 5 years for this and the other proposed Centre of Excellence on transport telematics. In addition the Department's Foresight Vehicle and Advanced Fuel Cells Programmes support the development of enabling technologies for alternative fuel vehicles.

<P>

<a name="21106w29.html_para3">Representations have been received from both the Governments of Norway, Finland, Denmark and Sweden and organisations representing fisheries industries in Scandinavia. The representations have centred on concerns that technetium-99, which does not occur naturally but is discharged from Sellafield, can be detected at very low levels, in marine organisms off the coasts of Scandinavian countries. All radioactive discharges from a site such as Sellafield have to be made within the limits of discharge authorizations set by the Environment Agency. The current levels of discharge of technetium-99 are well within the relevant discharge limit. At Ministers' request, the Environment Agency has recently reviewed the discharges of technetium-99 and made recommendations about how its discharge limit could be further reduced. The Government is currently considering its response to the Agency's recommendations.

In the academic year 2002&#150;03, a student parent with one child may receive a childcare grant of up to #5,724 (with two or more children up to #8,480). This may be supplemented by other dependants grants and discretionary support.

<a name="21106w31.html_wqn8"><B> Mrs. Calton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills, how many letters were received in support of Option 5 from <i>(a)</i> constituents and <i>(b)</i> schools in the F40 authorities.  [79440]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w31.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="21106w31.html_para11">The Government have received around 55,000 letters responding to the Formula Grant Review. The majority, around 53,000, are part of the campaign run by the F40 group of authorities, who have asked for a further option to be developed for education funding. However, we do not record the details of the senders of campaign letters as a matter of course. For this reason, and since very many of those 53,000 letters are multiple copies of the same letter sent by the same people to different Ministers, it is not possible to provide a more detailed analysis except at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="21106w31.html_para12">We are currently taking decisions on the new system to replace SSAs. As we do so we are carefully considering the full range of evidence, pressures and points that have been put to us.

<a name="21106w32.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Willis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what grants were made through the school improvement grant in each local education authority in 2001&#150;02.  [79470]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w32.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 A total of #213 million was available through the Standards Fund School Improvement Grant in the 2001&#150;02 Financial Year. Individual allocations, including the contributions from local education authorities, are shown in the following table.
<P>

<a name="21106w32.html_para0">Sixty per cent. of the grant is devolved to all maintained schools to raise levels of pupil attainment by funding activities in School Development, Post-Ofsted and Raising Attainment Plans. Fifteen per cent. of the grant is targeted at schools in special measures and secondary schools facing challenging circumstances to bring about urgent improvements. Five per cent. of the grant was to support direct interventions in schools facing challenging circumstances. The remainder is designed to achieve the priorities set out in local education authorities' Educational Development Plans.

 Over 200,000 teachers applied and were successful in Round 1 of Performance Threshold (97 per cent. of applications) and a further 31,000 successfully achieved threshold status in Round 2 (95 per cent. of applications to date). Teachers who were placed on point 1 of the Upper Pay Scale in Round 1 were first eligible to progress to point 2 in September 2002.

<P>
<a name="21106w33.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Children's Fund is responsible for implementation of 149 Children's Fund programmes (Annex A) across England. The Fund is being rolled out in three waves, and to date 40 plans in Wave 1 and 50 plans in Wave 2 have been approved. The remaining 59 plans in Wave 3 will be submitting proposals at the end of the year, and approved plans will begin operating from April 2003. Programmes bring together local voluntary organisations, statutory agencies, community and faith groups, children and young people and their families to deliver a range of locally co-ordinated preventive services for 5&#150;13 year olds at risk. Examples of activities include bi-lingual home/school liaison projects, helping children with behavioural difficulties,

<P>

<a name="21106w33.html_para0">The Children and Young People's Unit gather information on all services supported by the Children's Fund on a quarterly basis. The most recent information available from 38 out of 40 Wave 1 partnerships shows that 584 services were supported during April&#150;June 2002 (Annex B). No information was gathered from Wave 2 partnerships for April&#150;June 2002 because the majority of partnerships only received approval in April 2002. The CYPU is gathering service information on all Wave 1 and 2 partnerships for the period July&#150;September 2002, and this information should be available later this year. It is too soon for the programme to provide an accurate indication of the direct impact on children and their families, but early feedback from children, parents, teachers and other professionals is positive. Individual programmes are already making a difference in improving school attendance, tackling behavioural problems and promoting positive parenting.
<P>

<a name="21106w33.html_para1">The Children and Young People's Unit are in the process of selecting a contractor for a national evaluation of the Children's Fund, and work is expected to begin early in 2003. This will draw on the results of local evaluations of achievement against measurable targets which individual partnerships are required to carry out.

All correspondence received at QCA is responded to and dealt with by the relevant team or division. It is therefore not possible to give the figures requested without incurring disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="21106w33.html_para2">The procedures for dealing with complaints fall within QCA's Customer Service Charter and are responded to within the 5-day turn-around time described in the charter. QCA replies to any general complaints under their Customer Service Charter. Where schools have concern about the quality of marking of their pupils' scripts and consider that they may have been awarded an incorrect level, a review of marking can be requested. The arrangements for seeking a review of marking are included in QCA's Schools' Guide, sent to schools each year. An application for a review of marking is considered by a panel of senior markers led by the Lead Chief Marker for the subject. Any re-marking that occurs as part of the review procedure is undertaken by a review or senior marker.
<P>

<a name="21106w33.html_para3">The number of reviews of marking requested in 2002 is not yet available although early estimates have not shown any significant increase on previous years' figures.

 Details of Standards Fund expenditure by local education authorities for 2001&#150;02 are not held centrally. Some #197m was made available to authorities in 2001&#150;02 through Standards Fund grant for the recruitment and training of teaching assistants, as set out below. 95 per cent. of this grant was required to be devolved to schools. Schools have freedom to move funding between Standards Fund headings according to their own detailed needs and priorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many teachers in each local education authority were entitled to a golden hello in 2001&#150;02.  [79467]<P>

<P>
<a name="21106w35.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The information is not available in the form requested. The table shows provisional data on the number of claims for reimbursement of Golden Hello payments received by my Department in respect of the 2001&#150;02 financial year. The payments comprise a mixture of ''old-style'', #2,500 Golden Hellos paid on appointment to a relevant post and ''new-style'', #4,000 Golden Hellos paid on successful completion of induction. The number of newly-qualified teachers who were eligible to receive an ''old-style'' payment in 2001&#150;02, but exercised their right to claim a ''new-style'' Golden Hello later is not known.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills how many newly qualified teachers in each local education authority were entitled to induction support in 2001&#150;02.  [79468]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w35.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 All Newly Qualified Teachers (NQTs) who take up a post of one term or more in a maintained school, or non-maintained special school, are entitled to induction. This includes a 10 per cent. reduced timetable, ongoing support and guidance, and an individually tailored induction programme. NQTs can also undertake induction in independent schools and sixth-form colleges, although there is no statutory obligation to do so in such institutions.
<P>

<a name="21106w35.html_para1">The information on the number of NQTs undertaking induction in each LEA is now held by the General Teaching Council for England (GTCE). The information for the academic year 2001&#150;2002 will be available in the next few days and I will write to the hon. Member as soon as I have it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w35.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department does not routinely collect information on the number of formal warnings issued under section 15 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, nor on the number of these that lead to the subsequent use of the intervention powers by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="21106w35.html_para2">Any decisions to issue such warnings and to use such powers are for local education authorities. Statutory guidance on the use of formal warning notices was given in Annex 2 of the Code of Practice on Local Education Authority-School Relations in February 2001. A copy of this guidance is in the Library.

<P>
<a name="21106w35.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 We are developing a package of measures to deliver our commitment to enhance the take up of sporting opportunities by 5 to 16-year-olds by increasing the percentage of school children who spend a minimum of 2 hours each week during term time on high-quality PE and school sport. Our Swimming Strategy was announced on 17 October. Part of that Strategy, the Swimming Charter which will be published in 2003, will provide non-statutory guidance to schools on how much time to allocate for swimming specifically as part of this commitment to enhance sporting opportunities for children. Other details of the strategy, including the criteria to be used to select the areas for remedial swimming pilots, funding to be made available and details of increased training for PE teachers in swimming and water safety, are being developed. The Department does not collect data on how many schools ask for parental contributions for curriculum swimming lessons. Some 20 per cent. of children aged 11 years old fail to meet National Curriculum standards in swimming (Swimming In Key Stage 2: An Inspection Report on Standards and Provision; OFSTED, 2000).

Information on how interested parties can respond to the document will be made available when it is published.

 In introducing the new system of LEA funding for 2003&#150;04, we will implement the pledge that no local education authority will lose out in real terms in 2003&#150;04. The Education Act 2002 incorporates a reserve power that allows the Secretary of State for Education and Skills to set a minimum budget for an authority's schools, if the budget proposed by an authority is

<P><I>6 Nov 2002 : Column 418W</I><P>
seriously inadequate. Changes in the funding of individual schools depend very largely on changes in their pupil numbers. It is open to LEAs, if they wish, to include factors in their school funding formulae which have the effect of protecting individual schools from excessive year-to year reductions in their budget shares.

 The Government's planning policies for housing are set out in PPG3 (Planning Policy Guidance note 3, <i>Housing</i>). PPG3 explains that planned extensions to existing urban areas are likely to prove the next most sustainable option for new housing development after building on appropriate sites within urban areas, and that new settlements can be large-scale additions to existing settlements or freestanding. PPG3 does not define urban extension or new settlement in any further detail.

 We are committed to making it easier for people buying and selling homes through the introduction of a seller's pack, and the necessary legislation will be introduced as soon as Parliamentary time allows. The seller's pack will make the home buying and selling process more transparent and certain, and so reduce the stress and wasted costs suffered by hundreds of thousands of consumers each year when transactions fail or are delayed.

 Anecdotal evidence from various sources, including local authorities and media advertisements, strongly suggested that the right to buy rules were being exploited in some areas. Researchers at Heriot-Watt University have been commissioned to investigate the scale, nature and impact of such exploitation. The results are expected by the end of this

 Where a child is suspected to be suffering, or likely to suffer significant harm, local authority social services departments are required by section 47 of the Children Act 1989 to make enquiries, to enable the local authority to decide whether it should take any action to safeguard or promote the child's welfare.

<P>

<a name="21106w40.html_para3">Where, following the outcome of section 47 enquiries, the agencies most involved judge that a child may continue to suffer, or to be at risk of suffering significant harm, the social services department should convene an initial child protection conference. The aim of the conference is to enable those professionals most involved with the child and family to assess all relevant information; to make judgements about the likelihood of a child suffering significant harm in future; and to decide what future action is needed to safeguard the child and promote his or her welfare, how that action will be taken forward, and with what intended outcomes.
<P>

<a name="21106w40.html_para4">If a decision is taken that the child is at continuing risk of significant harm, his or her name will be placed on the child protection register, and it will therefore be the case that safeguarding the child requires inter-agency help and intervention delivered through a formal child protection plan. It is also the role of the conference to formulate the outline child protection plan, in as much detail as possible.
<P>

<a name="21106w40.html_para5">A child's name may not be placed on the register, but he or she may nonetheless be in need of help to promote his or her health or development.

<a name="21106w40.html_para9">The Government has welcomed the publication of this report. The Government recognises that there is still more to be done to ensure that the high standards of child protection are applied in every case. That is why it commissioned the Joint Chief Inspectors' report. It is also why my right hon. Friends, the Secretary of State for Health and the Home Secretary set up the statutory Inquiry, chaired by Lord Laming, into the circumstances leading up to, and surrounding, the death of Victoria Climbi&#233;. The issues raised by Victoria's case are wide-ranging, in terms of both policy and practice, and it is therefore important that we do not do anything that would pre-empt the outcome of the Inquiry. The recommendations of the Joint Chief Inspectors' report and those of the Victoria Climbi&#233; Inquiry will provide us with an authoritative basis for any reforms to child protection that may need to be made, and if radical reform is necessary we will implement it. The Government will respond to both reports after it has carefully considered them.

<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w41.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The impact of the European Working Time Directive (EWTD) has been taken into account with the planned expansion in the consultant workforce. The NHS Plan makes a commitment to 1,000 more specialist registrars by 2004. In addition, we have introduced a ''floors and ceilings'' flexibility to allow the National Health Service with an initial ceiling of an additional 540 posts for the period of 2002&#150;2004 and this will reviewed later this year.
<P>

<a name="21106w41.html_para6">Many solutions to achieve EWTD compliance for junior doctors will involve other professions. Large increases in the nursing workforce and allied health professions have already been achieved and there is a commitment to maintain these levels of growth. These increases in the non-medical workforce will support the development of the non-medical practitioner roles required. The main impact of these practitioners will be in reducing the need to cover at senior house officer level.
<P>

<a name="21106w41.html_para7">It will be inevitable that the changes needed to achieve EWTD compliance will significantly affect the working patterns of doctors in training and also change the traditional one-to-one relationship between a training grade doctor and their consultant.

<a name="21106w41.html_para8">The Department is currently undertaking a consultation exercise on the Chief Medical Officer's report <i>Unfinished Business: Proposals for reform of the Senior House Officer grade</i>. The report provides proposals for reform of postgraduate medical training, taking into account that proposed reform would be introduced at the same time as implementation of the EWTD. The report argues that the EWTD and training reform are mutually dependent&#151;the EWTD will require reform in training, which in turn can support implementation of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="21106w41.html_para9">A key proposal in <i>Unfinished Business</i> is that new and shorter higher specialist training programmes should be introduced which would lead to the award of an earlier certificate of completion of specialist training (CCST) for those satisfactorily completing training in the ''generalist'' elements of a specialty.

 In this financial year #28 million was allocated to health authorities to help them to meet the NHS Plan targets for community equipment services.

 <i>[holding answer 31 October 2002]:</i> Following publication of the Commission for Health Improvement report into the care of elderly patients at the hospital, the Chief Medical Officer commissioned Professor Richard Baker to undertake a clinical audit. As the hon. Member is aware there is also an ongoing police investigation. It would be inappropriate for me to comment further until the results of both investigations are clear.

describing how national commitments translate into targets for the National Health Service and social services. The process and timetable for developing plans at a local level were also contained in this document.
<P>

<a name="21106w44.html_para1">The new planning process involves streamlining current arrangements into a planning system based on a single three year local delivery plan. This process will be reinforced by the announcement of three year financial allocations to primary care trusts, giving the NHS locally the ability to plan for the medium term more effectively than in the past.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will set out his definition of obesity in children. [78429]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="21106w44.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 October]:</i> The simple classification of body mass index (BMI) for obesity in adults is not applicable to children. This is because the ratio of the rate of weight gain to height gain changes during normal growth, especially around puberty. Therefore, age and sex-specific reference data&#151;centile cut-off points&#151;are necessary to interpret the BMI measurement.
<P>

<a name="21106w44.html_para2">There is on going debate as to the most appropriate cut-off point to define obesity in childhood. Two different approaches are commonly used and both demonstrate that the prevalence of obesity is increasing in children in England.

<P>
<a name="21106w44.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 An estimated 1.3 million people in England have diagnosed diabetes, of whom around 85 per cent. have Type 2 diabetes. A break down in the form requested is not available. However, the frequency of diabetes is higher in men than in women. Prevalence rises steeply with age. Type 2 diabetes is up to six times more common in people of South Asian descent and up to three times more common in those of African and African-Caribbean descent, compared with the white population. It is also more common in people of Chinese descent and other non-white groups.
