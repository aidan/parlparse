 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what rights of appeal are available to parties to the Board of Inquiry into the USAF F-15 accident in Scotland on 26 March 2001.  [62826]</p>




<p><a name="st_0"><a name="60418w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 Normally the findings of a Board of Inquiry are not open to appeal and there is no statutory appeal mechanism within the Air Force Act 1955. However a person subject to air force law who thinks himself wronged in relation to any matter relating to his Service may, by virtue of section 180 Air Force Act 1955, submit a Redress of Complaint through the chain of command to the Air Force Board acting as the Defence Council. Any airman so affected, by the findings of a Board, could lodge such a Redress but the complaint must normally have been lodged within three months of the commission of the wrong complained of. A decision of the Air Force Board is susceptible to judicial review proceedings in the High Court.

<a name="60418w01.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_0">Secondly, and extra-regulationally, if new and significant evidence became available, in relation to an accident, which might have a bearing on issues of causation, and at the sole discretion of the Convening Authority, it would be open to the Convening Authority to re-open the BOI for the Board to reconsider its findings in the light of any new and compelling evidence.

<p><a name="st_1"><a name="60418w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 Completion of the Board of Inquiry was delayed awaiting the outcome of Court Martial proceedings and to allow the air traffic controller to fully exercise his rights under Queens Regulations 1269 to comment on the Board report.

The proposal exempts products that have a recognised level of safety including those containing substances that have been entered into Annex II of Council Regulation EEC/2377/90.

 Under EU legislation, routine TB testing is carried out annually or biennially in parishes with a historically higher number of bovine TB incidents in cattle. This is reduced to testing every four years in parishes with historically low or no TB incidents. TB reactors are removed for slaughter and the owner is compensated using a new table-based valuation system, which was introduced on 1 February. The rest of the herd are placed under movement restrictions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w06.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_25">In addition, we introduced compulsory pre-movement testing of cattle in England on 27 March, which will help to reduce the risk of spreading TB through cattle movements. The legislation applies to cattle over 15 months of age moving from one and two-year tested herds. It will be extended to movements of cattle over 42-days-old on 1 March 2007.

<a name="stpa_26">Improved diagnosis of TB in cattle is a major objective of Defra&#039;s wide-ranging research programme. The laboratory-based gamma-interferon test is not sufficiently specific to replace the TB test but use of the two tests in parallel has the potential to significantly increase the detection of infected cattle in herds where TB has been confirmed. Preparations are being made for wider use of the gamma interferon test in prescribed circumstances.

<p>
<a name="60418w06.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_27">In this country, the main wildlife reservoir of bovine TB is in badgers. A public consultation on both the principle and method of a badger culling policy in areas of high TB incidence in cattle was launched on 15 December 2005. This has now closed and we received more than 35,000 responses. These responses will be analysed carefully over the coming weeks to inform decisions alongside other available evidence.

 There is no persuasive scientific evidence which either confirms or refutes the theory that some animals with mineral deficient diets might have increased susceptibility to tuberculosis, particularly those in areas where soils are deficient in trace elements such as selenium.

The former has now been addressed in the Waste Management (England and Wales) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006 No. 937) which were laid before the House on 30 March 2006.

 The Department for Constitutional Affairs is the Government Department responsible for upholding justice, rights and democracy. The Department&#039;s aim is to provide for effective and accessible justice for all, to ensure the rights and responsibilities of the citizen, and to modernise the law and constitution.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w12.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_86">Currently, the Department has four strategic objectives, which cover the delivery of justice, civil and administrative law, protecting the vulnerable, modernising the constitution, increasing consumer choice and working in partnership with the independent judiciary. The Department also has five public service agreement targets to help deliver its strategic objectives, three of which are shared with the other criminal justice departments and agencies.

<a name="60418w12.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_87">It will be clear that the range of the Department&#039;s policies and actions is wide and the statistical information relating to it is not normally collected on a constituency basis. Consequently, the information requested in the question cannot be provided in the form requested except at a disproportionate cost. However, general statistical information about the Department&#039;s activities can be found at: http://www.dca.gov.uk/statistics/statfr.htm.

<p>
<a name="60418w12.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_88">An example of the information available on this site is statistical data on the speed with which persistent young offenders are brought to justice. The average number of days from arrest to sentence for persistent young offenders sentenced during the period from October to December 2005 was 86 days in the Metropolitan police force area, and 72 days in the Islington Basic Command Unit (BCD) area. These figures compare with 160 days in the Metropolitan police force area in the 1997 calendar year.

 The Representation of the People Regulations 2002 provide that electors may opt out of the edited version of the register of electors if they do not want their details to be sold to anyone for any purpose. Any attempt to use legislation to impose a retrospective ban on the use of information derived from pre-2002 electoral registers, though, is likely to be impracticable and unenforceable since this may be provided by commercial organisations based outside of the UK against whom the sanctions of UK law cannot be applied. Electors who do not want their details to be used by commercial organisations may wish to approach the mailing or telephone preference services requesting deletion from company records or publicly

 No advice is issued centrally to EROs on prosecuting those who fail to return an electoral registration form.

EROs are aware of their powers under electoral law to initiate prosecutions against those who commit the offence of failing to give, or providing false, information required for the purposes of maintaining registers of parliamentary and local government electors. As this is a matter for local discretion, records of such prosecutions are not held centrally and therefore the information relating to prosecutions could be obtained only at a disproportionate cost.

 We know of six political activists in long term detention in Belarus. The Belarusian authorities announced on 29 March that approximately 500 people had been detained following the elections. Of these: 288 were sentenced to 10 days administrative arrest; 112 sentenced to 15 days administrative arrest; 53 were minors released without charge: and 21 were foreign nationals, 14 of whom were sentenced from 3&#150;14 days administrative arrest. Unofficial sources suggest however that the number of arrests may be significantly higher, with estimates for the total number of arrests ranging from 700&#150;1200, possibly including foreign nationals. It is not clear how many of these remain in detention. This number includes Aleksander Kozulin (now released), an opposition leader and presidential candidate, political activists, members of non governmental organisations, journalists and members of the public who were protesting about the results of an election which was not free and fair.

In October 2005, the EU General Affairs Council concluded that the adoption by the Colombian Congress of the Justice and Peace Law was a significant development, since it provides an overall legal framework for DDK in Colombia. The Council noted that it had many concerns over the law, but it believed that if the law was effectively and transparently implemented it would make a positive contribution to the search for peace in Colombia.

President Putin stressed at the time of the announcement that Russia would continue to meet all its delivery requirements to European customers. More generally, the agreement reflects strengthening trade, economic and energy co-operation and bilateral links between China and Russia. Diversification of China&#039;s energy portfolio towards greater use of gas as a cleaner energy source and as a substitute for coal is good for climate change reasons.

 The overall security situation in Sierra Leone is generally calm, but fragile. The situation had sufficiently improved to allow the full departure of the UN peacekeeping force, the United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone, at the end of 2005. There has been progress on improving the training, leadership and professionalism of the Sierra Leone Army and Police forces. A UK-led International Military Assistance and Training Team has aided much of this reform by close co-operation with the Army and will remain in Sierra Leone until at least 2010. They currently have

 In addition to performance monitoring reports from local authorities submitted in relation to their homelessness grants, three studies have been particularly significant in helping to assess the impact of homelessness grants in preventing homelessness and leading to a sustained reduction in new cases of homelessness since the end of 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w31.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_22">In February 2005, the National Audit Office published a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General (HC286 Session 2004&#150;05), More than a roof: Progress in tackling homelessness&quot;, following an examination of the work of the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s Homelessness and Housing Support Directorate. The examination considered the directorate&#039;s impact in achieving the Government&#039;s targets to reduce rough sleeping and end the use of bed and breakfast hotels as long-term accommodation for families with children, and in developing new approaches to tackling homelessness. It found that the directorate&#039;s target setting, combined with directed financial support and advice, had helped to bring about significant achievements.

<p>
<a name="60418w31.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_23">In December 2005 the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister published the results of a survey of local authorities about homelessness. This included information about the wide range of prevention schemes that local authorities are using currently and their plans for future prevention activities. The survey report included estimates of the impact of homelessness prevention in reducing the use of temporary accommodation by preventing crises and helping households to settle and of the efficiency savings that they plan to make. The ODPM has also commissioned Heriot-Watt University to evaluate a range of homelessness prevention initiatives in case study local authorities and to produce good practice guidance for local authorities about the effectiveness of homelessness prevention. This project has now reported and the research and guidance will be published within the next three months.

<a name="stpa_34">Part 1 of the Civil Contingencies Act 2004 establishes a statutory framework for civil protection activity at the local level. Under this legislation all principal local authorities are required to maintain emergency plans and business continuity arrangements, informed by risk assessments, to ensure that they can mobilise an effective emergency response, and are able to continue to exercise their other functions during a full range of emergencies, including health emergencies. The legislation also requires local authorities and other key partners to exercise these plans. The performance of English local authorities against the duties set out in the Act will be assessed by the Audit Commission as part of the Comprehensive Performance Assessment.

1.Figures rounded to the nearest 100 thousand.<br>

2.Incomes below 60 per cent. of contemporary median is a measure of &#039;relative&#039; low income.<br>

3.Estimates of income, and whether households were not in receipt of council tax benefit, relate to the household&#039;s status at the time they were interviewed for the FRS. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect the composition of the household). The median relates to the middle-ranked individual.<br>





4.The estimates are based on sample survey counts, which have been adjusted for non-response and a number of other variables. Estimates are subject to both sampling error, and to the remaining variability in non-response which is not corrected by the adjustment method.<br>

<a name="stpa_49">People fail to take up their benefit rights, including council tax benefit, for a number of reasons. For example, the increasing number of home owners compared to tenants has had an impact on the number of people claiming council tax benefit. This is because home owners are likely to have less contact with the benefit system while tenants normally make a claim to council tax benefit at the same time as they make their claim for housing benefit.

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_12">As at the end of December, of those cases that progressed to calculation since the introduction of the new scheme, the average time from first contact to calculation was 177 days (25 weeks). Of such cases, 24 per cent. received a calculation in less that 6 weeks; 49 per cent. between 6 weeks and 6 months; 16 per cent. between 6 months and a year; and 11 per cent. took more than a year.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_13">It should be noted, however, that the Agency does not regard an application as being cleared once a calculation alone has been carried out, but once collection arrangements have been agreed with the non resident. Additionally, since not all Child Support Agency applications result in a calculation, an application is also defined as cleared if the case is closed, the parent with care is identified as claiming Good Cause or is subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision, or the application is identified as being a change of circumstances on an existing case as opposed to a new application.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_14">As of the end of December 2005, for all cases cleared since the introduction of the new scheme, the mean average time taken to process a new-scheme application from the date of first contact to clearance, as defined above, was 193 days (28 weeks). Of those cases cleared, 25 per cent. did so in less that 6 weeks; 42 per cent. between 6 weeks and 6 months; 18 per cent. between 6 months and a year; and 16 per cent. took more than a year. However, it should be noted that these figures exclude 104,000 applications that came through the Jobcentre Plus interface and have been cleared, but for which management information does not enable the age at clearance to be determined.</p>

The day on which payment is due from the non-resident parent is then specified by the Agency having taken in to account the date of any other income payable to the non-resident parent, which may result in a delay of up to 4 weeks to make payment to the Agency. The Agency then has 10 days to process the payment from the non-resident parent and make payment to the parent with care.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_18">Delays may occur if a non resident parent does not comply. For an employed non-resident parent the Agency can then impose a Deductions from Earnings Order (DEO). Where this occurs, the Agency must contact and liaise with the employer to set up the

Those who subsequently fail to attend on time or fail to attend any appointment on the correct date are required to show good cause; otherwise their benefit may be sanctioned.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_40">Alongside these regular and scheduled appointments, people may ask, at any time, for an appointment to see an adviser at their local Jobcentre. Wherever possible, we aim to see people immediately, but a forward appointment may be made. If someone attends late, we will still try to accommodate them, but where this is not possible another appointment will be made. There are no benefit implications for people arriving late for an appointment that has been arranged at their request and we do not monitor actual average waiting times for these types of appointments.</p>

 In setting the risk-based levy for eligible pension schemes for 2006&#150;07, the PPF used Dun and Bradstreet ratings which include county court judgements (CCJs) as one factor in assessing the risk of a business. As companies with CCJ&#039;s are more likely to become insolvent, then it is deemed fair that this should be reflected in the levy. Companies had until the 31 March 2006 to provide evidence that any recorded CCJs have been paid. The total pension protection levy which the PPF plans to raise in 2006&#150;07 is &#163;575 million across the pension schemes eligible for the PPF.

However, the completion rate within UK Higher Education Institutions is currently 85 per cent. which is a higher rate than most other countries and shows an decrease in the number of drop-outs since 1997.

Performance Indicators in Higher Education&quot;, published by HESA. For 2002/03, the projected outcomes summarise the pattern of movements of students at institutions between 2002/03 and 2003/04 and give the outcomes that would have been expected from starters in 2002/03 if progression patterns were to remain unchanged over the next few years. The HESA data show the proportion of entrants who are projected to: obtain a qualification (either a first degree or another undergraduate award); transfer to another HEI; neither obtain a qualification nor transfer (ie fail to complete the course).<br>

<a name="stpa_123">This progress has been possible for a number of reasons. Since 2000, we have been putting funding into universities, via the Widening Participation Allocation managed by the Higher Education Funding Council (HEFCE), to help universities cover the additional costs of recruiting and retaining non-traditional students. In 2006&#150;07, a total of &#163;344 million will be allocated to institutions to support their Widening Participation activity, which includes increased funding of &#163;236.6 million to improve student retention. This funding will be used for a variety of activities including: supporting the transition of students into HE, study skills and learner support and activities to enhance the quality of teaching and learning, all of which help to maximise their chance of success.

<sup>(29)</sup>Includes all local authority maintained grammar schools.<br>

Notes:<br>

1.School based expenditure includes only expenditure incurred directly by local authority maintained schools. This includes the pay of teachers and school-based support staff, school premises costs, books and equipment, and certain other supplies and services, less any capital items funded from recurrent spending and income from sales, fees and charges and rents and rates. This excludes the central cost of support services such as home to school transport, local authority administration and the financing of capital expenditure. The pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

2.Includes all local authority maintained schools with delegated budgets.<br>

3.2004&#150;05 data are provisional and are subject to change by the local authority.<br>

4.Figures are as reported by local authorities at 29 March 2006 in cash terms and rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

5.Financial data are drawn from local authorities&#039; 2004&#150;05 section 52 outturn statements submitted to the DfES. Pupil data are drawn from the DfES Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis. Local authority maintained grammar schools in England are drawn from Edubase (the Department&#039;s database of educational establishments) and matched across to the financial data reported on section 52 outturn.<br>

6.There are 164 grammar schools. The unit cost for grammar schools was compiled by obtaining a list of schools from EduBase and matching the financial data for the 164 schools from s52 outturn table B, and replicating the Department&#039;s LA unit cost calculation for these schools.<br>

 There is no specific central Government funding for schools entering into a hard governance federation.

 The Government have made clear that all forms of bullying are unacceptable and must be punished.

Although there is no evidence to suggest that this is a widespread problem in schools, any incidents need to be dealt with firmly and appropriately.

<a name="60418w45.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_128">Misuse of mobile phones was one of the specific issues considered by the Practitioners&#039; Group on School Behaviour and Discipline, in its report Learning Behaviour&quot; published last October. The report points to the fact that, while mobile phones are now a part of daily life, schools need a clear policy on their possession and use on school site. In the current Education and Inspections Bill we are re-enacting and strengthening the duty on schools to establish a behaviour policy, and we will be producing guidance on that duty which will specifically address the issue of mobile phone misuse. Bullying by mobile phones and the seriousness with which this should be treated is also referred to in our anti-bullying guidance pack for schools Don&#039;t Suffer in Silence&quot;, which is currently being updated. The wider problem of happy slapping&quot; and how to tackle it will also be covered within the soon to be launched Violence Reduction in Schools Programme (VIRIS) guidance. In addition, the remit of the Anti-Bullying Alliance under the funding provided by the Department includes investigating this issue as part of its work on developing innovative solutions to bullying.

<p><a name="st_133"><a name="60418w45.html_spnew7"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Research commissioned by the Department demonstrates the important role of parents in young people&#039;s decision making: Payne&#039;s review of the literature (Choice At The End Of Compulsory Schooling: A Research Review, DfES Research Report 414&quot;) concluded that young people see parents as probably the most important source of advice and help when decisions about post-16 routes have to be taken&quot;. Recent qualitative research for the Department (How Do Young People Make Decisions at Ages 14 and 16&quot;&#151;forthcoming May 2006) also shows that the parental role was identified by both young people and teachers as being particularly influential in the decision-making processes at ages 14 and 16&quot;.

<a name="stpa_129">However the Department has not commissioned any research/evaluation looking specifically at the benefits of involving parents/carers in post-16 career and education decisions, or indeed how good parents are at providing advice.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment she has made of the impact of a reduction in further education provisions for work-related causes as a result of changing the Department of Work and Pensions&#039; priorities on Learning and Skills Council provision.

 We are still in the process of agreeing the detail of the transfer with the Department for Work and Pensions and the Learning and Skills Council (LSC). The underpinning rationale in making this change is to get better value for money in the commissioning and delivery of publicly funded basic skills and English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) training and to target these resources more closely to meet the specific needs of people seeking employment or looking to progress their learning once they have found a job. It is too soon to assess what the impact of this change might be on the level of provision with different providers but Mark Haysom, the LSC&#039;s chief executive will write to you once such an assessment has been made.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_92">At the time of writing the transfer has not yet been confirmed so we are unable to provide a full assessment of what the level of provision will be with different providers. Discussions are still taking place between DfES and DWP to agree the level of funding that will transfer.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_93">In the meantime the LSC has undertaken some analysis to ascertain the degree to which providers are shared between both organisations. This is based on data provided to the LSC in August 2005 and shows that approximately 63% of JCP providers who hold a contract to provide JCP basic skills and ESOL programmes also have LSC contracts. There are regional variations. In the South West for example 73% of JCP providers also have a contract with the LSC.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_94">There will be no overall negative financial impact upon further education provision as a consequence of the transfer of funding responsibility from the DWP to the LSC. The LSC will ensure that the full resource transferring to the LSC from DfES/DWP is utilised to procure Skills for Life provision.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_95">Indeed, once fully embedded into the LSC&#039;s planning cycle, it is envisaged that existing LSC providers will be able to realise administrative savings because they will only need to talk to the LSC about planning and performance.</p>

<a name="stpa_134">For adult learners facing barriers to learning, learner support funds (LSF) provide additional financial support to people undertaking learning. Providers set their own criteria for allocating these funds to learners taking into account local needs and based on guidance from the LSC. The LSC guidance makes clear that learners with learning difficulties and/or disabilities must be given priority to these funds, especially where they are at risk of not taking up or continuing in further education.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w46.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_135">Where learners are not receiving a means tested benefit the provider may waive fees at their discretion and may make use of LSF in order to provide support. While the majority of those undertaking lip-reading courses do have a hearing impairment around 25 per cent. do not, and are therefore undertaking the course for a variety of other reasons. In 2004&#150;05 less than 20 per cent. of learners undertaking lip-reading courses paid fees with the rest qualifying for full fee remission either as a result of being on means tested benefits or due to the discretion of the provider. We are continuing to monitor this position with the LSC to ensure that the provisions we have in place to support these learners are sufficient.

In addition to this core activity, Shropshire learners have benefited from a further &#163;94,000 of investment in Skills for Life activity through the Employer Training Pilot and &#163;641,412 funded through European Social Funds activity in 2005/06.</p>

</ul>
<p>

<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_113">In the funding and planning dialogue for 2006/07 the college was initially offered an indicative allocation for adult programme delivery of &#163;132,639 (including Skills for Life) but the college itself requested the opportunity to review this provision due to its desire to focus development on its key mission: As a high quality post 16 establishment, Shrewsbury Sixth Form College is dedicated to meeting the needs of all its learners in a supportive and challenging environment. It specialises in the provision/teaching of advanced level courses for 16&#150;19 full time students&quot;.</p>

Through the recognition of its mission, core specialisation, forward thinking and innovative co-location discussions with Shrewsbury College of Arts and Technology, the sixth form college senior managers identified that Skills for Life provision may be more efficiently and effectively placed for delivery with other local providers.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_116">In summary, the Secretary of State, through the LSC is continuing to fund Skills for Life provision for learners in Shrewsbury, through the college of arts and technology rather then through the sixth form college.

Notes:<br>

1.The drop in registrations between December 1997 and December 1998 is mostly attributable to the reduction in re-registration period from two years to 15 months.<br>

2.PDS schemes have varying registration periods. To ensure comparability with corresponding GDS data, PDS registrations for established PDS practices are estimated using proxy registrations, namely the number of patients seen by PDS practices in the past 15 months.<br>

3.Data for 2003 and earlier do not include those PDS schemes that do not have any registrations, for example dental access centres, and is therefore not directly comparable with 2004 and 2005 data.<br>

 The old fee per item remuneration system encouraged high levels of invasive treatment and did not allow sufficient time for preventative work. The new contracts abolish this treadmill&quot; effect.

<a name="stpa_224">The old system has also failed to provide stability for local communities. Dentists could set up practices where they wished and vary the amount of national health service work they did without any influence by primary care trusts (PCTs). Where a dentist left the NHS or reduced the level of NHS service provided, the PCT was relatively powerless to replace this lost service. The new contracts enable PCTs and dentists to agree in advance what level of NHS service the dentists will provide. Where a dentist ceases to provide NHS service, the PCT will retain the funding for that contract and will use it to re-provide services.

 We are committed to modernising mental health services, and one of our national priorities is to ensure that people with severe and enduring mental illness, including those with mental illness and substance misuse illness&#151;dual diagnosis&#151;receive more responsive and appropriate services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w61.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_292">Many mental health trusts have existing partnership working with drug and alcohol services through in-house specialist substance misuse services. In addition, the mental health dual diagnosis good practice policy implementation guide recommends suitable arrangements for developing partnership services for adults with severe mental illness and substance misuse problems.

<p>

<a name="stpa_293">We are also promoting increased partnership working between the national health service and drug and alcohol services by responding to the advisory council on misuse of drugs (ACMD) report, published in January by the Home Office. The Department, in partnership with the Home Office, the Department for Education and Skills, the National Treatment Agency and the National Institute for Mental Health in England is supporting a number of activities which respond to the ACMD findings, including publishing research briefings for professionals and reviewing current dual diagnosis treatment interventions to inform future partnership working policy.

 Prison Health, a joint Home Office and Department of Health unit, has been working since 2000 to improve health care provision for prisoners. It has led and managed a work programme to modernise services, step up national health service engagement and improve performance monitoring. The responsibility for commissioning health services, including mental health services, in the publicly run prisons will have fully transferred from the Prison Service to NHS primary care trusts by April 2006.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w61.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_299">Mental health services for prisoners have been a key part of these reforms. The Department is investing nearly &#163;20 million a year in NHS mental health in-reach services for prisoners. These are community mental health teams working within prisons and are now available in 102 prisons, with some 360 extra staff employed. By the spring, every prison in England and Wales will have access to these services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w61.html_para14">
<a name="stpa_300">The Department of Health and the Home Office produced joint guidance in November 2005 to help facilitate quicker transfers to hospital for people whose mental health difficulties mean they are too ill to remain in prison. This guidance, The transfer of prisoners to and from hospital under sections 47 and 48 of the Mental Health Act (1983)&quot;, is available on the Department&#039;s website at www.dh.gov.uk/assetRoot/04/12/36/31/04123631.pdf

 The need for indemnities to be given by the national health service to the private sector, or by the private sector to the NHS, normally arises in cases where it is not clear if a liability will ever arise, or, if it does, what the amount of that liability will be. An example would be where, at some point in the future, an NHS employee deliberately damages the contractor&#039;s property while on duty at work. It is impossible to predict this sort of event, but it is clear that this would be the NHS&#039;s responsibility if it ever occurred. It is better value for money for the NHS to give an indemnity than to make the contractor take the risk, because the contractor is likely to include an allowance in its price in case this should ever happen.

 There was a survey to measure the margin on drugs available to community pharmaceutical contractors (the discount inquiry) in October 2000. The discount inquiry asked a random sample of pharmacy contractors what prices they had paid for a sample of medicines including rebates from suppliers. As a result of this survey, the claw-back used to calculate reimbursement prices paid to pharmacists was increased by about 0.6 per cent., depending on size of pharmacy, from an average of about 10.6 per cent. to 11.2 per cent. Under the terms of its agreement between the Department and the pharmaceutical services negotiating committee, the data used in the discount inquiry remain confidential.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w65.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_343">Although there have been no discount inquiries since 2000, the Department has monitored drug prices using market information from manufacturers and wholesalers. As a result of this, and following a public consultation paper, the Department reduced the reimbursement prices of four recently out of patent medicines on two occasions: the first with effect from December 2003 and the second with effect from September 2004. In total, this reduced the retained margins available to community pharmacy contractors by &#163;300 million per annum.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w65.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_344">When the current community pharmacy contractual framework was implemented in April 2005, the amount of retained margins in England was assessed as &#163;500 million per year. This money is an integral part of the total of &#163;1,766 million agreed during the contract negotiations, and will help to pay for services to patients. The Department is currently undertaking surveys of community pharmacy contractor invoices to determine the current amount of retained margin available to pharmacy contractors. If the current survey shows that total retained margins differ substantially from &#163;500 million, the Department will make 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Apr 2006 : Column 253W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
adjustments by varying reimbursement prices or the claw-back to bring it in line with the sum agreed as part of the contractual framework. The Department will continue to assess the level of retained margin but does not believe it is realistic to prepare forecasts as the actual sums retained will be determined by the market prices for generic medicines which can change significantly over time.

Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier Hospital Episode Statistic identification (HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and NHS number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data is incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

All diagnoses count of patients<br>

These figures represent a count of patients where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistic (HES) record.<br>

Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Secondary diagnosis<br>

As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnosis relevant to the episode of care.<br>

The reviews should consider the resources required to implement any recommendations relating to the use of psychological interventions and the timeline over which full implementation is envisaged. As announced in the recent White Paper, Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community service&quot;, the Government are committed to expanding access to psychological therapies. To this end, two demonstration sites are being established for people of working age with mild to moderate mental health problems with the aim of helping them to remain in or return to work. The sites will also aim to establish an evidence base for the effectiveness of such therapies and to support the extension to non-working age people and those with moderate to severe mental illness.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many offenders will be participating in &#039;Clean Up Week&#039; 2006.  [63007]</p>




<p><a name="st_18"><a name="60418w73.html_spnew6"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 As part of the year-round, nationwide Community Payback scheme, &quot;Clean Up Week&quot; aims to give communities a greater say in the kind of work offenders undertaking unpaid work do. Through this the objective is to increase the involvement of communities in criminal justice activities.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w73.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_7">As such, although &quot;Clean Up Week&quot; did not involve members of the public voting for projects in all probation areas, it is hoped that interest in Community Payback will be stimulated nationwide. And of course in all probation areas offenders will continue to do unpaid work which benefits their communities, as they do every week.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w73.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_8">In the eight &quot;Clean Up Week&quot; areas, projects vary in size and numbers of offenders working on them: from seven offenders for one day this week (and seven or eight every week until the project is complete) on the winning project in Warwickshire; to 90 offenders across the week on the winning project in Manchester. In Norfolk, since the projects (and votes) were spread out across the county, probation staff decided to go ahead with all five nominated projects, so approximately 250 offenders will take part.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w73.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_9">So across the eight probation areas taking part in &quot;Clean Up Week&quot;, around 486 offenders will be taking part in projects that were voted for by members of the public. But across the country as a whole, thousands more offenders will be doing work which has been suggested by members of local communities and which benefits them.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the likely effects of &quot;Clean Up Week&quot; 2006 in Romford and Havering.  [63008]</p>




<p><a name="st_19"><a name="60418w73.html_spnew7"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 Romford and Havering were not part of one of the Clean Up Week areas this year. The Probation Areas taking part (Avon and Somerset, Manchester, Leicestershire and Rutland, Humberside, Norfolk, South Wales, Teesside and Warwickshire) were chosen in consultation with the Communication Managers in local probation areas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w73.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_10">However, in Romford and Havering offenders continue to undertake a range of unpaid work this week, as in any other. Local Probation staff estimate that around 50 offenders will attend every weekday, and up to 120 per day at weekends. These offenders will do a range of tasks which benefit the communities of Romford and Havering. During the week much of the work takes place in community centres, where offenders will help permanent staff and do repair and decorating work. Or the work will take place outside, where they will clear overgrown footpaths or clean graffiti. On housing estates they will clear communal areas. Meanwhile at weekends much of the work takes place in schools: painting, decorating and cleaning. Through this work people who have offended can pay back and provide benefits to the community.

<i>[holding answer 10 March 2006]:</i> So far as can be determined from central records no jobs in the central Home Office and immigration and nationality directorate, and the United Kingdom Passport Agency have been relocated to Wales since 2001. There has been no movement of Public Sector Prison Service jobs to Wales since 2001. However, over the next two years work will be moved from Public Sector Prison Service headquarters and establishments and will create 480 additional posts in Wales.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what reasons his Department extended the home detention curfew scheme in April 2003; what assessment he has made of its effect; and what plans he has for further extension.  [59307]</p>




<p><a name="st_65"><a name="60418w78.html_spnew3"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 On 10 April 2003 the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department announced two changes to the Home Detention Curfew scheme which took effect from 14 July 2003. Firstly, the maximum period a prisoner may spend on HDC was increased from 90 days to 135 days and secondly, in order to maintain public confidence in the scheme, prisoners serving sentences for certain serious offences considered to be of particular concern to the public were to be presumed unsuitable for HDC unless there were exceptional circumstances.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w78.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_27">The maximum curfew period was increased in order to build on the scheme&#039;s previous success by providing earlier resettlement opportunities for lower risk offenders. Although not its primary purpose, this measure also helped to deal with pressures on the prison population. HDC has helped in providing prisoners with a smoother and more effective re-integration back into the community. The scheme provides suitable, low risk, prisoners with the opportunity to rejoin employment, training and their families at an earlier stage while providing protection to the public. Since its introduction in 1999, 85 per cent. of those released on HDC have completed their curfew period successfully.
</p>


<p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether he has undertaken a privacy impact assessment of the proposed national identity scheme; and if he will make a statement.  [62558]</p>




<p><a name="st_67"><a name="60418w79.html_spnew0"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The Government have carefully considered the privacy implications of the national identity scheme. The national identity register will hold only that information which is listed in Schedule 1 of the Identity Cards Act 2006. A significant amount of the information listed in Schedule 1 is already held on the passport database. For example, most of the information contained within paragraphs one, five and seven are held on the passport database which is administered by the Identity and Passport Service. Additionally, the information and personal reference numbers contained in paragraphs three and four are either allocated by a Government Department, or in the case of documents issued overseas, are generally recorded by a Government Department, usually the Immigration Service. The national identity register will hold much less information than databases that are administered by various private companies, for example 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Apr 2006 : Column 307W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
credit card issuers and supermarket loyalty schemes. The Identity Cards Act ensures that personal reference numbers which would tend to reveal sensitive personal data cannot be held on the register. The PNC number for example, could not be added to the register as this could suggest that the individual had been of interest to the police, or that the individual had a criminal record.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418w79.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_31">In addition to the safeguards in the Data Protection Act with which the scheme will comply, the Act also provides additional safeguards. Information will be disclosed only with consent under Section 12 of the Act, or via strictly controlled statutory procedures set out in Sections 17&#150;21 of the Act. The individual will be able to view the &#039;audit log&#039; information, set out in paragraph 9 of Schedule 1, through which they can view each occasion on which information has been disclosed from their record. A function of the national identity scheme commissioner set out at Section 22, will be to keep under review the extent to which the arrangements of the scheme make appropriate provision for securing the confidentiality of the information stored in the register.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make it his policy to impose a duty on the National Identity Scheme Commissioner to investigate and resolve problems with identity cards experienced by individuals; and if he will make a statement.  [62559]</p>




<p><a name="st_68"><a name="60418w79.html_spnew1"><b> Andy Burnham: </b> 
 The Identity and Passport Service operates a complaints system which individuals will be able to access in order to resolve any problems they may experience with identity cards. In addition, section 22 of the Identity Cards Act 2006, ensures that the commissioner must keep under review the extent to which arrangements made by the Secretary of State make appropriate provision for dealing with complaints. There is nothing in the Identity Cards Act that would either prevent individuals from making the commissioner aware of their complaints, or the commissioner from taking an interest in a complaint that had been brought to his attention.

I also met with several other bereaved families after the service of remembrance on the 1 November 2005, which my Department arranged. Since 7 July, I have been in contact with representatives of 37 of those who died. Officials from my Department attended the most recent bereaved support group meeting at the 7 July Assistance Centre and my Department is consulting with family members on proposals for a permanent memorial. I have extended an open invitation to any family members who wish to meet me on a more personal basis to do so at any time.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the causes of abortive magistrate court hearings; and what steps his Department is taking to prevent them.  [56121]</p>




<p><a name="st_93"><a name="60418w81.html_spnew8"><b> Ms Harman: </b> 
 Her Majesty&#039;s Courts Service, together with criminal justice system (CJS) partners, monitors the performance of magistrates courts with regard to ineffective trials. The CJS has introduced the Criminal Case Management Programme to reduce abortive hearings in the courts. In addition there is a monthly analysis of performance utilising quantitative and qualitative information undertaken by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform (OCJR) and HMCS. These measures have tackled the root cause of the many different problems which lead to ineffective hearings such as defendants not turning up at court, witnesses being absent, the prosecution and defence not being sufficiently ready and there being insufficient court time to hear a case. Ineffective trials have reduced from 24 per cent. to 12.7 per cent. in the Crown Court and from 31 per cent. to 21.1 per cent. in the magistrates courts since 1992. The data confirms that the causes of 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Apr 2006 : Column 315W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
ineffective trials have reduced significantly. In the magistrates courts ineffective trials where the defendant was absent has improved by 58 per cent. In the Crown Court ineffective trials where the defence, and the Crown Prosecution Service were not ready have improved by 73 per cent. and 63 per cent. respectively. Additionally, HMCS and other CJSs are testing new approaches to case management to further reduce the number of abortive hearings at court.

 Evidence suggests that employment is a key factor in reducing re-offending. The &#039;Reducing Re-offending Through Skills and Employment&#039; Green Paper made clear our intention to test the scope for introducing a new employability contract to motivate offenders. This new &#039;rights and responsibilities&#039; package would offer offenders a menu of options for training and skills support leading to a specific employment goal. In return, offenders would be expected to engage positively with the offer and meet clear performance criteria. Offender managers would select individuals who appeared likely to benefit from an intensive programme focused on employability, making an initial assessment of the range of an individual&#039;s needs, priorities, and barriers to learning. Wherever possible, this would be conducted before sentencing, so that the outline sentence plan could be put before the court, discussed with the offender, and then reflected, where appropriate, in conditions attached to the sentence.

 There is no fixed retirement age for police officers under the current police pension scheme under which officers can build up a maximum pension after 30 years service. Officers with at least 25 years service may retire with an immediate pension from age 50.

<a name="stpa_56">Otherwise officers become eligible to retire with an immediate pension between the ages of 55 and 60 depending on the compulsory retirement age for their rank and force. Officers with less than 25 years service who leave the police with deferred benefits will receive their pension at age 60. The Government are introducing a new pension scheme for new entrant police officers from 6 April 2006. The scheme provides a maximum pension after 35 years and a minimum pension age of 55 which is common to all ranks. Officers who leave the police before age 55 with deferred benefits will receive their pensions at age 65. Those employees of the police service who have access to the local government pension scheme, are members of a scheme which has a retirement age of 65, but allows individuals to voluntarily retire from age 60, and facility to retire with employer consent from age 50.

 It would be premature to state the precise structure of the merged strategic force in the East Midlands, as this will be an operational decision for the new Chief Officer.

 The case for Hampshire to stand alone as a strategic force has been rigorously assessed as capable of providing the required standard of protective services to tackle crime in the 21st century.

 Under the statutory charging programme, the charging of suspects is now predominantly undertaken by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). Although most summary cases continue to be charged by police without referral to the CPS, the decision to charge in indictable and &#039;either-way&#039; cases passes to a crown prosecutor. Both police and CPS use the evidential and public interests test set out in the code for Crown Prosecutors to arrive at a charging decision.

<a name="stpa_66">In cases where a police officer is responsible for charging, this will fall to a police custody officer. All such officers in England and Wales receive a considerable amount of training in relation to the charging of suspects. The Central Police Training and Development Authority (Centrex) have developed a custody officer training package that is updated annually and made available to all forces.

<p>
<a name="60418w84.html_para13">
<a name="stpa_68">It is also important that the arresting officer has sufficient knowledge of the law and this is reflected in the content of the initial police learning and development programme (IPLDP), the training for newly recruited police officers, which contains a number of core modules that are designed to provide trainee officers with a sound understanding of legislation.

<sup>(122)</sup> These statistics are based on information recorded on the central Prison Service IT system at the beginning of March 2006. Further updates and amendments may be made to records on this system in future resulting in revised figures.<br>

<sup>(123)</sup> Offence recorded on Prison Service IT system.<br>

Investigations suggest that around 5 per cent. of offence types recorded on this system do not relate to the offence for which they were released on HOC but relate to offences committed after release from prison and before the licence expiry date for their sentence. Of the 83 discharges for sex offences shown in the table, only 64 were serving a sentence for a sex offence at their time of release. The last offender to be released on HOC while serving a sentence for a sex offence was released in January 2004.<br>

<sup>(124)</sup> Includes the offence of bigamy.<br>

Funding, recruitment and training arrangements for PSOs are different from those for Probation Officers and, as such, PSO projections do not extend as far ahead as those for Probation Officers.

 Antisocial behaviour has a wide definition and prostitution is just one type of behaviour that can be tackled by an ASBO.

 Since September 2005, my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary and I have had discussions with all police authorities in England and Wales, including those in Greater Manchester, West Midlands, West Yorkshire, Merseyside and South Wales, about reconfiguring policing in their areas to ensure that there is the capacity and resilience to provide protective services, including counter terrorism, to national standards.

<p>
<a name="60418w89.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_99">The Government&#039;s counter terrorism strategy is a nationwide effort to reduce the threat and our vulnerability to terrorism across the UK and involves a variety of Government Departments and agencies, particularly the police service, working in partnership with local and regional government and the private sector. Key elements of the strategy focus on the development of effective and proportionate protective security arrangements and ensuring that we are prepared to respond effectively to, and recover from, a terrorist attack. We do not comment on the specifics of the operational activity across the UK as this could assist those who may wish to perpetrate acts of terrorism.

The following costs are excluded from this data; employer&#039;s superannuation costs, vocational trainee salaries and national insurance contribution costs, clinical audit convenors, clinical audit secretarial support costs and travel expenses, and costs associated with any salaried general dental practitioners and emergency dental services.<br>

<sup>(160)</sup> National PDS payment data is included for 2004&#150;05 only and relates to baseline payments or the agreed regular monthly payments made to PDS practices. Reliable PDS data at practice level is not available prior to 2004&#150;05. The data cannot identify the cost of any PDS services that are directly managed by local NHS trusts, such as certain dental access centres.<br>

<sup>(161)</sup> Payments are assigned to areas on the basis of practice postcode data.<br>

<sup>(162)</sup> Net payments represent the balance of payments due after taking account of NHS dental charge income collected from patients by dental practices.<br>

<sup>(163)</sup> 1997&#150;2000 data have been calculated using 2001 population data, as this is the earliest available. 2005 data have been calculated using 2004 population data, as this is the latest available.<br>

They concluded that there was no evidence of any demonstrable risk of the development of breast cancer caused by the use of underarm cosmetics. The recent paper in J Applied Toxicology claiming oestrogenic activity for a large range of metals, including aluminium, which is used as an anti-perspirant in underarm deodorants, provides very limited data from in vitro studies. No conclusions can be drawn regarding the biological significance of these data.

The UK Clinical Research Collaboration and the UK Clinical Research Network have brought together a number of organisations that are active in patient and public involvement in research, to discuss issues concerned with that involvement and to develop a shared agenda that maximises the impact of individual organisations&#039; activities and minimises unnecessary duplication. One of the first products of this collaborative working will be the production of a guide to understanding clinical trials for patients and the public.

<sup>(174)</sup> The introduction of ICD-10 for coding cause of death in 2001 means that figures are not completely comparable with data for years before this date. The data should therefore be interpreted with caution.

 We are determined to ensure that people already on incapacity benefits are treated fairly, while also ensuring that they have the right levels of support and encouragement to help them return to work where this is possible. We are therefore proposing that people already on incapacity benefits should have their existing benefit level protected but should also be able to benefit from the support we offer. Indeed, existing claimants in Pathways areas have always been able to volunteer for the programme and many already do. We have set out our proposals in the Green Paper &quot;A new deal for welfare: Empowering people to work&quot; (Cm 6730) published on 24 January 2006; available in the Library.

And this continued to be the case when jobseeker&#039;s allowance was introduced with only the income-based part&#151;previously provided through IS&#151;being a passport to the discretionary social fund. Basing eligibility for discretionary social fund payments (apart from crisis loans) on means tested income replacement benefits provides a clear distinction between those who are eligible to apply for help and those who are not.

 The obsolete publications referred to in the Resource Account 2004&#150;05 were those made by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). During that year some 1,032 stock lines (271,714 copies) were subject to disposal and adjustment.

Of the total there were two major disposals; 165,771 copies across 783 stock lines (61 per cent. of total) were due to the disposal of slow moving stock. This followed a recommendation from the National Audit Office that HSE should reduce its stock levels. A significant number of these publications were quite longstanding, and demand was initially based on placing orders for larger volumes in order to achieve cheaper print costs. Following the larger than usual level of disposals in 2004&#150;05, HSE has put in place a policy of setting shorter print runs to better reflect actual demand.

Notes:<br>

1. Statistics quoted in this response are taken from the Pathways to Work Evaluation database.<br>

2. Due to time lags in the benefits data a cohort of Pathways starts to the end of May 2005 have been considered.<br>

3. For new/repeat customers the Pathways start date and the benefit start date are effectively the same.<br>

4. Not all Pathways spell starts have a benefit claim start date matched to them. This is because the benefits data is taken from the National Benefits Database which does not include a proportion of short term Incapacity Benefit claims.<br>

5. This response is based on the number of Pathways spells rather than the number of individuals who have started Pathways. This is because an individual may have multiple spells on Pathways but their interaction within Pathways may be different in different spells.<br>

6. Database development work is required to merge the clerical data used as a basis for reporting on mandated stock customers to our benefits data. This work is currently in progress but resource is not available to complete this within the timescale for this question.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. These figures are early estimates. Operational processing times mean that a number of claim commencements and terminations are not reflected in the figures. The final figures incorporated within the Work and Pensions Longitudinal Study (WPLS) will take account of such cases.<br>

2. Caseloads are rounded to the nearest hundred. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>

3. Caseload figures are taken from the GMS scan at 25 November 2005, rated up to give end-month estimates.<br>

4. Pension credit (PC) replaced minimum income guarantee (MIG) on 6 October 2003. Existing MIG recipients were automatically converted onto pension credit on that date (assuming constituencies are assigned by matching postcodes against the relevant postcode directory.)<br>

5. This table uses the new Scottish parliamentary constituencies created in May 2005.<br>

6. Household recipients are those people who claim PC either on behalf of themselves only or on behalf of a household. This number is equal to the number of households in receipt of PC. The number of individual beneficiaries is the claimants plus their partners.<br>

7. Couples may include partners who are aged less than 60.<br>

Notes:<br>

1. Estimates are based on Family Resources Survey data for 2003&#150;04, with incomes and benefits projected forward into the future in order to estimate the eligibility for each pensioner household on the survey.<br>

2. As with National Statistics estimates of eligibility to pension credit in 2003&#150;04, estimates are given as ranges in order to account for possible biases in Family Resource Survey data. They also take account of the effects of sampling variation. It is assumed that the size of this range remains constant in future years relative to the decreasing proportion of non-eligible pensioner households.<br>

3. Estimates of eligibility cover all those aged above women&#039;s state pension age in the private household population of Great Britain.<br>

4. The projections assume the continuation of the current uprating of the standard minimum guarantee by earnings, although the Government are not committed to this beyond 2008.<br>

5. Estimates account for equalisation of state pension age between 2010 and 2020. It is assumed that the minimum age at which people can claim pension credit rises in line with women&#039;s state pension age.<br>

6. Estimates are calibrated to the 2003&#150;04 National Statistics estimates of non-eligibility to pension credit, which adjust 2003&#150;04 Family Resources Survey data to take account of possible biases in reporting.<br>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60418105.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_116">Prior to the coming into force of the Pensions Act 2004, pension scheme trustees were obliged to provide the Occupational Pensions Regulatory Authority (Opra) with basic information in the form of scheme name and address, scheme size in terms of number of members, benefit type (whether defined benefit, defined contribution, hybrid or not known), status (open, closed, frozen, winding-up, wound-up).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418105.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_117">This made it possible for Opra to collect the pension schemes levy and provide a pension tracing service for the public. However, it provided no information on the funding level, the nature of the employer&#039;s business, names and contact details for scheme advisers. In terms of the current challenges in relation to scheme funding this data was insufficient.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60418105.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_118">The situation is already being addressed. The Pensions Act 2004 requires UK occupational pension schemes to complete a scheme return and supply it to the Pensions Regulator. Considerable improvements in the quality of data available on pensions are expected by the end of 2006 when the majority of scheme returns will have been received by the Regulator.

<a name="stpa_119">While the steps the Regulator is taking to gather information through the scheme return will make a big difference, it has also analysed existing data to inform current policy issues. For example, the Pensions Regulator engaged PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) to provide an analysis of the potential impacts on employer solvency and investment of the new scheme funding regime, which included an analysis by PwC of the potential impact on 550 employers.

 There are a number of channels for the exchange of DNA information between the United Kingdom and other countries. They include: the United Kingdom National Central Bureau for Interpol (UK NCB) based at the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) which is often used to provide DNA profile data to other countries; bi-lateral direct liaison between law enforcement authorities; and formal mutual legal assistance channels. Exchanges of DNA information via these channels will almost always be a response to the needs of a specific criminal investigation.

<a name="stpa_136">The UK NCB is not currently able to provide data on the countries to which DNA profiles have been sent or on the number of DNA profiles sent to other countries in pursuit of specific criminal investigations.

However, it is estimated that DMA data is sent out by the UK NCB to one or more countries on two or three occasions each week. DNA data is only sent abroad where this is deemed necessary by the investigator, and is subject to data protection and human rights risk assessment. No data is available on the number of exchanges of DNA information which occur through direct liaison between law enforcement authorities or formal mutual legal assistance channels.

<a name="60418109.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_137">There have been two significant exchanges of DNA information in the last two years.

</p>


<p>
<a name="60418109.html_para2">

<a name="stpa_141">The Home Office began a four-year longitudinal study of 4,000 prisoners, Surveying Prisoner Crime Reduction, in late 2005. The Department of Health, Department for Work and Pensions, and the Department for Education and Skills are also stakeholders. The aims of the study are to assess prisoners&#039; problems and needs on reception, examine how these are addressed during and after custody, and 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>18 Apr 2006 : Column 452W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
to measure the association between prisoners&#039; participation in interventions and outcomes, including re-offending. The study involves interviews with a large and representative sample of prisoners at three stages: on reception to custody, prior to release and finally back in the community. The initial stage, on first reception into custody, will measure the proportion of this group with mental disorder. Prisoners will also be asked if they believe themselves to have a learning disability.

<i>[holding answer 17 March 2006]:</i> The extent to which any person influences another is very difficult to measure. Indoctrination is a very subtle process and would not in itself constitute a measurable incident. If one prisoner were to be seen as exerting a disproportionate power over another, this would classify as a bullying incident. Incidents of bullying are monitored at a local level as part of each prison&#039;s violence reduction strategy, but no central data is held. All prisons have multi-faith chaplaincy teams to meet the faith needs of prisoners, and to provide religious education and awareness, and pastoral support.

As the new Learning and Skills Council planning and funding responsibilities are implemented, the strategic role of the head of learning and skills in assessing education supply and demand across the entire prison regime becomes a key function. The new arrangements will also increase the supply of education provision by reducing the incidence of wasteful repeat assessment as offenders move around the criminal justice system.
