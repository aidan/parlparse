<i> [holding answer 12 November 2007]:</i> The Animal Welfare Act 2006 protects the welfare of animals on-farm and makes it an offence to cause suffering to any animal. The Welfare of Farmed Animals (England) Regulations 2007 lay down requirements in respect of general welfare, inspection, housing and feeding for all farm animals. The welfare of ducks is also covered by a specific code of recommendations. Flock-keepers are required by law to have access to and be familiar with this code, which encourages high standards of husbandry.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_802"><a name="71115w0002.htm_para13"><a name="07111539000153">A deposit system for bottles has an obvious appeal to the public, however there would be difficulties in implementing such a system in the UK. In 2004, DEFRA commissioned a project to evaluate whether a deposit system could provide additional value, in combination with the current packaging waste recovery system established in the UK, to achieve wider EC Directive targets. This work took into account existing deposit and return schemes in Europe, the USA and Canada.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_803"><a name="71115w0002.htm_para14"><a name="07111539000154">The report's conclusion was that a deposit scheme may not achieve our overall environmental goals since such systems favour packaging formats that do not necessarily deliver environmental benefits.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_804"><a name="71115w0002.htm_para15"><a name="07111539000155">A deposit scheme would be extremely expensive when compared to the existing UK packaging system, which uses a market mechanism and a tradable &#147;packaging waste recovery note&#148; (PRN). This system is reputedly the most cost-effective system in Europe for implementing the Packaging Directive.</p>

 We anticipate that the Commission will introduce the roadmap towards marine spatial planning some time before 2009.

 We see no substantial differences between the two concepts.

As we set out in the proposals in the Marine Bill White Paper in March 2007, marine planning will clarify our marine objectives and priorities for the future, and direct decision-makers and users towards more efficient, sustainable use and protection of our marine resources.</p>

 The Department did not expect the national health service to plan or manage its expenditure on a separate near cash and non-cash basis in 2006-07. Instead, the NHS was expected to live within overall expenditure limits and at least achieve financial balance. The net surplus of &#163;515 million recorded in the audited accounts for 2006-07 represents a revenue surplus only, and is reported after full account was taken by the NHS for pay costs.</p>

 The Department made clear in the national health service operating framework for 2007-08 that strategic health authorities (SHAs) will not generally need to top-slice primary care trust (PCT) revenue allocations to the same level as in 2006-07 because of the substantial improvement in the overall financial position of the NHS. However, for 2007-08 a number of PCTs have chosen to lodge resources with their SHA to be included within the SHA&#146;s strategic investment fund as a safeguard against any risk associated with the lower financial settlement over the period 2008-09 to 2010-11.</p>

The Tenth revision (ICD-10) has been used by the ONS since 2001. In the Ninth revision of the ICD (ICD-9) there are no specific codes that would allow deaths mentioning <i> Clostridium difficile</i> to be easily identified. Identifying these deaths in ICD-9 would require extensive text searching of a very large number of death certificates. This could only be done at disproportionate cost. Data for 1997, 1998 and 2000 are therefore not available as ICD-9 was used in these years. Deaths registered in 1999 in England and Wales were coded to both ICD-9 and ICD-10 as part of a special study to compare the two ICD revisions, and have therefore been used to give an additional year of data on deaths involving <i> C. diff</i>. Data is available for MRSA in both ICD-9 and ICD-10.<br>

It should also be noted that the country of birth question in the LFS is an undercount because:<br>
it excludes those who have not been resident in the UK for 6 months.<br>
it excludes students in halls who do not have a UK resident parent.<br>
it excludes people in most other types of communal establishments (eg hotels, boarding<br>

<p><a name="stpa_936"><a name="71115w0018.htm_para7"><a name="0711163000088">The National Assessment Agency (NAA), which is responsible for the external marking of national curriculum tests, specifies the criteria for eligibility to be considered for employment as a test marker. Until 2003, these were the possession of a degree or equivalent, and to be a practising teacher. Since 2004, applicants with a degree and who are taking a Post Graduate Certificate of Education course have also been eligible. The NAA does not collect data about the details of test markers&#146; qualifications.</p>

 International comparisons studies play an important role in benchmarking against other countries and as pointers to what we might learn from other school systems. They can also provide useful supplementary information about attainment, although they are not necessarily measuring the same content and processes as national tests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_937"><a name="71115w0018.htm_para8"><a name="0711163000094">The most recent findings come from the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) which was conducted in 2003. TIMSS found that the performance of 10-year-olds in England had improved significantly from 1995 to 2003 in both science and mathematics. However, the performance of 14-year-olds in England, as reported in TIMSS, had not increased significantly between 1995 and 1999 and 1999 and 2003, for either science or mathematics.</p>

PISA was conducted again in 2006, this time with a focus on science, and findings from the study will be published on 4 December 2007.</p>

This is governed by the Education Act 1996, as amended, which includes children learning the value of all relationships, with a particular emphasis on marriage and its importance for bringing up children.</p>

 The following table sets out allocations of the &#163;40.9 million of funding within dedicated schools grant (DSG) to support children from deprived backgrounds who attend schools in less deprived local authorities. The amounts are increases in funding for 2008-09, and will become part of each qualifying authority's DSG baseline for 2009-10 and 2010-11. No funding was allocated for 2007-08; funding for 2011-12 will be allocated under the next spending review. Decisions on the targeting of this funding will be taken by local authorities in consultation with their schools forums, but our strong expectation is that it will be directed to those schools with the most disadvantaged pupil intakes.</p>

 The Youth Cohort Study (YCS) for England and Wales provides information on the activities of young people who have completed compulsory education. For the cohort of 16-year-olds who completed their compulsory education in 2002/03, the YCS estimates that 31 per cent. of those who did not stay on in full-time education after the age of 16 had five or more A* - C grade GCSEs or equivalent.</p>

Staying in learning not only supports young people to get a better job; it also improves their life chances and equips them with the personal and social skills they need to thrive throughout their lives. That is why we have embarked on a series of education and training reforms which will ensure that there are suitable progression routes for all young people, and published on 5 November plans for raising the participation age to 18.</p>

 Financial support for learning will be restructured when the compulsory participation age is raised to 18, and we are looking at a variety of methods to ensure that this is done in the most effective way to ensure young people are enabled to participate.

 On 5 November we published a document setting out how our proposals to raise the participation age have developed since the consultation, and which aspects require legislation. This explains that enforcement action will be a last resort, but if a young person is not participating once suitable learning provision has been identified for them and appropriate support provided, the local authority will be able to issue an Attendance Notice, specifying precisely the provision the young person must attend and where and when they must do this. We estimate that very few young people will reach the stage of being issued with an Attendance Notice, as the focus of the policy will be on ensuring that there is an engaging and worthwhile learning programme for everyone young person and the right support, including financial support, to help them stay in learning and succeed.

House. The estimated additional annual costs to local authorities were based on additional resources needed to track and contact young people not participating, provide help and support to address issues and re-engage in learning, and ultimately enforce the duty, through the system of attendance notices described in the Green Paper. No additional costs were forecast for registration, based on maintaining the Connexions Caseload Information System. An estimated cost of &#163;50 million for additional tracking and support was included, and an estimated cost to local authorities of &#163;6.7 million for enforcement (with other enforcement costs being incurred elsewhere).

 We have asked the Funding Council to reduce funding for equivalent level qualifications by &#163;100 million by 2010-11. The council is consulting on the how to implement this policy. The entire &#163;100 million sum will be recycled within the higher education sector. Much of it will be available to support part-time provision for those already in the workplace who do not yet have a higher education qualification.</p>

 The MRC consulted Camden council on three occasions about, the possibility of moving the NIMR to the National Temperance Hospital site on Hampstead Road. To date there has been no formal consultation with Camden council or local residents on the proposals for the move of the NIMR to the site adjacent to the British Library. Should the BLISS consortium (MRC, CRUK, Wellcome Trust and UCL) be successful in acquiring the site, the consultation and planning process would naturally need to be followed.</p>

 We want employers to work more closely with the higher education sector to meet the higher skill needs of the work force and those of students still in education. Employers value broader skills such as communication, analysis and problem-solving and while a good higher education experience delivers these, more could be done. We will encourage this through our Higher Level Skills Strategy due to be published shortly.</p>

I was able to see how the university is flourishing on the international stage, while at the same time making a real contribution to the local economy and society. I greatly value visits of this kind, because I have made clear that the Government wants those working in the higher education sector and students to contribute towards the making of policy. I also valued the opportunity to speak with students from York university about a range of educational issues, as part of the Government&#146;s student listening programme.</p>
