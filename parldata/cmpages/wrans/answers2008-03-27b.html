 Bankruptcies can result in either a bankruptcy restrictions order (BRO) or a bankruptcy restrictions undertaking (BRU). A BRU has the same effect in law as a BRO but does not involve a court hearing. The period of a BRU is slightly discounted to take account of early settlement of the matter, hence the lower duration average in respect of BRUs as opposed to BROs.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 March 2008]:</i> The Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 will prohibit traders from engaging in unfair commercial practices, including aggressive selling techniques, towards consumers. A practice is considered aggressive if, through the use of harassment, coercion or undue influence, the average consumer&#146;s freedom of choice or conduct is significantly impaired, and this causes or is likely to cause him to take a different purchasing decision.</p>

This work followed extensive public debate about the state of childhood today and provided insights into the attitudes of parents and children themselves, including their views on appropriate roles for Government, councils, schools and families in creating the right conditions for happy childhoods. The research cost &#163;80,840 (including VAT). The outcomes have informed the Children&#146;s Plan, published in December 2007, and particularly the proposals for a new focus on improved opportunities for outdoor play.

 Future Carrier, as an integral part of the Carrier Strike capability contributes to a number of planning scenarios, the details of which I am withholding as their release would, or would be likely to, prejudice the defence of the United Kingdom.

 Reserves in formed units, such as Territorial Army (TA) Battalions and Regiments, and Royal Auxilliary Air Force Squadrons, are in most cases maintained to provide a framework which parallels their Regular equivalent, as over the years this has been shown as the most effective and robust method of providing a framework, upon which reservist capability can be recruited, grown, nurtured and trained.</p>

However the current operational requirement dictates that TA capability is deployed variously as individual reinforcements, formed sub-units and only in some exceptional cases&#151;particularly field hospitals&#151;as formed units.

The revised algorithm for allocation of such prisoners means that, unless a risk assessment indicates otherwise, these prisoners will be assessed as Category C and allocated to the Category C training estate. Here they will be able to access a wider range of offending behaviour programmes. Copies of the original and revised forms will be placed in the Library.</p>

 No specific research has been commissioned to investigate the relationship between aspects of prison regimes and re-offending. However, the latest available re-offending data, for the 2004 cohort of adult prisoners discharged from custody, shows that re-offending decreased by 4.6 per cent. between 2000 and 2004 after controlling for changes in offender characteristics. Re-offending behaviour can be influenced by not just the programmes run in prisons, but also the work of probation services and other partners once the offender has been released, as well as a wider range of socio-economic factors.</p>

 Around 2,000 trainees are expected to be on the Olympic site over the period of construction and between 85 per cent. and 90 per cent. of these (1,700 to 1,800) are likely to be NVQ level 2.

This will enable total UK Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) to reach over &#163;9.1 billion a year by 2010-11. We continue to urge all countries similarly to live up to their commitments, including the promises made at the 2005 Gleneagles summit, and to achieve the millennium development goals. The successful recent replenishments of the World Bank&#146;s International Development Association and of the African Development Fund in 2007, to which the UK pledged &#163;2.134 billion and &#163;417 million respectively over the next three years, will ensure that low-income developing countries will continue to benefit from the concessional finance and expertise of these institutions.</p>

1. Family Expenditure Survey figures are for the United Kingdom. Family Resources Survey figures are for Great Britain up to 1997-98, and for the United Kingdom from 1998-99 onwards, with estimates for Northern Ireland imputed for the years 1998-99 through to 2001-02.<br>
2. The reference period for Family Resources Survey figures is single financial years. Family Expenditure Survey figures correspond to single calendar years for 1979, 1981 and 1987, two combined calendar years from 1988-89 to 1992-93, and two financial years combined for 1993-95 to 1995-97.<br>
3. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication &#145;Households Below Average Income&#146; series, which uses disposable household income, equivalised for household size and composition, as a proxy for standard of living. This uses the OECD equivalence scale for all years in the series.<br>
4. The median income of the survey year in question has been used, namely the contemporary median, instead of using a fixed median for a particular year.<br>
5. For after housing costs, housing costs (such as rent, water rates, mortgage interest payments, structural insurance payments and ground rent and service charges) are deducted from income.<br>
6. Amounts in the tables have been presented in millions, rounded to the nearest 100,000 children.<br>

An additional conferencing tool will also be provided later in 2008 and this is expected to help provide further options to conduct more business from home offices and as a consequence reduce the amount of business travel.</p>

1. Definition of the proportion of children living in a working-age workless household is the percentage of children aged under 16 in a working-age household where no adult works. A working-age household is a household that includes at least one person of working age (a woman aged between 16 and 59 or a man aged between 16 and 64). Workless individuals are those who are either International Labour Organisation unemployed or economically inactive (that is, not in employment).<br>
2. Quarter 2 is April to June.<br>
3. The data provided differs from the data on children in workless households published by the ONS for Great Britain: the data provided has been adjusted by DWP for households with unknown economic activity, while the ONS published data for Great Britain is unadjusted.<br>
4. The DWP adjusted data for GB is used in measuring progress towards reducing the number of children in workless households to help inform the delivery of the child poverty PSA. The data has been previously published in a chart on page 19 of the 2007 DWP Autumn Performance Report.<br>

 Both in the UK and overseas, staff are paid subsistence to compensate for the additional costs of being away from home on official duty. Subsistence covers the cost of a room in a typical hotel and the costs of meals and other incidentals. Each post has a different daily subsistence rate depending on different economic conditions. Depending on local circumstances, Posts will normally book and pay for any hotel rooms direct, charging this back to the departmental cost centre for the member of staff involved. Our policy is to use standard hotels in the city concerned, typically non-luxury business hotels reasonably close to the Post.</p>

 The UK strongly supports the EU presidency statement of 15 March 2008 which said that the recent parliamentary elections in Iran were &#145;neither free nor fair&#146; and that &#145;the Iranian people deserve a genuine democratic choice about their country's future&#146;. We were deeply disappointed that Iran&#146;s Interior Ministry and Guardian Council disqualified over a third of all prospective candidates who registered to stand, including a large proportion of reformist candidates. This denied the Iranian electorate their right to choose from candidates representing the full range of political views in their country and make a genuine democratic choice about how they are governed. We do not wish to take sides in Iran&#146;s internal debates, but together with the EU we will continue to stand up for the internationally recognised principles to which many Iranians aspire including freedom of speech and transparent, genuinely democratic and accountable government.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 February 2008]:</i> The Government take underage drinking very seriously. The National Alcohol Strategy &#145;Safe.Sensible.Social&#146; published in June 2007, focuses action on three groups most at risk which are 18 to 24-year-old binge drinkers, young people under 18 who drink alcohol, and harmful drinkers whose drinking is damaging their health, often without them realising it.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_450"><a name="80327w0021.htm_para7"><a name="08032779000637">In the Home Secretary&#146;s speech on 6 February 2008, she said that a number of new measures and possible steps would be taken to crack down on crime and antisocial behaviour which is fuelled by alcohol. This includes highlighting the message that it is not acceptable for young people to drink in public places. The Home Secretary also said that she is considering a number of options including making the possession of alcohol by a young person an offence, or possibly involving the parents if alcohol is confiscated from a child. We are currently considering the effectiveness of the current powers and what can be done to help the police use them more effectively.</p>

This allows card schemes to apply for accreditation under PASS and entitles them to issue cards displaying the PASS holographic logo.

<p><a name="stpa_457"><a name="80327w0022.htm_para0"><a name="08032779000668">Further advertising activity to support the points-based system is planned in the next financial year. This activity will continue to be aimed at employers who will have new responsibilities under these new immigration controls. The budget for that activity has not yet been finalised.</p>

The following table gives figures for people sampled by the Yorkshire police forces, however, these people may not be resident in the area in which they were sampled. There are two figures for each force: the number of profiles, and the estimated number of individuals. The number of profiles held on the database is not the same as the number of individuals. As it is possible for a profile to be loaded onto the NDNAD on more than one occasion, some profiles held on the NDNAD are replicates. This can occur, for example, if the person provided different names, or different versions of their name, on separate arrests, or because profiles are upgraded.</p>

 The Identity and Passport Service, and prior to 1 April 2006, the UK Passport Service, has introduced a range of measures that help to counter identity fraud. These include carrying out identity checks, investigating suspected identity fraud cases, implementing systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent applications for UK passports, systems to confirm the validity of UK passports presented to other organisations and the introduction of interviews for first time passport applicants over 16-years-old. As part of research into the cost of identity fraud to the UK economy published in February 2006, The UK Passport Service calculated the cost of measures to counter identity fraud when processing applications for UK passports issued in the UK at &#163;62.8 million.</p>

 Dispersal orders are one of a number of measures to tackle antisocial behaviour. They have succeeded in tackling underage drinking, joyriding, noise nuisance, the antisocial use of fireworks and the harassment and intimidation of residents. They are not intended to be used in isolation, but should form part of a tiered and integrated response to tackling crime and disorder and antisocial behaviour in local areas. This includes work by Youth Offending Teams to prevent young people getting involved in offending and antisocial behaviour. There are no plans to extend dispersal powers.</p>

 Individuals subject to football banning orders imposed in England and Wales are required by the Football Banning Orders Authority to report to a designated police station at the beginning of the control period for all matches and tournaments played outside England and Wales and thereafter on match days.
