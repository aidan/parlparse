This is to ensure we have sufficient staff to cover the business over the transition period. We will ensure that existing staff work closely with both the MFA&#146;s senior management team and the MMO implementation team to capture knowledge and pass it to MMO staff who will begin to populate the skeleton body.</p>

 Out of 204 local authorities with a Housing Revenue Account, 178 have the servicing of a notional level of debt, the Subsidy Capital Financing Requirement (SCFR) supported by the HRA subsidy system. The remaining 26 are considered to be debt free and have a zero or negative SCFR. Of the 178 local authorities that have a level of debt supported by the HRA subsidy system 43 are in positive subsidy. In addition those authorities in Rounds 1 and 2 of the ALMO (Arms Length Management Organisation) programme receive an ALMO allowance to support the associated borrowing. For all other ALMOs the support for the associated borrowing is included within the SCFR.

 There has been a most impressive improvement in children's oral health. National surveys undertaken every 10 years show that between 1973 and 2003 the proportion of children starting school with no experience of tooth decay increased from 30 per cent. to 59 per cent. Over the same period, the proportion of 12-year-old children with decayed missing, or filled (DMFT) permanent teeth has fallen from 93 per cent. to a historic low of 38 per cent. As the following extract from The World Health Organisation Global Database of Oral Health shows, in this age group, the United Kingdom and Germany have the lowest levels of tooth decay.</p>

 Data on school temporary buildings were supplied to the Department by local education authorities in 2001, 2003 and 2005. However, the data did not show numbers of pupils taught in those buildings.

Progress is being made year-by-year in improving the quality of the school building stock. The bulk of schools capital is now allocated by formula to authorities and schools so that they can address their local priorities, including the replacement of decayed temporary accommodation, on which we have set a high priority. Given the high levels of funding, authorities have the opportunity to replace temporary buildings where they are considered to be unsuitable.</p>

 The Healthy Weight, Healthy Lives strategy sets out what the Government will do to reduce obesity but also calls on all parts of society to act. Schools have a vital part to play in helping children achieve and maintain a healthy weight. The Department has made available guidance and resources to help schools provide a healthy environment by providing nutritious school lunches, improving participation in high quality PE and sport opportunities, helping children learn about health through personal, social, health and economic education and practical activities such as cooking. Guidance and support is also provided to the 90 per cent. of schools that are currently participating in the national healthy schools programme, which promotes a whole-school approach to health, for example Guidance for Schools on Healthy Eating, and Physical Activity Guidance. Guidance from this Department and the Department of Health is issued to schools on how they can support the National Child Measurement Programme, which collects essential height and weight data on primary school pupils in Reception and Year 6.</p>
