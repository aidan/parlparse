<i> [holding answer 16 June 2008]:</i> The EU&#146;s proposed 16 per cent. burden-sharing target for the UK&#146;s non-traded sector is still subject to negotiation and applies to the entire non-traded sector. As such it will not be broken down into specific sectoral shares, for example between the transport and domestic heating sectors.

 The Department is working closely with Network Rail and Stagecoach South Western Trains (SSWT) to finalise the design and costs of the partial conversion of Waterloo International to accommodate some domestic services.

<p><a name="stpa_167"><a name="80626w0002.htm_para2"><a name="08062683000141">It is primarily the railway infrastructure outside Waterloo that limits the number of trains that can use the station rather than the number of platforms. Therefore the need is to run longer trains rather than more trains. So we are planning to make all the platforms at Waterloo long enough to accommodate 10 car trains and to modify the junction layouts on the approaches to the station so that, ultimately, all the platforms at Waterloo, including those once used by Eurostar, can be used by 10-car domestic services. Such a scheme would allow the use of longer trains than currently use the short platforms and would result in a large increase in capacity on the South Western network.</p>

 The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) modelled in detail the numbers and types of staff likely to be needed to undertake the back office operations from now until post 2017. This showed that, despite increasing volume from ID card demand, there will be a reduction in traditional examining and related production and customer support posts in IPS, due to the process efficiencies to be delivered from increasing automation and processing by the new Application and Examination system. These changes put pressure on IPS to adopt a more efficient operating model and to adjust its staff structure in some offices. Glasgow emerged for this proposal for the reasons that it has a relatively small production capacity; it currently has lower output per full-time equivalent compared to the larger offices; it already has an established capability for carrying out post issue counter fraud activity and there are opportunities for redeployment. The service to the public will remain the same.</p>

<i> [holding answer 29 April 2008]: </i>An audit record will be kept of occasions when an individual's record is checked or amended. The biometric, biographic and administrative components of the national identity register will each have their own audit record so information from these individual audit records will only be brought together to support the security of the register, in the interests of national security or the prevention and detection of serious crime, or to respond to an individual's request for data subject access.</p>

 The information, including the number of biometric fingerprints to be recorded and stored in the chip on the identity card for British citizens, will be prescribed in secondary legislation to be approved by Parliament under section 6 of the Identity Cards Act 2006. However, our intention is that during the enrolment process we will record 10 fingerprint images which will be stored on the national identity register with two of the holder's fingerprints stored on the chip on the identity card. This is also the procedure planned for the identity card to be issued to foreign nationals.</p>

 The precise manner of enrolment of fingerprint biometrics has yet to be finalised for identity cards to be issued to British citizens under the Identity Cards Act 2006. However, it is intended that 10 plain fingerprints will be recorded and stored on the national identity register. This will be compatible with fingerprint biometrics recorded for identity cards to be issued to foreign nationals under the UK Borders Act 2007.</p>

 The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has expressed concern that the Islamic Republic of Iran&#146;s lack of a comprehensive regime for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) represents a significant vulnerability within the international financial system. In addition to its role in setting and monitoring standards for AML/CFT in general, the FATF has warned the financial sector of the risks posed by Iran and advised jurisdictions on implementation of the financial provisions of UN Security Council Resolutions relating to Iran&#146;s nuclear activities.</p>

The FATF has also met Iranian authorities to discuss measures to improve Iran&#146;s AML/CFT regime. The FATF is keeping the risk posed by Iran under review and discussed progress at its meetings in London this month.

It welcomed the actions taken by its members to advise their financial institutions of these risks, and noted it was concerned about the lack of progress by, in particular, Uzbekistan and Iran.

 I refer the hon. Member to my answer on 5 June 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, column 1111W. The Government undertook a review of the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act in 2002 and published the document &#147;Breaking the Circle&#148; which set out proposals for reform of the Act. That paper made proposals for modifying disclosure periods for offences, and other changes to the operation of the Act. In 2003 the Government agreed that the proposals had merit and proposed to legislate when parliamentary time allowed. The position is now under review in the light of the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Act 2006, which was based on the recommendations of the Bichard report, and which makes changes to the disclosure situation for ex-offenders in many areas of employment.</p>

 Disposal of waste is a matter for local management across the prison estate. As prisons are much more than simply &#145;dwellings&#146; for prisoners, the waste comes from several sources. There is the equivalent of domestic waste but there is additional waste generated by industrial, commercial, horticultural and office activities. The majority of prisons now sort waste for sale, recycling or re-use. When waste cannot be disposed of in this fashion, generally prisons arrange for commercial collection and disposal. There is one known exception, when a prison pays a collection charge to the local authority.</p>

In the meantime, the Learning and Skills Council is progressing with its work to agree minimum levels of performance for apprenticeships; developing a new blueprint which clearly defines the core elements of an apprenticeship and specific training requirements; and working with the new Learning and Skills Improvement Service to secure continuous improvement in the provision of apprenticeships.</p>

 The Department was formed on 28 June 2007 from the DTI (now BERR) and the DfES (now DCSF). The Department accesses a range of corporate and professional skills development activities through these former Departments, in addition to internal provision in DIUS and that procured through external suppliers.

 During my recent visit to Bangladesh, I reiterated that the UK's interests, like those of the Bangladeshi people, are best served by a stable, prosperous and democratic Bangladesh. I met the Bangladesh Finance Adviser, and the Bangladesh Chief of Army Staff and expressed the UK's support for the roadmap for national elections before the end of 2008. I also repeated the UK's call to relax the provisions of the State of Emergency in Bangladesh, in order to facilitate conditions for the preparation of free and fair elections. I publicly urged all sides, including the political parties, to engage and participate positively in the democratic processes to bring a smooth transition to an elected government, which can sustain credible democracy thereafter. Also, I asserted the UK's belief that a return to the violent and confrontational politics of 2006 could never sustain democracy in Bangladesh.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) believes that poor farmers, if properly supported, have the potential to contribute significantly to reducing hunger and poverty by growing food for their families and the immediate community. This also contributes to overall economic growth. At the recent Rome Food Summit the UK called on all donors, other international organisations, developing country governments, the private sector and civil society to double our efforts to tackle hunger and poverty under a Global Partnership for Agriculture and Food (GPAF). DFID works directly on agriculture in more than 20 countries, investing &#163;120 million a year. In Africa and Asia DFID also supports a range of social protection programmes. In Africa alone we spend &#163;55 million a year on rural safety nets which deliver social transfers to 8 million poor farmers.</p>

It highlights the need to provide support to poor farmers, and to provide alternative income opportunities in rural areas. DFID is also a leading supporter of the Comprehensive African Agriculture Development Programme, CAADP, an Africa-led initiative looking to find the best ways of addressing the primary millennium development goal target of poverty and hunger.</p>

 The humanitarian situation in Zimbabwe continues to be a grave cause for concern. This year&#146;s harvest has been the worst in post-colonial history. The World Food Programme estimates that 5.1 million people may need food aid in the coming year. The severe HIV/AIDS crisis, increasing poverty and destitution, the chaos caused by hyperinflation, and the breakdown of water and sanitation services, are all adding to the risk factors for a major humanitarian emergency.</p>

This information was obtained from the PACT system, which covers prescriptions prescribed by general practitioners, nurses, pharmacies and others in England and dispensed in the community in the United Kingdom. For data at PCT level, prescriptions written by a prescriber located in a particular PCT but dispensed outside the PCT will be included in the PCT in which the prescriber is based. Prescriptions written in England but dispensed outside England are included. Prescriptions written in hospitals/clinics that are dispensed in the community, prescriptions dispensed in hospitals and private prescriptions are not included in PACT data. It is important to note this as some British National Formulary (BNF) sections have a high proportion of prescriptions, written in hospitals that are dispensed in the community. For example, BNF chapter 4 &#145;Central Nervous System&#146; has a fair proportion of items written in mental health clinics that are dispensed in the community&#151;these prescriptions are not included in the PACT data.<br>

Finished admission episodes (FAEs): A FAE is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year. 3. Data quality: HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. Whilst this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain. 4. Assessing growth through time: HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. During the years that these records have been collected by the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time. 5. All Diagnoses count of episodes&#151;primary and secondary&#151;&#147;drug related&#148;: These figures represent a count of all FAEs where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in a HES record. 6.

1. Data quality<br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts, and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
 2. FCE<br>
A FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>
3. All operations count of episodes<br>
These figures represent a count of all FCE&#146;s where the procedure was mentioned in any of the 12 (four prior to 2002-03) operation fields in a HES record. A record is only included once in each count, even if an operation is mentioned in more than one operation field of the record.<br>
 4. Low numbers<br>
Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between one and five have been suppressed and replaced with &#145;*&#146; (an asterisk). Where it was possible to identify numbers from the total due to a single suppressed number in a row or column, an additional smallest number have been suppressed in order to protect patient confidentiality.<br>
5. Ungrossed data<br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (ie the data are ungrossed).<br>

1. Birth Registrations 2002-06 as at 31 December each specified year. Figures are based on the full time equivalent numbers of qualified midwifery staff each year.<br>
2. SHA totals 2002-05 have been calculated using previous health authority (HA)/SHA configurations. HAs were reconfigured to become the 28 SHAs in 2002 and were subsequently reconfigured in to 10 SHAs in 2006.<br>
3. Due to overlaps in the HA/SHA reconfigurations, parts of West Pennine HA and North Derbyshire HA were split over Trent SHA and Greater Manchester SHA. These figures were included in the Trent SHA total to give the figure for the new East Midlands SHA.<br>

 The Department's &#145;Consultation on a Statutory Scheme to Control the Price of Branded NHS Medicines&#146; and the accompanying impact assessment, issued on 18 June 2008, set out how the proposed measures that are subject to consultation are estimated to result in a lost profits to the pharmaceutical industry of &#163;280 million a year. The United Kingdom comprises only 3.5 per cent. of the global market and in patent medicine prices will continue to be significantly greater than manufacturing and distribution costs. Therefore the Department has concluded that, although there will be an impact on profits for the global pharmaceutical industry as a result of the proposed measures, these will not be significant enough to affect the viability of global pharmaceutical companies.</p>

Definition of prevalence<br>
Quality and Outcomes Framework (QOF) prevalence information for 2006-07 is based on the 8,372 practices that were in the QOF achievement dataset.<br>
For 17 of the 19 areas of the clinical domain, the Quality Management and Analysis System (QMAS) captures the number of patients on the clinical register for each practice. (The other two clinical areas, depression and smoking indicators, are based on subsets of other clinical registers.) The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices&#146; lists.<br>
Raw prevalence for each clinical area is defined as a percentage of patients on a practice list:<br>
Raw prevalence = (number on clinical register/number on practice list) x 100<br>
 QOF prevalence<br>
It is important to emphasise that QOF registers do not necessarily equate to prevalence, as defined by epidemiologists. For example, prevalence figures based on QOF registers (eg obesity) may differ from prevalence figures from other sources because of coding or definitional issues. QOF registers are constructed to underpin indicators on quality of care. QMAS only uses &#145;Read codes&#146; that are common to all three versions. It is difficult to interpret year-on-year changes in the size of QOF registers. For example, a gradual rise in QOF prevalence could be due partly to epidemiological factors (such as an ageing population) or due partly to increased case finding.<br>

 We remain deeply concerned at the political situation in Burma. The regime continues to ignore the calls of the UN Security Council for a genuine and inclusive dialogue with the opposition and ethnic groups. Such a dialogue is the only way the country will achieve the national reconciliation, prosperity and stability it needs now more than ever. The renewal of Aung San Suu Kyi&#146;s house arrest on 27 May, and the regime&#146;s decision to undertake its flawed referendum in the midst of a humanitarian crisis, underline the urgency of making progress. As my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister said on 19 June 2008, the recent referendum lacks all credibility and the new constitution cannot provide a sound basis for Burma&#146;s future.</p>

 Both the UN Mission in Sudan (UNMIS) and the UN-African Union Mission in Darfur (UNAMID) incorporate an extensive human rights network, with officers investigating alleged human rights abuses by any party. Both UNMIS and UNAMID produce a weekly report of such allegations. Where there is evidence of specific human rights abuse by the Sudanese armed forces&#151;or any other warring faction&#151;we raise it with the appropriate authorities.</p>

 There are currently 43 British citizens imprisoned in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Consular officers can consider approaching the local authorities only if a British citizen is not treated according to internationally accepted standards. This may include where a trial does not follow internationally recognised standards for a fair trial or is unreasonably delayed compared to local cases. We have no record of any such approaches having been made in the UAE in recent years.</p>

We have no record of any such issues having been raised in recent times with UAE authorities. However, we have on occasion brought welfare concerns to the attention of prison authorities. These usually involve dietary and medical issues raised by prisoners. Our consulate in Dubai has taken up four cases of ill treatment with the Dubai authorities in the last three years. Posts also continue to liaise with the authorities in Sharjah and Abu Dhabi to ensure that the appeals are progressing.</p>
