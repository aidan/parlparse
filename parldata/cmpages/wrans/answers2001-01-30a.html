<P>
<a name="10130w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Llew Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment he has made of the recently published report by the United Nations Environment Programme into the environmental and health impact of the use of depleted uranium munitions by NATO forces during the conflict over Kosovo.  [145293]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The UN Environment Programme's (UNEP) report has not yet been published, but is expected around March 2001.
<P>

<a name="10130w01.html_para0">UNEP announced its intention in September 2000 to conduct field studies of sites in Kosovo that were struck by ordnance containing depleted uranium during the Kosovo crisis and undertook a field mission during November 2000. The mission to Kosovo took vegetation, soil and water samples and radiological measurements in chosen target sites. The mission also planned to undertake an analysis of the toxicological situation. The samples have been sent to a number of European laboratories for further analysis. UNEP announced some preliminary findings following this field mission, by way of press releases. When the final report is published, we will make an assessment of its findings.
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Chaytor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if it remains his policy to sanction the use of munitions containing depleted uranium in future operations in which the United Kingdom is involved; and if he will make a statement.  [144736]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2001]:</i> Depleted uranium (DU) ammunition provides a battle winning military capability. Alternative materials are not as effective. Therefore DU will remain part of our arsenal for the foreseeable future because, when this country commits our forces to conflict, we fight to win. Our troops need the best available equipment to enable them to do this. To deny them a legitimate capability would be quite wrong.

<a name="10130w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. David Atkinson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if Russia will participate in the forthcoming NATO theatre ballistic missile defence feasibility studies; and if he will make a statement.  [146636]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence is not aware of any plans for Russian participation in the forthcoming NATO theatre ballistic missile defence feasibility studies. There have, however, been discussions between NATO and Russia in recent months on the scope for co-operation on theatre missile defence and related issues.

<a name="10130w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence if he will list the anti-tank weaponry available to his Department for purchase, indicating which of these weapons are in use in NATO forces.  [147271]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="10130w01.html_para1">As part of the acquisition process we publish details of the capability that we need to acquire. We then invite industry to present potential solutions that they believe will meet our requirements. We do not seek to assess every anti-tank weapon available for potential procurement, though we keep major developments under review.
<P>

<a name="10130w01.html_para2">Interoperability with other NATO forces is an important consideration in deciding which anti-tank equipments to purchase.

<P>
<a name="10130w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Quentin Davies: </B>

<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to ensure that Type 45 destroyers have their own anti-submarine warfare capability; if this will be available from the outset; and if he will make a statement;  [147574]

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w01.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 As I stated on 21 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 248-51W, a contract was placed on 20 December with BAE Systems Electronics (the nominated Prime Contractor for the Type 45 programme) for the Demonstration and First-of-Class Manufacture phase covering the completion of the design and build of the first three Type 45 destroyers. Equipped with the Principal Anti-Air Missile System, the primary role of the Type 45 is anti-air warfare, although it will have an anti-submarine capability.
<P>

<a name="10130w01.html_para4">Following contract signature we have been able to accelerate the fitting of a hull-mounted sonar, the top requirement within the Incremental Acquisition Plan (IAP), so that this is now achievable in all Type 45s as they are built. An Invitation to Tender for the sonar system will be issued by the Prime Contractor in February and we envisage that a new, off-the-shelf system will prove to offer best value for money.
<P>

<a name="10130w01.html_para5">The Type 45 has been designed with a much lower acoustic signature than the existing Type 42, and this will reduce the likelihood of its detection by submarines. From the outset, in addition to the sonar, the Type 45's anti-submarine warfare capability will be provided by the Lynx HMA Mark 8 helicopter; the ships will also be fully interoperable with the Merlin HM Mark 1 anti-submarine helicopter. These aircraft will carry Stingray anti- submarine torpedoes. The Type 45s will also be equipped, from build, to carry the Surface Ship Torpedo Defence System (SSTD) towed and expendable acoustic decoys. In the longer term, all the Type 45s will also be fitted to deploy enhanced SSTD countermeasures, and this requirement forms part of the Type 45 IAP.

(3) pursuant to his answer of 21 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 249-50W, what obligations the DFM contract places upon BAE Systems Electronics to prepare BAE Systems Marine and Vosper Thorneycroft to compete for later ships of the class;  [147983]
<P>
(4) pursuant to his written answer of 21 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 249-50W, if acceptance of BAE Systems Marine's unsolicited proposal would require <i>(a)</i> amendment and <i>(b)</i> renegotiation of the DFM contract with BAE Systems Electronics.  [147985]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w01.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 In his statement on 11 July 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 701-12, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Defence advised the House that, under the control of the Prime Contractor (BAE Systems Electronics), a single design definition is being developed involving the two shipbuilders BAE Systems Marine and Vosper Thorneycroft. This will mean, that from the outset, we have a design that can be efficiently constructed by either company, and that this will assist competition for follow-on ships. This is the basis of the Demonstration and First of Class Manufacture (DFM) contract which covers the design and build of the first three ships only. Our procurement strategy has not changed.
<P>

<a name="10130w01.html_para6">The DFM contract requires all sub-contracts with a value in excess of &#163;500,000 to be competed unless agreed otherwise between the Prime Contractor and the MOD. The Prime Contractor is also required to satisfy the MOD that prices of an sub-contracts to be placed non- competitively are fair and reasonable. The MOD is free to decide in what manner it wishes to be associated with the pricing of sub-contracts and, through the mechanisms described above, will have a close oversight of them. The Prime Contractor is responsible for the selection of his sub-contractors and the risk that the Prime Contractor has accepted in the contract will remain unchanged by this oversight.
<P>

<a name="10130w01.html_para7">The BAE Systems Marine unsolicited proposal is still being assessed but if it is accepted, the DFM contract would need to be re-negotiated.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what consultations he has held with awarding bodies and examiners in connection with their setting, marking and grading activities this summer; what assessment he has made of the extent to which the new AS levels will be accommodated within their programme of work and staff availability; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="10130w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wicks </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 January 2001]:</i> A greater number of examiners is needed this summer, not least because we are in transition from the old A level qualifications to our new and widely welcomed reforms. The exact number of examiners needed will not be known until Easter, when entries have been made. The awarding bodies have already begun recruiting examiners. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is working with the awarding bodies to ensure that the system will deliver this summer's results on time. We are monitoring this work closely to confirm that all necessary steps have been taken. The Government are committed to maintaining a robust and effective public examination system.

<a name="10130w04.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment when he last met representatives of the European Trades Union Confederation; and if he will make a statement on the issues discussed.  [147520]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 I have not met with the European Trades Union Confederation. However, during the UK Presidency, the Foreign Secretary chaired a meeting with the European Trades Union Confederation as is customary, followed by a reception; both events were attended by my right hon. Friend the Member for Oxford, East (Mr. Smith), the then Minister for Employment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will make a statement on the required level of <i>(a)</i> outcome-related funding for New Deal for Disabled People programmes and <i>(b)</i> other New Deal programmes.  [147734]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w04.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The central focus of New Deal is to secure jobs for unemployed people. Each New Deal aims to provide effective help in tackling the barriers that people face in getting work. In the New Deal for Disabled People we have given job brokers very wide discretion as to how they help people into jobs. In support of this wide flexibility much of the funding is geared to job entries and sustained employment rather than to stages and processes. The precise funding arrangements for other New Deals vary according to the detailed design and objectives for each programme.

<a name="10130w04.html_wqn2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what funding he has given to each school in Hampstead and Highgate under the New Deal for Schools.  [147875]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w04.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The information showing the schools in the Hampstead and Highgate constituency which benefited under the New Deal for Schools is shown in the following Table A. These allocations formed part of the &#163;3.462 million investment made so far in schools in Camden local education authority under the New Deal for Schools programme.
<P>

<a name="10130w04.html_para0">The New Deal for Schools was introduced as a new additional programme targeted specifically at addressing the backlog of urgent repairs in school buildings that had built up after 18 years of under funding under the previous Administration. It has been in addition to other capital funds made available to Camden local education authority.
<P>

<a name="10130w04.html_para1">In total, since 1996, Camden local education authority has received some &#163;10.66 million of funding for capital investment in school buildings as shown in the following Table B.
<P>

<a name="10130w04.html_para2">Nationally, investment in school buildings has tripled from &#163;683 million a year in 1996-97 to over &#163;2 billion in 2000-01. It will be &#163;3.2 billion in 2003-04, including grant, credit approvals and Private Finance Initiative credits. There will be central Government investment of &#163;7.8 billion in school buildings in total from 2001-02 to 2003-04.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment, pursuant to his answer to the hon. Member for Maidenhead (Mrs. May) of 24 January 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 581-84W, on adult education, how much Standard Spending Assessment was withdrawn from each of the local education authorities listed in respect of the switch of Government resources to the Learning and Skills Councils.  [147991]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w04.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 No Standard Spending Assessment has been withdrawn from local education authorities for 2001-02. My right hon. Friend announced yesterday that he would be making available an extra &#163;52 million in grant to authorities with lower than average increases in their Standard Spending Assessment (SSA) in 2001-02, and which face pressures from the introduction of the Learning and Skills Council, which will have responsibility for adult education from April. Newcastle local education authority's share of the additional grant will be &#163;760,000.

10979/00 submitted by the Department of Trade and Industry on 10 October 2000. The proposed Directive is currently being considered by both the European Parliament and the Council.
<P>

<a name="10130w06.html_para8">A Recommendation from CEPT implementing a "one-stop shop" for licences for satellite systems and services was adopted in October 1999. The procedure allows undertakings seeking licences in more than one country to apply via the internet using a single common application form, greatly reducing red tape within the legal framework established for European Community member states by the Licensing Directive 97/13/EC. Four countries have implemented the Recommendation to date, while several more, including the UK, expect to implement as soon as satisfactory testing of the software is achieved.
<P>

<a name="10130w06.html_para9">A second Recommendation from CEPT adopted in 1999 contained a subset of conditions drawn from the Licensing Directive relevant to the telecommunications satellite environment. The Recommendation encourages CEPT administrations to draw only from the reduced list when attaching conditions to satellite licences. The Recommendation also contains a list of guidelines designed to promote a harmonised understanding of each condition throughout CEPT.

Their original plan was published in 1989 and they have just published a revised plan based on a review. This concludes that regional Eurostar services would be heavily loss making and that there are no economic, environmental or social grounds for providing a subsidy. Copies of their report are available on their website at www.brb.gov.uk. In future the Strategic Rail Authority will have a duty to provide a plan for passenger services through the Channel tunnel.

Guidance on the publicity to be given to planning applications is contained in the Department's Circular 15/92, "Publicity for Planning Applications". This advises that major developments must be publicised through newspaper advertisement and either site notices or neighbour notification.

<a name="10130w07.html_para11">The paper by Viel and colleagues examined the spatial distribution of some types of cancer around a French municipal solid waste incinerator from 1980-95. For parts of that period, more soft-tissue sarcomas and non- Hodgkin's lymphomas than expected were found in areas close to the incinerator. The emissions from the incinerator were known to contain far higher concentrations of dioxins, dust and hydrogen chloride than are permitted now, and in 1998 the incinerator was therefore partly closed and partly upgraded. The authors advised that:

The expert advisory Committee on the Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment considered this and follow-up studies and concluded in March 2000 that any potential risk of cancer due to residency near to municipal solid waste incinerators was exceedingly low and probably not measurable by the most modern epidemiological techniques. The Committee agreed that, at the present time, there was no need for any further epidemiological investigations of cancer incidence near municipal solid waste incinerators.

 No specific assessment has been made but current flood management practices provide a measure of flood relief to urban properties in high-risk areas by allowing undeveloped land to flood. The benefits of managed retreat in coastal and estuarial situations have been recognised for some time and this is one of the options identified for assessment through shoreline management plans.

<a name="10130w08.html_para0">MAFF and the Environment Agency are currently developing guidance on river catchment assessments that will lead to catchment flood management plans. The restoration of flood-plain functions and washlands is likely to be one of the management options that will be considered in such plans. The revised draft PPG 25, on which we will be consulting shortly, will emphasise the need to consider flooding issues at the river catchment level. It will specifically advise that local plans should identify sites where managed realignment of coastal defences or restoration of functions to flood plains, could contribute to more sustainable flood management, as well as to amenity, landscape and biodiversity objectives.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. All figures are estimates and are taken from the Households Below Average Income (HBA) data set which is derived from the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS does not include Northern Ireland, and 1998-99 is the latest year for which data are available.<P>

2. Due to small sample sizes, reliable estimates of male pensioners aged 75 and over and female pensioners aged 80 and over, broken down by five year age bands do not exist.<P>

3. The estimates are sample counts, which have been adjusted for non-response using multipurpose grossing factors that control for region, council tax band and a number of other demographic variables. However, they do not control for the population by five year age bands. Estimates are subject to both sampling error and to variability in non-response. All proportions are rounded to the nearest per cent. and numbers to the nearest 100,000.<P>

4. The income measure used is weekly net (disposable) equivalised household income (that is to say income that is adjusted to reflect 



the composition of the household). The figures may be sensitive to the choice of equivalisation scale used.<P>

5. The estimates are presented on both a Before Housing Costs (BHC) and an After Housing Costs (AHC) basis in line with HBAI conventions.<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security when he will publish the inspection report of the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate in respect of the London borough of Wandsworth.  [148159]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10130w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate report was published today in respect of the London borough of Wandsworth and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10130w12.html_para0">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, as well as its counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="10130w12.html_para1">Inspectors consider that Wandsworth has a strong management structure including comprehensive documentation specifying its relationships with its in-house provider which exhibits good practice and experienced, knowledgeable staff, supported by guidance and procedures on an intra-net. The report notes overall significant improvements have been made to the Revenues and Benefits Service since its transfer in-house in November 1998, but there are still further improvements to be made. Wandsworth has implemented the Verification Framework and inspectors generally found a commendable level of verification but improvements are needed on the level of verification of residency.
<P>

<a name="10130w12.html_para2">The council has tight and well documented reconciliation procedures to help keep claims right, although inspectors consider they need to develop a risk analysis to focus counter fraud work.
<P>

<a name="10130w12.html_para3">The BFI reports that Wandsworth has a strong corporate commitment to counter fraud work and has successfully applied prosecutions and other sanctions. However, inspectors consider the council needs to improve arrangements for the management of overpayment identification, classification and recovery and maximising use of its powers to recover overpayments. Work also needs to be done to strengthen the quality of fraud investigations.
<P>

<a name="10130w12.html_para4">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.

 Estimates of the amount of unclaimed income-related benefits in Great Britain (Council Tax Benefit, Housing Benefit, Income Support, Jobseeker's Allowance) can be found in "Income Related Benefits Estimates of Take-Up 1998-99", a copy of which is in the Library.
<P>

<a name="10130w12.html_para5">There are no comparable estimates available of the amount of unclaimed Invalid Care Allowance, Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance or Disability Living Allowance.
<P>

<a name="10130w12.html_para6">No precise estimates are available of the amount of retirement pension left unclaimed, although take-up is thought to be between 95 per cent. and 100 per cent. On average around 98 per cent. of families take up their entitlement to Child Benefit. No estimates are available for different parts of Great Britain.

 We published in December 2000 our response to consultation on the Housing Green Paper. This set out radical measures to bring about improvement to the administration of Housing Benefit. These measures will help us to bring improvements to the performance of struggling councils to raise standards across the board and to streamline Housing Benefit to make it easier for councils to administer and simpler for individuals to claim.
<P>

<a name="10130w12.html_para7">As part of the drive to ease the burden on local authorities the Department is also discussing with representatives of registered social landlords proposals they have volunteered for assisting with elements of Housing Benefit administration.
<P>

<a name="10130w12.html_para8">We have also taken account of representations received from registered social landlords, and others about the appeal rights of third parties against the recovery of overpayments of housing benefit. Our decisions on this were set out in my written answer to my hon. Friend the Member for Birmingham, Hall Green (Mr. McCabe) on 10 January 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 575W.

<P>
<a name="10130w12.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Customs have a network of road fuel testing teams located regionally throughout the UK to ensure that rebated heavy oils, including red diesel, are not misused as fuel by road vehicles. These teams run testing vehicles in the UK which operate as mobile laboratories able to test for the chemical markers present in rebated oil.
<P>

<a name="10130w12.html_para9">Since 1996-97, Customs, excluding Northern Ireland, have prosecuted 20 cases of road fuel offences, involving red diesel, and have been successful in all cases.

 The second anniversary of the outbreak of unrest in the Moluccas on 19 January was marked by renewed violence in Ambon. At least 14 people were killed in clashes between Moslems and security forces. This latest break-down illustrates the fragility of the security situation and has cast a shadow over recent improvements in Ambon, including the calm period over the Moslem and Christian holidays. We remain deeply concerned by reports of attempts to force Christians to convert to Islam in Kesuiu and Tior. The Governor of Maluku led a second mixed-faith mission to the islands on 23 January. If necessary, the mission will arrange to evacuate all those wishing to leave the islands. We continue to urge the Indonesian Government to exercise tolerance and restraint, and remind them of their responsibility to maintain law and order and take immediate steps to bring the perpetrators of the violence to justice. I did so most recently with Foreign Minister Shihab on 12 December.

 The Government have recently issued a licence for the export of industrial gas turbine parts to Iran for civil end use. This particular industrial engine has been developed from a military engine and is commonly used to drive pumps and electric generators. The engine is not subject to export control when it is exported as a complete unit. However, when it is broken down into component form, a very small percentage of its parts are unchanged from their original form and, as military components, come within the scope of the UK's arms embargo and are controlled under Part III of Schedule 1 of the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994.
<P>

<a name="10130w13.html_para14">The Government are satisfied that Iran does not possess any aircraft powered by the original military engine, and that the risk of the components being diverted for use by the Iranian military is minimal.

 We fully support the efforts being made for peace and the protection of human rights and democracy in Colombia.

 Peace in Colombia will remain elusive until a concerted effort is made to tackle violence, inequality, poverty and social injustice and illegal drugs cultivation and trafficking. We and our EU partners place particular importance on the defence of human rights and international humanitarian law; assistance for victims of violence and the need to uphold the rule of law; protection of biodiversity and the environment; and support for regional co-operation. The EU package for Colombia of 105 million euro announced in October 2000 will focus on these areas. Our policy also stresses alternative development and voluntary eradication. US support for Colombia places a high priority on an anti-narcotics strategy, although a significant proportion of the US$1.3 billion package will also contribute to institutional-building, human rights and strengthening access to justice.

 No specific advice has been issued to schools on this subject. The Government are advised on food safety issues by the Food Standards Agency (FSA).

 Paragraph 3 of Schedule 9 to the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 imposes limits on campaign expenditure by registered political parties in the 365 days prior to the date of a parliamentary general election. The maximum amount a party may spend is determined by the number of constituencies contested. A party receives an allowance of &#163;30,000 for each constituency contested, subject to a minimum threshold. A party contesting every constituency in the United Kingdom would therefore be subject to a limit on campaign expenditure of &#163;19.77 million during the normal 365 day period.
<P>

<a name="10130w17.html_para8">I have today made a commencement order bringing Schedule 9 into force on 16 February 2001. As provided for, in section 163(6) of the Act, the order includes transitional provisions specifying a lower limit on campaign expenditure that will apply if the next general election is held less than 365 days after 16 February. In such circumstances, the allowance per constituency contested will be as follows:

<a name="10130w19.html_para8">Net changes to that previously planned recruitment by forces will result from the allocation of extra recruits from the CFF. The net change is expected to total 9,000 recruits over the three years 2000-01 to 2002-03. The table shows the current force allocations from the CFF for each year.
<P>

<a name="10130w19.html_para9">Some forces have asked to defer part of their CFF allocation into the next financial year and other forces have asked to bring forward CFF recruitment from next financial year into this year. In total, forces have been given authority for a net deferral of up to 250 CFF recruits from 2000-01 to 2001-02.
<P>

<a name="10130w19.html_para10">The current allocations for each force vary, however, with changes to the forces' recruitment plans. The latest estimates, shown in the table, include an expected net deferral of 210 CFF recruits from 2000-01 to 2001-02.

Allocations may differ from previously published figures, as they include agreed acceleration or deferral of CFF recruits between 2000-01 and 2001-02. In the case of the Metropolitan police agreement has been given to defer up to 155 CFF recruits from 2000-01 into 2001-02, but the force now expects to defer only 115. <P>

<P>
<a name="10130w20.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 No central support has been provided specifically for volunteers who staff police stations. The staffing of police stations by civilian volunteers is a result of local community initiatives between the police, the civilian volunteers, and civilian volunteer organisations.
<P>

<a name="10130w20.html_para5">The use of such volunteers by the police is an operational issue to be decided by the Chief Officer of a police force. The matter is most effectively addressed at a local rather than national level, as it is local needs that are being served. Many forces make use of civilian volunteers although the work they undertake varies.
<P>

<a name="10130w20.html_para6">I appreciate the work volunteers undertake to support the police. Such work is an excellent example of the community and the police working together.

 Article 41 of the proposed Council Directive on minimum standards on procedures in member states for granting and withdrawing refugee status is based on Article 3 of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees and Article 13 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community.
<P>

<a name="10130w21.html_para1">The Forum would include officials from the member states and experts from academic institutions and other bodies. It would discuss and advise on crime prevention trends and policies. We support the purposes of the Forum, but attach importance to ensuring that it should not duplicate activities in other European Union fora. We are also seeking information on the likely costs of the Forum and how these would be financed.

<a name="10130w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Criminal Records Bureau will issue certificates, on application, to individuals. An announcement about the fees that the bureau will charge will be made as soon as possible. It will be a matter for employers (or others, including voluntary organisations) to decide whether to reimburse the cost incurred by individuals. Waiving charges in respect of some or all of those in the voluntary sector would inevitably impose an additional burden on the Exchequer or result in a higher charge for others using the bureau, who may be no less deserving than those in the voluntary sector. But we have made clear our determination to keep the level of fees to a minimum.

1. The fall in expenditure in 1996-97 of 3.5 per cent. due to the reduction in capital spend following completion of major capital works in 1995-96. Capital spend in recent years is lower due to the introduction of Private Finance Initiative funding for new prisons.<P>

2. The fall in forecast spend this year (2000-01) due to the transfer to the Youth Justice Board. Adjusting for this factor reveals an increase in cash terms in 2000-01 of 2.9 per cent. <P>
