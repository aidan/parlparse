 Introducing the National Childcare Strategy shows that the Government recognise the importance of good quality affordable child care. We have encouraged and supported private child care provision.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w01.html_spnew2"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Since the FSA assumed its statutory powers on 1 December last year, it has been the single authority with responsibility for the regulation of the UK financial services industry, with rule-making powers. By 2004, the FSA will also assume responsibility for the regulation of mortgages and general insurance. The FSA has proposed changes to the polarisation rules that should enhance the benefits of competition and improve access to financial advice for many consumers and is working to ensure that information and disclosure to consumers of endowment mortgages and other financial products is improved.

 We will do so precisely in the way we did when reforming the betting and pools tax regimes, by working with the bingo companies to produce a new system of taxation which boosts growth, secures duty revenues, and benefits bingo players.

 The Government are committed to increasing the supply of risk capital for businesses throughout the UK. Backed by up to &#163;80 million of Government support, regional venture capital funds will provide up to &#163;270 million of investment in small businesses with growth potential across England. The devolved Administrations have similar public/private equity schemes. The Government have also invested &#163;20 million in a &#163;40 million community development venture fund focused on the most deprived wards in England.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what bilateral discussions he has had with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry regarding new taxes and regulations imposed on small businesses.  [63083]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Chancellor meets regularly with Cabinet colleagues, including the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="20620w01.html_para0">Since 1997 the Government have introduced numerous measures to help small business, including:
<P>

<P>
<BR>
implementing the recommendations of the Carter Review of Payroll Services;
<P>
<BR>
cutting the small companies' rate of corporation tax from 23 per cent. to just 19 per cent. and reducing the 10 per cent. starting rate to zero;
<P>
<BR>
introducing a 10p starting rate of income tax; and

introducing measures to ease the impact of VAT on small business.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20620w01.html_para1">The Government are committed to ensuring that regulations are fair and effective, so that they protect the vulnerable but do not stifle enterprise or productivity. Policy is to regulate only when necessary. Where appropriate the Government have exempted small business from certain regulations. Two examples are, exempting small shops from the new EU unit pricing requirements and exempting employers with 20 or fewer employees from the trade union recognition procedures in the Employment Relations Act.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w01.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Chancellor argued strongly for the further progress on debt that was made at the G7 meeting in Halifax, Canada, this weekend. The decision to complete the financing of the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) trust fund will allow a further $1 billion (&#163;677 million) of debt to be written off from the poorest countries' balance sheets.
<P>

<a name="20620w01.html_para2">That will help them adjust to the impact of the world economic slow down following the tragic events of September 11 and the collapse in commodity prices.
<P>

<a name="20620w01.html_para3">Under its 100 per cent. policy, the UK is already providing total debt relief to all eligible countries under the HIPC initiative and continues to use every opportunity to press other countries to do likewise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w01.html_spnew9"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 UK manufacturing productivity growth has averaged 2.6 per cent. a year since 1997. The Government are aiming to deliver conditions for improved productivity performance over the long term, and to that end have introduced a range of policies to promote competition, and raise investment, innovation and skills.

<P>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what representations he has received on the impact of the recent slow down in the eurozone economy on manufacturing industry in the south-west of England.  [60374]<P>

<P>
<a name="20620w01.html_spnew10"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The Chancellor and other Treasury Ministers regularly meet with manufacturing representatives from all regions and countries of the UK, including the south-west. These discussions cover a wide range of issues and the Government value the insights gained.

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> The total number of Customs and Excise officers suspended as at 16 June 2002 is 12. Seven are employed in the north of England, three in London, and two in the south of England. All involve allegations of potential gross misconduct, which if proved may result in dismissal.
<P>

<a name="20620w01.html_para4">It is Customs and Excise policy that suspension is normally only imposed in the most serious cases, when it is necessary and in the public interest. Suspension is always without prejudice, and does not anticipate any decision about the allegations made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w01.html_spnew14"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 All of the revenue from the climate change levy is recycled back to business through NICs cuts and support for energy efficiency. While the levy package is broadly revenue neutral to business as a whole, the effects on any specific sector will depend on a number of factors, including:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The future energy consumption of firms in the sector and the use they make of levy funded energy efficiency support.
<P>
<BR>
Employment levels in those sectors and the benefits received from the levy funded national insurance contribution cuts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 As the consultation document "Modernising Annuities" sets out, there are sound financial reasons for people to annuitise their retirement savings by age 75. So the Government do not propose to abolish the age 75 rule.

<a name="20620w02.html_para0">The consultation, which ran until 5 April, was intended to stimulate discussion on annuity issues. The Government are now evaluating the outcome of the consultation before deciding how to proceed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w02.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 We shall be introducing a new, lower rate of duty on biodiesel on Royal Assent to the Finance Bill, 20 pence per litre less than the rate for ultra-low sulphur mineral diesel. We have also introduced duty incentives to encourage the production and use of road fuel gases, such as compressed natural gas (CNG) and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and have given a commitment that duty on these fuels will be frozen in real terms until at least 2004.

<P>
<a name="20620w02.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government set out their strategy for tackling the misuse of marked rebated oils as road fuels in "Tackling Indirect Tax Fraud", published alongside the 2001 pre-Budget report. Following consultations, action is being taken to tighten fiscal control over the distribution of rebated oils and to introduce an additional European marker for rebated gas oil and rebated kerosene. The Government have seen no evidence that marking legitimate duty paid fuel would constitute a more effective or pragmatic response to the problem.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the impact of cross-border fuel smuggling on the Northern Ireland economy.  [62644]<P>
<P>
<P>

 The Government are committed to tackling fuel duty evasion and its associated problems in Northern Ireland. Further details about road fuels fraud in Northern Ireland and the Government's activities to counter it have been published in the documents "Tackling Indirect Tax Fraud" (November 2001) and the Northern Ireland Organised Crime Task Force's "Threat Assessment and Strategy" documents (May 2002). Copies of these documents have been placed in the House of Commons Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w02.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Customs' most recent estimate of the total revenue loss from the use of non-UK duty paid fuels, including legitimate cross-border shopping as well as all types of fraud, is for the calendar year 2000 and is contained in "Tackling Indirect Tax Fraud", published in November 2001 as part of the PBR. The Government have undertaken to update those figures annually.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the average cost is of a litre of <i>(a)</i> unleaded petrol and <i>(b)</i> diesel fuel in (i) Northern Ireland and (ii) the rest of the United Kingdom; and what proportion of the cost is made up of fuel duty in each case.  [62639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w02.html_spnew9"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Department of Trade and Industry collect information on the average pump prices of unleaded petrol and diesel on a weekly basis across the UK. However, this information is not broken down by geographical region and so it is not possible to provide average costs for Northern Ireland specifically.
<P>

<a name="20620w02.html_para1">DTI data suggests that, as at 10 June 2002, the UK average pump price of a litre of diesel was 76.1 pence and the UK average pump price of a litre of unleaded petrol was 74.6 pence.
<P>

<a name="20620w02.html_para2">At those prices, 60.2 per cent. of the price of a litre of diesel and 61.4 per cent. of the price of a litre of petrol is made up from fuel duty.

<P>
<a name="20620w02.html_spnew10"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Customs records of the number of vehicles seized do not disaggregate between the nature of the offences involved in each case. I regret, therefore, that this information is not available.

 Customs have made no such assessment.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is not possible to present the number of live births per 1,000 teenage women by social class as population estimates by social class are not available. Also social class is only available in England and Wales and Northern Ireland by father's social class, so it is not possible to derive social class for registrations where only the mother's name is recorded. In England and Wales a 10 per cent. sample of the fathers' occupation and employment status is used to determine social class. For Scotland births within marriage are categorised to social class of the father; social class of the mother is used to categorise births outside marriage.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The number of live births to teenage women are given in the following tables for 2000, the latest year for which information is available for the United Kingdom. Data for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland are presented separately because of differences between the constituent countries in the way social class is allocated (see above). The key for the social classifications is at the end of this annex.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Information is not collected at registration on ethnicity, only on country of birth of parents. In a recent article in Population Trends <sup>1</sup> data from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) were used to estimate average fertility rates for births to teenage mothers by ethnic group in Great Britain. Part of Table 3 of that article is presented below, giving data for the period 1990&#150;96. It should be noted that the results are based on very small sample numbers. No information is available from the LFS on marital status at the time of birth so it is not possible to look at ethnic fertility rates inside and outside marriage.</FONT></UL>

In its initial comments on what amendments might be considered, the United Kingdom has suggested that the Commission should consider either dispensing with or establishing the Advisory Committee.

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> My right hon. Friend the Minister of State for Rural Affairs (Alun Michael) represented this Department at the World Food Summit. Although the summit was primarily concerned with international development issues which go beyond DEFRA's responsibilities, my right hon. Friend's attendance reflects the importance we attach to the role of trade and rural development in alleviating poverty and hunger.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what representations the Government made to the insurance industry during and following the serious floods in 2000 to ensure that property insurance would continue to be available to owners and tenants of residential and commercial premises in areas at risk of flooding; what undertakings the insurance industry gave at that time; if she will respond to Esure's statement that insurers have decided to deny home insurance cover to prospective new clients in the 10 per cent. of postcodes most susceptible to flooding; and if she will make a statement about what steps the Government intend to take to ensure that property insurance remains available to all at a reasonable cost.  [63439]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is an agreement in place with the Association of British Insurers member companies that during 2002, other than in exceptional circumstances, they will continue to provide flood cover for domestic properties and small businesses which they currently insure. Cases where there is an alleged breach of this agreement will be investigated by the ABI.
<P>

<a name="20620w08.html_para0">The insurance industry is a competitive one. Government have no plans to intervene in the market either generally or with individual companies. While recognising concern about the recent announcement by Esure, I understand their position to be that they will not provide cover to new clients in areas at risk of flooding. This decision is not a breach of the ABI agreement which relates only to renewal of existing policies. It is also my understanding that as a relatively newly formed company, Esure have few existing clients in the floodplain.
<P>

<a name="20620w08.html_para1">While no formal assessment has been made, I am aware that there could be a significant impact if insurers were to withdraw cover for households and businesses at risk of flooding. The Government are therefore working hard with the industry to try to ensure the continued, widespread availability of affordable flood cover beyond the end of 2002. There have been regular meetings with the insurance industry, at both ministerial and official level, to consider their calls for increased investment in flood and coastal defence, controls on development in areas at risk of flooding, simplified arrangements for implementing flood defences and better information on real flood risk. I expect to meet again with the industry later in the summer.

 Korea is not authorised to export meat or animals to the European Union. DEFRA official veterinary advice is that there is no significant risk of travellers bringing foot and mouth disease back from Korea, provided rules on personal imports of animal products are observed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she is taking to reduce the possibility of a further outbreak of foot and mouth disease; and if she will make a statement.  [62157]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w08.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We are taking a number of steps to reduce the possibility of a further outbreak of foot and mouth disease through initiatives covering prevention; disease surveillance and contingency planning.
<P>

<a name="20620w08.html_para7">On 28 March the Government launched an action plan to reduce the risk of plant and animal disease entering the country illegally and threatening our agricultural and horticultural industries. A copy of the action plan can be found in the House Libraries. As recommended by the Policy Commission on Food and Farming, the action plan commits the Government to undertake a risk assessment of the threat posed by contaminated illegal meat imports. This is well under way and due to report in the autumn. The information provided by the risk assessment will help inform decisions about the nature of risks from imports so that resources can be efficiently targeted. Along side the risk assessment, work is being carried out to improve publicity and raise awareness of the risks posed by personal imports. Other work is concerned with improving detection and a pilot detector dog scheme will be operational later in the year.
<P>

<a name="20620w08.html_para8">We attach great importance to veterinary surveillance for the early detection of new or exotic diseases/ infections, including foot and mouth disease. Work on a strategy to enhance veterinary surveillance was curtailed last year because of the foot and mouth epidemic. This work has resumed and a strategy document is now in early draft form and will be issued for public consultation later this year.
<P>

<a name="20620w08.html_para9">In the event of a future outbreak of foot and mouth disease our ability to quickly contain and eradicate the disease will be vital. DEFRA has already published an interim operational contingency plan to support the European Union approved strategic plan, veterinary instructions and local plans that already existed. This draws extensively on experience of the 2001 outbreak and DEFRA will develop this further to achieve better emergency preparedness, taking full account of the recommendations of the independent inquiries.
<P>

<a name="20620w08.html_para10">Additionally, preventive measures introduced during the 2001 outbreak remain in force, for example the ban on feeding pigswill to livestock and the 20 day standstill on the movement of livestock.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> Individuals in the UK contribute to the CAP as consumers through higher food prices and as taxpayers through CAP direct support payments.
<P>

<a name="20620w09.html_para0">We estimate that, in 2000, a notional UK family of four paid &#163;4-&#163;5 per week in higher food prices as a result of the CAP. UK taxpayers do not contribute specifically to the CAP; rather they contribute to the EU budget as a whole. Total EU payments in 2000 were approximately &#163;51 billion (euro 83 billion), of which around &#163;25 billion (euro 40.5 billion) was spent under the CAP.

<P>
<a name="20620w09.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> Market price support in the UK dairy sector was equivalent to around &#163;900 million in 2000, the latest year for which data is available.

<P>

<a name="20620w09.html_para3">We are currently working on proposals for a specific scheme under the national scrapie plan to cover flocks that have had scrapie.

 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2002]:</i> EU legislation (TSE Regulation 999/2001 as amended) required the UK to test 15,000 sheep aged over 18 months and destined for human consumption from 1 January 2002. In addition to this, a SEAC-recommended scientific survey was run concurrently which added an additional 5,000 animals to the abattoir survey.

 I understand the hon. Member is referring to the injuries resulting from the administration to sheep of the ruminal bolus used to identify sheep under the national scrapie plan. Since January 2002 some 93,000 sheep have been tested under the plan. Of these 36 have died or have had to be destroyed following problems with the administration of the bolus. Compensation has been (or is in the process of being) paid to the owners concerned.

<a name="20620w09.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 June 2002]:</i> Through its breeding schemes the national scrapie plan aims to increase genetic resistance to TSEs by increasing the prevalence of the ARR allele. At present participation in the plan is voluntary and it is only rams with the genotypes which are the most susceptible to TSEs (those carrying the VRQ allele) which must be culled or castrated by those farmers who choose to join. Other susceptible genotypes in participating flocks are to be phased out over time. It is clearly in the interest of sheep farmers to convert their flocks to a TSE-resistant basis as quickly as possible and it should be possible for the vast majority, if not all, of them to do so over a planned time scale. If there were any breeds where the existence of the ARR allele is absent or so low as to make this impossible, the Government would of course take that into account. We have initiated, as part of the national scrapie plan, a rare breeds survey to obtain better information on the distribution of genotypes in rare breeds.

 The GEO-3 report provides an authoritative assessment that informs our thinking on global sustainable development. Although it does not single out individual countries, it makes clear that action is required by all countries in the north and the south to reverse environmental degradation. The report is an unequivocal reminder that sustainable development rests on three pillars&#151;economic, social and environmental. It highlights the need for action in key areas, such as biodiversity, climate change, forests and oceans. The UK Government takes the problems identified by the report extremely seriously and is taking appropriate action including;

<P>
<a name="20620w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Environment Agency has estimated that there may be some 300,000 hectares of land in the UK affected to some extent by industrial or natural contamination. However, much of this contamination will be relatively minor. It is not possible to estimate the value of this land because the total is not derived from an assessment of individual sites and value depends on site-specific factors such as land use or planning permissions.

<a name="20620w10.html_para4">Under Part IIA ("contaminated land") of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, local authorities are under a statutory duty to inspect their areas to identify contaminated land as defined in the Act. Broadly speaking, this is land which poses an unacceptable risk to human health or the environment in its current circumstances. This is an ongoing duty, which came into effect in April 2000 in England and more recently in Wales. It involves detailed risk assessments and determinations on a site-specific basis. The regime is described in DETR Circular 02/2000, "Contaminated Land". The Environment Agency will include data in its periodic State of Contaminated Land reports, the first of which for England is due to be completed this summer. I will arrange for a copy to be placed in the Library.

 The EC LIFE programme provides co-financing for actions both in nature conservation (LIFE-Nature) and in other fields of the environment (LIFE-Environment), as well as specific environmental actions outside the EU (LIFE Third Countries). The European Commission is responsible for implementing the LIFE programme.

The Commission are required (under Article 12 of Regulation EC 1655&#150;2000 of the European Parliament and the Council concerning LIFE) to produce a report on the implementation of the LIFE Regulation, including the programme's contribution to the development of Community environment policy, by 30 September 2003.

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> Responsibility for the MHS, the Executive Agency responsible for the enforcement of meat hygiene legislation, was transferred from MAFF to the Food Standards Agency when the Food Standards Agency was created on 1 April 2000. Funding transfers were made at the same time.
<P>

<a name="20620w11.html_para0">In 2001 the Government reduced charges to small and medium sized plants, as recommended in the Maclean review. This resulted in a loss of income to the MHS. The then MAFF, and the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales, as industry sponsors, contributed towards the cost of this change through baseline funding transfers to the Food Standards Agency.

<a name="20620w11.html_spnew2"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 Whereas the closure of branches of the major clearing banks in rural areas can sometimes lead to inconvenience for those who cannot easily travel to the nearest town, there are more rural post offices than rural branches of all the banks combined. Post offices are therefore well placed to provide banking services, and access to banking in rural areas is improving as more banks turn to the Post Office to provide their customers with convenient access. The Government are strongly supporting the Post Office in its plans to help reduce financial exclusion through innovative banking schemes and has made clear that it is prepared to provide funding for 'universal banking' on the basis of a robust business case.

 The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate's (BFI) report on Allerdale borough council was published today and copies of the report have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para0">This follow up inspection report shows that since the first inspection in October 1999 the council had made substantial progress in most areas of administering benefits. However, further improvements were still needed in counter fraud and overpayment.
<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para1">Allerdale had been struggling to bring work backlogs under control but the second inspection found work had been reduced to manageable levels through close management and monitoring of the situation.
<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para2">A significant increase in the number of staff in housing benefit administration and the appointment of a senior fraud officer as well as a restructuring of the teams in line with BFI's first recommendations had brought about a major improvement.
<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para3">In the fraud team, the long-term absence of a fraud officer had adversely affected the quantity and quality of investigations. BFI noted that the management was addressing the problems during the on-site phase of the inspection.
<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para4">The first inspection had also recommended the appointment of an overpayment officer. The council had done this and taken other positive steps to managing overpayment better. The situation has improved but further improvements are necessary to, in particular, improve debt recovery.
<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para5">Progress since the first inspection had been positively supported by greater involvement of Members and senior management in housing benefit administration and counter fraud work.
<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para6">Allerdale administered some &#163;19 million in housing benefits in 2000&#150;01.
<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para7">The report makes recommendations to help the council address weaknesses and to improve the administration of housing benefit and council tax benefit, as well as counter fraud activities.
<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para8">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State is now considering the report and will be asking the council for its proposals in response to the findings and recommendations of the BFI.

 Using the powers available to my right hon.

<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para9">We are disappointed that East Lothian council has been the subject of two critical reports by the Benefit Fraud Inspectorate before taking action to remedy their problems with benefit administration. However, we are pleased that the council is now starting to take its responsibilities seriously and improvements are being made in benefit administration.

It is the responsibility of the compensator&#151;in these cases the DTI&#151;to recover any appropriate benefit from miners' compensation.
<P>

<a name="20620w14.html_para13">To date the DTI has settled 28,000 claims amounting to &#163;137 million of compensation, of which the total sum recovered from miners is &#163;96,500.

<a name="20620w15.html_para0">Together with over &#163;3 million remaining development funding, this new investment will allow Culture Online to develop a range of innovative projects over the next two years. Culture Online will involve partnerships between cultural organisations and the private sector and we will be commissioning proposals for projects later this year. The funding will provide exciting new digital materials to enhance the school curriculum and lifelong learning. These new materials will be available through a Culture Online website and linked to the DfES Curriculum Online portal and the National Grid for Learning. Culture Online will monitor and evaluate projects to ensure the success of the programme.

 Finland has contributed liaison teams and a civil military co-ordination team.

Sweden has contributed intelligence troops. How long those countries will leave their troops at ISAF's disposal is a matter for them. We were pleased with the swiftness and generosity with which contributing nations offered troops to ISAF when the UK was planning its leadership, and the large number of countries contributing demonstrates the strength of international commitment to the war against terrorism.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w15.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Transport Act 2000 requires local authorities to draw up a local transport plan with policies to promote and encourage safe, integrated, efficient and economic transport services and facilities. Every plan must include a bus strategy containing policies as to how they intend to use their powers to secure the provision of local bus services meeting local needs.
<P>

<a name="20620w15.html_para2">The Act also provides powers for local authorities to make quality partnership schemes with operators of local bus services, to make ticketing schemes to promote joint or through ticketing between operators, and to make provision for making information about bus services available to the public. The Act also provides for local authorities to make quality contract schemes, involving the tendering of an entire local network, where this is the only practicable way for them to implement the policies set out in their bus strategies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Proposals for new tram and light rail schemes normally need Transport and Works Act (TWA) powers. If funding from my Department is essential for the project to proceed, promoters should seek a provisional view from my Department on whether the scheme passes the Government's appraisal tests which are used to decide whether a project is eligible for funding before seeking powers. In such cases, if and when such powers are obtained, my Department then reaches a decision on whether funding should be provided for the scheme.

 Major schemes in local transport plans, including light rail schemes, are assessed under the New Approach to Appraisal, which takes account of five over-arching objectives: environment, safety, economy, accessibility and integration.

 My Department's 10-year plan includes targets for <i>(a)</i> increasing bus use by 10 per cent. and <i>(b)</i> doubling light rail use.

 Light rail schemes can offer a range of benefits to business, in both urban and outer-city areas, depending on the circumstances of the particular case. They can provide a safe, reliable and efficient mode of transport for employees and customers; they may contribute to reducing congestion by attracting motorists from their cars; and they can increase the attractiveness of an area to potential investors.

 The potential role of light rail schemes in integrated transport strategies is summarised in paragraphs 107&#150;08 of my Department's Guidance on Full Local Transport Plans, as follows:

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>that they can be effective in providing a high quality public transport option in densely used transport corridors and in encouraging motorists to switch from their cars.
<P>
<BR>
108. However the capital costs of light rail schemes are high, particularly compared to bus priority measures and modest guided bus schemes which may offer a more cost-effective alternative. Therefore if authorities with to develop light rail schemes, they will need to be able to demonstrate that they represent good value for money, form an essential part of a local integrated transport strategy and that the objectives of that strategy cannot be met in better ways. It will also be important to show that a light rail scheme is fully integrated with other public transport modes in the area and that appropriate traffic managements schemes are to be introduced so that light rail has priority over other road space users and that the road decongestion benefits of the light rail scheme are maintained over a long period. We would also expect local authorities to develop public-private partnerships to take forward such schemes where this is necessary to secure Best

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will provide funding for greater car parking capacity at Stafford railway station.  [63162]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w17.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The provision of car parking facilities at railway stations was not a requirement of the original franchise agreements. Car parking capacity at Stafford station is a matter for the station operator, Virgin West Coast. The Strategic Rail Authority's rail passenger partnership scheme is a potential source of funding.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w17.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> Agreements between Railtrack and other persons regarding new freight connections to Railtrack's network are subject to the approval or discretion of the rail regulator under section 17 or 18 of the Railways Act 1993. The rail regulator has issued directions to Railtrack under section 18 for 31, six and four new connection agreements with Railtrack in each of the last three calendar years. Any such connection is subject to the Railways Act 1993, Railway Group Standards, the Railways and Other Transport Systems (Approval of Works, Plant and Equipment) Regulation 1994, the Transport and Works Act 1992, and Part G of the Railtrack Track Access Conditions. Railtrack publishes guidance for anyone seeking to connect to its network in a publication entitled "A Guide to Freight Connections". The latest edition was published in October 1998. Substantially the same regime applies to connections which do not involve Railtrack.

 <i>[holding answer 17 June 2002]:</i> The fixed track access charges paid by each franchised train operating company for 2001&#150;02 are shown in the table. In total these charges are 20.5 per cent. lower in real terms than the aggregate fixed track access charges for 2000&#150;01. This reduction takes account of direct grants from the SRA, in the absence of which access charges would need to be higher.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many roadside tests were carried out on motor vehicles to test for illegal petrol and diesel in each year since 1995.  [62947]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w18.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20620w18.html_para1">Roadside checks do not include risk-targeted checks made at premises. They are therefore only part of Customs activity to test for illegal petrol and diesel.
<P>

<a name="20620w18.html_para2">The decline in the number of tests made reflects a move to more risk assessed challenges. This makes better use of Customs' resources and results in a greater hit rate than for fully random testing. Figures for 2000 show hit rates of approximately 4.5 per cent. for random tests and 45 per cent. for risk-assessed challenges.
<P>

<a name="20620w18.html_para3">Customs figures for roadside checks do not go back as far as 1995. However, the table shows the number of roadside checks carried out from financial year 1996&#150;97.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what restrictions exist on the use of red diesel in the United Kingdom; and whether these regulations were changed following shortages in fuel supplies in September 2000.  [62939]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w18.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="20620w18.html_para4">Restrictions on the use of red diesel and other 'rebated oils' are contained in the Hydrocarbon Oil Duties Act 1979, and published in Customs and Excise Public Notice 75 "Fuel for Diesel Vehicles".
<P>

<a name="20620w18.html_para5">This legislation was not changed after the shortages in fuel supplies that occurred in September 2000, though for a brief period at the time motorists were permitted to use red diesel, provided that duty at the full, road fuel, rate was paid.

<a name="20620w20.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the role parents of school age children can play in helping improve children's academic performance at home.  [62858]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 Parents have an important role to play in supporting their children's learning at home to improve their academic performance. At a general level, for example, parents can discuss the school day with their child so they can praise and encourage them for good results and help them through any academic or other problems they might have. Parents can provide support with homework set by the school where it is appropriate; indeed our national homework guidelines for schools, published in 1998, emphasise, among other things, that schools should ensure they work closely with parents and ensure that they are given guidance about how best to help their children. A survey my Department published this April found that 76 per cent. of parents believe helping their children with homework is extremely important.
<P>

<a name="20620w20.html_para7">A great deal of work has been carried out by my Department to help parents become more involved, based on the strategy for involving parents which was first described in the 1997 White Paper "Excellence in Schools". This strategy comprised three strands: providing information to parents, giving parents a more effective voice, and encouraging families to learn together. Resources which have been produced for parents as part of this strategy include the Parents' Centre website, the Learning Journey parents' guides to the curriculum, and the "Parents + Schools" magazine, as well as several hints and tips booklets produced as part of publicity campaigns including the National Year of Reading, Maths Year 2000, and the Dads and Sons campaign.
<P>

<a name="20620w20.html_para8">Of course there are also many specific activities that parents can carry out: for younger children, reading with them and to them, playing number games or helping them with spellings; for older children, giving advice on how to organise their time, giving them support with using the internet, and encouraging children to engage in activities of general educational benefit, such as reading, and visiting museums and galleries. Underlying all these and many other activities is the idea that parents have a responsibility to show children that they believe in the value of education and learning, both for their own sake and as a means to achieving greater success in later life.

 The production of genetically modified animals (as well as their use in experiments or other scientific procedures) is controlled under the terms of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. The production and use of such animals allows new areas of medical and other scientific research to be explored: provides the potential for investigating a wide variety of conditions including cancer, cystic fibrosis and multiple sclerosis; and allows the quality of the science in many areas of research and testing to be improved. The Home Office does not maintain a central register of the lines produced of their physical characteristics. There are, however, a number of third party databases detailing genetically modified animals and their characteristics.

 The Lord Chancellor has made &#163;1.5 million available in this financial year to contribute to the costs of tuition fees and training contracts for prospective solicitors who undertake to carry out publicly funded work for at least two years after qualification. The Legal Services Commission (LSC) published a consultation paper "Developing Legal Aid Solicitors" on 12 June 2002. The paper sets out the details of two schemes which will provide support for up to 100 training contracts, and 100 LSC sponsorship grants, from September 2002. Copies of the paper have been placed in the Libraries of both Houses.

<P>
<a name="20620w23.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 Since July 2000, the British high commission has been running its sterling post account using the parallel rate of exchange, and charging for some of its consular and visa services using the parallel rate. It has held charges for other consular and visa services at the official rate. Initially, the two rates were broadly similar. But since February 2001, the parallel rate has diverged increasingly from the official rate, and the Zimbabwe dollar is now trading on the parallel market at around 10 times the official sterling rate of exchange. In financial year 2001&#150;02, this resulted in an under-recovery by the FCO of around &#163;422,000 in consular fees.
<P>

<a name="20620w23.html_para3">In order to regularise the position, and avoid any future shortfalls in recovery, the British high commission will charge for all consular and visa services at the parallel exchange rate, with effect from midnight on 23/24 June.

The agency's key targets are set by the Minister and are published each year in the agency's corporate and business plan. Performance against these key targets is monitored by the NIO as the agency's parent Department. The agency's performance against key targets is published in its annual report and accounts. Both publications are presented to Parliament.
<BR>
<i>Compensation Agency</i>
<BR>
The performance targets for the Compensation Agency are set out in its published corporate plan 2001&#150;04 and business plan 2001&#150;02.

<i>NDPSs</i>
<BR>
<i>Juvenile Justice Board</i>
<BR>
The Juvenile Justice Board was appointed on a temporary basis in July 2000, pending the creation of a youth justice agency as recommended following a review of the criminal justice system in Northern Ireland. The board currently operates on the basis of a ministerial strategic steer which it is then required to convert into an agreed action plan. The current programme which covers the period August 2001 to July 2002 includes the following key issues:
<BR>
Regime development.
<BR>
Revised assessment procedures.
<BR>
Updated child protection procedures.
<BR>
In addition, and in preparation for establishing a purpose-built single centre at Rathgael, the board is also required to develop and further provide:
<BR>
Staff training&#151;to ensure that staff have all the necessary skills required to meet the objectives set by the board.
<BR>
Community projects&#151;which seek to provide further support for vulnerable young people in the community.
<BR>
The board has responsibility for on-going monitoring of each of the key action points and formal meetings are held with the Northern Ireland Office at regular intervals to review progress. The Northern Ireland Office retains responsibility for routine monitoring of related expenditure.

<i>PBNI Performance Indicators</i>
<BR>
Performance targets for the Probation Board for Northern Ireland are agreed on an annual basis by the Department on behalf of the Secretary of State in accordance with the Probation Board Management Statement. The management statement has been in place since April 1999 and the following table outlines the performance indicators which have been agreed to date. Achievement of the targets is monitored by the Department at regular overview meetings and at the end of year Ministerial Accountability Review. The targets are set out in the Probation Board annual business plan and achievement levels are recorded in the relevant annual report. Information prior to 2000&#150;01 is not readily accessible and was in a different format. The targets outlined are those agreed as a result of the development of the management statement.

 The main Government agency for research into the causes of and treatment for disease is the Medical Research Council (MRC). The Department also funds research to support policy and the delivery of effective practice in the national health service.
<P>

<a name="20620w28.html_para0">The MRC spent &#163;1.4 million in 2001&#150;02 on research relevant to motor neurone disease (MND) and on basic work on the function of motor neurones. The MRC also support a large portfolio of basic research into the biology of the brain and the nervous system in both normal and diseased states. Such studies may well have relevance to the treatment of MND and related conditions in the future.
<P>

<a name="20620w28.html_para1">The Department has also supported work in this area. Recent research projects include the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of riluzole for the treatment of motor neurone disease that completed in August 2000.

 The Government have pledged in the NHS cancer plan that funding for specialist palliative care services, including hospices, will increase by &#163;50 million per annum by 2004. This investment is included in the overall national health service investment for implementing the cancer plan. How the &#163;50 million is deployed locally will depend on the needs of the area. Cancer networks have drawn up service delivery plans on palliative care to review the level of services offered in their area and these will ensure that each network has a range of palliative care services available. We are currently reviewing the outturn position for 2001&#150;02 and the progress in that year.

 Violence against any member of staff working in the national health service is unacceptable. Significant action has been taken at both national and local levels to tackle the problem of violence as part of the cross-Government NHS zero tolerance zone campaign. This includes the issuing of new sentencing guidelines to magistrates courts, the publication of new guidelines on the withholding of treatment from violent and abusive patients and, for the first time ever, the allocation of central funding to support the large number of local initiatives being introduced to protect staff.

 The Government recognise that education and the science base are important factors in maintaining the attractiveness of the UK as a location for the research and development (R&D) pharmaceutical industry. Last year the Government published, jointly with the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, a set of competitiveness and performance indicators which will be used to monitor trends in UK competitiveness as a location for the R&D pharmaceutical industry. Baseline data collected show that in the late 1990s the number of graduates in medical sciences from UK universities was similar to that in Germany and rather greater than in other European countries. Data also show that the UK Government spends more on R&D in health fields than does any other European Government. Copies of the Pharmaceutical Industry Competitiveness Task Force (PICTF)&#151;Competitiveness and Performance Indicators 2001 report are available in the Library.

 The possibility of a doctor being fined for refusing to disclose information on ethical grounds was a concern voiced during the affirmative procedure debates on the regulations. While the imposition of such a fine cannot be ruled out, circumstances where it would be the appropriate response are difficult to imagine.

 The information is not available in the format requested. Information on waiting times for screening test results is only available for those areas where the result letters are sent to women directly by the health authorities (around two thirds of health authorities do this).
<P>

<a name="20620w29.html_para0">In 2000&#150;01, 60 per cent. of women in these health authorities received their written cervical screening test result within six weeks (54 per cent. in London). 91 per cent. (84 per cent. in London) received their written result within 10 weeks. It is likely that even where a letter is sent, general practitioners will notify their patients by more rapid means as soon as they have a result.

 There is no current data available on the number of people known to be infected with toxoplasma gondii, as toxoplasmosis, the infection associated with toxoplasma gondii, is not a disease reportable under the Public Health (Infectious Diseases) Regulations 1988. However, the Public Health Laboratory Service (PHLS) has received the following confirmed laboratory reports for Toxoplasma gondii in England and Wales for the years 1999 to 2001:

<a name="20620w30.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The Food Standards Agency is taking the lead in pressing for changes to European Union labelling rules to require country of origin labelling on a wider range of foods, particularly meat products. It is also pressing for changes that would prevent misleading labelling by restricting the use of terms like "produce of . . ." to those foods where the main ingredients come from, and production processes occur in, the named place or country. Other EU member states are supporting the UK's initiative on this issue. In addition, the recent 



<P>
<P><I>20 Jun 2002 : Column 559W</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w30.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 June 2002]:</i> The Government are in favour of positive labelling giving consumers the information they need to make properly informed choices. The Food Standards Agency is taking the lead in pressing for changes to European labelling rules to require more informative country-of-origin labelling on a wider range of foods, particularly those containing meat.
<P>

<a name="20620w30.html_para0">However, it would not be possible to extend labelling requirements to cover imported processed food containing beef from animals over 30 months old in the way that has been suggested. The rules covering the restrictions on sale of over thirty-month imported beef are UK national measures and such additional labelling requirements may not be in conformity with EU law. In addition, it is usually not possible to tell the age of the animal from which processed beef products have been derived.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20620w31.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 23 May 2002]:</i> We do not routinely seek the views of parent organisations. However, over the course of one year the Department consults a sample of 3,000 mothers. The purpose of this is to elicit their knowledge, attitudes and understanding of the immunisation programme. The information gained from this exercise is then used to inform our communications with health professionals and parents.
<P>

<a name="20620w31.html_para0">A lay representative is shortly to be appointed to the joint committee on vaccine and immunisation who advise the Government on immunisation policy.

 <i>[holding answer 24 May 2002]:</i> The nurse grade structure for NHS Direct consists of F and G grade nurses offering medical advice.
<P>

<a name="20620w31.html_para1">NHS Direct defines what it requires of its nurses through a set of competency statements. Nurses can be recruited from any speciality provided they meet these competencies, although they must have between three and five year's post-qualification experience.

<sup>(22)</sup> The director of the NHS CFS was appointed in September 1998 to establish the new organisation, and the strategy document "Countering Fraud in the NHS" was published in December 1998.<P>

<P>

<sup>(23)</sup> The NHS CFS Operational Service was established and became fully operational in January 2000.<P>

<P>

<sup>(24)</sup> Because of the low value of most NHS patient fraud (the current prescription charge is &#163;6.20) it is not appropriate or cost effective to routinely prosecute those who perpetrate it. A process to recover the value of the charges evaded has been in place since the NHS CFS was established. In addition, Penalty Charges are applied. These are for a sum which is five times the charge which should have been paid plus the original charge up to a maximum of &#163;100.<P>

<P>

<sup>(25)</sup> Only one prosecution (out of 115) has been unsuccessful in the last three years, however, the NHS CFS do not merely seek to apply criminal sanctions. Rather it seeks to combine criminal, civil and disciplinary sanctions to best effect.<P>
