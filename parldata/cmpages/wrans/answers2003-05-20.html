<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w01.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Lord Chancellor's Department is working with the Home Office and the Crown Prosecution Service to deliver a substantial programme of reform to improve confidence in the criminal justice system, including the courts.

23. <a name="30520w01.html_wqn9"><B> Hugh Bayley: </B>

<P>
24. <a name="30520w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what plans he has to review probate procedures.  [114240]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w01.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 A wide-ranging review of probate services and procedures took place in 2001 as part of the Modernising the Civil Courts programme (now the Courts and Tribunals Modernisation Programme). This was supported by PA Consulting Group, an independent management systems and technology consulting firm, who reported their findings and recommendations to the Court Service in August 2001. Consultation took place between 25 November 2002 and 28 February 2003, and we are now analysing the responses. There are no plans for any further reviews.

<a name="30520w01.html_sbhd11"><H3 align=center>Witness Attendance</H3>


<P>
25. <a name="30520w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Allen: </B> 
 To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what steps the Lord Chancellor is taking to reduce delays in cases caused by lawyers unreasonably requiring witnesses repeatedly to attend court.  [114241]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w01.html_spnew11"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Witnesses are usually only required to attend court on the day the case is listed for trial. However, occasionally the needs of justice may require adjournment of a case to allow for re-examination of a witness. An adjournment would only be made on the request of the parties and it would be entirely a matter for the judge hearing the case to decide whether or not such a request was reasonable. Judges are mindful of the distress and inconvenience that can be caused by delay and wherever possible will work to avoid unnecessary adjournments.

The FSA is currently consulting on the necessary rule changes to implement Directive 2002/12/EC and Directive 2002/13/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council as regards solvency margin requirements for life and non-life insurers respectively. Later this year, the FSA will be consulting on their intention to implement new 'enhanced' capital requirements and to take forward the framework set out in CP136 (Individual Capital Adequacy Standards) to implement a Basel type 'three pillar' approach for insurers.

<a name="30520w03.html_para2">The Commission presented the 2004 Preliminary Draft Budget, which will be the first budget for an EU of 25 member states, and also the first to use activity-based budgeting, matching resources to outputs. I tabled a UK paper on the reform of external actions expenditure, emphasising the need for greater poverty focus, effectiveness and efficiency.
<P>

<a name="30520w03.html_para3">ECOFIN had an orientation discussion on the 2003&#150;05 Broad Economic Policy Guidelines (BEPGs).

<a name="30520w03.html_para4">ECOFIN adopted an Opinion on the Austrian Stability programme, and also agreed a mandate for the Economic Policy Committee to produce a progress report on the overall impact of ageing populations on public finances for the November ECOFIN.
<P>

<a name="30520w03.html_para5">ECOFIN adopted the Occupational Pensions Directive, as amended by the European Parliament, with Belgium making an oral statement and Estonia a written statement. The adoption of this directive, an important cornerstone of the Financial Services Action Plan and the first step towards a single market for occupational retirement provision, represents an excellent outcome for the UK.
<P>

<a name="30520w03.html_para6">I presented the UK's proposal for an International Finance Facility (IFF). This is an important initiative designed to raise substantial extra resources and make a stable, long-term commitment to development countries to help them meet the UN Millennium Development Goals. After discussion, the Presidency concluded that the IFF was an interesting initiative, which should be discussed again by ECOFIN in the near future, following an examination of the financial aspects in the Economic and Financial Committee.
<P>

<a name="30520w03.html_para7">ECOFIN discussed a Presidency paper on the right to deduct value added taxation (VAT). Following discussion, it was agreed that further consideration of this issue by ECOFIN should await the Commission Communication on a VAT Strategy and their proposal on the place of supply of services.
<P>

<a name="30520w03.html_para8">Over lunch, Ministers discussed the tax package and the Italian request for a Council decision under Article 88(2) on the repayment of Italian milk quota fines. Ministers agreed: that the tax package is not to be reopened and that all reservations on it should be lifted; that Ambassadors in COREPER should examine the Italian proposal on milk quotas with a view to allowing the Council to take a decision on this in June; and that the Council should take the final decisions on both the tax package and on the Italian request regarding milk quotas in June.

 Industry are in the process of submitting outline proposals for undertaking the work to store intermediate level waste from our decommissioned nuclear powered submarines. An exercise will then determine the most effective procurement strategy, and detailed evaluation, which will inform a further period of public consultation, will lead to the selection of potential bidders who will be invited to undertake more detailed negotiations. This is expected to take around three years to complete and after further public consultation will result in the selection of a preferred bidder, solution and site. Currently we have no plans to move our decommissioned nuclear powered submarines from their present locations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proportion of food sourced and served by the catering sections of each Department was <i>(a)</i> produced in Britain, <i>(b)</i> organic and <i>(c)</i> Fair Trade in each year since 1997; and what steps she is taking to increase those levels.

 This information is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="30520w07.html_para6">I understand that caterers contracted to Defra source a high percentage of produce from the UK in summer but in the winter most comes from abroad. Our largest contractor sources 60 per cent. to 70 per cent. of the food from the UK during the summer: For meat all year round the figures are: chick bacon&#151;mostly Dutch; pork&#151;88 per cent. UK; lamb&#151;20 per cent. UK; and beef&#151;70 per cent. UK.
<P>

<a name="30520w07.html_para7">Our published guidance for public sector bodies covers issues such as removing obstacles to tendering by local and UK producers and the purchase of organic and fair trade produce. It can be seen on our web site at: http://www.defra.qov.uk/farm/sustain/procurement/index.htm. We are also taking a number of other steps to integrate sustainable development into the public procurement of food and catering services. These include seminars to raise awareness, bilateral meeting at Ministerial and senior management level (including with representatives of local government) and the production of case studies. The guidance takes account of the Government's policy of achieving value for money and their commitment under the EC rules to ensure that public procurement is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will instruct the Environment Agency to take immediate steps to tackle the odour problems affecting Castle Point residents; what steps the Environment Agency is proposing to take; and how long she estimates it will take for her measures to be effective.  [113791]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 16 May 2003]:</i> The odour problems affecting Castle Point residents have been recognised and discussed with the Environment Agency which is already taking steps to tackle the problem. Further action is being discussed with the site operator.
<P>

<a name="30520w08.html_para0">Work to prevent the escape of landfill gas from one of the two sources of odour has already begun. A final layer of waste is being put over the affected area, which will be followed by a clay 'cap' to seal it. The Environment Agency has required that this odour source be abated within three months and it is expected that this will be completed within this time.

<a name="30520w08.html_para1">The second and most predominant source of odour has been treated with oxidising agents which eliminate the odour rapidly, but there has been difficulty in maintaining this and further efforts are being made to stabilise the source in an aerobic state. A number of additional measures are also being implemented.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research has been conducted by the Environment Agency into the sources of the odour problems that have affected Castle Point residents in recent months.  [113792]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 16 May 2003]:</i> Odours have been traced by the Environment Agency to two sources within the site. The first source is from an area of the landfill site from which landfill gas was escaping. The second is from a lagoon within the site. Research into the health effects of the landfill gas is currently being undertaken by the Environment Agency at the site. The research will look into any health impacts that may have been caused by the odours.

<P>
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w08.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 16 May 2003]:</i> The Environment Agency has acted to ensure that more robust procedures are put in place to monitor for odours more actively at Pitsea landfill site. This will enable such odours to be detected and dealt with promptly. Planned activities which may potentially generate odours will be risk assessed to ensure that all measures are in place beforehand to minimise odour release.
<P>

<a name="30520w08.html_para2">As the site nears the end of its operational life, more of it will be progressively capped and sealed, enabling landfill gas to be efficiently extracted and burned and for rainfall to be shed from the surface of the site without becoming contaminated.
<P>

<a name="30520w08.html_para3">I am happy to discuss with the hon. Member or the Agency any further issues of concern if the local community remain anxious about the operation of the Pitsea landfill site.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her policy is on the forthcoming publication, by the European Commission, of a new Directive on the transport of live animals; what efforts are being made to persuade European colleagues <i>(a)</i> to replace the transport of live animals by a trade in meat and <i>(b)</i> to adopt a maximum limit of eight hours per journey to slaughter; and if she will make a statement.  [114000]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government would prefer a trade in meat rather than the long distance transport of animals for slaughter. We have consistently pressed for improvements in the current controls on the welfare of animals during transport and more recently for the introduction of a general eight hour maximum for journeys within the EU. We look forward to publication of the European Commission's long overdue proposals to update and improve the current directive.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what regulations she plans to implement on the treatment of ash residue from <i>(a)</i> incineration of animal by-products and <i>(b)</i> human incineration at crematoria.  [114388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w08.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 19 May 2003]:</i> The EU Animal By-Products Regulation requires that ash from low-capacity incinerators which burn whole ruminant carcases or other specified risk material(SRM) must be disposed of as waste to a licensed landfill site.
<P>

<a name="30520w08.html_para4">Ash from incinerators which burn non-SRM material may be spread to land if it is derived from agricultural waste. However, the requirement for a waste management licence effectively prevents the application of non-agricultural waste e.g. from pet crematoria to land.
<P>

<a name="30520w08.html_para5">Ash from the cremation of human corpses does not fall within the scope of waste legislation.

 The Carbon Trust was created in April 2001, taking over management of the non-domestic part of the Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme (EEBPp) in July 2002 (which it re-launched as Action Energy) and administration of the Enhanced Capital Allowances programme in August 2002. In this time the Carbon Trust has also formulated its programmes, market research and financial and procurement procedures.

 Further sea trials of the exclusion grid designed to reduce common dolphin by-catch in the offshore fishery-for bass which-takes place in-the Channel were recently completed.
<P>

<a name="30520w09.html_para1">The scientists responsible at the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) at St. Andrews University will require some weeks to produce their full report. However, I should like to give here a preliminary indication of the outcome, in recognition of the widespread interest in this matter.
<P>

<a name="30520w09.html_para2">The trial was undertaken by SMRU on our behalf at a cost of &#163;100,000 and involved the chartering of a pair trawler for twelve days in March for the deployment of the grid in normal commercial fishing conditions in the SW bass fishery. It formed the second stage of testing 



<P>
<P><I>20 May 2003 : Column 687W</I><P>
this device at sea, the first stage having taken place in 2002. The primary aim was to develop the system further towards the point where it will fish reliably with minimal loss of fish and that any dolphins encountered will be able to escape safely through the grid and out of the net.
<P>

<a name="30520w09.html_para3">The twelve day charter was completed successfully, using a new camera system enabling day and night real time monitoring of the grid system in use. It was clear that the grid performance improved this year with virtually no loss of fish related to the grid system. This, encouragingly, indicates that the grid system ought to be acceptable not only to UK fishermen but to others countries involved in the pair trawl fishery.
<P>

<a name="30520w09.html_para4">Contrary to expectation, and in contrast to other boats fishing nearby, no dolphins were seen to approach the grid during the period of the charter. The reasons for this are presently unclear and are being considered by SMRU but it is possible that some aspect of the grid system is acting in some way as a deterrent to dolphins. However, the overall result was a zero mortality rate during the twelve day charter.
<P>

<a name="30520w09.html_para5">As no dolphins had been encountered during the charter period, the skippers of the vessels&#151;and we are extremely grateful for the co-operation of the skippers and the Scottish Pelagic Fishermen's Association with all aspects of the trial&#151;volunteered to continue using the grid accompanied for most of the time by a SMRU observer. During this extension of the trial two dead dolphins were recovered from the tunnel of the trawl after one particular haul. It is probable that one of these had become trapped in the small mesh cover net over the escape panel. This is disappointing, but the researchers are confident that recurrence of this problem can be prevented by adjustments to the escape panel, as part of the ongoing development of the system.The very significantly reduced mortality rate overall in this trial (2 animals, both caught in the same haul, over seven weeks, and these from causes that are expected to be eliminated) is encouraging when compared with previous years. Two animals died in 82 hauls over a seven week period beginning in March, a significant reduction in what is normally observed to be the case. In observations elsewhere in the fishery without the grid employed, 28 dolphin casualties were recorded in 49 hauls. All this is grounds for optimism that a viable means of minimising dolphin by-catch in this fishery can be attained very soon. A fuller analysis of the data from the trial is now being undertaken which once complete, will form a fuller report of the trial to be published as soon as possible. This will be made available on the Defra website and a copy will be placed in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="30520w09.html_para6">I am determined on the basis of these results to move forward next year from trialling these measures to actually deploying them in the fishery. I will be discussing how this can be achieved with the industry and whether other adaptations to the fishing gear, such as changes to fishing methods, could also contribute to by-catch reduction. At the same time, however, the general level of by-catch in the south west cannot continue unchecked each year and I do not rule out other options such as closure if effective by-catch reductions cannot be achieved in the short term.




<P>

 By the end of March the Countryside Agency had spent &#163;13.5 million on implementing part 1 of the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, mostly on mapping open countryside and registered common land. The figure includes payments to the contractors, Black and Veatch; consultation and dissemination of information on the mapping process; and the Agency's staff and running costs.

<a name="30520w10.html_para8">Assuming that the scheme is viable we anticipate that it will take a minimum of three months from the date when the decision is taken on whether to proceed to get the scheme operational.

 <i>[holding answer 7 May 2003]:</i> New EU legislation, the Animal By-Products Regulation, applied in Member States from 1 May. Amongst other things the Regulation banned the routine on-farm burial and burning of animal carcases.

<P>

<a name="30520w10.html_para15">A letter was sent out on 17 April to livestock farmers. This invites them to register an interest in participating in a subscription based scheme for the collection and disposal of fallen stock. This has the full backing of the Farming Unions.
<P>

<a name="30520w10.html_para18">A ban on hunting with hounds could have implications for the disposal and humane slaughter of fallen stock in some areas but by no means all. Those farmers who currently use the fallen stock service provided by hunts could be faced with additional costs if they use knackers yards or other off-farm disposal routes. However, there is a demand for this service. Most hunts already make a charge and there is no reason why such a service should not continue as a business opportunity should hunts be banned.

 The Government are committed to the effective management of flood and coastal erosion risk and have increased funding in all three spending reviews. Following autumn 2000 floods, i.e. between 2000&#150;01 and 2005&#150;06, total expenditure is expected to increase from &#163;328.5 million to &#163;564.2 million an increase of &#163;236 million in cash terms.

The additional money being made available to Food from Britain to support the quality regional food sector is intended to help address this need. These objectives chime well with those of British Food Fortnight, but direct Government aid to the latter could conflict with our obligations under Article 28 of the EC Treaty not to distort competition by favouring products because of their national origin.

A total programme budget of &#163;25 million has been set aside for the years 2003&#150;04, 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06. &#163;6 million of this will be spent this financial year, of which &#163;4 million has been allocated to HM Customs to fund enforcement activity and publicity at the borders, and &#163;1.5 million has been allocated to the Food Standards Agency to lead work on a step change to improve co-ordination and co-operation across legal import routes. The remainder has been allocated to Defra to implement other aspects of the action plan, including further publicity. No decisions have yet been made on allocations for 2004&#150;05 and 2005&#150;06.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps <i>(a)</i> her Department, <i>(b)</i> executive agencies and <i>(c)</i> non-departmental public bodies sponsored by her Department are taking to improve the competitiveness of small and medium sized food and drink (i) producers and (ii) exporters.  [113765]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
<i> [holding answer 19 May 2003]:</i> Various measures which have the potential to help small and medium sized food and drink producers increase competitiveness are set out in the Government's Sustainable Farming and Food Strategy, published in December 2002. These include the new Food Chain Centre, which is looking at ways to improve the efficiency of the food chain, and English Farming and Food Partnerships, which will support and promote co-operation and collaboration between farmers, and between farmers and the food chain. In addition, Food from Britain is undertaking a national support programme, which includes measures to increase competitiveness, for small and medium sized quality regional food producers.
<P>

<a name="30520w12.html_para1">On the export side, the Department continues to provide grant aid to Food from Britain to carry out promotion of exports of food and drink: at least 50 per cent. of producers assisted must be SMEs.
<P>

<a name="30520w12.html_para2">Through its Eat the View initiative the Countryside Agency is working in partnership with a wide range of organisations to encourage consumers to make the link between the food they eat and the countryside, thus encouraging demand for locally sourced food and drink typically supplied by small and medium producers. Most projects within the initiative will assist SMEs to improve their competitiveness.
<P>

<a name="30520w12.html_para3">In addition the Home Grown Cereals Authority is working closely with all parts of the grain chain to improve the competitiveness of the UK arable industry both at home and overseas. The Meat and Livestock Commission works almost wholly with SMEs to improve efficiency by providing information and advice on breeding techniques, reducing production costs and improving marketing strategies, and by facilitating links between producers and the major supermarkets.
<P>

<a name="30520w12.html_para4">Small and medium sized food and drink producers are also eligible to apply for grants under various schemes for projects that may contribute to improving their competitiveness.

<P>
<a name="30520w12.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra officials have discussed this issue several times with representatives of the British Food Trust, and have concluded that in its current form the project is not eligible for any of the current funding schemes. However, we are happy to continue the constructive dialogue we have had with the British Food Trust to explore other ways in which we can help.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what plans there are to protect the bittern in England; and if she will make a statement.  [113969]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The bittern is one of the 391 species for which action plans have been prepared as part of the UK Biodiversity Action Plan (UK BAP). The plan sets objectives and targets for the conservation and enhancement of the species. Reports in 2002 on progress with the plan show that targets to increase the range and numbers of the bittern are being achieved. A survey by the RSPB in 2002 recorded a total of 31 booming males in England, almost double the number recorded in 1994. Plans to secure the long term future of the bittern by providing suitable reedbed habitat are also showing progress. In England, 800 hectares of new reedbed have been created since 1995 and the active management of existing reedbeds is improving.
<P>

<a name="30520w12.html_para5">In October 2002 the Government published 'Working with the Grain of Nature&#151;A Biodiversity Strategy for England'. The strategy takes an holistic approach to the conservation of biodiversity within England and is a key means by which the UK BAP will be taken forward in England. It sets out a series of actions for the key sectors which impact on biodiversity, including water and wetlands.

technical experts and the Competent Authority for existing substances that discussed and finalised the risk assessment for MTBE.
<P>

<a name="30520w12.html_para6">The risk assessment concluded that there were concerns for the aquatic environment and groundwater (potability in respect of taste and odour) as a consequence of exposure arising from the release of MTBE to surface water from leaking storage tanks and spillage from over filling of the storage tanks.
<P>

<a name="30520w12.html_para7">The Environment Agency is looking to improve our groundwater quality by the monitoring of oxygenates including MTBE where this is merited by risk of contamination.
<P>

<a name="30520w12.html_para8">The occupational risk identified is controlled to the extent needed by legislation currently in force at Community level.
<P>

<a name="30520w12.html_para9">The Environment Agency's review on the presence and behaviour of MTBE in England and Wales was published in November 2000 and a copy was deposited in the Library of the House at the time. The Environment Agency intends to produce a short follow-up report on MTBE incidence but it will take a little time to compile. A copy will be made available to the Library of the House as soon as possible. I will write to let my hon. Friend know when that is.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w12.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The impact of the CAP reform proposals on commoning will be complex and depend in large part on the detail of their implementation. This is particularly true of the proposal to decouple agricultural support from production. Our objective will be to create a workable system which allows existing commoning systems to continue.

 The Otter is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the EU Habitats Directive.
<P>

<a name="30520w13.html_para0">The Government strongly supports the UK Biodiversity Action Plan target to maintain and expand existing otter populations and restore breeding otters to all catchments and coastal areas where they have been recorded since 1960.




<P>
<P><I>20 May 2003 : Column 700W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30520w13.html_para1">The Environment Agency and the Wildlife Trusts are the lead partners in pursuing these biodiversity targets. The Environment Agency published the Fourth Otter Survey of England (2000&#150;2002) on Monday 12 May. This confirmed that the increase in otter distribution observed since the first survey in 1977&#150;1979 is continuing. Every one of the 12 regions and catchments into which England was divided for the survey, shows an increase in the positive sites. Otters were present on 73 per cent. of the Local Environment Agency Plan areas surveyed. An increase in otter distribution cannot be directly translated into an increase in otter numbers but such a significant increase in the distribution represents a significant increase in the number of otters on England's rivers and waterways. Full details of the survey can be found at http://www.environment-agency.qov.uk./

I have amended my answer in the following table. In addition, the Countryside Agency also spent &#163;2.7 million over the period 2001&#150;02 to 2002&#150;03 promoting the Rural Transport Partnership and developing guidance. &#163;1.3 million was spent over the same period on promoting and developing guidance for the Parish Transport Grant. The rest of the answer remains correct.

 Defra funds an on-going programme of research into methods of combating outbreaks of rabies in wildlife. The Animal Health Act (1981) permits the use, in a rabies outbreak, of poisonous baits to control foxes and other wild vectors of rabies. T3327 is a carbamate compound akin to a number of approved agricultural pesticides. It was developed with a view to finding a more biodegradable, humane and effective poison for use, if absolutely necessary, in a rabies emergency. In September 2002 poison baits were laid for three days during a strictly controlled five-week trial in a 14km <sup>2</sup>  area in the MoD's Dundrennan Ranges in Scotland. Further field trials of T3327 are not planned. Exact numbers of animals killed during the trial are not known, as some will have died underground but six foxes and 11 badgers were found dead. There was no evidence that other species, wild or domestic, had been poisoned.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the cost of introducing a zero waste strategy; and what definition the Government uses of incineration in terms of the disposal of waste.  [110212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 No assessment has been made of the cost of introducing a zero waste strategy. Government's priorities for sustainable waste management in England and Wales are set out in "Waste Strategy 2000". The Government's forthcoming response to the Strategy Unit Report "Waste Not, Want Not", will also identify further steps to be taken to-help deliver our priorities and targets.
<P>

<a name="30520w13.html_para6">Although Waste Strategy 2000 is not a zero waste strategy (either zero waste to landfill, or a totally closed resource cycle), it does demand substantial waste minimisation, and significantly increased levels of re-use and recycling.
<P>

<a name="30520w13.html_para7">The definition of incineration as it relates to the disposal of waste, in the glossary of terms in "Waste Strategy 2000" is as follows:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Incineration&#151;is the controlled burning of waste, either to reduce its volume, or its toxicity. Energy recovery from incineration can be made by utilising the calorific value of paper, plastic, etc to produce heat or power."

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what incentives local authorities can introduce to encourage the reduction of waste from domestic households.  [113186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Strategy Unit report "Waste not, Want not" suggested that household incentive schemes that local authorities might wish to introduce could include council tax discounts for households that home compost; provide rewards or prizes for those that recycle; provide a mixture of free services with charges for special services; or introduce variable charging schemes with a reduction in council tax.

<a name="30520w13.html_para8">Local authorities already have powers to introduce the first two of these suggestions.

<P>
<a name="30520w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The latest estimate is that around &#163;19 million will be distributed to eligible applicants under the LTCS Sustainable Waste Management Legacy Fund. To administer the fund, ENTRUST is receiving a fee of 2 per cent. of whatever funds are distributed (i.e. if the Fund distributes &#163;20 million to eligible applicants, the administration fee received will be &#163;400,000). This is the same level of payment that ENTRUST receives to regulate the LTCS itself on behalf of HM Customs and Excise and represents good value for money.

 The tables needed to answer this question have been prepared by the Environment Agency and placed in the House Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Water Bill is not, and has never been, intended to transpose the Water Framework Directive.
<P>

<a name="30520w14.html_para1">Our intention is to give effect to the Directive through secondary legislation under the European Communities Act 1972. Many of the necessary powers needed to comply with the Directive already exist. We have consulted widely on our proposals to transpose the Directive and will continue to do so. Much of the existing legislative framework for water resources in England will implement the Directive, for example, controls over the abstraction of fresh surface water and ground water and impoundment of fresh surface water, including a register or registers of water abstractions.
<P>

<a name="30520w14.html_para2">Some provisions in the Water Bill will help implement some of the requirements of the Water Framework Directive, in particular articles 11(3)<i>(c)</i> and <i>(e)</i>. These elements were planned after the Government published "Taking Water Responsibly" in March 1999, which suggested updating the framework for abstraction licensing to improve water resource management.
<P>

<a name="30520w14.html_para3">The Water Bill will help implement Article 11(3)<i>(c)</i> by placing water undertakers under an enforceable duty to conserve water in carrying out their functions. The licensing requirements of the Water Resources Act 1991 largely implement Article 11(3)<i>(e)</i> already, and proposals in the Bill are consistent with that.

<a name="30520w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 All traps must be submitted for approval and are tested for humaneness and efficacy by experts. Traps are approved by Orders made under The Pests Act 1954 which specify the traps that may be used, the manner of use and the species against which the trap may be used. The conditions of any approval are designed to ensure humane and selective operation. The use of unapproved spring traps has been prohibited in England and Wales since 1958. Spring traps specified by the Department as being adapted solely for the destruction of rats, mice or other small ground vermin, and for moles are exempted under the Small Ground Vermin Trap Order 1958.
<P>

<a name="30520w14.html_para4">Particulars of the approvals given for traps to catch and kill wild mammals are detailed in the Spring Traps Approval Order. This is submitted to Parliament on a periodic basis, depending on the submission of traps, and lists all traps, manufacturers and terms of approved use at that time. Some further minor changes to this list (such as changes to a manufacturers trading details) were published by way of a MAFF press release dated February 1997. The performance of design is commercially confidential. Non disclosure of such commercial information is in accordance with Reg. 4(2)<i>(e)</i> of the Environmental Information Regulations.
<P>

<a name="30520w14.html_para5">The Agreement on International Humane Trapping Standards: http://www3.oup.co.uk/envlaw/hdb/Volume 12/Issue 03/supp data/harrop supp.pdf has been agreed by the European Commission, Canada and the Russian Federation but has yet to be enacted by the member states of the EU. As presently proposed, this agreement only applies to fur-bearing species. The only species currently listed in this agreement that occur in Britain are the otter, badger, pine marten and stoat, although additional species will be added in future. These species receive protection under The Badger Act 1992 and The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and, with the exception of the stoat, may not be trapped without a licence. The current testing procedures proposed within Annex 1 of the Agreement have been carried out on new traps since 1992. However, as this agreement has not yet been enacted, approval of such traps has been made on the basis that they are, at least, as humane as traps already approved for the same target species. This is only an interim arrangement. The Department will shortly attend an expert working group meeting on the implementation of humane trapping standards in the EU. This will offer an opportunity to discuss how the agreement might best be enacted and implemented in the UK. The enactment of the Agreement would require traps approved using earlier criteria to be retested and reapproved as appropriate.

<a name="30520w14.html_para6">Trap testing is conducted on a regular and ongoing basis as new trap designs are submitted for approvals by commercial companies. I am not prepared to discuss details in view of security considerations.

1. For England the main source of information is the five yearly English House Condition Survey (EHCS). The latest figures on fuel poverty from this survey relate to 2001. Figures for fuel poverty in 1998 have been produced from the Energy Follow Up Survey to the 1996 English House Condition Survey.<P>

2. Fuel poverty is defined as when a household needs to spend more than 10 per cent. of its incoming (including housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest) on fuel in order to maintain a satisfactory heating regime.<P>

<a name="30520w16.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The regulation of gas transportation, including connections to the mains gas network, is the responsibility of the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (OFGEM). The Government have not set targets for the numbers of households connected to the network. However, since 2001, in the context of its Fuel Poverty Strategy, the Department of Trade and Industry has been in discussion with Transco and other interested parties about connections to the mains gas network, with a view to promoting industry-led projects to extend the network. I expect the first industry-led projects to begin this year.

 Around 4.5 million households in Great Britain do not use mains gas, although some could have access to a gas connection.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will visit the Suffolk Coastal constituency to inspect the measures taken to protect Sizewell A and B power stations from attack and afterwards address local constituents on this issue.  [112880]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w16.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 There are no plans for a Ministerial visit to the Sizewell nuclear power station in the foreseeable future. However I can assure those who are employed at, or live near the facilities that the UK's civil nuclear sites apply stringent security measures regulated by the Office for Civil Nuclear Security (OCNS), the security regulator. The security regulator works closely with the Health and Safety Executive, the safety regulator, which provides advice on the safety implications of events, including external hazards such as plane crashes, at nuclear installations. Security at nuclear sites is kept under regular review in the light of the prevailing threat and has been significantly enhanced since the terrorist attacks in the USA on 11 September 2001. It is not Government policy to disclose details of these measures, which could potentially be of use to terrorists.
<P>

<a name="30520w16.html_para6">However, with specific regard to the Sizewell B nuclear power station, I can say that subsequent to the incursions by Greenpeace in October 2002 and January 2003, the Office for Civil Nuclear Security have reviewed security and some security enhancements were identified which are being implemented as soon as is practicable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w16.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Emergency preparedness is a well established feature of the safety regime for civil nuclear sites. Co-ordinated plans are prepared by first tier local authorities, in the case of Sizewell Power Station by the Suffolk County Council, under the Radiation (Emergency Preparedness and Public Information) Regulations 2001. These plans include arrangements for alerting local people. Since 11 September 2001, the arrangements to respond to terrorist incidents at nuclear sites have been enhanced. An exercise programme, which has been running over many years, helps ensure emergency response plans are kept up to date and ready at any time.

 There has been little progress, as yet, on Security Sector Reform. Our embassy in Luanda has had preliminary contacts with the Angolan Defence Ministry to see whether UK expertise here, especially in peacekeeping, would be welcome. We are awaiting an Angolan response.
<P>

<a name="30520w18.html_para1">The Government of Angola (GoA) has taken some steps towards improving economic and political governance and transparency. These include an audit of the Central Bank; placing customs administration under Crown Agents; undertaking an Oil Diagnostic Study by KPMG; and reviewing the public procurement system. As part of its Technical Support Strategy for Angola, the World bank is currently conducting a Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review. The UK plans to help in this. The review will make recommendations later this year. The GoA needs to strengthen public finance management and macro economic policy to reduce economic instability. The UK is encouraging Angola to take further measures to improve oil sector transparency by participating in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), launched by my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister in 2002. We have also provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Planning, following a request to help prepare its Interim-Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP).

 We do not retain statistics of the number of successful visitor visa applicants who have previously been refused asylum in the UK. To obtain this information, visa sections worldwide would need to compare the names of successful visa applicants with those whose claims for asylum had previously been refused: this would incur disproportionate cost.

<a name="30520w18.html_para2">Entry Clearance Officers (ECOs) overseas consider each application on its own merits against the relevant requirements of the Immigration Rules. An application from someone who had previously been refused asylum would not, therefore, necessarily fall for refusal, although an ECO would take this into account when making a decision.

 A new EU treaty would need to be ratified according to the individual political and constitutional traditions of each of the Member States. None of our EU partners have yet made formal announcements on whether they would hold a referendum on a Constitutional Treaty. Of the 25 countries affected, we are aware that the constitutional traditions of some, such as Denmark and Ireland, make referenda in those countries likely, whereas the constitutional traditions of others, such as Germany, make referendums unlikely.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has regular discussions on the future development of NATO with the US and other Allies. NATO Foreign Ministers last met in Brussels on 3 April.
<P>

<a name="30520w20.html_para3">At the Prague Summit in November 2002, NATO Heads of State and Government took decisions to transform the Alliance to meet the new threats and security challenges of the 21st Century. To do this NATO must develop new military capabilities to meet these new threats, streamline NATO command structures and have access to flexible Allied forces, able to move quickly to wherever they are needed. As part of this process, NATO has embarked on a radical reshaping of its command structure. The UK strongly supports this process.
<P>

<a name="30520w20.html_para4">Prague also emphasises the commitment of NATO to operate out of the Euro-Atlantic area, in order to meet threats to the Allies' common security interests. In this context, NATO decided on 16 April 2003 to offer increased support to the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan. NATO has no permanent troop presence in Africa and no plans to establish one.

 The effect of the home information pack on such properties will be to make more information on possible pollution available to prospective buyers at the start of the transaction process. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's consultation paper on the contents of the home information pack identifies three ways in which the pack could identify potential pollution problems affecting the property. The first is the standard searches made of local authorities. These would identify, for example, any entry relating to the property in the register maintained under section 78R(1) of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. The second is an environmental search, which could identify, for example, close proximity to the operation of certain prescribed industrial processes. The third is the home condition report, which would identify any potential pollution problem observed by the home inspector in the course of his inspection of the property. The detailed contents of the home information pack will be considered further in the light of responses to the consultation.

 A regulatory impact assessment was not appropriate in respect of proposals to withdraw PPG21, given that no new regulations are proposed. Since we are not proposing to abolish the county council's strategic role in relation to tourism, we did not cover this issue in the regulatory impact assessment for the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill. The new Regional Spatial Strategies will have an increasing sub-regional dimension in which the strategic planning authorities will have an important role through their representation on the Regional Planning Bodies, as statutory consultees, and in some cases, as agents of the Regional Planning Bodies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make it his policy to reduce the UK's accepted levels of radiation emissions from mobile telephone masts.  [112541]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w21.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) has the statutory responsibility for advising the Government on exposure guidelines for electromagnetic fields (EMFs). This includes radiofrequency (RF) radiation from mobile phone masts. The advice from NRPB is, however, concerned with exposures to EMFs from all sources.
<P>

<a name="30520w21.html_para0">NRPB has recently issued a consultation document in which it proposes new advice on exposure guidelines for EMFs. The consultation document is posted on its website at: http://www.nrpb.org/publications/consultation documents/emf consultation document.htm
<P>

<a name="30520w21.html_para1">In its new advice, the NRPB recommends adopting for the United Kingdom the guidelines recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICNIRP) in 1998. It thus covers the range of emissions from mobile phone masts, for which the limits are based on preventing any effects caused by whole or partial body heating.
<P>

<a name="30520w21.html_para2">In the last few years the Radiocommunications Agency (RA) and the NRPB have carried out and published measurements of people's exposures to RF near to base station sites. The data show that exposure to signals from masts at locations accessible to the general public is very much lower than guideline levels advised by the ICNIRP.
<P>

<a name="30520w21.html_para3">This finding is consistent with the conclusions in a report prepared by an independent expert group on mobile phones under the chairmanship of Sir William Stewart, FRS, FRSE. The expert group published its report on Mobile Phones and Health in May 2000 and it is available on the group's web site at: www.ieqmp.orq.uk. The conclusion of IEGMP on exposures to signals from masts was that:
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2003]:</i> The public health implications of mobile phone base stations were assessed by the independent expert group on mobile phones (IEGMP), chaired by Sir William Stewart.

international guidelines. The information is available on the NRBP website at www.nrpb.org<i>&#151;</i>see publications NRPB R-321 and on the RA website at www. radio.gov.uk&#151;see mobile phone base stations.
<P>

<a name="30520w21.html_para5">The IEGMP proposed that gaps in knowledge were sufficient to justify a precautionary approach to the development of this technology and recommendations were made for further research. The LINK Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research Programme (MTHR) has now been established under an independent Programme Management Committee (PMC). Research studies already underway are mainly concerned with the use of mobile phone handsets but the PMC has recently commissioned an epidemiological study addressing public concerns about possible health risks from exposure to emissions from base stations. It is one of the first such studies in the world. Further information can be found on the MTHR website at www.mthr.orq.uk.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30520w21.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 A number of studies on the purported biological effects of mobile phone usage have been published in the scientific press. These include work on cataract formation published in the Chinese Medical Journal in December 2002 and molecular studies in various journals. The quality of the reports is variable and they can only be properly assessed in totality by a review group with the appropriate wide ranging expertise.
<P>

<a name="30520w21.html_para6">The Stewart Report in May 2000 provided a comprehensive review of the possible health effects of radiofrequency exposure from the use of mobile phones and found that "exposures to radiofrequency (RF) radiation below guidelines does not cause adverse health effects to the general population." Similar conclusions were reached by a Royal Society of Canada Expert Panel (1999), the Health Council of the Netherlands (2000), an Expert Group set up by the French Government (2001) and the British Medical Association (2001).
<P>

<a name="30520w21.html_para7">The Stewart Report recommended that there should be a further comprehensive review of the science related to possible health effects of exposure to RF radiation within three years. This review is being carried out by the National Radiological Protection Board's (NRPB) independent Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR). The review is nearing completion and will be finalised by the end of 2003.

<P>
<a name="30520w24.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2003]:</i> No milk tokens have been distributed yet. The volume of applications received by the Inland Revenue for new tax credits has delayed the distribution of milk tokens to families who qualify through child tax credit. We are working with the Inland Revenue to ensure that milk tokens are distributed as soon as possible. Those people eligible for this scheme will receive a cheque as a cash payment for any backdated entitlement.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Jobcentre Plus has been established to deliver a radical change in the way that benefits and employment services are provided to people of working age. By 2006, we plan to introduce a network of around 1,000 fully integrated Jobcentre Plus offices.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Through the development of these new modern offices, Jobcentre Plus will provide an integrated, work-focused service to all people of working age. The introduction of work-focused interviews is extending the opportunity to more people to take advantage of the help, guidance and support we can provide to assist them to move into sustainable employment. We are also introducing new services for employers, which will help them fill vacancies more quickly with well-prepared and motivated employees.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In all our plans we have focused on the needs of our customers. The new offices will offer customers a seamless service, where they will be able to make enquiries about their benefit entitlement, and the training and employment opportunities available to them, under one roof. Alternatively, customers can choose to telephone one of our contact centres to make inquiries without having to come into one of our offices. The introduction of new technology is also enabling people to find the information they need about jobs and training via the internet and our touch screen Jobpoints. These facilities are making it easier for our customers to access the services we provide.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Our staff are also benefiting from the introduction of Jobcentre Plus. The refurbished offices are providing a professional, modern environment in which to work and work-focused interviews afford the opportunity for greater job satisfaction through delivering advice and guidance on work, training and benefits to a broader range of people.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As at 2 May 2003, we had opened 258 new Jobcentre Plus offices and have set out our plans to introduce the Jobcentre Plus model across Great Britain by 2006. I would like to assure you however that we will not open an office unless we are confident that it provides an environment in which the new Jobcentre Plus services will work and one that is safe for our customers and staff. Throughout this transitional period our social security offices and Jobcentres are working together to ensure that customers still benefit from a high standard of service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Jobcentre Plus will be introduced in Portsmouth during mid 2004. Partners and stakeholders were consulted about these plans in June and September 2002. Their comments are currently being taken into consideration in reaching final decisions, which have yet to be announced.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Currently, services are being offered at Portsmouth Central Jobcentre, Portsmouth North Jobcentre, Guildhall Walk Social Security Office. These offices are not large enough to accommodate the integrated services of Jobcentre Plus, nor do they have the capacity for expansion. Suitable premises are being identified, which will have the capability to deliver the enhanced services to Portsmouth customers. I can give you my assurance that customers will continue to receive a high level of service during implementation and beyond. I can also confirm that we are not planning any reduction in the numbers of Jobcentre Plus staff in Portsmouth.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The introduction of Jobcentre Plus is being well received by our customers. In national surveys we have found that eight out of 10 customers are satisfied with all elements of the new service.

<i>[holding answer 19 May 2003]:</i> The Government's information campaign, to support the move to Direct Payment, provides customers with factual information on the banking options available to them, including information on the Post Office card account. We will write directly to all customers affected by the change to provide them with the information they need to decide which option is best for them. The information is presented in a way that enables customers to decide which option is best for their individual circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30520w26.html_para2">There is no question of people not being able to get their money. Those customers who feel that the account options available do not meet their particular needs should contact the Customer Conversion Centre on the freephone number provided to discuss their needs and circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30520w26.html_para3">Where customers genuinely are unable to manage an account they will be advised that, in the short term, they can retain their order book. However, order books are being phased out and will no longer be available after 2005.
<P>

<a name="30520w26.html_para4">We are currently developing an alternative payment method to pay the small number of customers who are unable to open or manage an account.

 The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis has told me that procedures for the use of powers under section 59 of the Police Reform Act 2002, to seize vehicles being used in an anti-social manner, are currently the subject of internal consultation. Instructions to borough commanders are expected to be published in the form of a Police Notice by the summer.

 <i>[holding answer 15 May 2003]:</i> The matter of targets, either monthly or annual, on the number of arrests made or summonses issued, is not one on which the home office issues advice to Chief Constables. Such targets as are set are a matter for the Chief Constables in the light of the prevailing local circumstances within their force areas.

<sup>(22)</sup> For persons convicted also includes the offence of 'Being carried knowing vehicle to have been taken or driven away'.<P>

<P>

<sup>(23)</sup> The conviction figures relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with.<P>

<P>

<sup>(24)</sup> Crimes were recorded on a calendar year basis up to 1997 and on a financial year basis thereafter.<P>

<P>

<sup>(25)</sup> The number of crimes recorded in that financial year using the expanded offence coverage and revised counting rules which came into effect on 1 April 1998.<P>

<P>

<sup>(26)</sup> Due to some police forces adopting the principles of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) earlier than its national introduction across England and Wales on 1 April 2002, figures for 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02 may be inflated.<P>

<P>

<sup>(27)</sup> Staffordshire Police were only able to supply a sample of data for magistrates courts proceedings covering one full week in each quarter of 2000. Estimates based on this sample are included in the figures, as they are considered sufficiently robust at this level of analysis.<P>
