<p><a name="40512w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Allan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what assessment she has made of the impact of the decision by the Crown Prosecution Service not to proceed with the case against Mr. Robert Duqueria for the alleged removal of objects from the scheduled site of Cunetio, Wiltshire on her strategy to protect archaeological sites in England; and if she will make a statement.  [172212]</p>








<p><a name="40512w01.html_spnew1"><b> Estelle Morris: </b> 
 It is for the Crown Prosecution Service to determine whether any prosecutions are in the public interest and it judges each case on its individual merit. Through the Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Areas Act 1979 and the Treasure Act 1996, there is a framework of legislation in place to protect important heritage sites. I would expect those who operate in this area would do so in accordance with the law.

In addition, the recently expanded Portable Antiquities Scheme, through its network of Finds Liaison Officers, is designed to encourage closer working relations between archaeologists and metal detector users.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what estimate she has made of the number of bingo halls which occupy more than 10,000 sq ft and would be eligible to convert to a casino under the terms of the draft Gambling Bill.  [172046]</p>







<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 May 2004 : Column 324W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>





<p><a name="40512w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 There is no central record of the total area which each licensed bingo club covers; but we have seen estimates that over half of the current total of about 700 clubs have a total area in excess of 10,000 sq ft. We indicated last August that, under the proposed Gambling Bill, the minimum size of the area set aside for table games in a new casino should be 5,000 sq ft. We are now looking again at that requirement in the light of the views of the Joint Scrutiny Committee on the Bill and the points made by interested bodies and individuals in commenting on the Bill proposals. It is, however, relevant to note that a 5,000 sq ft minimum table gaming area would entail a total casino size considerably in excess of that, particularly if the casino also wanted to provide bingo for its customers.

 In DCMS one employee was granted approved early retirement terms in the financial year 2003&#150;04 at a cost of &#163;9,361. In addition, two employees were awarded compensation payments at a cost of &#163;61,887.

<p><a name="40512w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 Ice Hockey is classified as an Olympic sport and as such funding decisions are a matter for UK Sport.

<p>
<a name="40512w01.html_para2">
The top priority for UK Sport is the provision of support for those senior athletes/teams operating at a UK/GB level who have realistic chances of winning medals at the highest level (Olympic Games/World Championships within the current Olympic cycle).
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w01.html_para3">
UK Sport have informed us that in recent years, GB Ice Hockey has been unable to provide evidence that it can meet this criteria and has not, therefore, received support from UK Sport.

There is scope for developing talent via the home country Sports Councils but sports would be assessed against a number of criteria. Ice Hockey has not been deemed a priority at present by Sport England.

However, UK Sport does acknowledge that if GB athletes are to win medals in the Winter Olympics, in the longer term, some form of support needs to be provided. In recognition of this, UK Sport is in discussion with a number of partners, including an Olympic Winter Sports Group. Ice Hockey UK is represented on the Winter Olympic Sports Group.

<p><a name="40512w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The North West Development Agency (NWDA) is working closely with the Lancashire and Blackpool Tourist Board, the nominated Destination Management Organisation (DMO) for Lancashire. The new DMOs are, in effect, smaller versions of tourist boards.

 The Afghan Transitional Authority holds ultimate responsibility for the security of the Afghan national elections due in September 2004. NATO&#039;s planned expansion of the International Security Assistance Force will, however, contribute to creating the security conditions within which free and fair elections may take place.

[172024]</p>








<p><a name="40512w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 No. Cluster bombs are legal weapons that are not indiscriminate. They provide a unique capability for use against wide area or dispersed targets. Were we not to use them, it would be necessary to use a large number of either unitary bombs or artillery shells to cover an equivalent area, involving a greater tonnage of explosive. Increasing the number of munitions launched also increases the risk that one or more launches may go astray. In many instances, using munitions other than cluster bombs may pose a far greater risk to civilians at the time of attack. Any applications for the export of cluster bombs would be considered on a case by case basis against criteria announced by the Foreign Secretary on 28&nbsp;July 1997 and the EU Code of Conduct on Arms Sales.

<p><a name="40512w02.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Caplin: </b> 
 The land was acquired on 30&nbsp;March 1940 by &#039;The Commissioners of His Majesty&#039;s Works and Public Buildings&#039;. Subsequent Government inter-departmental transfers culminated in the disaggregation of the Common User Estate by the Government&#039;s Property Holdings Unit in April 1996. This resulted in the land transferring (again on an inter-department basis) to the Ministry of Defence although technically the legal title remains with the successor to &#039;The Commissioners of His Majesty&#039;s Works and Public Buildings&#039;. The proceeds of the disposal would fall to the MOD.

<p><a name="40512w03.html_wqn4"><b> Ms Dari Taylor: </b> 
 To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what assessment he has made of how the change in the level of council funding for housing has affected the residents of Stockton South since 1997.  [171469]</p>








<p><a name="40512w03.html_spnew4"><b> Keith Hill: </b> 
 Since 1997 allocations of capital funding to local authorities for housing purposes have risen consistently by an average of 15&nbsp;per cent. per annum. This includes the Major Repairs Allowance we introduced in 2001&#150;02 specifically for the improvement of local authority housing stock alongside the Decent Homes Standard that set minimum standards to be met by 2010. Stockton&#039;s allocations in the period 1997 to 2003&#150;04 have risen by some 320&nbsp;per cent. In addition, Arms Length Management Organisation initial resources of &#163;44.5&nbsp;million are available with a further &#163;8&nbsp;million to follow to facilitate Decent Homes improvements over the whole of the Stockton borough.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w03.html_para1">
Increased resources have also been generated through the Neighbourhood Renewal Fund and Single Housing Investment Partnerships (SHIP) to target non-decent and non-sustainable housing stock. In the last three years alone &#163;12.7&nbsp;million has been invested in the local authority housing stock with future investment up to 2010 expected to be &#163;11.45&nbsp;million.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w03.html_para2">
In the private sector and as a result of successful SHIP/English Partnerships bids &#163;6.9&nbsp;million has been secured in addition to &#163;532,000 for renovation grants, home repair assistance, empty homes and damp proofing.

 This is a matter for local assessment. National planning advice in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 &quot;Housing&quot; (PPG3) and Circular 6/98, &#039;Planning for Affordable Housing&#039; makes it clear that each local authority should assess the local need for affordable housing within its area. Policy UR9 of Regional Planning Guidance for the North West gives further advice on the need for affordable housing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w03.html_para3">
PPG3 advises that where there is a demonstrable lack of such housing, local planning authorities should include a policy in their development plan seeking affordable housing in suitable housing developments. It advises them to identify sites on which affordable housing will be expected and to indicate the amount of such housing to be sought as a proportion of the overall dwelling provision on a site. Decisions about the amount and types of affordable housing to be provided in individual proposals should reflect local housing need and be a matter for agreement between the local authority and the developer.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w03.html_para4">
The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has published for consultation proposed changes to the current policies for affordable housing set out in PPG3 and Circular 6/98. The proposed changes re-emphasise the above policy, but also include allowing local authorities to seek affordable housing on smaller sites where this is justified. The changes are designed to help deliver more affordable housing where it is needed, and deliver a better match between a community&#039;s housing needs and supply.

<p><a name="40512w04.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) has been developed in response to recommendations made by the Policy Commission on the Future of Farming and Food. The ELS is intended to tackle countrywide environmental problems such as diffuse pollution, loss of biodiversity and landscape character and damage to the historic environment. A pilot scheme has been running in four areas of England since February 2003, and an evaluation of these pilots has confirmed that the scheme is popular with farmers and has the capacity to deliver widespread environmental benefits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w04.html_para2">
Following the success of the pilot, Defra intend to launch Entry Level Stewardship (ELS) as part of a new agri-environment scheme called Environmental Stewardship in early 2005. Proposals for the new scheme have recently been submitted to the European Commission for approval. It is proposed that the ELS should be open to all farmers in England and that they 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 May 2004 : Column 335W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
will be paid at a flat rate of 30 per ha in return for carrying out a certain amount of environmental management options across their whole farm.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w04.html_para3">
A parallel Organic Entry Level Stewardship (OELS) is proposed, which will have the same design as the standard Entry Level Scheme but would be tailored towards organic farming systems. It is proposed that organic farmers will receive a higher payment rate of 60&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;per ha, in recognition of the contribution that organic farming systems make towards increases in soil health and fertility, benefits for biodiversity and wider landscape benefits.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w04.html_para4">
Entry Level Stewardship and its Organic equivalent will be complemented by Higher Level Stewardship, which is designed to build on the basic Entry Level in order to deliver significant environmental benefits in targeted high priority situations and areas. Further information on Environmental Stewardship will be available once Commission approval has been received. Final details of the new Scheme will be made available immediately prior to the launch in 2005. Application packs will not be available until the launch of the Scheme.

</p>



<p>(2) what advice she has received on the future incidence of flash flooding.  [170131]</p>








<p><a name="40512w04.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 I understand the recent flash floods in Worcester resulting from exceptionally intense rainfall equivalent to around a month&#039;s rain in just a few hours. This caused extensive highway flooding and some local property flooding. This flooding was from surface runoff and storm sewer/highway drain overflow and not from the main river system.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w04.html_para5">
Although the Environment Agency (EA) issued a Floodwatch and were operating a local storm balancing system on the Barbourne Brook in Worcester, the wider emergency response to the flash flooding fell for the most part to Severn Trent water and the local highway authority who are primarily responsible for responding to such incidents, the EA will be assisting its partners in the follow up investigation and the review of the storm event.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w04.html_para6">
The Government recognise the need for Integrated Drainage Plans for urban areas prone to such flooding, and this will be considered as part of Defra&#039;s new strategy on flood and coastal erosion risk management. However any assessment on flash flooding would need to take into account detailed knowledge of the drainage systems in the area, the local topography, together with modelling of the effects of different types of event. This information is not generally available and carries a high degree of uncertainty. The EA are in the meantime working with Research Councils and the Flood Risk Management Research Consortium to develop improved modelling and prediction of flooding in urban areas.

human settlements issues in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and national Sustainable development strategies; integrated water resource management plans to be in place by 2005; innovative financial mechanisms, such as the UK&#039;s proposed International Finance Facility; promotion of small-scale local initiatives and partnerships; and improved coordination between UN agencies and with international financial institutions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w06.html_para6">
CSD 12 raised the profile of these issues and stimulated inclusive and interactive debate by all parties. The Chairman&#039;s Summary of the ministerial segment recognises that we are not yet on track to meet the targets, identifies the main obstacles faced and picks up on most of the UK&#039;s priorities. It also sets out a number of challenges to be addressed in the second year of the cycle on water, sanitation and human settlements, culminating at CSD 13 in May 2005, which has the task of agreeing the policy responses needed to get back on track with these international targets.

<p><a name="40512w07.html_spnew6"><b> Caroline Flint </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> HG1 and HG1A are body armour protection levels defined in a Home Office body armour standard. Both HG1 and HG1A afford the same ballistic protection. They both provide protection against standard ammunition fired from short-barrelled handguns. In the case of HG1A a back face deformation of the armour to a maximum depth of 44mm is allowed and in the case of HG1 this maximum deformation is reduced to 25mm. The back face deformation is a measure of the trauma that would be inflicted.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he was informed <i>(a)</i>&nbsp;that Highmark Manufacturing Co Ltd. had changed the specification of its KCW223 model of body armour and <i>(b)</i>&nbsp;that the body armour used by some police forces did not meet the protective HG1/KR2 classification of the original tender.  [172357]</p>








<p><a name="40512w07.html_spnew7"><b> Caroline Flint </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> Highmark did not change the specification of the armour. In mid 2001 it incorporated a material that had been cured in a different way. They did not inform the Home Office of this change. It has now been established that the fully cured material affords a lower ballistic trauma protection level than the partially cured material. The Home Office was informed of the problem in February 2004 and established its extent in March 2004. All affected forces have been told what action they should take, and the manufacturers are providing upgrade packs to return the armour to the specified protection level.

[172358]</p>








<p><a name="40512w07.html_spnew8"><b> Caroline Flint </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> The police forces in England and Wales using KCW223 model of body armour supplied by Highmark Manufacturing Co Ltd. are Avon and Somerset constabulary, Cheshire constabulary, Cumbria constabulary, Devon and Cornwall constabulary, Dorset police, Durham constabulary, Greater Manchester police, Hampshire Constabulary, Lancashire constabulary, Leicestershire constabulary, North Wales police, South Wales police, West Midlands police and West Yorkshire police. 30,000 models of this armour have been supplied and the manufacturers are supplying upgrade packs to return the armour to its original HG1/KR2 level (where required).

<p><a name="40512w07.html_spnew9"><b> Caroline Flint </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> In mid 2001, Highmark Manufacturing Co Ltd. started using a material that makes up part of the construction of the armour model KCW223 which was supplied to police forces. This material had been cured in a different way to material previously used. This resulted in the armour in having a reduced ballistic (trauma) protection level in 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 May 2004 : Column 347W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
terms of the HG1/A specification and a slightly reduced stab protection level that placed it just below the KR2 level in some carriers and just above KR2 in others.

[172360]</p>








<p><a name="40512w07.html_spnew10"><b> Caroline Flint </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> The Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) of the Home Office produces a body armour standard. HG1A is a body armour protection level, which was introduced in early 2002. PSDB approved test houses test body armour to the current PSDB standards and the results are published in the Manual of Ballistic and Stab Resistant Body Armour maintained by PSDB. When body armour is tested at a PSDB test house the manufacturer is asked to provide a Declaration of Construction that details the material used in the manufacture of the armour along with a detailed description of the construction of the armour. Any model of armour tested is assigned an identification number that uniquely identifies it and the test sample is retained by PSDB. This procedure is designed to ensure that all armour bearing a particular model number that has met a PSDB defined protection level, which is subsequently supplied by the manufacturer, is of the same construction as the original test armour.

<p><a name="40512w09.html_spnew8"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Following the publication in May 2000 of the Stewart Report on Mobile Phones and Health, we took expert advice from the National Radiological Protection Board&#039;s independent Advisory Group on Non-Ionising Radiation (AGNIR) on the health and safety aspects of TETRA technology.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w09.html_para1">
The AGNIR experts confirmed that it was unlikely that the specific features of TETRA technology could pose a risk to health and suggested a number of areas where further research would be useful. These suggestions have been taken forward as follows:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Dstl) is assessing the effects of TETRA exposure on various types of cells. Dstl concluded that TETRA has no effect on calcium exchanges in cells. Further work on epileptiform activity and cognitive performance is underway.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Imperial College is carrying out a national health monitoring study of police users of Airwave.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The University of Birmingham and the University of Manchester are looking into patterns of work of Airwave users.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Microwave Consultants Limited are measuring Specific Absorption Rates (SARs) from TETRA equipment.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The National Radiological Protection Board have completed further work on modelling SARs.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Radiocommunications Agency (now Ofcom) checks emission levels from TETRA base stations.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w09.html_para2">
In addition, we are funding TETRA research as an adjunct to the Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) programme. Studies funded under this arrangement are selected and managed by the MTHR Programme Management Committee. As part of this adjunct programme, the Burden Neurological Institute in Bristol is examining possible effects of microwave radiation on the electrical activity of the brain.

As part of that review, I asked the Financial Services Authority and the Financial Ombudsman Service to review the circumstances in which the Financial Services Authority takes regulatory action instead of individual cases being determined by the Ombudsman and to consider introducing a process by which firms may appeal against Ombudsman decisions. The Financial Services Authority and the Financial Ombudsman Service plan to publish a joint consultation paper by early June.

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has asked me to reply to your questions concerning the Jobcentre Plus Provider Liaison Group. This is something which falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The inaugural meeting of the Jobcentre Plus Provider Liaison Group was held on the 6th September 2002.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Jobcentre Plus Provider Liaison Group&#039;s membership includes representatives from several of our largest work-based private sector providers, together with providers in the voluntary and community sector, smaller private providers and Further Education establishments. In addition, membership includes the Association of Learning Providers (ALP), a trade body for the work-based sector who represent approximately 30% of Jobcentre Plus providers. The Group is supported by a small secretariat from Jobcentre Plus. Full membership of the Group is set out in Annex 1.</p>
</ul>
<p>





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 May 2004 : Column 363W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The purpose of the Group is to provide a forum in which providers are consulted on changes to policy and operational processes. In practice this gives them the opportunity to comment upon policies from their perspective as organisations that deliver these policies. The Group enables Jobcentre Plus to obtain the views of providers from a wide background and should help ensure that our business can be delivered more effectively and efficiently.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">There is no formal selection process. In order to ensure the arrangements are manageable, the Group has a membership of approximately 20. However, we do try to be inclusive as possible, and membership is potentially open to each of our providers. In setting up the group we attempted to ensure that a range of providers was represented. In addition to our inviting a number of the largest providers, each Jobcentre Plus Region was requested to nominate a local provider, to ensure that the Group offers views from smaller providers. Some Jobcentre Plus regions also hold their own meetings of local provider groups where there are region-specific issues to discuss.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Group meets on a regular basis, usually bi-monthly, and meetings are held in Sheffield.</p>

 At the Madrid Donors&#039; Conference in October last year, the Government announced a total UK pledge of &#163;544&nbsp;million towards the reconstruction effort in Iraq from April 2003 to March 2006.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 May 2004 : Column 365W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

<p>
<a name="40512w13.html_para3">
DFID has now committed over &#163;278&nbsp;million for humanitarian and reconstruction assistance to Iraq. This includes &#163;70&nbsp;million for the International Reconstruction Fund Facility for Iraq, managed by the World Bank and the United Nations. We are also supporting Iraqi government policies and reforms that benefit the poor, and, in the south of Iraq, helping to restore infrastructure and develop the region&#039;s links with central government in Baghdad.

[171420]</p>








<p><a name="40512w13.html_spnew3"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 The Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) reports that average electricity production is in the region of 4,000 megawatts (MW), approximately the same level as before the 2003 conflict. A number of generating units are undergoing maintenance and should be back in service by the summer peak demand period. The CPA&#039;s power generation target for 1&nbsp;June is 6,000 MW.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w13.html_para4">
It is estimated that immediately after the 2003 conflict coverage of water services was 60&nbsp;per cent. of the urban and 30&nbsp;per cent. of the rural populations. Considerable work has taken place since then to improve the quantity, quality and reliability of water services to the population. There are no complete statistics on current coverage, but informal estimates suggest that, in the south, supply has increased by 10 to 15&nbsp;per cent. since May 2003. By the summer of 2004, water quality and volume in Basra is expected to have exceeded pre-conflict levels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w13.html_para5">
A total of US$32 billion was pledged for the reconstruction of Iraq at the Madrid Donors&#039; Conference in October 2003. Very significant sums are now being committed to specific projects for the reconstruction of power and water infrastructure and in a wide range of other sectors including health, education, transport, irrigation, telecommunications, housing and oil production.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w13.html_para6">
The maintenance of essential services is to a very large extent undertaken by Iraqis rather than by foreign contractors. However, it is clear that some reconstruction projects may be delayed as a result of restrictions imposed by the present security situation on the ability of contractors and development agencies to operate normally throughout the country.

 In January 2003 HM Treasury and the Department for International Development (DFID) launched a proposal for an International Finance Facility (IFF). The IFF is designed to &quot;frontload&quot; aid to help meet the internationally agreed Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The IFF has the following advantages; it provides the additional 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 May 2004 : Column 366W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
resources necessary to help achieve the MDGs, making funds available for education, health, economic development, debt relief and building trade capacity; it is the only feasible proposal at the moment which would deliver these resources; it locks in the political commitment of donors to Monterrey pledges and it provides the predictability and critical mass of aid needed for simultaneous and sustainable investment in developing systems across sectors, tackling the causes rather than the symptoms of poverty.

 Dependence on rain-fed agriculture contributes to the high levels of vulnerability and chronic food insecurity found in Ethiopia. Less than 5&nbsp;per cent. of the country&#039;s arable land is currently irrigated. The Government of Ethiopia recognises the need for appropriate forms of irrigation that will benefit smallholders as well as commercial farmers, in its poverty reduction strategy. Irrigation is an important component of the Government&#039;s Water Sector Development Programme. In addition, the Government are undertaking a large programme to promote rainwater harvesting at the smallholder farm level.

 The harvest that has just been completed will be the principal determinant of the need for humanitarian action in Malawi over the next year. Preliminary reports suggest a lower harvest than last year&#039;s bumper crop, but with major shortfalls restricted to a few areas. In order to assess more accurately the 2004 harvest and its impact on food security and household vulnerability, the Malawi Government, donors and NGOs are undertaking a series of surveys.

 The Government of Angola has not yet set a date for the next elections, indicating that 14 steps, including conclusion of the new constitution and re-establishment of the Electoral Commission, are necessary before an election can take place.

<a name="40512w14.html_para1">
DFID is supporting the electoral process. One of the key aims of our Country Engagement Plan for Angola is &quot;a political system which allows all people to influence state policy and practice&quot;. Hence DFID is working closely with the international community and Angolan civil society in developing a strategy to support the forthcoming elections. Specifically, DFID is funding a large-scale programme to help civil society, the media and political parties to prepare for the elections. Through this project DFID envisage providing assistance on technical processes such as election monitoring, although details have yet to be agreed.

Once the date for the elections is set, DFID would anticipate working with other members of the international community to do more.

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what efforts have been made by his Department in the last two years to work with civil society in Angola on transparency issues; and what results have been achieved.  [172082]</p>








<p><a name="40512w14.html_spnew4"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 DFID completed its first Country Engagement Plan for Angola in September 2003. One of the three outcomes highlighted in the Plan is &quot;government systems for raising and using resources which are transparent and give priority to poverty reduction&quot;. Since then DFID has made significant progress on developing and implementing a comprehensive strategy on transparency in Angola. This includes encouraging Angola to participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), contributing to the World Bank&#039;s Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review (PEMFAR), and assisting in development of a G8 Anti- corruption and Transparency (ACT) programme. We have also followed negotiations between the Government of Angola and the IMF on a new staff monitored programme for which greater fiscal transparency is a key pre-condition.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w14.html_para3">
With respect to civil society in Angola, DFID is one of several donors contributing to the Transparency Coalition set up by the international NGO World Learning in September 2003. The coalition consists of six different national NGOs who are working together to raise awareness and disseminate information on 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 May 2004 : Column 369W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
transparency issues throughout the country. The coalition recently put forward a proposal, which DFID has agreed to fund, to analyse and make accessible in layman&#039;s terms the complex and very technical Angolan National Budget (OGE). This should allow Angolan civil society to more actively participate in debates on the annual budget process. DFID has also participated in a new forum established by the National Democratic Institute (NDI) in Luanda to look at transparency issues. Through this forum, donors help keep civil society informed on developments in transparency at the political level.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w14.html_para4">
Much of this transparency work is still in its early stages and it will take some time before we see the full effects. It is worth noting however, that one positive result is already evident. Within the Angolan media there is a more open and animated discussion on transparency issues and civil society has been actively participating in this.

 The BTC pipeline has the potential to deliver substantial economic benefits to Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey and it will strengthen regional co-operation, developing new economic and political links between the three host countries. All the international parties involved in the BTC pipeline (including BTC Co., EBRD and IFC) are keen to make sure that the revenues generated by the project do not exacerbate regional tensions. Mitigation measures are already in place, including an IMF approved oil fund in Azerbaijan, a commitment by BP to publish what it pays to the host Governments and support by the World Bank and IMF on budgeting and public expenditure management. Furthermore, Azerbaijan is in the first wave of countries to begin to implement the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). The EITI aims to increase the transparency of payments by extractives companies to Governments, as well as the transparency of revenues received by those host countries. Increasing transparency is a key component to reducing poverty, corruption, and the potential for conflict. The UK Government are helping Azerbaijan implement EITI, whereby BTC revenues are channelled through the State Oil Fund to ensure that the people of Azerbaijan benefit. We are also in discussions with the Government of Georgia on the possibility of their involvement in the EITI.

The Government also remain unwilling to discuss with the international community what stocks they hold, and what volume of grains they expect to import to meet any deficit in domestic supply. Without an appeal WFP will face difficulty in planning, securing donor funding for and implementing emergency operations beyond the coming months when existing agreements and stocks will run out. DFID will continue to monitor the situation closely in collaboration with WFP and other partners.

<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has asked me to respond to your recently tabled Parliamentary Questions about funding allocated to develop school travel plans in Northern Ireland and what assessment has been made of the six safe routes to schools pilots that are being developed.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">You will be aware that, as proposed by the Regional Transportation Strategy 2002&#150;12, Roads Service has been working to address the issue of the &#039;school run&#039;, given its impact on morning traffic congestion, through the &quot;Safer Routes to Schools&quot; initiative with the aim of encouraging more children to walk, cycle and use public transport for their journey to school.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Department of Education, the Department of the Environment Road Safety Team and other agencies are working alongside Roads Service in this project. The following six schools are currently participating in the initiative:</p>
</ul>
<p>





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 May 2004 : Column 395W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">St. Joseph&#039;s College, Belfast;</p>

</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">This is the first time a schools initiative to promote sustainable modes of transport in response to a traffic congestion issue has been undertaken in Northern Ireland. Measures at the six schools are mainly exploratory and at different stages of development. The overall aim is to assist each school in developing a travel plan, which sets out a package of measures for reducing the number of car trips made to school. Where appropriate, Roads Service will subsequently introduce improvements to the roadway such as installing pedestrian facilities and traffic calming measures to facilitate children who may want to walk, cycle and use public transport. Additionally, other measures such as cycle shelters and lockers are provided by the Department of Education inside the schools premises.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">To get the school travel initiative started, Roads Service and its&nbsp;partners have spent nearly &#163;85,000 over the last three years (2001/02-&#163; nil, 2002/03-&#163;48,391, 2003/04-&#163;36,253) on assisting development of travel plans for the participating schools. The funding was used to investigate existing infrastructure and facilities at the schools, examine accident data, undertake surveys to establish baseline school travel information and pay for the training of a Travel Plan Co-ordinator who was appointed to champion the initiative in the schools. This work was followed by the preparation of draft travel plans, which were given over to the schools to take ownership of and develop in line with the ethos of the school and its thinking on the sustainable transport concept. No specific funding has been allocated yet for the further development of travel plans as resources are being concentrated for the time being on the pilot group of six schools. However, it is intended, as part of the next stage of the initiative, to develop a practical support package that encourages other schools to engage in the travel plan process.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The improvements to the infrastructure and facilities at each of the pilot schools will be completed this financial year. While we will undertake a preliminary assessment at the end of the school year 2004/05 of how successful these measures have been, initial work including installation of cycle shelters at the schools has had very positive results and generated an increase in cycling among pupils for the school journey. It is anticipated that the planned infrastructure work to the road network adjacent to the schools should have equal effect in facilitating and encouraging more children to use sustainable modes of transport.</p>

The information provided below is therefore broken down into PTEs and shire counties. PTEs are amalgamations of adjacent urban LAs, and as such have been used as an indication of urban areas. Shire counties have been taken to represent rural areas. The TDT database holds a total of 277,363 bus stops in England, of these 65,954 are in the PTEs outside London and 191,760 in the shire counties.

In late 2003, a survey of bus real time information capability in English local authorities, recorded 361 at stop RTI signs in the PTEs outside London, and 2,067 at stop RTI signs in the shire counties. In addition to signs, there are &quot;virtual stops&quot;, which provide bus real time information through short messaging service (SMS).

The Panel has recently produced practical guides to protect bus and coach crews.

The British Transport Police (BTP) also play a vital role in keeping Britain&#039;s railways safe and secure, and pleasant to use. The Force works closely in partnership with those who manage the railway, staff and tenants, and local police forces. BTP covers crime from serious violent and sexual offences to pick-pocketing and car crime. It also takes a lead in combating the anti-social behaviour that can impact so much on those who use and work on the railway. Other examples of the spreading of crime prevention good practice include a toolkit on reducing crime on public transport, and good practice case studies to improve personal security in bus travel. Department for Transport guidance (to be issued this summer) to local transport authorities on giving greater emphasis to accessibility issues within Local Transport Plans will encourage authorities to adopt a partnership approach with CDRPs, local partners in the health, education and welfare to work sectors, and the local community to address crime and the fear of crime issues as one way of improving people&#039;s ability to access jobs and key services.

 Candidates are able to book driving tests with the Driving Standards Agency by phone, by post or online via the internet.

The Agency has a national target for the average annual waiting time for a practical car driving test in England, Scotland and Wales of six weeks. The national average waiting time at the end of April for car tests was 9.2 weeks. Against the national average waiting time target for a motorcycling test of four weeks, the waiting time was 4.6 weeks.

The Agency is deploying as many driving examiners as possible from Scotland to the London and South East area to tackle the problem of high waiting times there. In the context of its Business Plan for 2004&#150;05, I have set the Agency a target to bring national waiting times for a car driving test down to six weeks by January 2005.

 The majority of capital support is allocated to schools and local education authorities (LEAs) by formula, and they decide how to invest it in line with their asset management plans.

Table A sets out the capital support given by the Government to Sefton LEA since 1997&#150;98, in total and by programme, including devolved formula capital grants to each school. Table B shows the schools in the Bootle constituency that benefited from investment through the New Deal for Schools (NDS) programme, which ran between 1997&#150;98 and 2000&#150;01.

<p><a name="40512w28.html_spnew2"><b> Alan Johnson: </b> 
 No changes have yet been made to the fee structure for Level 2 courses in further education institutions. From September this year we will be trialling, in the North East and South East regions, a new entitlement enabling adults in the labour force without a full level 2 qualification to have access to free tuition for their first full level 2 qualification. Where a learner is taking a publicly available course in further education through this entitlement there will be no tuition fee cost to the learner or their employer. We will continue to expect colleges to collect fees from employers for customised provision. From September the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s funding assumption that for dedicated provision employers pay above the standard fee assumption for individual learners will be abolished. As outlined in our White Paper &#039;21st Century Skills&#151;Realising Our Potential&#039; we will consult the sector later this year on changes to the fees framework from 2005&#150;06.

VAT registrations do not capture all start-up activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Similarly, businesses that de-register will not necessarily have closed. Only 1.8&nbsp;million out of 3.8&nbsp;million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2002.

<p><a name="40512w35.html_wqn0"><b> Mrs. Curtis-Thomas: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what the findings were of the second Work-Life Balance study&#039;s accompanying employee survey report.  [170519]</p>








<p><a name="40512w35.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Sutcliffe: </b> 
 &quot;The Second Work-Life Balance Study (WLB2): Results from the Employees&#039; survey&quot; was published in March by my Department as report number 28 in the Employment Relations Research Series. It is based on a survey carried out by MORI in January and February 2003. Key findings from the study are as follows:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">There was a high level of support for work-life balance amongst employees with 95&nbsp;per cent. agreeing that &#039;people work best when they can balance their work and other aspects of their lives&#039;. However, they were also clear that business considerations should still come first with three-fifths (60&nbsp;per cent.) agreeing that employees should not expect to &#039;change their working pattern if to do so would disrupt the business&#039;.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Reported availability of work-life balance practices appeared to have increased since 2000 for several arrangements, but varied considerably from 67&nbsp;per cent. of employees who said part-time working was available to only 20&nbsp;per cent. who said that working from home on a regular basis was available.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">There has also been an increase in take up of several flexible working practices since 2000. Where employers provided flexible arrangements, take up among employees in the previous year and with their current employer was highest for flexitime (55&nbsp;per cent.) and working from home (54&nbsp;per cent.), but lower where hours of work (and thus pay) would be reduced such as for job-sharing (15&nbsp;per cent.).</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">A sixth of employees (17&nbsp;per cent.) had approached their employer in the last two years to make a request to change how they regularly work for a sustained period of time, and 77&nbsp;per cent. said their request had been agreed. Almost one-third 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>12 May 2004 : Column 447W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>(29&nbsp;per cent.) of mothers had requested a change in how they regularly worked from their employer in the last two years, compared to only 12&nbsp;per cent. of fathers.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">However, there was some employee concern, particularly among men, about the consequences of adopting flexible working practices in terms of their job security and career prospects. Although when asked about various working patterns and leave arrangements, only in the case of working reduced hours (such as part-time working) did more employees consider that adopting this way of working would negatively affect their career (51&nbsp;per cent.) than those who stated that it would not (38&nbsp;per cent.).</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w35.html_para0">
The findings indicate strong support for work-life balance among employees. The increases in provision and take up indicate a shift towards improved work-life balance for employees, and the Department has encouraged this trend through the new employment rights introduced in April 2003. This legislation gives new rights to parents including introducing paternity and adoption leave for the first time, and the right to request flexible working for parents of children under six-years-old and of disabled children under 18-years-old (with a statutory duty on the employer to consider the request), as well as increasing maternity pay and leave.

Notes:<br>

1. A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>

2. Figures are grossed for coverage, except for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

3. Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

4. Trusts in Crosby Area:<br>

REM Aintree Hospitals NHS Trust<br>

REQ Southport and Formby Hospitals NHS Trust<br>

RJV West Lancashire NHS Trust<br>

RVY Southport and Ormskirk NHS Trust.<br>

5. Southport and Ormskirk NHS Trust was created on 1&nbsp;April 1999 from Southport and Formby Hospitals NHS Trust and part of West Lancashire NHS Trust. The figures for West Lancashire NHS Trust for 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 are for the whole trust. It is not possible to identify the proportion of this figure attributable to Southport and Ormskirk NHS Trust.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health which bodies have had the prime responsibility for making available medical staff to support local authorities in their functions related to the Control of Disease Act 1984 during the NHS reorganisations of the last five years; and whether funding has followed these changes.  [156843]</p>








<p><a name="40512w38.html_spnew1"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson: </b> 
 Long-standing central guidance has been that the local consultant in communicable disease control (CCDC) should normally be the local authority proper officer for the purposes of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984. Local authorities also look to the national health service to provide medical officers for the purposes of the port health regulations which are made, or deemed to be made, under powers in the Act.

<p>
<a name="40512w38.html_para0">
In the last five years, CCDCs have been employed by health authorities, primary care trusts (PCTs&#151;which were created in three waves, from April 2000, April 2001 and April 2002) and, from 1&nbsp;April 2003, the Health Protection Agency (HPA).

From 2003&#150;04, funding previously allocated to health authorities has been made available directly to PCTs.

 During the period 1997 to 2003, the former Medicines Control Agency (MCA) achieved compliance through amendment to the website by the internet service providers in six cases involving the sale and supply of all medicines via the internet.

<p><a name="40512w38.html_spnew3"><b> Miss Melanie Johnson </b> 
<i>[holding answer 4&nbsp;May 2004]:</i> A review of recent research entitled, &quot;Health Effects from Radiofrequency Electromagnetic Fields&quot;, published by the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) advisory group on non-ionising radiation concluded:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">&quot;Exposure levels from living near to mobile phone base stations are extremely low, and the overall evidence indicates that they are unlikely to pose a risk to health.&quot;</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w38.html_para3">
Nevertheless, following the precautionary approach advocated by the independent expert group on mobile phones (IEGMP) in May 2000 (www.iegmp.org.uk), the LINK mobile telecommunications and health research (MTHR) programme, was established under an independent programme management committee (PMC), following the publication of the IEGMP report. The PMC has expressed its wish to undertake research into the effects of 3G exposures and discussions are already taking place on how this can be added to the overall programme of research. Further information about this programme as a whole can be found on the MTHR website at www.mthr.org.uk.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>12 May 2004 : Column 461W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w38.html_para4">
The operators of mobile telephone equipment, including 3G technologies, ensure that public exposure does not exceed national and international guidelines. A substantial number of measurements of potential exposures of the public from base station emissions, have been made by a number of bodies, including the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) (www.nrpb.org) and Ofcom, formerly the Radiocommunications Agency (www.ofcom.org.uk). In all cases, exposures have been very much lower than guidelines.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on progress towards the National Framework milestone for primary care group and primary care trust schemes for older people to receive more help from pharmacists in using their medicines.  [170617]</p>








<p><a name="40512w38.html_spnew4"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 While we do not collect data centrally on the number of primary care trusts (PCTs) that have schemes in place so that older people can get more help from pharmacists in using their medicines, there is good evidence to indicate that the number of pharmacists providing support to patients, general practitioners and PCTs to improve medicine taking has increased significantly since 2001, when the older people&#039;s national service framework was published.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w38.html_para5">
PCTs now employ over 1,000 pharmacists, some of whom provide hands on support to GP practices to set up medicines management schemes, which help patients take their medicines more effectively. Through the national medicines management collaborative at least 393 community pharmacies are actively involved in programmes such as prescription intervention schemes, medication reviews, return of unwanted medicines, and minor ailment schemes, thereby encouraging self-care and support to vulnerable groups, particularly older people. This includes enhanced prescription collection and delivery services, medicines management services to care homes and domiciliary visiting. The Department is also funding a trial of structured services based exclusively in community pharmacies for patients with coronary heart disease, led by the pharmaceutical services negotiating committee.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w38.html_para6">
The proposed new community pharmacy contractual framework, which is currently being negotiated, will also be an important driver for change and will help to ensure that pharmacists are more involved in supporting patients in using their medicines. Repeat dispensing, which is expected to be an essential service provided by all pharmacies, will enable patients with stable conditions to obtain a prescription from their GP, which can then be dispensed in several instalments by their pharmacy over an agreed period of time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w38.html_para7">
The first pharmacist supplementary prescribers have qualified and will be writing their first prescriptions imminently. Supplementary prescribing within a clinical management plan agreed with the doctor will be particularly beneficial for patients with chronic diseases. The work of the medicines partnership taskforce, funded by the Department, has helped professionals and older people to become more involved in medication reviews.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what analysis he has made of the potential link between the use of mercury-based whooping cough vaccines and the incidence of autism; and if he will make a statement.  [167767]</p>








<p><a name="40512w41.html_spnew1"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 As with all medicinal products, vaccine safety is continually monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and its independent expert advisory body, the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). The MHRA and CSM have thoroughly reviewed the safety of mercury-containing vaccines, including alleged links with autism, on a number of occasions.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w41.html_para0">
In 2001, CSM conducted a major review of the available evidence and has since then considered new data as it has emerged. In 2003, following a review of further studies, including two United Kingdom studies involving more than 100,000 children, CSM advice was placed on the MHRA website at http://medicines.mhra.gov.uk.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w41.html_para1">
Further studies from Denmark involving almost half a million children have also specifically investigated the suggested link between mercury-containing vaccines and autism. None of these studies found any evidence of a causal association.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w41.html_para2">
On the basis of the available data, the advice of CSM remains that there is no evidence of harm from the form of mercury contained in vaccines, with the exception of possible hypersensitivity reactions, typically skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection. The CSM advises that the benefits of immunisation with such vaccines outweigh any potential risks of vaccination. This view concurs with that of the World Health Organisation.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40512w41.html_para3">
Despite the strong evidence supporting the safety of mercury-containing vaccines, the European medicines regulatory body, the European Agency for the Evaluation of Medicinal Products (EMEA) continues to promote the development of vaccines without, or with the lowest possible levels of, mercury compounds. The CSM supports the EMEA position. In response to this, several UK licensed vaccines have had levels of such compounds reduced or removed completely from the manufacture of the component antigens or from the final vaccine.
