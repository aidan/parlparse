 Latest Government Actuary Department (GAD) analysis shows that the guaranteed rates of return available on annuities by around age 75 become so large relative to other investments that increasingly unrealistic investment returns need to be achieved in order to match or do better than the income that could be achieved through an annuity. Any investment vehicle with an expected yield greater than an annuity after 75 would inevitably be both expensive and carry a significant degree of risk, which people in the later stages of life may be ill-equipped to bear. Of course the optimal age for individuals to annuitise before 75 will depend on a range of individual circumstances.</p>

During these additional investigations, unexpected structural defects in the bridge were identified. As a result, traffic using the sliproad will continue to be restricted to a single lane, with a 40mph speed limit, for safety reasons. Short-term measures, and options for a permanent solution, are under consideration, and the timing of the resulting works will be subject to the scale of the work required and the availability of funding.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the operation of section 57 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000; and what recent representations he has received about the operation of this <i> (a)</i> section and <i> (b)</i> Act. [71014]</p>

<p><a name="st_256"><a name="06070727000374"><a name="60706w0019.htm_spnew0"><a name="06070727003512"><b>Mr. Coaker:</b>
 Section 57 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 (CJCS) inserted new provisions in section 38 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 (PACE). These provisions enable police custody officers to detain a person after charge for the purposes of taking a sample (of urine or other non-intimate sample) to test for the presence of specified Class A drugs, subject to conditions and procedures set out in sections 63B and 63C of PACE .</p>

<p><a name="stpa_348"><a name="60706w0019.htm_para0"><a name="06070727000375">The Drugs Act 2005 (section 7 and paragraphs 1-4 of Schedule 1) subsequently amended section 63B and other sections of PACE to allow for the testing of adults for specified Class A drugs on arrest while retaining the powers for testing on charge in the case of adults and the under eighteens (where applicable). Where a person has tested positive under these powers, section 9 of the Drugs Act introduced a new power for the police to require adults to attend an assessment of their drug use or face a criminal sanction.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_349"><a name="60706w0019.htm_para1"><a name="06070727000376">This legislation forms a core part of the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) and aims to identify problematic drug misusers at the earliest opportunity of their contact with the criminal justice system and get them into drug treatment and other support. Currently, drug testing operates within the 71 crime partnership areas across England and Wales with high levels of acquisitive crime, the so called &#145;DIP intensive areas&#146;.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_350"><a name="60706w0019.htm_para2"><a name="06070727000377">The volume of tests conducted under this legislation continues to grow. Some 17, 400 adult drug tests were carried out in April 2006, more than three times the number in April 2005.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_351"><a name="60706w0019.htm_para3"><a name="06070727000378">The Home Office has received no specific recent representations about the operation of section 57 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000 although a number of police forces have made enquiries about introducing drug testing in their areas.</p>

<p><a name="st_257"><a name="06070727000380"><a name="60706w0019.htm_spnew1"><a name="06070727003514"><b>Joan Ryan:</b>
 The total number of disclosure applications received and disclosures issued by the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) in the last 12 months is contained in table 1.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_352"><a name="60706w0019.htm_para4"><a name="06070727000381">Information on the average length of time taken to process the checks during these periods is not available in the format requested. The CRB operates to a set of a Published Service Standards (PSS) which for the majority of the period was to publish 93 per cent. of Standard Disclosures within two weeks and 90 per cent. of Enhanced Disclosures within four weeks. The monthly performance measured against the PSS is as shown in tables 2 and 3.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_353"><a name="60706w0019.htm_para5"><a name="06070727000382">The four week target for Enhanced Disclosures is made up of two distinct parts. The CRB is required to process 90 per cent. of valid Enhanced Disclosure applications to the police within 10 days, with the police forces required to process 95 per cent. of the checks within a further 14 days. The CRB consistently exceeded their target in 2005-06 and, for May 2006, processed 97.4 per cent. of applications to the police within 10 days. The CRB and the police forces are working together to reduce police completion times in line with the overall service standard objectives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_354"><a name="60706w0019.htm_para6"><a name="06070727000383">The CRB recently published its Five-Year Strategy and Business Plan 2006-07 and the PSS for the financial year 2006-07 for Standard Disclosures is 90 per cent. within 10 days and for Enhanced Disclosures 90 per cent. within 28 days. The shortening of the Standard Disclosure PSS is the result of the effectiveness of the CRB&#146;s internal processes.</p>

It is our intention to deploy the INI to other business areas following full deployment to child abuse investigation units but we do not plan to train all officers in the use of the INI or to give all officers direct access to the system; searches can be carried out on their behalf. Which areas should receive the application, and in which order, will be determined in consultation with the police service, informed by the outcome of current trials involving the Thames Valley Force Intelligence Bureau; the Child Exploitation and On-line Protection Centre; the East Midlands Regional Special Operations Unit and the Metropolitan Police Counter Terrorism Command. At the conclusion of the trials in August, the IMPACT Programme Board will have a better understanding of the business benefits and resources required to respond to inter-force requests for information following a match on the INI. It is for forces to determine how to manage the resource requirements to implement the new operational capability we are delivering. The INI is being developed to incorporate certain local audit and administration functions. We are currently assessing the impact of INI on forces in terms of the operational benefits delivered by the system and the demands associated with responding to inter-force enquiries. On-site surveys and case reviews are being conducted to identify the type and number of cases where INI-identified data have made a significant contribution to their work. We are also working with forces to identify best practice and potential new applications of the system.</p>

 Of the officers who retired with either an ordinary pension or an ill-health pension in 2004-05 10.5 per cent. retired with an ill-health pension, based on available data from 42 out of 43 forces. Since the number of retirements is liable to change from year to year, the rate of ill-health retirement is now measured against the number of officers in service, this being a more stable measure. For 2004-05 the rate of ill-health retirement was three per 1,000 serving officers. These figures are published in HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary&#146;s annual report for 2004-05 (page 25) which can be found at: http://www.official-documents.co.uk/document/hc0506/hc08/0842/0842.pdf.

Specifically, we have been short of experienced staff and some key management posts were unfilled which has inhibited our ability to respond to local problems. Experience levels are growing and we have recently filled all of the management posts. We now have four senior managers on site and 22 junior managers to support them.</p>

We have also reviewed our internal process from first contact by the customer to payment, which will reduce the time it takes to assess claims. We are reviewing progress against this plan weekly and putting in place arrangements to clear the arrears of claims that have built up by lending Chippenham additional help from outside.</p>

 As part of the Welfare Reform Green Paper consultation we have met a large number of stakeholders to discuss the full range of our reform proposals.

 The UK&#146;s aim in Afghanistan is to support the development of a free, secure and stable state.

 The Serving Personnel Continuous Attitude Survey (CAS) is a management information tool that is used to assess and monitor the attitudes of serving officers and soldiers over time. Its findings inform the development of service personnel strategy and policies. In the ninth Serving Personnel (SP9) survey, which was distributed in September 2005, question 66 was removed and replaced with question 39c, an open-ended question which asks &#147;If within the last 12 months you have suffered unfair treatment, discrimination, harassment and/or bullying and you have chosen not to complain please explain why?&#148;. The analysis of open-ended questions is complex and not contained in the Technical Annex of the CAS Report, which is placed in the Library of the House.</p>

 UK funding for the UN Mission to the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) is drawn from the Tri-departmental (FCO, MOD, DfID) peace-keeping budget. In 2005-06 this budget made assessed contributions of approximately &#163;37 million to MONUC. The UK also currently provides six officers to MONUC, at a gross additional cost of &#163;740,000 in 2005-06. These officers fill key strategic posts, notably that of the Chief of Staff in the Eastern Division HQ in Kisangani, and the Military Assistant to the Force Commander in the MONUC Force HQ in Kinshasa. In addition, we have provided training support during the stand-up of the Eastern Division HQ and advice, with other nations, through the short-term deployment of a technical assessment mission.</p>

Since then OPSI has made a significant contribution in sharing best practice across the public sector. This includes developing an on-line licence that can be used across the whole of the public sector, developing an on-line assessment tool which gauges the effectiveness of public sector organisations in meeting their obligations, and speaking to over 400 public sector organisations about their new responsibilities. OPSI has also played a key role in setting standards of compliance and in the resolution of disputes.

 The Department always seeks a full range of views when drawing up and framing legislation. Consultation is a key part of the policy-making process; both informal and formal. The Department holds regular meetings with representatives of the principal stakeholder groups for our policy areas and with relevant experts. Organisations and individuals can also contribute to the Department's formal consultations which abide by the Code of Conduct on Consultation. Known stakeholders are alerted to the fact that a formal consultation is taking place. As required by the Code, the Department then gives feedback on the responses received and on how the consultation process influenced the policy decision.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_424"><a name="60706w0033.htm_para0"><a name="06070727003185">Four Government Bills have been introduced to Parliament by the Department in the current parliamentary session, the Children and Adoption Bill, the Childcare Bill, the Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups Bill and the Education and Inspections Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_425"><a name="60706w0033.htm_para1"><a name="06070727003186">The Children and Adoption Bill was published in draft for pre-legislative scrutiny by a joint committee of both Houses, and the Government published their response to the report of that committee before the Bill was introduced to Parliament. Prior to that, the policy proposals on which the Bill was based were subject to full consultation through the Green Paper &#147;Parental Separation: Children's Needs and Parents' Responsibilities&#148;. Discussions were held with key stakeholders throughout the preparation of the Bill.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_426"><a name="60706w0033.htm_para2"><a name="06070727003187">Full consultation was carried out on the Childcare Bill, including discussions with stakeholders and a formal consultation from 15 July to 7 October 2005. The Department published a response to this consultation, &#147;Report on Responses to Consultation on Legislative Proposals for the Future of Childcare and Early Years Provision in England&#148;, in late October 2005, copies of which can be found in the House of Commons Library. Regular meetings were held throughout the framing and drafting of the Bill with key stakeholders including provider organisations, children's charities and local authority representatives.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_427"><a name="60706w0033.htm_para3"><a name="06070727003188">The Safeguarding Vulnerable Groups (SVG) Bill was subject to extensive consultation prior to introduction. A range of consultations have informed the development of the centralised vetting and barring scheme for which the SVG Bill will provide the statutory framework. In April 2005 a consultation was carried out on proposals for the vetting and barring scheme (VBS). Further engagement with stakeholders on the policy detail was carried out in December 2005, and January, March and April 2006 on the Independent Barring Board (IBB). The Department continues to consult with stakeholders as the VBS systems and processes are developed in more detail.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_428"><a name="60706w0033.htm_para4"><a name="06070727003189">Proposals for the Education and Inspections Bill were set out in the Schools White Paper &#147;Higher Standards, Better Schools for All&#151;More Choice for Parents and Pupils&#148; published on 25 October 2005. This followed on from the DfES Five Year Strategy published in July 2004 which was extensively consulted upon. In addition, it enacts the policies that were set out in the 2005 Labour party manifesto. The Department discussed the White Paper with a very wide range of stakeholders over recent months.</p>

 The Government recognise the importance of personal finance education for all young people. The National Curriculum for Citizenship, which is compulsory at key stages 3 and 4 (11 to 16-year-olds), includes teaching pupils about how the economy functions, including the role of business and financial services. In addition, the DfES has asked the QCA, as part of the wider review of GCSE maths and the emphasis on improving functional skills, to consider including financial capability more explicitly in the maths curriculum. QCA has also developed a package of guidance for teachers of PSHE which includes two units of work on financial capability. In September 2004, we made work-related learning a statutory element of the curriculum, and from September 2005 are funding schools to develop a new focus on enterprise education, defined as enterprise capability supported by better financial capability and economic and business understanding. We are also working closely with the Financial Services Authority to take forward its Financial Capability Strategy which includes support for schools to deliver better personal finance education.</p>

The LSC does not stipulate the training that is required by each funded learner to ensure their health and safety. Each learner&#146;s complete learning programme should contain the appropriate personal health and safety training. It is a contractual responsibility of each school or college to determine what training is required and to ensure that this is delivered. Training should be in line with the result of risk assessment taking into account the environment, task, and the learner&#146;s age, experience and any special requirements.</p>
