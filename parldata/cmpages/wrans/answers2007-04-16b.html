 My Department worked closely with creditors and the enforcement profession to produce and issue the national standards for enforcement agents, available from the DCA website. The standards are a best practice guide intended for use by all enforcement agents, public and private, the enforcement agencies that employ them and the major creditors who use them. The standards have been widely endorsed by the trade associations representing bailiffs and advise that discretion should be used when dealing with those who might be potentially vulnerable, including the elderly, people with a disability and single parent families.</p>

 Complaints made against bailiffs, be they certificated or non-certificated, can be made by telephone or writing to the firm that the bailiff works for, the organisation who employed the bailiff to act on their behalf or the magistrates court that issued the enforcement order. Complaints against certificated bailiffs can also be made to the court that granted certification to the bailiff and to the Enforcement Officers Association, or the Association of Civil Enforcement Agencies, which are responsible for promoting higher standards within the profession. HMCS leaflet EX345 details the procedure for complaints about bailiffs and recommends seeking legal advice before starting this process.</p>

 The Government are committed to controlling legal aid expenditure. A small number of practitioners have recently informed the LSC that they do not intend to continue doing legal aid work. This is not unusual, as the number of providers in the market has always fluctuated. There will be no effect on the provision of service to clients in any area. These few solicitors have made this assertion without sight of either the proposed new fee levels (crime and family), or the structure of the process for competitive tendering (crime), both of which the LSC are due to consult on shortly.</p>

 We are very concerned about humanitarian conditions throughout Somalia. Although food security appears to have improved compared to 2006, the current high risk of conflict may generate widespread additional humanitarian needs. According to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, up to 100,000 more people may have been displaced since early February.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="70416w0010.htm_para3"><a name="07041774000872">According to UN agencies, humanitarian conditions in the refugee camps are difficult, with ongoing high levels of child malnutrition. The Kenyan authorities have gone to great lengths in offering shelter to the 174,000 Somalis currently believed to be in camps, and they have legitimate security concerns about the influx of large numbers of Somalis. However, we remain concerned that, since the beginning of the year, they have denied entry to the camps to some Somalis genuinely seeking to flee from conflict. Our high commissioner in Nairobi raised the issue of the border closure with the Kenyan Minister of Foreign Affairs in early January. And the UK has supported a similar approach by the EU presidency. The UK participated in a US-hosted senior level donor round table in late January about the humanitarian impact of the closure of the border with Somalia and we have ongoing discussions with the USAID Office for Disaster Assistance and the USAID Office of Food for Peace about remedial action.</p>

 Lack of buy-in from a broad range of rebel groups means that there has only been limited progress with the implementation of the Darfur Peace Agreement (DPA), particularly on the wealth sharing and security provisions. But a few of the power-sharing provisions of the DPA have been implemented. Minni Minawi was appointed Special Assistant to the President, and nominations have been made to some positions on the Transitional Darfuri Regional Authority and other bodies, but this remains insufficient.</p>

 The Agricultural Wages Board provides a pay structure for the agricultural workers linking minimum pay rates, qualifications and experience. This goes beyond the protection given by the national minimum wage arrangements. Given the fragmented and isolated nature of the agricultural workforce, the strong links between home and job, and the need to protect migrant and seasonal workers from exploitation, the Government decided to retain the agricultural minimum wage when the national minimum wage was introduced in 1999. These concerns remain valid today and the Government consider that it is appropriate to maintain the current protections given to agricultural workers.</p>

 Routine cattle herd testing for bovine tuberculosis (bTB) in Great Britain, uses the single intradermal comparative cervical tuberculin (SICCT) test (commonly known as the &#147;skin test&#148;).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_132"><a name="70416w0013.htm_para7"><a name="07041774001122">Research shows that when the skin test is applied to cattle in bTB-free herds in Great Britain, there is a less than one in 1,000 chance that a non-infected animal will be wrongly classified as a reactor. This is known as the test&#146;s false positive rate. An alternative way of defining this is to say that the skin test has a specificity in excess of 99.9 per cent. Although the probability of getting at least one false positive result increases with the size of the herd being tested, it would be extremely rare to find more than one false positive in a herd.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_133"><a name="70416w0013.htm_para8"><a name="07041774001123">When considering the false positive issue it is important to bear in mind that failure to confirm the disease by post-mortem examination at the slaughterhouse, or by culturing the causative bacterium in the laboratory, does not mean that the animal was not infected with bTB. In the early stages of this infectious disease, it is not always possible to see lesions with the naked eye and, due to the fastidious nature of the organism, it is not possible to culture it from tissue samples in every case. Because of this it is not possible to give a meaningful figure for the number of false positive test results.</p>

 TB in dogs is already notifiable.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) is spent by the Government on actions to combat climate change; whether he plans to increase spending to the 1 per cent. of GDP recommended by the Stern Review; and if he will make a statement.

<i> [holding answer 14 March 2007]:</i> The Stern Review suggests that taking action to mitigate climate change&#151;by aiming for a stabilisation goal of around 550 parts per million of carbon dioxide equivalent or lower&#151;will cost a total of 1 per cent. of GDP across the world by 2050. However, Stern does not recommend that this estimated 1 per cent. of GDP should come from Government expenditure; nor does he suggest that every country should directly spend 1 per cent. of their GDP on measures to combat climate change&#151;some countries will have higher costs than others.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_145"><a name="70416w0014.htm_para5"><a name="07041774001180">Stern&#146;s estimate reflects the likely costs under a timely, flexible, global policy, employing a variety of economic instruments to control emissions of a broad range of greenhouse gases. Stern advocates action on three fronts:</p>
<a name="70416w0014.htm_brev0"><a name="07041774001691"><ul><p class="tabletext">1. To create a global price for carbon;</p>
</ul><a name="70416w0014.htm_brev1"><a name="07041774001692"><ul><p class="tabletext">2. To provide finance for technology research, development and deployment; and</p>
</ul><a name="70416w0014.htm_brev2"><a name="07041774001693"><ul><p class="tabletext">3. To take action to change behaviour&#151;including encouraging energy efficiency and reduced deforestation, where there are many cheap abatement opportunities, some that even save money.</p>
</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_146"><a name="70416w0014.htm_para6"><a name="07041774001181">Therefore Stern recommends action by Government to ensure that the private sector faces clear long-term price signals and incentives to ensure low-carbon economies, for example by establishing cap and trade schemes, as well as some level of Government expenditure to bring forward low-carbon technology and tackle market failures. Using only Government expenditure as the sole means of delivering reductions in emissions is likely to impose greater burdens on economies than the alternatives, and if the signals are not clear enough, or we delay action, the costs could be significantly higher.</p>

 Since the 1990s DEFRA and its predecessors have encouraged coastal defence authorities to produce shoreline management plans (SMPs) that provide a framework for long term strategic planning at the coast, taking account of climate change and other factors. These SMPs are developed on a coastal cell basis which is appropriate for the regional planning scale.</p>

This review will fully incorporate lessons learnt from the first round plans and three pilot second round plans that have been undertaken to test and develop DEFRA's revised guidance to the authorities. In addition, first round plans have pointed to the need for a number of more detailed strategy studies that have been progressed in many areas.</p>

 I am only able to report on changes which have been made since the formation of my Department in 2001.

Natural England does not have information available about changes of name or branding within their legacy bodies prior to that time. The re-branding by Natural England has cost the Exchequer &#163;385,000 for brand materials, website changes, new signs, stationery, publications and launch events.</p>

Costs up to the launch of the re-brand were &#163;120,000. However, it was agreed that communications materials were only replaced when existing stocks became exhausted or when a contract was due for renewal. No additional money&#151;other than for a short guide to the brand for Environment Agency staff&#151;has been spent &#147;launching the brand&#148;.</p>

The primary aim throughout has been to protect key services and ensure they continue to be delivered to appropriate standards. The savings put in place will, therefore, have no impact on pesticides safety which is the Directorate's top priority. Some research projects, particularly on the behaviour of pesticides in the environment, will have to be postponed. There should be no significant impact on investigative and surveillance work, particularly since efficiency gains from new technology have allowed the number of samples tested within the key pesticide residues surveillance programme to be maintained at lower costs.</p>

 It is for each local authority (LA) to decide whether to implement alternate weekly collection, or any other waste management system. However, my Department has funded research and guidance to assist LAs in carrying out their operations in the most efficient and effective manner. This will ensure that such changes in collections do not impact negatively on residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_203"><a name="70416w0017.htm_para3"><a name="07041774001437">Guidance published by the Waste and Resources Action Programme (WRAP) in 2005 sets out the process councils need to go through if they are considering the introduction of an alternate week collection service. The guidance is based on the experiences of LAs that have already implemented such schemes. WRAP is currently revising its guidance to take account of the latest research, including recent householder and LA experiences. Suitability of an alternate weekly collection service often depends on local geography and housing stock. The guidance also emphasises that a key part of any successful change is following full consultation with local residents.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_204"><a name="70416w0017.htm_para4"><a name="07041774001438">My Department has made some assumptions about the costs of alternate weekly collections in our modelling] for the review of England&#146;s Waste Strategy.

A more complete study will follow later this year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_205"><a name="70416w0017.htm_para5"><a name="07041774001439">WRAP has not carried out a general assessment of cost savings associated with alternate weekly collection.  <br>

The work that has been done has looked at particular LAs and how alternate weekly collection has been implemented in these cases. The general work that WRAP has been undertaking for Defra looks at different types of alternate weekly collection design and how this impacts on recycling performance and total quantities of household waste collected.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_206"><a name="70416w0017.htm_para6"><a name="07041774001440">Alternate weekly collection covers a number of important design decisions in relation to residual household waste, recycling and composting collections and only one component of this is whether or not to collect household residual waste on alternate weeks. There are many systems where only elements of recycling and composting alternate with one another and the refuse is still collected on a weekly basis.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_207"><a name="70416w0017.htm_para7"><a name="07041774001441">WRAP has carried out regular public! attitude surveys since 2004 that have included ratings of how convenient the public find different LA collection systems to use. Only a minority of alternate weekly collection systems received poor convenience ratings and these related to systems where insufficient capacity has been provided to householders in the week that alternated with refuse collection.</p>

 Under the proposals to allow creation of Joint Waste Authorities (JWA), it will be for groups of authorities to determine which powers they wish to pass to a JWA. If a group of authorities opted to pass waste collection responsibilities to a JWA, then the constituent authorities would no longer have a role in waste collection. The JWA would be responsible for making decisions such as whether to introduce alternate weekly collection. The JWA would be governed by elected members from the constituent local authorities. If a group of authorities chose to pass only waste disposal functions to the. JWA, and to retain waste collection responsibilities themselves, the JWA would not be able to make any decisions about alternate weekly collection.</p>

 According to earliest available records (pre-1850), species such as grayling, roach, dace, chub, gudgeon, barbel, common bream, eel and perch are native to the River Don. We have utilised these records, together with the topography of the river, throughout our stocking programmes to stock species appropriate to the location. Fishery surveys were also undertaken after the recent pollution incident, land the data compared to that from previous surveys to help evaluate suitable species for stocking. Stocking needs for 2007-08 will be based upon future monitoring to ensure it meets the demands of the river following this incident.</p>

Fish passes, for example, may be installed, according to need, in order to allow stocks unaffected by the pollution to migrate upstream. A recovery plan for the river is being finalised.</p>

 In 2006, the UK under-fished its North Sea nephrops quota by some 3,429 tonnes, 2,443 tonnes of which has been carried over to 2007. This takes this year&#146;s UK quota for this stock to 25,087 tonnes, which is 4,084 tonnes above the level of its actual landings in 2006.</p>

Any disadvantage would be greatly outweighed by the benefit to the inshore fleet of securing 150 tonnes of North Sea sole.

 The UK Government recognises that health workers are essential to the delivery of essential health services and achievement of the health related MDGs. DFID therefore invests substantially in health, supporting African Governments to strengthen their health services. DFID uses a variety of mechanisms, including support to international agencies, direct support to Government budgets, working jointly with other donors or through projects. For example, in Malawi, where the shortage of health workers is particularly severe, we provide &#163;100 million support for the health sector of which &#163;55 million is earmarked for the Emergency Human Resources Programme. This programme focuses on improving recruitment and retention through salary increases for health workers, expanding training capacity&#151;doubling the number of nurses and tripling the number of doctors in training&#151;and using international volunteer physicians and nurse tutors while more Malawians are being trained. The programme also supports human resources planning and management capacity in Malawi&#146;s Ministry of Health. In Nigeria and Kenya, DFID provides technical assistance to develop human resources for health plans. A long-term &#163;50 million health reform programme has been agreed in Sierra Leone which will strengthen recruitment, training and retention of key health workers.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_271"><a name="70416w0020.htm_para6"><a name="07041782000040">DFID engages regionally and globally on policy development and advocacy with key institutions such as WHO, the World Bank and African regional institutions such as the African Union (AU) and the New Partnership for Africa&#146;s Development (NEPAD). DFID has recently committed &#163;1 million to support the formation of the Global Health Workforce Alliance which will play a key advocacy, policy and convening role on human resource for health issues.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_272"><a name="70416w0020.htm_para7"><a name="07041782000041">Health worker brain drain results from a mix of country push factors that motivate staff to leave, and pull factors that attract workers away. DFID works with the UK Department of Health to develop and implement policies that prevent the targeting of developing countries in the international recruitment of health care professionals including agreeing a list of countries, from which the NHS does not actively recruit. In addition, the Department of Health has brokered agreement for this Code to apply to major players in the UK independent healthcare sector.</p>

 The recruitment, training and retention of health workers is essential to improve the delivery of basic health services in Africa. This requires budgets that can support and sustain long term public investment. The advice the IMF gives to African countries on budget issues needs to contribute to strengthening health services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_273"><a name="70416w0020.htm_para8"><a name="07041782000044">Concerns have been raised in some African countries about the impact of public sector expenditure ceilings on the retention of health workers. We have been closely monitoring the impact of ceilings and discussing these concerns with the IMF. The IMF has agreed to engage further in discussions at national and global level on the issue of health work forces and how these can be best supported by their programmes. These should recognise the constraints all countries face in deciding on appropriate levels of expenditure, domestic deficits and borrowing and also how higher spending on public services can be supported by higher levels of aid. In discussions with the international financial institutions, DFID continues to urge an approach that supports stability, growth and the best use of higher levels of aid. These discussions include the topic of fiscal space which will be discussed at this year's spring meetings.</p>

 The core of DFID's work in health in developing countries in Africa is to support national partners in their efforts to build effective and accessible health services which are able to prevent, identify and treat the major causes of ill health.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_274"><a name="70416w0020.htm_para9"><a name="07041782000047">This includes support to address the shortage of health workers, and remove barriers such as user fees that prevent the poor from using services. For example, in Malawi DFID has provided &#163;55 million over six years to fund an innovative Emergency Human Resources Programme to support the training, recruitment and retention of health workers. This will eventually double the number of nurses and treble the number of doctors. In Zambia DFID has committed &#163;14.5 million over five years to support the abolition of user fees in public health facilities.</p>

During 2005, 5,000 of 7,000 HIV positive pregnant women received a complete course of Anti Retro Viral prophylaxis. The aim is also that more HIV positive pregnant women offered help to prevent mother to child transmission are referred for care and support services&#151;currently only one third of women are referred on.

A draft review of health sector performance for 2006 suggests a downward trend and an estimated maternal mortality rate of 187 per 100,000 live births. These figures need to be interpreted with care. At country level, discussions with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) are taking place over the measurements of maternal mortality in the 2008 Demographic Health Survey and/or the 2010 Census.</p>

This strategy aims to strengthen service delivery at all levels of the health system and the capacity of individuals and communities to improve maternal and neonatal health. Districts have also been able to 'kick start' action on maternal health using flexible funds from the SWAp. This includes the signing of 47 service level agreements with the Christian Health Association of Malawi to remove user fees for maternal services and using locum payments to midwives to go to health centres to cover staff shortages.</p>

 DFID has recently only supported one BBC World Service Trust project in Burma: a grant of &#163;1,997,513 for a radio soap opera to raise awareness of HIV/AIDS in audiences in Burma. The project started in January 2003 and was to last three years. By late 2005, the project was spending DFID's grant more slowly than budgeted, so we agreed an extension until September 2006. A review at that point judged that the project was judged likely partly to achieve its purpose. When the project managers requested a further extension we declined in order to focus our resources on other projects which we judged would be even more effective in reducing poverty in Burma.</p>

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has no immediate plans to meet with chocolate manufacturers to discuss the use of child labour in the production of cocoa, but he met with Cadbury Schweppes at the end of last year and has met with Stop the Traffik. In addition, the UK Government have been engaging with the International Cocoa Initiative, which was set up by the chocolate manufacturers to address concerns about the use of the worst forms of child labour in cocoa production. The Initiative is focusing on surveying working practices in Ghana and Ivory Coast to identify what activities in the production of cocoa would fall into the International Labour Organisation&#146;s (ILO) definition of the worst forms of child labour, how widespread these activities are and how best to tackle them. In doing this the International Cocoa Initiative is working closely with the governments of Ghana and Ivory Coast. The Secretary of State discussed the work of the International Cocoa Initiative when he met representatives of Cadbury Schweppes on 2 October. A progress report on the Initiative&#146;s work was given to the chocolate manufacturers and other interested parties at a meeting of the Cocoa Task Force hosted by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office on 22 February this year.</p>

This is in addition to our annual &#163;20 million core grant to UNFPA.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_295"><a name="70416w0022.htm_para1"><a name="07041782000165">We also have a number of programmes we directly support in countries.

In Somalia, we have provided over &#163;400,000 to a project which aims to provide free primary health care and increase the access and quality of services provided to women. Part of this programme provides reproductive health education and highlights the benefits of family planning and birth spacing for women and their children.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_297"><a name="70416w0022.htm_para3"><a name="07041782000167">However, many countries now recognise that education (especially female education) can play an important role in reducing poverty. The link between improved education and improved reproductive health and HIV prevention is also recognised and many developing countries have established or broadened reproductive health policies and programmes. However, over 200 million couples still have no access to effective contraception and 15 to 24-year-olds account for 50 per cent. of new HIV cases. In Africa, 90 per cent. of all HIV infections are sexually transmitted with women and young people disproportionately affected.</p>

 The Department for International Development (DFID) supports a range of projects designed to reduce the risk of pesticide poisoning in the agricultural sector. For example, DFID has researched and promoted integrated pest management practices for cost-effective and sustainable control of cotton bollworm in small-scale cotton production systems in India and Uganda. These practices are currently being scaled up by the Indian Government after they resulted in both increased yields and a 52 per cent. reduction in pesticide use.

 DFID has supported a range of training, education and research projects to promote best practice in the use of pesticides in developing countries. Integrated pest management practices researched with the help of DFID have proven to be particularly useful pest control strategies that can significantly reduce or eliminate the use of pesticides. DFID has recently allocated &#163;37.5 million over five years to help scale up some of the most promising research findings and promote their use in Africa and South Asia. DFID is a major supporter of development cooperation carried out by the European Commission and the Commission has provided around &#8364;30 million towards a Pesticide Initiative Programme' to improve training for farmers in various African, Caribbean and Pacific countries.

The evaluation found that DFID India&#146;s overall development effectiveness is substantial and increased significantly between 2000 and 2005. For example, DFID&#146;s support to primary education through the Government of India&#146;s Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) programme has helped to get millions of children into school and to cut drop out rates. Support to civil society in some of the poorest districts of India has also made significant headway in allowing poor and marginalised groups to realise their rights.

 The Public Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF) does not separate its activities purely between public and private schemes for water supply. The realities of water services provision in developing countries are more complicated.</p>

These projects used extensive community outreach to get 90 per cent. of the population to agree on technical, financial and cost recovery options, including tariff design. This demand driven approach is now being replicated through other donor programs and also in the Philippines and Thailand with many other prospects for replication.</p>

 Between the financial years of 1996-97 and 2005-06, Zambia received &#163;662.3 million from the UK as bilateral aid. Of this amount, DFID's bilateral programme totalled &#163;309.6 million and included financial aid, technical cooperation, humanitarian assistance and debt relief. General poverty reduction budget support also featured in financial years 2000-01, 2004-05 and 2005-06. Aid from other (non-DFID) UK official sources amounted to &#163;352.7 million and includes CDC Group (originally known as Colonial Development Cooperation) investments, non-DFID debt relief and contributions from the British Council among other items. Table 1 provides further details on UK bilateral aid to Zambia over the past decade.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_334"><a name="70416w0024.htm_para6"><a name="07041782000514">Zambia has benefited from substantial external debt relief in recent years. Following the attainment of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Completion Point in April 2005 and implementation of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) in 2006, Zambia's external debt stock has declined from US$ 7.1 billion in 2004 to approximately US$ 0.5 billion in nominal terms at year-end 2006. As a result, the net present value of debt to GDP ratio has fallen from around 28 per cent. in 2004 to 4 per cent. following the MDRI. At the end of 2006, domestic debt was estimated at $1.74 billion some 20.2 per cent. as a share of GDP in 2006.</p>

 HM forces in Afghanistan are there as part of a peace-enforcement operation. However, the character of any particular campaign is rarely static and its intensity can vary over time. This requires UK forces to conduct a wide range of military activities concurrently, and transition quickly from one type of operation to another. This is evident in the way in which UK forces are involved in frequent engagements with the Taliban while simultaneously assisting in reconstruction activities. Nevertheless, the aims of the ISAF mission remain to stabilise the security environment so that the Provincial Reconstruction Team and other agencies can operate to extend the Government's authority, to improve the rule of law, and to facilitate reconstruction and development, particularly by supporting capacity-building in the security sector.</p>

 The 51 mm mortar is in service in Afghanistan but is approaching its planned out of service date across the armed forces. Ammunition stocks have been prioritised in order to continue to support its use in Afghanistan. The capability provided by the 51 mm mortar will be replaced by a combination of systems including the 40 mm Underslung Grenade Launcher and rocket hand-fired illumination and smoke rounds. In Afghanistan, this capability is being augmented by a purchase of a more modern and supportable 60 mm mortar.</p>

 Operational reliability is assessed by the numbers of aircraft that are deemed as Fit For Purpose (FFP) against the planned average FFP figure. Aircraft are deemed Fit For Purpose if they are capable of undertaking the required task on a given day. Aircraft are not available for tasking if they are undergoing scheduled maintenance, modification programmes or any unforeseen rectification work that can arise .on a day to day basis. The figures do not reflect the fact that an aircraft assessed as not fit for purpose may be returned to the front line at very short notice to meet the operational need. The planned average FFP for the Tristar aircraft for 2006-07 is 4.8 aircraft per day. As at the end of February 2007 we have achieved a FFP figure of 4.62 aircraft per day for the same period, largely owing to the ongoing programme to fit defensive measures to the Tristar.</p>

<i> [holding answers 22 and 23 March 2007]:</i> If an injury sustained in theatre warrants the immediate removal of a limb, the operation will be conducted under field conditions. Service personnel injured while on operation in Iraq or Afghanistan who require further medical treatment are usually aero-medically evacuated to Selly Oak hospital in Birmingham. Once evacuated to the UK, the patient will undergo detailed assessment by the hospital clinical team and further medical treatment, if required, will be carried out. We are aware of no cases of service personnel contracting an infection while in theatre, in transit, or as a military patient being treated in Birmingham that has subsequently led to a limb amputation.</p>

UHB does collect overall infection rates, and in total for all patients, it has had 93 MRSA bacteraemia reports across the Queen Elizabeth and Selly Oak hospital sites from April 2006 to the end of February 2007.

<i> [holding answer 26 March 2007]:</i> Data migration for Army personnel has been a challenge due to the sheer volume concerned and the age and diversity of the legacy systems involved. The current estimate is that the proportion of personnel who will experience a variance in basic pay in the first month of transition will be between 0.5 per cent. and 3 per cent. This incorporates Army and RAF reserves, as well as regular Army. For specialist pay the proportion is expected to be between 4 per cent. and 8 per cent. Work between now and the first live pay run in April is expected to result in the variances being at the lower end of the estimates range. In cases of mismatch of either basic pay or specialist pay the individuals affected will be notified by the Army in advance and where necessary local payments will be made to ensure hardship is not an issue. Action will be taken to inform the May pay run.</p>

 Numerous reports of unexploded bombs (UXB) were investigated during and shortly after WWII; in most cases the UXB were located and cleared by military bomb disposal teams. There were, however, instances where a device could not be found. In these instances, it was concluded the UXB had either travelled underground to a depth and position where it could not be reached, it had broken up on impact, leaving only fragments, or the report was mistaken and no UXB existed. It was decided that such UXB sites did not represent an immediate danger to the public, and they were added to the Abandoned Bomb Register. These sites would only be further investigated if new evidence arose or a device was unearthed. There are 26 possible UXB sites on the Abandoned Bomb Register for Wales; none of these is in Pembrokeshire.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_438"><a name="70416w0033.htm_para16"><a name="07041797000129">Consumer power usage is expected to rise as a result of switchover, primarily because of the rapid increase in the take-up of set-top boxes, particularly for second sets, which would not otherwise be converted until replaced. The predicted level of the increase is dependent on a number of assumptions about the usage and design of equipment in the market at the time of switchover. DCMS, DTI and Defra economists have estimated that the increase in consumer energy use of completing digital switchover in 2012 is likely to be between 966GWh and 2,816GWh per annum above that predicted for market take-up in the absence of a set switchover timetable. The central estimate for the total impact of switchover is a net increase of l,705GWh per year. This is equivalent to a 0.34 per cent. increase in domestic electricity consumption. This would be reduced if industry can be encouraged to make more energy-efficient products. Work on this is being taken forward as part of the DTI usability action plan.</p>

 The statutory recognition procedure applies to GB employers who, together with their associated employers, employ 21 or more workers. It is not possible to estimate precisely how many workers are employed in organisations which fall under this threshold. However, at the start of 2005, the estimated number of employees working in UK enterprises with 19 or fewer employees was 4,764,000. There are no estimates of the number of workers who are excluded from the statutory procedure because of their employment status.

 The Environment and Heritage Service (EHS) holds details of alleged illegal or unauthorised waste activities. It does not have figures for fly-tipping, which, although not legally defined, has in the past been used to describe largely domestic, low quantity incidents. Such small-scale cases are generally dealt with by district councils.</p>

 Under the proposed new arrangements, the Department will retain the statutory responsibility for securing the delivery of the services necessary to promote the health and wellbeing of the population. The role of the authority will be to implement the Government's policies for health and social services, to manage performance of the system and to commission services to meet the demands of patients. These roles are not appropriate to a central Government Department. The new, much smaller DHSSPS will be able to focus on assisting the Minister with policy, legislation and strategic planning and resource allocation.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland whether the Government are satisfied with the financial and equality provisions in place in respect of cross-border bodies established in consequence of the Belfast Agreement; and whether these correspond with the requirements placed on non-cross-border public bodies within Northern Ireland.

 The cross-border bodies are accountable to the North/South Ministerial Council and are jointly funded by the Northern Ireland Public Expenditure system and the Irish Government. Northern Ireland staff employed in the cross-border bodies generally follow the NICS pay award and their pay growth is considered, with due regard to public sector pay policy, as part of the business planning process. For these reasons cross-border bodies are currently outside the formal HM Treasury pay remits process.</p>

 The following table has been compiled from the address given by the prisoner at the time of committal. To break down those classified as GB into individual countries would involve a disproportionate cost. The figures listed are from the last six years for which statistics are available. It is not currently possible to differentiate between overseas prisoners and those from Northern Ireland of no fixed address. However, since July 2006 foreign nationals have been recorded separately.</p>

It is more common to introduce 20 mph zones, which are a form of traffic calming in residential areas where an extensive network of streets is involved and where self-enforcing measures can be provided to reduce vehicle speeds to approximately 20mph. Where speeds have been reduced to 20 mph by self-enforcing measures, it is then possible to introduce a mandatory 20 mph limit. However, if the level of traffic calming measures is insufficient to reduce speeds to around 20 mph, then it is unlikely that the Police Service of Northern Ireland would agree to the introduction of a mandatory 20 mph limit.</p>

For each scheme, the number of injury collisions occurring over the three year period following introduction of a scheme, is compared with the collision history for a similar period prior to the works.</p>

In addition, the DHSSPS has also issued a &#147;Careplan for Women who Experience a Miscarriage, Stillbirth or Neonatal Death&#148; and explanatory booklets to accompany the consent forms that are used to record a family' s wishes in respect of a hospital post mortem examination and the removal, use and disposal of human tissue.</p>

However, it is apparent that the volume of Irish language translations has fallen following the dissolution of the Assembly while EU enlargement and the increased immigrant population has seen a significant increase in the volume of ethnic language translations. The level of Ulster-Scots translations has remained fairly static over the period.</p>

The amount of work required to achieve clearance, and the length of time involved, varies considerably depending on, amongst other things, the circumstances of the parents and how readily they cooperate with the Agency. The work undertaken by the Agency&#146;s New Client Teams extends far beyond simply clearing new applications through the computer system. A significant proportion of the work undertaken by the Agency&#146;s New Client Teams consists of setting up the first maintenance payments to the parent with care, and retaining responsibility for this growing caseload until the first fully compliant, on time payment is made by the non-resident parent.</p>

The number of uncleared applications fell by 13 per cent. in the 12 months prior to December 2006, as the Agency made progress in clearing significant numbers of older, more complex cases. These cased often require a great deal more work than other applications and this is reflected in the increasing average age of cleared cases.</p>

1. Numbers are rounded to the nearest hundred.<br>
2. The increase in the number of old scheme clearances in September and October 2006 was as a result of work being carried out to clear a number of cases that had previously not been on the system.<br>
3. The definition of a clearance is not the same on the old and new schemes. A clearance on the old scheme occurs when an assessment has been carried out, a case is closed, the parent with care (PWC) is identified as claiming Good Cause or the PWC is subject to a Reduced Benefit Decision. For a new scheme case to be cleared it must also have a maintenance collection schedule set up following a calculation.<br>

 The Jobseeker&#146;s Mandatory Activity (JMA) pilot is a two year pilot which started in April 2006 and is operating in 10 Jobcentre Plus districts. In pilot locations, people aged 25 and over who have been in receipt of jobseeker&#146;s allowance or national insurance credits only for more than six months are required to attend a three day JMA course.

In the case of deceased individuals, a partner may make a claim for a contributory benefit, which is dependent on the contribution record of the deceased individual.

 The Government take into account a number of factors when reviewing benefit rates each year, the most important of which is the level of inflation.

 There is strong evidence to suggest that sanctions do drive behaviour. Of those claiming jobseekers allowance (JSA) the vast majority comply with the JSA conditions; only 14 per cent. Are actually referred for a decision and only 4 per cent. Actually have a sanction applied. Research of those that have and have not been sanctioned on JSA found that nearly half of those sanctioned think their own sanction was fair.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_575"><a name="70416w0054.htm_para2"><a name="07041819001293">These figures suggest that the overwhelming majority of claimants meet the conditions and understand the need for sanctions when those conditions are not met.</p>

But where there is non-compliance and a sanction is applied, it has to be sufficient to drive home the message that benefit is only paid to those who meet the conditions.</p>

On 13 December 2006, Communities and Local Government launched a consultation on the draft of a new Planning Policy Statement on climate change. This makes clear that new development should be located to optimise its carbon performance and make the most of existing and planned opportunities for decentralised, renewable and low-carbon energy supplies. In 2006 the Government amended Part L of the Building Regulations to increase energy efficiency standards. Without prescribing solutions, the regulations set standards for energy performance in a way that enables builders to take into account the benefits of renewable and on-site energy generating systems, thus encouraging their take-up.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_598"><a name="70416w0056.htm_para2"><a name="07041819001860">Government have not made any specific assessment of the potential for the use of currently unused waste heat from power plants. As promised in the Energy Review Report, we have issued new and improved guidance to power station developers on meeting their combined heat and power obligations. This will encourage the waste heat from plants to be utilised for other purposes, including the distribution of heating in communities.</p>

However, local authorities have general and discretionary powers under s.123 of the Local Government Act 1972 to dispose of land in any manner they wish.

The circular provides advice on making an application for a disposal that falls outside the terms of the general consent and it also makes it clear that, when disposing of land an undervalue, authorities should remain aware of the need to fulfil their fiduciary duty in a way that is accountable to local people.</p>

<i> [holding answer 19 March 2007]:</i> The decision was informed by the large body of evidence which shows that academies are an effective way of improving performance in underperforming schools and that despite the overall rise in education standards over the last decade there will remain a significant number of schools beyond the initial target of 200 academies which are underperforming and would benefit by becoming an academy.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_638"><a name="70416w0060.htm_para2"><a name="07041829000188">The percentage of pupils getting five good GCSEs including English and Maths in academies improved last year alone by 6.2 percentage points&#151;six times better than the national improvement rate of one percentage point&#151;and all 21 academies which had students who took GCSEs in 2006 are above the floor targets; 18 of the 24 predecessor schools they replaced were below.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_639"><a name="70416w0060.htm_para3"><a name="07041829000189">Academies are making dramatic improvements at key stage three&#151;above the national average&#151;with rises last year of 8.1 percentage points in English, nine percentage points in Maths and 10.5 percentage points in Science compared to previous validated results.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_640"><a name="70416w0060.htm_para4"><a name="07041829000190">16 academies have had full Ofsted inspections. Key to the future success of the academies is their leadership and management. On this indicator Ofsted has classed two academies as outstanding, 10 as good, three as satisfactory and one as inadequate.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_641"><a name="70416w0060.htm_para5"><a name="07041829000191">Academies are popular with parents. There were three applications for each academy place in September 2006. Almost all academies were oversubscribed on opening and each year afterwards.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_643"><a name="70416w0060.htm_para7"><a name="07041829000193">Last year's independent PricewaterhouseCoopers evaluation of academies found strong pupil and teacher support for academies.

<p><a name="stpa_644"><a name="70416w0060.htm_para8"><a name="07041829000194">All of the above were factors in the decision to expand the programme to 400. The case has since been reinforced by the positive findings of the NAO report on academies published last month, which found that academies are &#147;on track to deliver good value for money&#148;. The NAO concluded that academies are improving performance compared with predecessor schools, and that the improvement is faster than in comparable schools.</p>

 Mathematics is currently the only subject to have a tiered programme of study at key stage 4. Pupils should be entitled to access all learning relevant to the key stage at the level most appropriate to them. The current tiered curriculum creates an artificial ceiling of expectation for pupils following the foundation tier. The new single programme of study will enable teachers to personalise the curriculum to suit the needs of individual pupils, allowing them to engage with mathematics at all levels.</p>

Our guidance suggests that the maximum journey duration for a child of primary school age could be 45 minutes, while a journey of up to 75 minutes could be appropriate for a child of secondary school age.

Other funding streams support a range of opportunities, for example, the joint DCMS/DFES Museums and Galleries and the London Challenge New Views programmes.
