 No discussions have taken place between Ministry of Defence Ministers and the Defence Police Federation regarding the size of the MOD police establishment since the events of 11 September. MOD police strength, however, is kept under constant review in the light of calls on the resources of the force.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what resources have been made available to his Department for the fulfilment of its obligations under PPG 22 in advising district councils during the process of the issue of planning consent for an onshore wind turbine.  [27333]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 No specific additional resources have been made available to the Ministry of Defence to enable them to assess onshore or offshore wind turbine proposals.
<P>

<a name="20115w01.html_para0">The consultation procedure mentioned in PPG 22 is known as Safeguarding. This is a statutorily based system whereby local planning authorities are required to consult the Defence Estates Safeguarding (DE Safeguarding) team on planning applications for development near to certain sites such as aerodromes, explosives storage areas or communications facilities. Safeguarding ensures that no development occurs that would interfere with the safety or effectiveness of military operations. There is no statutory obligation for the local planning authorities to consult DE Safeguarding on developments outside Safeguarded areas. However, as it is now widely recognised that wind turbines may interfere with radar, communication aids and low flying anywhere in the UK, the Safeguarding team is routinely included in consultations.
<P>

<a name="20115w01.html_para1">Defence Estates Safeguarding section acts as a focal point to co-ordinate the MOD response to both informal proposals from the wind energy industry and formal planning applications from local planning authorities. There are 10 technical advisers within the MOD who are consulted by Defence Estates on wind turbines proposals, all of whom undertake the assessment of the impact of the proposals in addition to their operational duties.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Coherence and transparency between the two initiatives is very good and improvements achieved under either will be mutually beneficial. NATO experts have been closely involved with EU colleagues in work 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 2002 : Column 123W</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what action will be taken to improve the level of enabling forces and weapons which are required to meet the Petersberg Tasks prior to 2008; and if he will make a statement.  [26707]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Under the Helsinki Headline Goal, EU member states are to be able, by 2003, to deploy and sustain for at least a year up to 60,000 personnel, with air and naval support as necessary, capable of conducting the full spectrum of Petersberg Tasks.
<P>

<a name="20115w01.html_para2">At a Capabilities Commitment Conference in November 2000 and the further Capabilities Improvement Conference in November 2001, member states contributed a wide range of forces and capabilities to this target. Member states have also agreed to put in place a European Capabilities Action Plan to address remaining shortfalls based on voluntary efforts and building on existing national and multinational initiatives. This work is now being pursued under the Spanish Presidency.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what assessment has been made of the upper range of possible Petersberg Tasks; what consultation there has been with other EU countries on Petersberg Tasks since 1992; and if he will make a statement.  [26856]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The Petersberg Tasks, as defined at the Western European Council of Ministers in Bonn in June 1992 and subsequently adopted by the EU in the treaty of Amsterdam are: humanitarian and rescue tasks; peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking. It is impractical to define precisely the upper range of such operations, as this will change depending on the circumstances at the time. The work carried out since Helsinki to elaborate the requirements of the Headline Goal has included as a working assumption a potential use of EU-led forces to separate warring factions.

 Both HMS Ark Royal and Illustrious will continue in service into the next decade until the two new aircraft carriers enter service. HMS Invincible, the oldest ship of the class, will retire from service towards the end of this decade.

 The Ministry of Defence is working closely with a number of organisations to develop the Royal Navy's plans for the commemoration of the Battle of Trafalgar in 2005. Led by the Official Nelson Celebrations Committee, which brings together the interests of a wide range of maritime museums and associations connected with the Nelson heritage, a national and international programme of cultural and commemorative events is being discussed, among which a number of events involving the RN are being considered but, at this stage, it is too early to be precise.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what estimate his Department has made of the cost to its budget since 1 May 1997 of fraud; and if he will make a statement.  [27295]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w01.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The reported estimated cost to the Department of fraud since 1 April 1997 is &#163;4,666,853.
<P>

<a name="20115w01.html_para3">No abatement is made for subsequent recoveries. The figure relates to a combination of suspected and proven frauds and thefts with estimated values refined from time to time as investigations, sometimes lasting a year or more, reach a conclusion. A significant element of estimated cost or value in any given year relates to initial "at risk" estimates applied to suspected procurement fraud. The majority of these are resolved as "no crime" or have a proven value significantly lower than original estimates.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w02.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The opportunities for commercial development of West Freugh airfield in Wigtownshire have been assessed several times in recent years. In each case, it has been concluded that there are few commercial opportunities for development of the airfield.

<a name="20115w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence already has tungsten armour piercing rounds which are used by Challenger 2 tanks. The further purchase of tungsten ammunition has been proposed for the test and calibration firing of Challenger 2 tanks. Such a buy would have no effect on the use of depleted uranium rounds, since the rounds are used in different roles. The Charm 3 round, which incorporates a depleted uranium penetrator, is a war fighting round, while the tungsten rounds are used in the calibration of the Challenger 2 weapons system.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w02.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 There has been no change from the policy described in the DERA PPP consultation document published in April 2000. Our preference is to seek a flotation on the stockmarket as soon as QinetiQ's potential is suitably developed and as soon as we can ensure best value for the taxpayer. As identified in the consultation document, and subsequent statements on the way forward, we have kept open the option of seeking a strategic partner for the business as an intermediate step.
<P>

<a name="20115w02.html_para0">We have emphasised throughout this process that the precise timing and nature of the transaction will be dependent on value for money considerations and this continues to be the case.

<a name="20115w02.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hoyle: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence (1) how many special arrangements are in place to pay pensions to retired Gurkhas who are sick or disabled;  [27497]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will review the tri-partite agreement between the UK, India and Nepal to increase the pension paid to retired Gurkhas.  [27498]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the then Minister for the Armed Forces completed a thorough review of Gurkha pensions and gratuities only two years ago. The outcome was a significant improvement in the payments made as a result of a death in service, which brought death in service gratuities for Gurkhas to the level of comparable British Army service personnel, and increases to pension payments of at least 100 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20115w02.html_para1">Gurkha pensions are not paid at the same rates as British service men as the context in which they are paid is very different. Discharge in Nepal, and the link to Indian Army rates is the basis on which the Gurkhas serve. The levels of pension paid to our Gurkhas reflect the cost of living in Nepal, where they are discharged. Gurkha pensions now compare favourably to professional salaries there. They are also paid earlier than that of a British soldier. Gurkhas receive their pension at the end of their 15 years of service rather than the 22 years required of their British counterparts. In addition, up to 100 per cent. of the Gurkha pension can be passed on as a family pension to a soldier's widow until her death or remarriage and then to unmarried children up to the age of 25 years.
<P>

<a name="20115w02.html_para2">Sick or disabled Gurkha pensioners are able to nominate an individual, usually a family member or friend, to collect their pensions in cash from one of the 



<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 2002 : Column 126W</I><P>
three pension paying offices in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Itahari, or from one of the 24 Area Welfare Centres situated throughout Nepal. A significant number of sick and disabled Gurkha pensioners choose to receive their pension this way, but it is impossible to identify the precise number without making manual checks to over 25,000 pension records. The information could, therefore, be provided only at disproportionate cost.

 Scottish Executive Officers work internationally under the arrangements agreed in the Concordat on International Relations. The Framework for co-operation is between the devolved Administrations and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Accordingly, Scottish Executive Officers report to both. The FCO has assisted the Scottish Executive to set up an office in Brussels and has given five staff in Scottish Executive EU Office diplomatic status. The Scottish Executive Officer in the British Embassy in Washington also has diplomatic status.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary issued a strong statement on 24 November expressing his concern at the comments of the Zimbabwean Government spokesman which implied that foreign and local journalists were assisting terrorists. The British High Commissioner in Zimbabwe made formal representations to the Foreign Ministry in Harare on 26 November, and wrote to the Zimbabwean Foreign Minister the same day, expressing the British Government's deep concern at threats to the independent media in Zimbabwe.

 As well as failing to spend around $3.5 billion set aside by the UN for humanitarian purchases under "oil for food", the Iraqi Central bank consistently holds up delivery of $1 billion worth of goods already approved by the UN. The UN Secretary General has repeatedly drawn attention to Iraq's refusal to implement crucial UN proposals, such as the introduction of a local cash component, which would play a critical role in the rehabilitation of vital sectors, including water and sanitation and health. In his latest report on "oil for food" (November 2001), the Secretary General criticised the Government of Iraq for also obstructing the implementation of the programme in northern Iraq, by refusing to grant visas for UN personnel and clearance for essential supplies, including demining equipment, for the Iraqi people.

The position of the loan with Belize is under annual review. They have failed to qualify for debt relief under the Commonwealth Debt Initiative and are being asked to recommence payments.

For some developing countries, payments are being written off through the Paris Club for Official Bilateral Creditors. For countries qualifying for debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative, much of their Paris Club debt is written off. In December 1999, the UK Government announced that we would provide 100 per cent. debt relief on all ECGD debt for qualifying HIPC countries to free up more resources for poverty reduction.

 Official development assistance (ODA) per capita for all donors combined is given in the table. This shows a decline from US$14.1 in 1990 to a low of US$10.4 per capita in 1997, followed by a rise to US$11.0 per capita in 1999, the latest year for which figures are available.

 The Government are committed to the target of raising official development assistance to 0.7 per cent. of Gross National Income. Between 1974 and 1979 the proportion increased from 0.40 per cent. to 0.51 per cent. From 1980 to 1996 the figure fell to 0.27 per cent. Since 1996 we have raised official development assistance as a share of Gross National Income to 0.32 per cent. and are committed to reaching 0.33 per cent. by 2003&#150;04. Progress after that will be decided in the current and subsequent spending rounds.

We remain fully committed to the UN 0.7 per cent. ODA/GNI target. We have set out our plans for the years to 2003&#150;04 and, as these show, official development assistance as a proportion of GNI will rise to 0.33 per cent. in 2003&#150;04. Initial estimates of DFID expenditure for 2001 indicate that the ratio will remain around 0.32.<P>

GNI (Gross National Income) is the new name for GNP. The name has been changed to better reflect the information included within the figure.<P>

This increase in the amount of UK aid spent on the poorest countries is in line with the Government's policy, set out in the 1997 White Paper on International Development, to refocus our efforts on the elimination of poverty. Poorest countries are defined as having the lowest GNI/capita in the most recent year for which data are available (1999).<P>

 The UK has written off all its aid loans to the poorest countries. At 1 April 1997, outstanding aid loans of &#163;389,796,841 (principal &#163;341,629,947; interest &#163;48,166,894) owed by developing countries were included in DFID's accounts. By 31 March 2001, this figure had been reduced significantly to &#163;201,835,945 (principal &#163;192,833,981; interest &#163;9,001,964). Table 1 shows, by country, the balance of outstanding aid loans at 1 April 1997 and at 31 March 2001. Bilateral agreements have been reached with all the countries shown in italic on waiving scheduled payments as they become due.
<P>

<a name="20115w05.html_para1">Table 2 sets out, by country, the amount of principal Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) debt outstanding at 31 May 1997 and at 31 December 2001. The figures show a reduction in the residual balance from &#163;1.746 billion to &#163;1.355 billion respectively. Included in these figures are the debts owed by the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC), as shown in ECGD's accounts. However, under the Government's 100 per cent. bilateral debt relief policy, no further payments are required from these countries once they qualify for HIPC debt relief, and any amounts received are held in trust and, once they reach their HIPC Decision Point, are returned to the countries for poverty reduction.

 The value of debt and interest repaid on aid loans to the UK by the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) since 1983 is &#163;5.292 million. Details of the amounts repaid by these countries, by year, from 1 April 1983, are shown in the table.

The project is one of the first to incorporate an explicit focus on the livelihoods of fisheries-dependent communities. DFID have provided a lead to the FAO and planners in the countries of the region in the development of more effective methods and strategies for enhancing the livelihoods of poor people. DFID-led thinking and practice are having a wide influence on the policies and practices of FAO and others, including the International Fund for Agricultural Development, who are being assisted by the project to apply the livelihoods approach to other national fisheries programmes in the region.

 The sustainable livelihoods fisheries project is one of the first to adopt an explicit people- centred, livelihoods approach to fisheries-dependent communities. These communities are among the poorest in West Africa. As part of the project DFID is also seeking to influence FAO's own ways of working.
<P>

<a name="20115w06.html_para5">Livelihoods approaches are participatory and communities are involved in decisions affecting their livelihoods. It is not possible to give an exact figure of the number of meetings held. They occur as part of the processes of design, appraisal, management, monitoring and review. They take place at local, national, regional and international levels. They vary in financial cost to the project from zero (when, for example, a local community meets to discuss its priorities and plans) to several thousands of pounds (when, for example, managers and national representatives come together each year to take strategic decisions). The meetings are held to address the objective of the project, which is the improvement of livelihoods in poor fisheries communities.

 My Department does not make estimates of world population growth. We take careful account of the population statistics provided by the United Nations which indicate that world population grew from 5.7 billion in 1995 to 6.1 billion in 2001, and is estimated to grow to over 9 billion by 2050. It is also estimated that all of the projected growth will take place in developing countries, which by 2050 will account for over 85 per cent. of world population.

One of the priorities of my Department therefore is to help ensure that contraception is available to all men and women in the developing world who want it. 57 per cent. of the world's couples are now using contraception compared with 9 per cent. 30 years ago. Another of our major priorities therefore is to try to ensure that the millennium development goals of universal primary education by 2015, and gender equality in primary and secondary education by 2005 are achieved. Where this choice exists girls are more likely to receive an education, and go on to have fewer, healthier children.

 The Government currently have no plans to extend the current coal subsidy scheme, or to introduce a new scheme, beyond July 2002. However we are working to ensure that the new EU coal state aid regime from July this year gives us the flexibility to devise suitable schemes to aid the industry if that is ever appropriate. Once the new EU regime is in place, we will of course consider on its own merits any proposals for Government support that complies with the new rules.
<P>

<a name="20115w09.html_para0">We will also ensure that the new regime retains provisions to prevent subsidised coal from undercutting international prices, so that the UK coal industry cannot be disadvantaged with respect to its competitors in member states which may decide to pay continued aid.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the costs to small businesses of women taking statutory maternity leave.  [26051]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w09.html_spnew6"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 For most small firms, the probability of an employee taking maternity leave in any given year is low. For example, survey evidence suggests that only about a tenth of workplaces with 10 or fewer employees have anyone going on maternity leave in any given year.
<P>

<a name="20115w09.html_para1">Small businesses can recover 100 per cent. of the statutory maternity pay they pay out plus an additional amount to compensate for any associated employers' national insurance contributions they may have paid. Some small businesses, however, may choose to offer higher levels of maternity pay and longer periods of leave as a matter of good practice. Small businesses will also face costs in covering for the absent employee. The cost to any particular business will depend on the wage paid to the pregnant employee and how the business decides to cover for the absent employee.
<P>

<a name="20115w09.html_para2">The Government have published a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on the simplification of maternity leave which examines the likely costs of the changes to maternity leave which will be introduced in 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w09.html_spnew7"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Government's proposals to improve maternity leave and pay and introduce paid paternity leave have been the subject of extensive public consultation. These measures were put forward in the Green Paper "Work and Parents: Competitiveness and Choice" (published December 2000) to which we received over 600 formal responses. Further responses were received following the publication of framework documents in May 2001 outlining the operation of the schemes. During the public consultation period we received responses from individual employers of all sizes, employer representative groups including those specifically representing small employers, parents, and employee representative groups.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w09.html_spnew8"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The information is as follows:
<P>

<a name="20115w09.html_para4"><i>(a)</i> It is not possible to collect statistical data on the strength of individual cases. Any assessment of the merits of an individual case is necessarily subjective.
<P>

<a name="20115w09.html_para5">A working definition was used for the Regulatory Impact Assessment accompanying the Employment Bill based on the advice given to applicants, namely that a weak case was one where applicants had been advised by a solicitor or non-legal adviser that they would lose the case if it went to a hearing.
<P>

<a name="20115w09.html_para6">Data on the advice given to applicants are available from the 1998 Survey of Employment Tribunal Applications. This suggests that there were between 2 and 4 per cent. of applications where the case either went to a hearing, was withdrawn within two weeks of the hearing date, or dismissed or disposed of in some other way and where the applicant was advised that they would lose the case at hearing (either by a solicitor or by a non-legal organisation such as a Citizens Advice Bureaus or a trade union). A range is given because not all applicants sought advice and, in some cases, conflicting advice was given by different sources. Applying these percentages to the 2000&#150;01 level of applications would imply between 2,600 and 5,200 such cases.
<P>

<a name="20115w09.html_para7">This measure is based on cases where the applicant was advised they would lose the case at a hearing. In some of these cases, the tribunal may have upheld the application. On the other hand, these estimates do not include cases where there was a weak defence.

<a name="20115w09.html_para8"><i>(b)</i> Information on settlements does not identify cases which settle "close to the hearing date". Three quarters of cases settle or withdraw before the hearing, and ACAS conciliation leads to settlement in 38 per cent. of cases.

 We have not received any representations specifically on the administration costs of the Renewables Obligation. We have however received views on the cost to the consumers, domestic and industrial. We are expecting that the additional cost to the consumer will on average be, 4.4 per cent. in 2010&#150;11 over 1999 actual levels. The economic impact of the Renewables Obligation has been looked at in depth and we are proposing to phase it in gradually. The gradual implementation of this initiative has been planned to avoid major price hikes and to set an upper limit to the cost to both the industrial and the domestic consumer.

<a name="20115w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The new Renewables Obligation, to come into effect this year, together with exemption of renewables from the climate change Levy and continuing support under the non-fossil fuel obligation, will create a long-term market incentive for renewables expected to be worth over &#163;1 billion per year by 2010.
<P>

<a name="20115w10.html_para1">This will be underpinned by direct Government funding for renewables worth over &#163;260 million between 2001 and 2004 including an extensive capital grants programme for the early development of offshore wind and energy crops, the initial stage of a major photovoltaics demonstration programme and a boost for research and development.
<P>

<a name="20115w10.html_para2">In addition, on 1 November 2001 we published a consultation document in response to Ofgem's reports on NETA and its impact on smaller generators, including renewables and combined heat and power (CHP). Consultation closed on 1 December and follow-up work to analyse responses and take appropriate action is now under way. On 20 December I announced the formation of a working group to look at obstacles to consolidation under NETA, and to report to DTI by 31 January 2002. The Government will be publishing a response to their consultation shortly.
<P>

<a name="20115w10.html_para3">In addition, DEFRA are planning to issue their CHP Strategy shortly and that this will seek views on the measures needed to support the development of CHP.

 The Government currently have no plans to extend the current coal subsidy scheme, or to introduce a new scheme, beyond July 2002. The existing scheme has achieved what it set out to do, as eligible pits have been helped significantly to survive the very difficult price and structural threats they faced in 1999&#150;2001.
<P>

<a name="20115w10.html_para4">We are working to ensure that the new EU coal state aid regime from July this year gives us the flexibility to devise suitable schemes to aid the industry if that is ever appropriate. Once the new EU regime is in place, we will of course consider on its own merits any proposal for Government support that complies with the new rules.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on North Sea oil and how long it is estimated the reserves will last; what percentage of the UK's oil requirement comes from the North Sea; and how many jobs in Scotland depend on the North Sea oil industry.  [26610]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 North Sea oil has been a success story for the UK and the Government are determined, in partnership with industry through PILOT, to ensure its continued success. Detailed estimates of oil reserves on the UK Continental Shelf are given in the Brown Book (Development of UK Oil and Gas Resources 2001). The extent to which these reserves might be produced depends on a number of factors, including prices and costs relative to other oil producing areas. It is therefore difficult to make accurate predictions, but if all the discovered oil reserves given in the Brown Book were to be developed they represent some 11 years of production at rates in 2000. If in addition, estimates of as yet undiscovered reserves are also considered, UK oil reserves represent between 13 and 29 years production, although the upper estimate is unlikely. In practice, production levels will fall and reserves will last longer. Indeed, a PILOT target is to produce 3 Mboed (million barrels of oil equivalent per day) in 2010 against about 4.5 Mboed in 2000.
<P>

<a name="20115w11.html_para0">About 70 per cent. of UK oil production is exported and different grades of oil imported, so that UK crude accounted for some 46 per cent. of refinery throughput in 2000.
<P>

<a name="20115w11.html_para1">UKOOA, the offshore operators association, have estimated that some 118,800 jobs in Scotland depend directly and indirectly on the oil industry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w11.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Many organisations, both in the public and the private sector, contribute to economic regeneration. These bodies do not always specify what part of their budget is intended for regeneration, and where they do so there is no common definition of what is covered. Other previously existing organisations such as English Partnership and the Commission for New Towns covered a much wider area than the SEEDA boundaries, making it difficult at this late stage to disaggregate figures for the SEEDA area. For all these reasons it is not possible to provide figures in the form requested.




<P>

<P>

<a name="20115w11.html_para2">While numerous partnership and organisations are currently involved in economic regeneration at a local level within the region, SEEDA is the main region-wide organisation which actively promotes economic regeneration in the south-east.

Strictly speaking not all of this expenditure would be classed as "economic regeneration" as SEEDA's work among other things also involves skills, rural and community regeneration and social inclusion, however, all SEEDA's activities underpin economic regeneration within the south-east region.

Stalls are set up to provide additional and specialist information about a range of topics, including investments and accounts. The open days have been a huge success and several more are planned for the first quarter of 2002, including one in Cardiff.</FONT></UL>

<a name="20115w13.html_spnew14"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The Public Guardianship Office has a Key Performance Measure which applies to letters from hon. Members as well as from the general public. It currently requires 85 per cent. of letters to be responded to within 15 days of receipt. In the period 1 April to 30 November 2001 this target was exceeded and 91.9 per cent. of letters received a response before the target date. However, it is very unfortunate that the hon. Member's letter of 14 November was answered outside of this target, for which the PGO offers it sincere apologies.

In the period 1 April to 30 November 2001 this target was exceeded and 91.9 per cent. of letters received a response before the target date.

 The Lord Chancellor appoints to judicial office exclusively on merit.

<a name="20115w14.html_para0">The Lord Chancellor has already introduced a number of initiatives to encourage greater numbers to apply for judicial office and to secure equality of opportunity in the appointments process. For example, he has made information about the appointments procedures widely available, particularly through his website and the publication of the Judicial Appointments Annual Report; he applies the procedures flexibly in relation to age and sitting arrangements; he has introduced a work shadowing scheme which has proved to be very successful; he has reviewed the detailed criteria for appointment against which assessments of suitability are made; he is piloting a scheme to encourage applications from those who may think that their career progress to date understates their

<a name="20115w14.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 We have no plans to review the cost benefit criteria for public funding in civil cases, to which I understand the question refers. Funding is available subject to satisfying the financial conditions for funding and a funding assessment under the funding code. The funding assessment (or merits test) that has to be passed before funding can be granted already includes an assessment of the case's cost-benefit ratio. That is the applicant's own case; the merits of his or her opponent's case cannot be taken into account. However, it is inevitable that cost-benefit will change in some cases as matters develop, and an applicant's case needs to satisfy the funding assessment at all stages for funding to be retained. It would be impossible to devise a test that

<P><I>15 Jan 2002 : Column 175W</I><P>
prevented funding being lost during the life of a case if merits deteriorated to a point where it was no longer justified.

<a name="20115w16.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Helen Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to her statement of 17 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 7, on sex offenders, for what reason she has concluded that it is not in the interests of child protection to make people's names and addresses widely accessible in the community; and if she will make a statement.  [25515]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w16.html_spnew3"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The police already have and use the power to disclose information to members of the public about sex offenders in the community where, in their judgment, it is necessary to do so to prevent a crime from being committed. We believe, in common with the public protection agencies, that making information about sex offenders widely available would hinder child protection rather than helping it. Offenders subject to the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 would be less likely to comply with those requirements if they knew their details would be publicly available, and might be driven into hiding due to fear of vigilante action. Sex offenders in this situation would not then be subject to the inhibiting controls of the public protection agencies and, for example, would be less likely to undertake treatment due to a fear of being identified. As a result, they would pose a greater risk to children.




<P>
<P><I>15 Jan 2002 : Column 181W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20115w16.html_para5">This conclusion is borne out by the experience following the <i>News of the World's</i> sex offender campaigns in 1998 and 2000. The Association of Chief Officers of Probation provided anecdotal evidence about the effects of those campaigns, including that a number of high risk sex offenders lost contact with the public protection agencies; many others who were previously participating in treatment programmes stopped doing so for fear of being identified; a number of serious assaults on people who were mistaken for sex offenders took place; and the families, who in some cases had been the victims of sex offenders, were also assaulted and abused by members of the public. All these factors are deeply regrettable but perhaps the most regrettable potential consequence of community notification is that children will be placed at greater risk from sex offenders who are not complying with the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act.
<P>

<a name="20115w16.html_para6">The National Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) has also recently published a report on the community notification system in the United States (Megan's Law). That report concludes:

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many people are registered on the Sex Offenders List that have been found guilty of child abuse.  [26609]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 Until March 2001, data on the number of registered sex offenders were collated biannually on a national basis from the police national computer. However, this arrangement was overtaken by guidance issued by the Home Office in respect of the statutory provisions in section 67 of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000. The guidance requires information about the number of registered sex offenders in each police area to be published. This will take place from April 2002 and local systems are being put in place to deliver it. A collated report on the national situation should be available during the summer. However, until these systems are in place such information could be obtained only by a specific research exercise.
<P>

<a name="20115w16.html_para9">There is, in any case, no specific offence of child abuse as many sexual offences are capable of being committed against either adults or children. Indeed some sex offences against children are committed by children. The statistical information which will be required of Chief Officers of Police and Probation in relation to their work on Multi-Agency Public Protection Panels (MAPPPs) is one of the areas which are currently being developed.

<a name="20115w17.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 There are currently no reliable data about trafficking in people either nationally or internationally. The clandestine nature of the offence means that it is difficult to measure the extent to which the United Kingdom receives children trafficked for sexual and labour exploitation. However, there is no evidence to indicate that there is large-scale trafficking of children to the United Kingdom.

<a name="20115w17.html_para0">The United Kingdom is one of the strongest supporters of the International Labour Organisation's (ILO) Convention on the Elimination of the Worst Forms of Child Labour.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w18.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 No adjustments will be made to any local authority's settlement figures for 2002&#150;03 as a result of the abolition of the council tax benefit subsidy limitation scheme. Like other local authorities, Devon county council will no longer need to make, or include in its budget requirement, a contribution under the scheme for 2002&#150;03 or future years. It will therefore benefit from the abolition of the scheme. The figure of &#163;1.4 million is its contribution to benefit costs under the scheme in 2001&#150;02.

 The subsidy we are providing to assist people into home ownership is limited and has to be targeted in ways that best help our communities.

 Local authorities have submitted Asset Management Plans to Government as part of the first live round of the single capital pot during 2001. Each authority was asked to provide an estimate of its maintenance backlog for all assets&#151;housing, education, transport, office accommodation etc. No distinction was made between repair and maintenance for this purpose.

<a name="20115w19.html_para0">The response rate on the question of backlog was over 70 per cent. for counties, metropolitan districts and unitary councils, 57 per cent. for London boroughs and 24 per cent. for district councils. The average backlog for those authorities responding was used to produce an estimate for the whole population.

 The Guildford Direction Signs Demonstration Project trialled a series of measures aimed at improving the overall quality of direction signs and making them easier for drivers to follow. No formal report was published, but the lessons learned were incorporated into the new Traffic Signs Regulations and General Directions which came into force in 1994. Guidance on the correct use and design of signs was published in 1994 in Local Transport Note 1/94 "The Design and Use of Directional Informatory Signs" and 2/94 "Directional and Informatory Signs Interim Design Notes". The latter was superseded in 1997 by Chapter 7 of the Traffic Signs Manual "The Design of Traffic Signs". All were published by the Stationery Office.

 Listed building appeals involving Grade I and II* listed buildings are already decided by the Secretary of State rather than by planning inspectors. Other appeals involving listed buildings may also be recovered for decision by the Secretary of State at his discretion. Where appeals are determined by individual planning inspectors, however, I am satisfied that they are equipped to consider all relevant aspects of the case. It is for them to decide the weight that should be attached to the views of English Heritage and other consultees and to other material considerations in the light of all the circumstances of the particular case. We have no plans to change the current arrangements.

 The Department collects information about action by local authorities in England under the homelessness provisions of the 1985 and 1996 Housing Acts. In the third quarter of 2001, 30,910 households were accepted by local authorities as being eligible for assistance, unintentionally homeless and in a priority need category. The latest Statutory Homelessness Statistical Release, issued on 11 December 2001, presents these and other related figures up to the end of September 2001, and copies are available in the Library.

<a name="20115w22.html_para1">Concerted action by the international community is the key to addressing the problem. In the past few years the UK has supported and participated in counter piracy missions and seminars in "hotspot" areas sponsored by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO). Last year, through the IMO, we prepared codes of practice for the investigation of piracy incidents and the registration of "phantom" (stolen) ships. These codes have now been issued as circulars to all IMO member states and adopted at the IMO General Assembly. We continue to raise the matter in other international fora, including the United Nations General Assembly, to highlight the issue and raised the topic at ministerial level in areas where the problem continues to be of concern. We also meet the maritime industry on a regular basis to discuss how best we can continue to deal with the issue and whether there are any new ways of tackling the problem. We are currently reviewing the use of technical aids to counter piracy and will issue further advice to the industry when this is completed.

<a name="20115w22.html_para2">However, a lack of places on short training courses has meant that some officers have not been able to revalidate in time for the 1 February deadline. In December, with the support of industry and the officers' union NUMAST, the MCA issued an Advice Note that enables dispensations to be applied for up to 31 January 2002, with a maximum validity of up to 31 July 2002. These are issued under Article VIII of STCW 95, are ship specific, non-renewable and apply only to officers serving below the ranks of Master and Chief Engineer, enabling them to complete the necessary courses. The number of those applying for these dispensations will not be known until later in February.

The process involves a property advisory group, which includes representatives of the Rail Passengers Council, the Rail Freight Group and local authorities, advising the SRA on potential future use of sites for rail and other integrated transport uses. In this way sites with potential for future transport use are identified while surplus sites can be sold with proceeds re-invested by the SRA in support of its objectives. Where disused lines are in other ownership the local planning authority may restrict development which may prevent future re-opening.

 <i>[holding answer 11 January 2002]:</i> Local education authorities fund Statutory Youth Services directly. Their core client group is 13 to 19, although historically services will operate within the age range of 11 to 25. Therefore, upon reaching the age of 25 and over the persons involved would transfer to an adult education group. The Department does not issue guidance to local education authorities on the detailed delivery of its services.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if the proposed reduction in contribution by the governors of voluntary aided schools towards building costs is included in the broadly neutral reallocation of costs between governors, local education authorities and her Department; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w24.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 As part of our reform of the funding of premises work at Voluntary Aided (VA) schools, we are proposing that the governing bodies of those schools would be liable for capital work to virtually all of the school premises, excluding playing fields. This would replace the current complex set of arrangements for dividing liability between governing bodies and local education authorities (LEAs). The proposed new arrangements would provide greater flexibility in the way in which capital funds can be used, and lead to a substantial streamlining of the related administrative and funding processes.
<P>

<a name="20115w24.html_para2">Our estimate of the financial impact of the proposed changes takes account of the average initial and ongoing costs of providing and maintaining VA school buildings, and of how these costs would fall to the parties involved. Our estimates have demonstrated that most of the proposed increase in the standard rate of grant support&#151;from 85 per cent. to 90 per cent.&#151;would be required to meet the additional premises liabilities which would transfer from LEAs to VA school governing bodies.
<P>

<a name="20115w24.html_para3">Implementation of the reforms is subject to approval under the Regulatory Reform Act 2001. Further information on the proposals, including our overall assessment of cost neutrality, is provided in the Department's Statement which accompanied the proposed draft Regulatory Reform Order. Copies of the relevant documents are available in the House of Commons Library.

 The Schools Access Initiative provides resources to make mainstream schools accessible to pupils with disabilities and special educational needs. Over the three year period 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 we are investing &#163;220 million in the Schools Access Initiative. This is crucial to the Government's commitment to improving educational standards for all children and working towards a more inclusive approach for children with disabilities and special educational needs.

Under the new provisions, the FSA can impose financial penalties on, and publicly censure, those who abuse markets, including through misuse of information. The FSA can also now investigate and prosecute insider dealing offences under the Criminal Justice Act 1993.

The pre-Budget report contains projections of the public finances which show that the Government remain on track to meet both their fiscal rules over the cycle, including in the cautious case. The projections are consistent with a prudent interpretation of the stability and growth pact which takes into account the economic cycle, sustainability and the important role of public investment (as specified in Article 104 of the EU treaty).

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the reasons underlying the growth in the level of manual adjustments made by HM Customs and Excise to their modelled forecasts for receipts over the years from 1995&#150;96 to the present.  [26412]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w30.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Officials in HM Customs and Excise make manual adjustments to forecasts produced by economic models in consultation with officials from HM Treasury. The purpose of these adjustments is to provide more accurate forecasts of revenue receipts. This is conventional practice and such adjustments are made so as to capture events or trends that are not explicitly modelled, eg one-off events, such as the millennium celebrations; changes to the scope of the tax; changing tastes or new products.
<P>

<a name="20115w30.html_para2">The models for alcohol and petrol and diesel were re-estimated by Professor Marcus Chambers in 1999 (published as Government Economic Service Working Paper, Number 138). For most items the manual adjustments have been considerably reduced as a result.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer on what basis the Inland Revenue indexed the amount of state pension included in pension tax codes between 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01.  [26797]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w30.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 January 2002]:</i> The Inland Revenue does not routinely index the amount of state pension when it issues tax codes to pensioners before the start of the tax year. It bases the tax code on information provided to it by the Department for Work and Pensions (the Department of Social Security before June 2001) for individuals receiving the state pension, which takes into account the increase in the state pension that comes into effect in the new tax year. If for any reason the information is not provided by DWP, the estimated amount of state pension already included in the tax code is increased by reference to the appropriate percentage increase in state pensions as announced in the pre-Budget report.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer further to his answer of 17 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 32W, on Capital Gains Tax, what estimates for the Capital Gains Tax yield in <i>(a)</i> 2002&#150;03 and <i>(b)</i> 2003&#150;04 are used to derive the estimates for tax revenues contained in the pre-Budget report of November 2001; and if he will make a statement.  [25784]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w30.html_spnew10"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The available estimates of Capital Gains Tax receipts in years to 2002&#150;03 are given in Table B11 of the November 2001 pre-Budget report and receipts mostly relate to accruals of the previous tax year. Estimates for later years are highly dependent on assumed growth in asset values.

<P>
<a name="20115w30.html_spnew14"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Prescription and other national health service patient charges are outside the scope of VAT. NHS charges are not directly chargeable to income or corporation tax but NHS practitioners will be taxable on their income and profits in the normal way. It is not possible to separate tax revenue on NHS charges from tax revenue on other income.

<P>
<a name="20115w30.html_spnew15"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 Information on the full extent of charitable giving is not available from administrative sources. A study by the Charities Aid Foundation and the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) estimated that about 30 million adults in Great Britain gave to charities in the year 2000. A survey by NCVO/NOP suggested that this was worth nearly &#163;6 billion excluding legacies. There are also significant amounts of giving by companies. The cost to the Exchequer of donations under Deeds of Covenant, Gift Aid and Payroll Giving is estimated at &#163;525 million for 2000&#150;01.

<P>
<a name="20115w31.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The cost of any income tax relief for private medical insurance would depend on a number of factors including the type of relief given, the exact requirements for qualification for the relief, as well as the numbers of individuals or policies qualifying. Consequently it is not possible to provide the estimates requested.

Detailed analyses for 1998&#150;99, and analyses of related interest charges or penalties, are not available. The geographic analysis allocates yield to the office currently dealing with the relevant case: because of transfers of cases between offices that may reflect work done in a different large business office location.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what evidence he has on the effects of the rise in part-time employment on the level of demand for bank notes. [27443]<P>

 There could be some effect on the demand for money from labour market developments, such as the rise in part-time employment, although the levels of economic activity and prices, nominal interest rates and the inflation rate are usually viewed as more important. Contributory factors to the growth in part-time employment are assessed in Box B1, Annex B of the Financial Stateral and Budget Reportof FSBR 2001.

The National Statistician has been asked to reply to your recent question concerning household expenditure for the latest year for which figures are available. I am replying in his absence. (26615)
<BR>
Expenditure by households is published quarterly as part of the National Accounts in 'Consumer Trends', available on the ONS website at www.statistics.gov.uk/products/p242.asp. The year 2000 is the latest complete calendar year for which figures are available. The information on children's clothing and footwear is not separately available. An approximate allocation between adults' and children's goods may be made using more detailed information on average weekly expenditure published in "Family Spending 1999&#150;2000", Table 7.1.

 E-commerce of itself is unlikely to have significant short-term impact on the concept for tax purposes of corporate residence. However the UK tax authorities continue to be engaged in discussions at OECD, in consultation with the business community, on this and related e-commerce issues.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the tax lost to the Inland Revenue in each of the last four years as a consequence of tax planning by accountancy firms.  [26234]<P>

<P>
<a name="20115w34.html_spnew15"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Tax planning is a term commonly used to describe the organisation of financial affairs in an entirely lawful manner in order to minimise liability to tax. It is not really practicable to estimate the tax liabilities that would have arisen had accountants organised the affairs of their clients in a less efficient manner. Consequently, there can be no reliable measure of the tax lost to the Inland Revenue as a consequence of tax planning.

 About 1 per cent. of all beer consumed in the UK has been legitimately bought duty-paid in another EU country. The impact of changes to the rate of beer duty on this volume appears to have been negligible.

 Between 1990&#150;2001 and 2000&#150;01 beer clearances fell by 9 per cent. on the basis of alcohol content. The fall is likely to have resulted from numerous contributory factors which are not possible to attribute accurately.

 Full trade liberalisation could lift at least 300 million people out of poverty by 2015. Even diminishing protectionist tariffs in agriculture and in industrial goods and services by 50 per cent. would boost the world's yearly income by nearly 400 billion US dollars, a boost to growth of 1.4 per cent. Developing countries would gain 150 billion US dollars and a greater than average increase in GDP growth.

 The working families tax credit (WFTC) is a success in making work pay for families with children. At August 2001 WFTC was helping 1,270,000 families. This is 52 per cent. more families than were benefiting from family credit at its peak, and families were receiving on average around an extra &#163;35 per week.

<a name="20115w37.html_para1">Information on the number of hoax calls made to the London Ambulance Service (LAS) is not collected centrally. However, the LAS classify a hoax call as one where, on arrival of an ambulance crew or first responder, there is no patient to be found at the scene. The LAS recorded 391 such calls between the beginning of January and the end of November 2001. This figure represents less than 0.5 per cent. of the total workload for that period.
<P>

<a name="20115w37.html_para2">The LAS recognise that the majority of patients who dial 999 require some form of medical help or other assistance but also believe that, for many, their illness and injuries do not require an emergency ambulance to attend them. It is, however, extremely difficult to set a strict definition as to what constitutes an inappropriate call.
<P>

<a name="20115w37.html_para3">The LAS launched on 17 December 2001 a public education campaign to reduce the more blatant inappropriate use of the service by patients who could make their own way to an accident and emergency department or, in some cases, do not require hospital treatment at all. The campaign also highlights the fact that people should not phone the LAS for advice and so clog up the 999 call-taking system, but should instead be phoning NHS Direct or seeking advice from their GP.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2002]:</i> The national health service recipe book, issued in May 2001 as part of the better hospital food programme, requires hospitals to meet estimated average requirements for food energy, and reference nutrient intake for all other nutrients.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2002]:</i> Hospitals currently undertake surveys to gain feedback from patients on the standard of their catering services. However, these surveys are designed and implemented locally, do not take a consistent form and do not allow for comparisons to be drawn.
<P>

<a name="20115w38.html_para5">To address this, the better hospital food panel is developing a national patient catering survey. This will ask a range of questions which have been designed through detailed consultation with patients about the standards of service they expect and will complement the questions on catering which will be included in the national patient survey.

 <i>[holding answer 8 January 2002]:</i> The National Health Service Litigation Authority offers an indemnity to national health service bodies against employer and public liability risks where the relevant incident occurred on or after 1 April 1999. The authority handles those claims which have a potential liability in excess of certain amounts (&#163;10,000 for employers' liability and &#163;3,000 for public liability). In the calendar year 2001 (data available to 6 December 2001) the authority was notified of 2,244 claims made by employees and 732 claims made by third parties (not all of whom will be patients).

<a name="20115w38.html_para7">Loyd Grossman, who is the chairman of the panel, has provided his services free of charge since he became involved in the programme in September 2000, and continues to do so. His involvement stems from a real desire to help the national health service modernise and improve its catering services. Likewise, no other members of the panel are remunerated for their involvement.

A regime of this kind would give the public better assurances as to safety and quality as well as providing systematic information about the use of the product.

 The Town and Country Planning (General Development Procedure) Order 1995 requires a local planning authority to consult the Environment Agency before granting planning permission for development within 250 metres of land which is or has, at any time in the 30 years before the relevant planning application, been used for the deposit of refuse or waste. Guidance to the agency in Waste Management Paper 27 on Landfill Gas, published in 1991, contains guidelines on the proximity of new housing developments to landfill sites. These guidelines do not arise from European legislation and we have had no discussions with the European Commission about changes to the guidance.

 <i>[holding answer 17 December 2001]:</i> A Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) on the proposal for a Council Regulation (EC) on substances that deplete the ozone layer was undertaken in December 1998. It estimated that the total costs of compliance for business, charities and voluntary organisations would be &#163;370 million. The report put that figure in context by stating that under the then current EC Regulation (3093/94), it was estimated that end-users would make investments totalling &#163;4 billion spread over the next 10 to 15 years. The main effect of the new regulation would be to bring forward the timing of some of those investments.

<a name="20115w40.html_para10">The RIA did not estimate compliance costs for the extraction of ozone-depleting substances from the insulating foam in domestic refrigeration equipment as the draft proposal did not make it mandatory. It was not until June 2001 that the European Commission gave EU member states its final interpretation of the regulation that did require the recovery of controlled substances in the insulating foam of domestic fridges and freezers. My Department recently announced a payment of &#163;6 million to English local authorities to cover their costs of handling fridges and freezers until March 2002. We are urgently assessing the impacts of the regulation, including the costs, and will determine what further action is required beyond that.

The UK achieved its key objective of ensuring that the agreement would not impose fuel quality restrictions on fuel (diesel) used by non-road mobile machines (NRMM's) in advance of a full Commission review of the costs and benefits of such a measure. Council agreed conclusions in response to the Commission's communication on a strategy for dioxins, furans and polychlorinated biphenyls. The strategy proposes a number of actions aimed at preventing the formation and release of these substances; further identification of sources; establishment of indicators; and faster, cheaper measurement methods. Council broadly welcomed the Commission's approach, and asked for it to consider a number of options, including the setting of limit values for emissions under the integrated pollution prevent and control directive, improved measurement methods, and possible instruments for the control of non-industrial sources of emissions.

Council recognised that the review of existing active substances could not be completed within the current timetable of end of 2003. It therefore extended the period for the review to the end of 2008 but to only the end of 2005 for higher priority substances. Council also called on the Commission to cover a number of detailed issues in further work in this area including the proposed revision of the directive and a thematic strategy on pesticides.
<P>

<a name="20115w41.html_para10">The Commission presented a proposal for the revision of directive 96/82 (Seveso II), and a proposal for the revision of recovery and recycling targets in the directive on packaging and packaging waste. The Commission also gave progress reports on proposed directives on an EU chemicals strategy, recycling of batteries and accumulators and air quality limits for heavy metals in ambient air. The UK drew members states' attention to the problems for air quality posed by rising background levels of ozone precursors, and asked the Commissioner to consider what action was necessary.
<P>

<a name="20115w41.html_para11">Council also heard progress reports on a thematic strategy for the sustainable use of pesticides and on the revision of Regulation 2455/92 (trade in certain dangerous chemicals) which is necessary to enable the EC to become a Party to the Rotterdam Convention. There were also progress reports on the ratification of the Rotterdam Convention and the IMO Convention on TBT, and on Community implementation of the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety. The Commission also briefed Council on the progress of accession negotiations on the environment with the candidate countries.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w41.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 It is estimated that the disposal of liquid refrigerants, through high temperature incineration, costs approximately &#163;1&#150;2/kg. The cost will vary with the type of container and the size of the consignment. The volume of refrigerant is usually between 70&#150;300 grams depending on the size of appliance, although large air conditioning units can contain rather more refrigerant. This would result in a cost of between seven and 60p per unit.

 Under EC Regulation No. 2037/2000 all CFCs removed from waste appliances must be destroyed. The effect of Articles 9 and 10 of the waste framework directive is to require the disposal or recovery of waste to be carried out under the terms of a permit issued by the Environment Agency. The conditions set by the agency in these permits control matters such as the separation of different types of liquid extracted from waste appliances.

 There is no reason why commercial operators should refrain from refurbishing commercial refrigeration equipment.

 The number of plants required to recycle waste fridges and freezers in the UK will depend on a number of factors including: the capacity of individual plant (technology used), and the scale of exports of fridges and freezers to other member states for treatment.

<P>
<a name="20115w43.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 In the UK our concern about the effects of the bushmeat trade on endangered species led in early 1999 to our drawing the issue to the attention of the UK's Tropical Forest Forum, encouraging it to establish a UK Bushmeat Working Group. The group, supported with funding from the Department, brings together all those in the UK with an interest (Government Departments, conservation NGOs, the timber trade and others) and ensures that information on actions and opportunities for addressing the bushmeat problem is pooled and disseminated as widely as possible. We shall continue to support this initiative.
<P>

<a name="20115w43.html_para2">Internationally, many animals hunted and traded as bushmeat are listed in the appendices to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Any international trade in these animals, their parts or derivatives is therefore either banned completely or controlled by means of a permitting system. Due to increasing international trade in bushmeat and its impact on listed species, the Department raised the issue within CITES in April 2000. We were successful in our proposal that a CITES Bushmeat Working Group be established, and the Department provided &#163;55,000 towards this. To support the group's work we have commissioned research to analyse existing knowledge and expertise on the bushmeat trade in west and central Africa, highlight gaps in data and understanding, and make recommendations for further action. We intend presenting the results of this research to the next meeting of the working group. The CITES conference taking place in November 2002 will assess the group's progress and consider any further action required.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what percentage of land in the UK is covered by woodland; what measures are in place to increase the planting of trees and woodland in the UK; and if she will make a statement on the use of sink holes to absorb carbon dioxide and reduce emissions.  [26578]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w44.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Woodland cover in the UK stands at 11.5 per cent. We provide financial incentives to landowners to plant new woodland through the woodland grant scheme and the farm woodland premium scheme. These incentives and others, such as challenge funds, are targeted to meet our priorities and programmes for forestry.
<P>

<a name="20115w44.html_para0">Increasing the areas of sustainably managed forest and agriculture often has environmental benefits in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The contributions that these will make to meeting our 12.5 per cent. emissions reduction commitment under the Kyoto protocol and to our domestic goal to reduce CO <sub>2</sub>  emissions by 20 per cent. below 1990 levels by 2010, are described in "Climate Change&#151;the UK Programme" and in the "UK's Third National Communication" under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, published in November 2000 and 2001 respectively.

 <i>[holding answer 10 January 2002]:</i> All types of asbestos waste, including asbestos cement, have been classified as special waste in Great Britain since 1996 and in Northern Ireland since 1998. However there have been recent changes to the hazardous waste list, including the addition of asbestos cement on to the list. These were discussed between EU officials and my officials. We recognise the dangers posed by asbestos cement waste if it is not properly managed and supported the decision to reclassify it as hazardous waste.

 Applications for the processing and marketing grant, rural enterprise scheme and vocational training scheme under the England Rural Development Programme are all subject to detailed technical assessment to determine the quality and value for money of the proposed project. The assessment covers: the need for the project; project objectives, performance indicators and milestones; sustainability (economic, environmental and social); relevance to key policy themes and national and regional priorities; financial viability; the requirement for public funds; the quality of plans for project management and delivery and the management of key risk and variables associated with the project. The size of the project determines the depth of the assessment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20115w44.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Livestock markets were closed to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. Markets will be reopened as soon as the disease risk assessment allows. In the meantime, livestock producers have found other means of selling their stock and it will be for them and their organisations to decide on how they should best proceed when markets are again available. The costs and benefits of livestock markets is one of the issues we will be considering post-FMD and in the light of the inquiry reports.

<a name="20115w44.html_para9">The conference identified the need to develop a broad range of disease control options, based on science and including emergency vaccination, to meet particular circumstances. It was agreed that flexibility in the choice of methods of controlling and eradicating the disease and improved communications are required and that there is an urgent need for tests to differentiate between infected and vaccinated animals. The conference also considered ways of preventing future outbreaks, including tightening import controls at the European border.

Last year the EU Commission also published an informal paper on the possible future amendment of the sizing requirements. Our horticultural marketing inspectorate has consulted widely on this matter with growers' representatives and other interested parties. We will ensure that the views expressed by all stakeholders are taken into consideration in any future discussions.
