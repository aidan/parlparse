To ask the Attorney-General what proportion of criminal cases relating to the financial services sector referred to <i>(a)</i> the CPS and <i>(b)</i> the SFO resulted in charges being brought in each of the last three years.  [84089]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w01.htm_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 Neither the Serious Fraud Office nor the Crown Prosecution Service records case information by reference to the economic sector in which the activity giving rise to consideration of charges takes place. Accordingly, in order to answer the question, it would be necessary to undertake an individual review of all cases, which could be done only at disproportionate cost.

<P>

<a name="90518w01.htm_para0">The results are broadly consistent with the results for January, showing that concern amongst the public on this issue is still low. The results also show that those questioned are looking beyond the impact of the Bug on computers and are now considering the wider effects.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w01.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Bob Russell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many investigations have been held in the past year into reports of near misses by aircraft flying over the UK; how many were related to aircraft using the Clacton sector air corridor; whether an investigation is being made into reports of an incident on 7 May; what action he will take to prevent further incidents; and if he will make a statement.  [84035]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w01.htm_spnew3"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 All reported airprox incidents are fully investigated by the independent UK Airprox Board (UKAB). Information on the location of individual airprox incidents is not held in the form requested. In 1998, UKAB investigated 202 airprox incidents, slightly lower than at any time in the past decade, despite significant increases in traffic over that period. Up to 7 May 1999 there have been 66 incidents reported to the UKAB.
<P>

<a name="90518w01.htm_para1">The Civil Aviation Authority's Safety Regulation Group (SRG) is carrying out an investigation into the airprox incident which occurred on 6 May over Essex. Once completed, the SRG report will be passed to the UKAB for its review and assessment of the incident. UKAB will publish its findings. This will include an assessment of the degree of collision risk and any safety recommendations UKAB thinks it appropriate to make.

[84214]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w01.htm_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meale: </B> 
 According to Entrust, &#163;162.4 million was awarded to environmental bodies as at 13 May 1999 and 10 per cent. of this total is a voluntary donation from landfill operators and not refunded through the landfill tax credits.

[84105]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w01.htm_spnew5"><B> Ms Armstrong: </B> 
 The Commission operates a quality control review process to monitor the performance of auditors and to ensure they comply with its Code of Audit Practice, which is issued under section 4(1) of the Audit Commission Act 1998 and approved by Parliament, and with professional auditing standards. The Commission reviewed the work of the District Auditor's investigation of Westminster City Council designated sales on a number of occasions, most recently in April 1996.

 The Audit Commission is required to balance income with expenditure taking one year with another.

[84117]
<P>

 In the past two years the CAA has received 12 reports of aircraft arriving at UK airports with fuel levels below the prescribed minimum.
<P>

<a name="90518w02.htm_para0">The international standard for minimum fuel levels is contained in Annex 6 to the Chicago Convention. This requires that an aircraft should arrive at its destination airport with enough fuel to make an approach to land, carry out a missed approach, fly to an alternate airport, hold for 30 minutes and carry out the subsequent approach and landing. The aircraft should also carry a contingency reserve specified by the relevant national aviation authority. The breaching of minimum fuel levels does not immediately place an aircraft in danger.

We will be introducing amendments in the Lords which will update the scheme and help maintain its stability. For the statutory reserve scheme the start and finish times will be brought up to date and the arrangements for determining costs will be clarified. We also plan to give the boroughs powers to set up a statutory joint committee dealing with concessionary fares, which will have the option of taking decisions on the basis of qualified majority voting.

 KPMG is currently undertaking an investigation of local air pollution control regime costs in England and Wales commissioned by the Welsh Office, the Department of Trade and Industry and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions. The final report of the study, which will be completed in July, will inform our decisions on charging levels for 2000-2001 and any structural changes in 2001-2002 in England. Local authority and trade associations will be consulted on all proposed changes.
<P>

<a name="90518w02.htm_para5">The future level of local air pollution control charges in Wales will be a matter for the National Assembly.

<P>
<a name="90518w03.htm_spnew9"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 The available information shows that all of the 14 curfewees referred to in the reply given on 27 April 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> columns <i>110-11</i>, remained on curfew until the end of their home detention curfew period. They would remain liable to breach action after that date. However, information about cases dealt with after the expiry of home detention curfew is not held centrally.
<P>

<a name="90518w03.htm_para11">The Government recognise the need to expedite breach action in such cases. It is for that reason that Section 103 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 was implemented on 1 January 1999. This will mean that a curfewee whose original offence was committed on or after 1 January 1999 and who commits an offence during the home detention curfew period will be liable to immediate recall by the Secretary of State.

 I am aware of Iraqi claims that recent actions in the no-fly zones have caused civilian casualties and killed livestock on 29 and 30 April and again on 12 May. If these claims are true the casualties are deeply regrettable. Civilians and civilian property are never deliberately targeted by coalition pilots. Their mission (in support of UNSCR 688) is to prevent Saddam's air forces from persecuting the Kurds and Shia Muslims of northern and southern Iraq. The military action undertaken in the no-fly zones in recent months has been in response to Iraqi attempts to shoot down or otherwise threaten aircraft and kill aircrew.

<P>
<a name="90518w08.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 May 1999]:</i> Funding of &#163;11.1 million was provided under the Voluntary Rationing Scheme (VRS) in 1998-99. This expenditure supported 1,036 VRS repair projects and 739 VRS capital projects. Funding for VRS repair grant was available to Voluntary Aided schools throughout 1998-99. However, due to an unusually high demand in the early part of the year, funding for VRS capital work was not provided between 27 August 1998 and 31 March 1999.
<P>

<a name="90518w08.htm_para3">The Voluntary Rationing Scheme is one of a number of largely demand led elements in the overall provision of grant to governing bodies for building work at Voluntary Aided schools. The amount available in any year depends on the total demand for grant for all types of capital and repair work at these schools. Funding for VRS capital will be monitored closely throughout 1999-2000 and schools

<P><I>18 May 1999 : Column: 312</I><P>

<a name="90518w08.htm_para4">In 1999-2000, the total budget for the provision of grant towards the governors' liabilities for building work at Voluntary Aided schools is &#163;121 million.

Of the &#163;121 million available for 1999-2000 some &#163;17 million has provisionally been set aside for demand led elements such as the Voluntary Rationing Scheme.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to establish a specialist nurse service for multiple sclerosis patients along the lines of the breast care nurse scheme.  [83362]
<P>

<P>
<a name="90518w10.htm_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Department currently has no plans to establish a specialist nursing service for multiple sclerosis patients. We welcome the spirit of partnership with the voluntary sector shown by the recently launched Multiple Sclerosis Society initiatives to jointly fund nursing posts for patients with MS. It is, however, for the National Health Service locally to decide whether to pursue this initiative in the light of their local needs and priorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what assessment he has made of the demands on the health service arising from Kosovar refugees arriving in the United Kingdom; and if he will make a statement;  [83737]
<P>
<UL>(2) what percentage of Kosovar refugees he estimates will need NHS <i>(a)</i> primary care and <i>(b)</i> hospital treatment within one month of arrival;  [83738]

(3) if he will meet the Secretary of State for the Home Department to discuss what account should be taken of existing health authority waiting lists in determining where Kosovar refugees are placed.  [83739]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w10.htm_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary announced in the House on 5 May 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 943, that the United Kingdom is prepared to give temporary protection to several thousand refugees from Kosovo. The National Health Service is expected to play its part in preparing for this and stands ready to do what is necessary to identify refugees' health problems and provide appropriate treatment.
<P>

<a name="90518w10.htm_para0">For the majority of refugees, individual health problems are not known until they are examined, either on arrival or soon afterwards. All refugees are being registered with a general practitioner as a matter of course. So far, more than 900 people have arrived in the UK, and experience suggests that many of those still to come will have primary healthcare needs, either now or in the near future and a few will need hospital treatment.




<P>
<P><I>18 May 1999 : Column: 318</I><P>

We have also agreed to accept a small number of priority medical cases, with their immediate family members, who meet the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' criteria for medical evacuation. No such cases have been received so far. We anticipate that careful selection of UK hospitals for any priority patients that do come will ensure that any impact on existing NHS waiting lists is kept to a minimum.

 We expect to be in a position to seek views from organisations and companies interested in the provision of the Domiciliary Oxygen Therapy Service once forthcoming guidelines from the Royal College of Physicians have been published. The timetable and the extent to which the review's conclusions will be made public are currently being considered.

To emphasise this point, a joint letter signed by the Chief Medical Officer and the President of the Royal College of Psychiatrists has been sent to all Consultant Psychiatrists in the NHS, all health authorities and NHS trusts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w11.htm_wqn5"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, what were the reasons for the real terms increase in expenditure on bishops listed in the Church Commissioners' last annual report.  [84187]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w11.htm_spnew5"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The Commissioners' expenditure on bishops falls into three distinct categories: stipends, working costs and housing costs (diocesan bishops only).
<P>

<a name="90518w11.htm_para3">Bishops' stipends (pay) increased in line with the stipend increase recommended for parish clergy. From 1 April 1998, the stipend of a diocesan bishop was &#163;27,660 and the stipend of a suffragan bishop was &#163;22,740. The Commissioners' expenditure on bishops' stipends rose by &#163;0.2 million, from &#163;2.5 million in 1997 to &#163;2.7 million in 1998.
<P>

<a name="90518w11.htm_para4">Bishops' working costs increased by &#163;0.7 million, from &#163;8.1 million in 1997 to &#163;8.8 million in 1998. Staffing costs account for most of these working costs. The average increase in the Average Earnings index in 1998 over 1997 was 5.1 per cent. Other factors contributing to increased expenditure in 1998 included &#163;0.4 million in the Lambeth Conference, which takes place every 10 years, and the updating of office equipment for bishops and their staff.
<P>

<a name="90518w11.htm_para5">Expenditure on diocesan bishops' housing increased by &#163;0.4 million, from &#163;2.6 million in 1997 to &#163;3.0 million in 1998. Spending on these houses can change significantly from year to year depending on the works needed. It tends to be higher when the See becomes vacant, as the opportunity is taken to complete works when a bishop is not living there. There were still costs being met in 1998 relating to the large number of new diocesan bishops in the last three years. A change in the calculation of depreciation of See houses, and improvements to the working environment of bishops' staff, were also special factors in 1998.
<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w11.htm_wqn6"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the hon. Member for Middlesbrough, representing the Church Commissioners, how many and what percentage of bishops had use of a chauffeur at May (i) 1997, (ii) 1998 and (iii) 1999; and what was the total cost in current prices for each appropriate financial year.  [84188]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w11.htm_spnew6"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 In 1997, 31 bishops employed full or part-time drivers at a cost of &#163;336,741. At 1 May 1998, 31 bishops employed drivers, and the cost of their employment in 1998 was &#163;337,807. Costs for 1999 are not yet available but at 1 May 1999, 27 bishops employed drivers. The hon. Member may wish to refer to the answer my predecessor, Mr. Michael Alison, then the right hon. Member for Selby, gave to Mr. Harry Greenway, the then hon. Member for Ealing, North. In 1995, 31 bishops employed drivers, and the cost of their employment was &#163;334,000, 24 February 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>65</i>.
<P>

<a name="90518w11.htm_para6">The retail prices index has moved from 146.0 in January 1995 to 160.0 and 164.4 in December 1997 and 1998 respectively (January 1987 = 100), from which it will be seen that the real costs of bishops employing drivers have fallen since 1995. Bishops have increasingly been making use of part-time drivers.

<P><I>18 May 1999 : Column: 323</I><P>

<P>

<a name="90518w11.htm_para7">27 out of 44 diocesan bishops employ a full or part-time driver. In addition the 70 suffragan or assistant bishops drive themselves or occasionally receive some special assistance when they are not able to do so, e.g. because of a disability.

<P>
<P>

Expenditure on a house tends to be higher when the See becomes vacant, as the opportunity is taken to complete works when a bishop is not living there.
<P>

<a name="90518w11.htm_para11">Spending on bishops' housing is subject to close budgetary control. Repairs to buildings are limited to the minimum that the Commissioners feel is consistent with the proper maintenance of these properties in their care. The Commissioners have nearly completed their review of the suitability of all diocesan bishops' houses (suffragan bishops' houses are owned by the diocese) and in many cases steps have been taken to reduce long-term running costs.

 The UK made a &#163;10 million grant commitment in March 1998 to a Millennium Bug project managed by the World Bank through InfoDev. InfoDev is a multi-donor funded programme set up to promote the increased use of information and communication technologies in developing countries. To date, &#163;6 million has been paid into the project and further sums will be released this year, as disbursements are made by the Bank.
<P>

<a name="90518w12.htm_para0">Following the UK's lead in supporting this project, others have made substantial grant commitments, including the US ($12 million), Canada ($0.7 million), Sweden ($1.26 million), Italy ($0.3 million), and The Netherlands ($3.5 million). The total international commitment to the project presently stands at $34.2 million.
<P>

<a name="90518w12.htm_para1">The Project has produced an information guidance document, "Year 2000 Toolkit--A National Plan for Developing Countries", which has been disseminated world-wide through 18 regional and country conferences undertaken throughout 1998, attended by some 120 developing countries. Participants consisted of senior government officials and information technology managers. The document is available on the internet.
<P>

<a name="90518w12.htm_para2">The Project also provides grants to assist developing countries prepare national action plans and to support work on systems of critical national importance. So far, a total of 84 developing countries are included in the grant arrangements, mainly to help them prepare national action plans, for which grants of up to $100,000 have been provided. Larger grants are available to help with remediation and testing work. Grant applications presently total about $15.7 million.

 <i>[holding answer 28 April 1999]</i>: We have on a number of occasions, along with EU partners, called for the urgent establishment of a permanent UN presence in East Timor to help prevent further violence in the territory. We welcome the agreement signed by Indonesia and Portugal in New York on 5 May whereby a United Nations presence will supervise the consultation of the East Timorese on the question of autonomy. We are working with others on arrangements for the deployment of an international police presence in East Timor to oversee implementation of the 5 May agreement.

<a name="90518w14.htm_spnew7"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We have issued the following guidelines to overseas posts:
<P>

<a name="90518w14.htm_para2"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"1. The Government's White Paper on Tobacco, presented to Parliament in December 1998, contained the following sentences concerning the role of Posts overseas:
<P>
<BR>
"We are not in the business of banning the production or export of tobacco products, and the DTI and our embassies will continue to provide advice, to which UK companies are entitled, in the sale of legal products. However, in keeping with the current practice of Ministers and officials not becoming involved in the advertising or promotion of tobacco products at home, guidelines will shortly be issued to our diplomatic posts instructing them to be scrupulous to ensure that they follow suit overseas, taking into account local circumstances."
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90518w14.htm_para3"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Guidelines:</i>
<P>
<BR>
2. Posts must no longer directly promote products containing tobacco, whether through advertising or through publicly associating HMG with their sale, especially where this might be misconstrued as some form of government endorsement or approval of them. However, given the general, non-discriminatory basis of British Trade International services and other UK government support for business--which, as a matter of principle, are available to all British companies, provided their products are mainly of UK origin and are legal--Posts should nonetheless, if approached, offer support and advice to assist UK tobacco companies through the provision of trade, investment and political information. While it may be true that such companies rarely, in any case, seek HMG assistance in their exporting effort, it will be important that Posts scrupulously adhere to these new guidelines, after taking into account local circumstances. Posts should bear in mind that the international tobacco control lobby is increasingly well organised, and pressure groups may seek to highlight any apparently controversial involvement in any event sponsored by a tobacco company.
<P>
<BR>
3. It follows from the above that Posts should not inter alia be associated in any way with the promotion of the tobacco industry, for example by accepting advertisements for UK or local tobacco products in publications issued by the Post, or sponsorship from tobacco companies for their activities, including Chevening Scholarships. Nor should they attend or otherwise support receptions or high profile events--especially those where a tobacco company is the sole or main sponsor--which are overtly to promote tobacco products, such as the official opening of a UK tobacco factory overseas; events where tobacco sponsorship is more low-key (for example, among several sponsors of a visiting orchestra) can be attended. Posts may also continue to offer assistance to UK tobacco companies in other ways, such as in resolving business problems--customs or port clearance, smuggling, trademark violations etc--that are potentially discriminatory. They may also provide information and assistance on foreign country policies and investment opportunities including advice to help them comply with foreign government laws or regulations.
<P>
<BR>
4. In short, unless otherwise specified above, Posts should not support activities designed specifically to encourage smoking. Posts have the delegated authority to decide for themselves whether any proposed action on their part is in keeping with these new regulations, but may refer to London for decision--to the FCO geographical department (if there are political implications) or JEPD--where this is felt necessary.




<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>18 May 1999 : Column: 334</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
5. The White Paper also stressed the Government's wish to encourage and support the efforts of other countries to strengthen their own tobacco control strategies. Requests for help, particularly with expertise, should be passed to the Department of Health (Health Promotion Division).
<P>
<BR>
6. These guidelines will take effect from 1 June 1999."

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer, pursuant to his answer of 26 April 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>56</i>, concerning HM Customs and Excise staff at Heathrow, since 1 May 1997 in relation to Customs Cargo staff other than NIS at Heathrow, how many jobs have been lost in Customs Cargo; what is the reduction in staff of the import control teams; what steps are being taken to combat the increase in traffic of the undeclared excise goods from the Continent; how HM Customs and

 <i>[holding answer 17 May 1999]:</i> There are currently 222 staff years allocated to the Cargo Division at Heathrow. In Customs Cargo at Heathrow the following reductions have been made in staff since 1997:

<P>
<BR>
Year to March 2000--15 staff years (6.2 per cent.).

<a name="90518w15.htm_para3">Of these reductions the following numbers were involved in import control:

<P>
<BR>
1999--0
<P>
<BR>
2000--8.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="90518w15.htm_para5">The reductions in the current year have been made to reflect the movement of freight control inland as a result of the take up of Customs Freight Simplified Procedures (CFSP). The percentage of import entries at Heathrow now being processed via the CFSP system is 41.8 per cent.
<P>

<a name="90518w15.htm_para6">The increase in traffic of undeclared excise goods from the continent is being addressed in a number of ways. During the last financial year a special exercise was run, under Customs risk testing programme, to target tobacco goods in freight. The exercise produced &#163;53.085 in revenue over six weeks, of which all but &#163;300 was for tobacco goods. The results of that exercise have been fed into Customs ongoing risk review. This will provide sharper and more focused targeting of staff onto those freight consignments and importers that are considered a risk to the revenue, together with better intelligence in trend analysis and identification.
<P>

<a name="90518w15.htm_para7">DTI documentary checks and CAP control checks are subject to computer-based selection profiles. Community transit and anti-counterfeit checks are carried out by import and export control staff as part of their normal scrutiny and examination roles, using intelligence and risk analysis techniques to target resources effectively.
<P>

<a name="90518w15.htm_para8">The estimated revenue loss from failure to detect undeclared excise goods at Heathrow Cargo is not known as all current estimates specifically exclude freight consignments. The revenue estimated as lost nationally through cigarette smuggling by air passengers is &#163;50m per year. Further details on cross-border shopping and smuggling of alcohol and tobacco products were laid in the House of Commons Library on 19 November 1998.

<P>
<a name="90518w15.htm_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In his Budget speech of 9 March, the Chancellor explained that in terms of the turnover of criminals' tobacco smuggling is now a &#163;1&#189; billion business. That was an assessment by HM Customs and Excise based on their work in progress to monitor the scale of such smuggling (chiefly of cigarettes and

hand-rolling tobacco). The provisional results of this work indicate that the total amount of revenue (excise duty and VAT) evaded in 1998 was perhaps around &#163;1.7 billion.
<P>

<a name="90518w15.htm_para9">Forms of tobacco duty evasion covered by this assessment include cross-Channel smuggling of cigarettes and hand-rolling tobacco, smuggling by air passengers, diversion frauds and smuggling over very large consignments in freight.
<P>

<a name="90518w15.htm_para10">HM Customs and Excise will continue to examine ways of measuring such smuggling, and are discussing with representatives of the tobacco industry ways of improving the methodologies used.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90518w15.htm_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The forecast for tobacco revenue receipts for 1999-2000, published in the March 1999 Financial Statement and Budget Report, is &#163;7 billion. This takes into account a range of factors including smuggling, forestalling behaviour by manufacturers, the affordability of tobacco products, trends in public health awareness, etc.
