Also excluded is land that was previously developed but where the remains of any structure or activity have blended into the landscape in the process of time (to the extent that it can reasonably be considered as part of the natural surroundings), and where there is a clear reason that could outweigh the re-use of the site&#151;such as its contribution to nature conservation&#151;or it has subsequently been put to an amenity use and cannot be regarded as requiring redevelopment.&#148;</p>

Disposable income (equivalent to "net income") equals gross income less deductions for income tax and National Insurance contributions.  3. The income measure used was the joint disposable income of the HRP plus partner (if any) and not "household income". This is because, whilst there might be other income earners in the household, the HRP and spouse alone will generally have responsibility for paying the rent&#151;so their joint income was considered to be the more appropriate income measure.  4.

Net rents were considered more appropriate for comparison with disposable incomes.  <i> Source:</i>  Department for Work &amp; Pensions: Family Resources Survey, 2004-05<br>

 Choice-based lettings schemes use a variety of media to advertise available vacancies, including websites, newspapers, free sheets, property shops and telephone services. Adverts will include brief details about the property and may include details about the area. In addition, schemes will usually publish feedback information for each advertised property that has been let, such as the number of bids received and the priority level of successful applicants, to help home seekers make judgments about which properties to bid for in future.</p>

The locality adjustment factor is a logarithmic variable applied to each of approximately 10,000 localities. Every locality has a locality adjustment factor derived from the average value, and average size, of dwellings in the locality at a required point in time.</p>

 The Government's view then, as now, was that the Taliban and other illegally armed groups do not pose a long-term strategic threat to Afghanistan, though they do represent a significant impediment to the country's near-term reconstruction, particularly in the south.

 The fit for task figure provides a quarterly measure of all trained personnel that are considered medically fit for the task they were posted to their ship/unit/station to perform. It is the balance of the trained strength that is not medically downgraded. It is important to note, however, that the majority of medically downgraded personnel remain fit enough to work in some other capacity. For example, for the first quarter of year 2006-07 whereas 94.5 per cent. 83.7 per cent. and 90.2 per cent. of Royal Navy, Army and RAF personnel respectively were fit for task, only approximately 0.5 per cent. in each Service were considered unfit for any military duties. The remainder were not fully fit for task, but still fit to work in some other capacity.</p>

 The process to close military hospitals began in 1994 because they no longer had sufficient patient volume and case mix to develop and maintain the skills of our medical personnel. To meet this training need we have established Ministry of Defence hospital units (MDHUs) located within NHS hospitals at Derriford, Frimley Park, Peterborough, Portsmouth and Northallerton, and the Royal Centre for Defence Medicine within the University Hospital Birmingham Foundation Trust (UHBFT) in Birmingham.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_96"><a name="60904w0012.htm_para9"><a name="06090621000386">The integration throughout the NHS trusts of service personnel in those specialisms which are required on deployed operations enables Defence Medical Services staff to take advantage of NHS expertise and to maintain their own clinical skills in an active, up-to-date environment. Additionally, treating Service patients within the NHS trusts which host MDHUs provides the most effective means of giving the UK armed forces benefit from the latest advances in medical treatment and the recent investments in NHS facilities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_97"><a name="60904w0012.htm_para10"><a name="06090621000387">In the last two years, enhanced command and control structures have been introduced. Each MDHU now has a dedicated command team. This has improved administrative, business and training functionality and enables clinical staff to concentrate on honing their professional skills, both medical and military. Although service staff work in a NHS environment, military ethos is maintained through regular collective events. Military uniform is worn by all command and serving administrative staff and also by clinical staff, except where duties require specific clinical dress. Clinical staff have their working time apportioned between &#147;Trust Protected Time&#148; and &#147;Military Protected Time&#148;. The former guarantees sufficient clinical exposure to maintain standards, while the latter ensures that service operational and training requirements are met.</p>

Records indicate that DESO made arrangements for Ethiopian officials to visit the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) and Hunting Engineering (now Insys) in March 1997. Subsequently, DERA won contracts for project management advice on the upgrade programme. We have found no evidence of discussions involving the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency of the US Government. Nor have we found any record of actions by Hunting Engineering connected with the programme for which the approval of the Ministry of Defence was required.</p>

 Much of the RAF data were transferred from legacy systems to JPA by a team of RAF clerks to ensure that data input was effectively controlled. Wherever possible, data are input by using lists of values contained in drop-down menus which reduces the opportunity to input data incorrectly. Free text boxes are used in only a handful of scenarios where drop-down menus are deemed to be inappropriate. Where errors have been identified in data transferred from legacy systems the individual is encouraged to amend the details either through the self-service facility or though unit HR staff.

 We have received three requests from the House of Commons Defence Committee for information and evidence on the future of the UK&#146;s strategic nuclear deterrent. In response, we produced an initial memorandum, which was published on 20 January 2006. My predecessor also discussed this issue with the Defence Committee in some detail on 1 November 2005, as did I during my introductory session on 11 July this year. We have provided a detailed and substantive response to the Committee&#146;s first report, which was published on 26 July this year, and will continue to do all that we can to support future inquiries by the Committee in this area.</p>

 As part of the operational welfare package, personnel serving on operations overseas are allowed 20 minutes of free telephone calls each week to anyone anywhere in the world. The financial allowance for people serving in non-operational locations overseas includes an element that is intended to cover the difference between the cost of 20 minutes of telephone calls in their location and the cost in UK.</p>

<p>The number of current and former service personnel treated by the NHS for mental health conditions since the beginning of the operation in Iraq is not known. Similarly, details of personnel who have been discharged as a result of a mental health condition that can be attributed specifically to service in Iraq and whose continued medical care has therefore been transferred to the NHS is not held centrally and to obtain it would require the examination of the individual medical records of every patient. These can only be viewed for non-clinical reasons with the express consent of the individual concerned, to protect patient confidentiality.

 The Royal Navy, Army and Royal Air Force personnel staffs who answer such requests work to the same guidance and criteria in discharging MOD's duty to process personal data fairly and in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. Key issues include whether the subject of the record is alive; whether the next of kin are making or are aware of the request; and the precise nature of the information held and requested. This inevitably involves case by case consideration of often complex circumstances. A number of reports of apparently inconsistent outcomes have led officials to launch a review with the aim of providing more detailed guidance on the release of information from service records. I will write to the hon. Member when that work is complete, which I expect to be before the end of the year.</p>

 A review of surface ship support arrangements concluded that the best way of achieving a sustainable, efficient and affordable surface ship support market for the future would be through the formation of an alliance. This was announced on 14 February 2006 and we are now working to take this forward. Agreement was reached in principle shortly after the announcement with the prospective Surface Ship Support Alliance (SSSA) partners (Devonport Management Ltd., Babcock International Group and Fleet Support Ltd.) on the work-share for the autumn 2006 upkeep packages. These packages of work will not be contracted under the yet-to-be-agreed alliance umbrella, but will instead form part of an initial test of principle for the alliance concept. Subject to affordability and this work continuing to offer best value when set against the Department&#146;s other priorities, it is intended to enter into contracts within the next few months.</p>

 The information requested could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Senior civil servants&#146; travel is conducted in accordance with the Home Office guidance which makes clear that Air Miles should be used only for official purposes or else foregone. However, if it is impracticable to use the benefits for Government travel, there is no objection to senior civil servants donating them to charity if this is permissible under the terms of the airline's scheme and the charity is one chosen by the airline.</p>

 The fourth national Alcohol Misuse Enforcement Campaign (AMEC 4) ran from 8 May to 8 June. The results from this campaign will be released shortly. Previous AMECs have been shown to be very effective in dealing with alcohol-fuelled crime and disorder, including town-centre violence and under-age sales of alcohol. Early indications are that AMEC4 saw the highest-yet level of activity by the police and trading standards officers. One of the purposes of AMEC4 was to set the tone of acceptable behaviour during the World Cup competition, and the relatively low level of disorder seen during the competition is testimony to its effectiveness.</p>

This includes ensuring that victims, witnesses and the community are aware of any ASBOs in force in their area. Publicity also helps the community to police such orders, acts as a deterrent to other potential offenders, and increases public confidence that local agencies are able to deal effectively with this type of problem.

Code C issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 states (at paragraph 13.1) that chief officers of police are responsible for ensuring appropriate arrangements are in place for people who cannot speak English and provides that interpreters should be drawn from the National Register of Public Service Interpreters. There exists more detailed national guidance regarding interpreters in the criminal justice system and this is currently under review by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, with the Association of Chief Police Officers and other interested parties. The National Register of Public Service Interpreters is maintained by a not-for-profit limited company, which is a subsidiary of the Chartered Institute of Linguists. I understand that there are 120 Arabic interpreters on the current Register and that many of these are available to work in more than one police area.</p>

Work on development of robust solutions using gait recognition is relatively recent and the Home Office is aware that one of the premier centres of research in the field is in the UK at Southampton University. It is recognised that automatic gait recognition has potential to support systems that protect the public, but this technology needs further development and validation before it can be considered for deployment on a routine basis.</p>

 I hope that, as the subject matter of the above questions are closely linked, it will be helpful if I deal with them in one reply. The Reporting Application Registration Card (RepARC) Project was introduced in 2004 to create an automated link between compliance with reporting restrictions attached to temporary admission and access to asylum support payments. All asylum applicants are issued with an Application Registration Card (ARC), which is a biometric card containing fingerprint data and is also used as the method of collection for asylum support payments. In the RepARC system, ARCs are electronically revalidated at reporting events. Such events take 3-4 minutes including the process of checking identity and revalidation. Failure to report on two consecutive occasions leads to expiry of the card, and presentation of an expired card at a post office leads to denial of asylum support payments. This supports our policy of having in place a link between compliance with all aspects of the asylum process and access to support. If payment is suspended as described above, the remedy for the applicant is to resume reporting. If this does not happen, the case is referred to enforcement officers to locate the applicant; formal discontinuation of support may follow after eight weeks. Rollout of the RepARC process to all 11 IND reporting centres commenced in October 2005, in conjunction with the implementation of section 69 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the payment of travel expenses for reporting). Key external stakeholders have been kept fully informed of the rollout timetable, which has so far delivered the system to the reporting centres in Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Croydon, Glasgow, Solihull and two London centres. Rollout to the remaining reporting centres (north London, North Shields and Folkestone) will be complete by 31 July 2006, by which date it is expected that all NASS-supported applicants reporting to these sites will be reporting with an ARC. Non NASS-supported applicants are not covered by the RepARC scheme, although all asylum applicants are issued with ARCs. As of 30 April, 4250 asylum seekers with biometric ARCS, the total of all NASS supported asylum seekers who report to RepARC-enabled centres, were reporting within the RepARC system. Non NASS-supported applicants do not fall within the RepARC system but are still issued with ARCs, which are frequently used at reporting events to verify identity.</p>

 Code C issued under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 states (at paragraph 13.1) that chief officers of police are responsible for ensuring appropriate arrangements are in place for people who are deaf. The Code provides that sign language interpreters should be drawn from the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People Directory of British Sign Language/English Interpreters. The Code also makes it clear that if a person appears to be deaf or there is doubt about their hearing or speaking ability, they must not be interviewed in the absence of an interpreter unless they agree in writing to being interviewed without one. There exists more detailed national guidance regarding interpreters in the criminal justice system and that is currently under review by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform, with the Association of Chief Police Officers and other interested parties.</p>

 Between 1999 and 2003, major investment was made in CCTV through the Crime Reduction Programme (CRP). A total of &#163;170 million of Home Office capital funding was made available to local authorities following a bidding round. Through this, more than 680 CCTV schemes were installed in town centres. The end of the Crime Reduction Programme signalled the end of a dedicated central funding regime for CCTV. After the conclusion of the CRP, crime reduction funding moved to a structure that saw it being directly allocated to local Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs) and Basic Command Units to enable them to tackle local crime priorities using a number of interventions including CCTV.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 July 2006]: </i>There is no specific offence of child abuse. It is not possible to identify the number of offences of assault and harassment offences which were committed against children. There are, however, a number of offences specifically relating to child victims for which data are available from the Court Proceedings Database held by the Office for Criminal Justice Reform. The number of defendants found guilty of these offences in 2004 is provided in the following table. Information on whether these offenders are receiving treatment is not centrally collected, however the current target is for 1,240 sex offenders to complete treatment in custody and a further 1,200 to complete treatment in the community during 2006-07.</p>

 Most consumers use credit in a productive and prudent way, however a small minority of individuals show signs of financial distress.

of antisocial behaviour orders and of sex offender orders, the establishment of the Youth Justice Board, sentencing for both adults and juveniles, the establishment of the Sentencing Advisory Panel and the creation of specific racially aggravated offences. Although the measures in the Act have worked well, we have kept them under review and in the light of experience and of specific reviews we have made a number of changes to further improve them. In particular we have strengthened and improved upon the arrangements for antisocial behaviour orders and have built upon sex offender orders to create sexual offences prevention orders; we have extended racially aggravated offences to include religious aggravation; we have reviewed the whole of the sentencing framework for adults and introduced new arrangements in the Criminal Justice Act 2003; the youth justice arrangements have also been reviewed and proposals for change published in March 2004; and we have reviewed the partnership arrangements, with proposals for change being introduced in the Police and Justice Bill while others are subject to further consultation. The Government attaches a very high priority to public protection, the reduction of crime and to ensuring that the criminal justice system works effectively. We set out, in our document &#145;Rebalancing the Criminal Justice System in favour of the Law Abiding Majority&#146;, which we published on 20 July, further proposals for improvements across a range of areas. Representations are made from time to time in relation to individual provisions in the Act. The statutory instruments made under the Act are in the following list.</p>

Note that the offence stated in part (iii) of the question relates to &#145;careless' driving rather than &#145;dangerous&#146; driving.

Under the scheme the police are able to issue persons committing specified minor offences including being drunk in a highway and drunk and disorderly, with a fixed penalty notice. No admission of guilt is required and payment of the penalty discharges all liability for the offence. Data on the number of PNDs issued for these offences in each police force area in England in 2004 and 2005 (provisional) can also be found in the following tables. It is not possible to identify the number of PNDs which were issued in each London borough as the data are not collected at that level of detail centrally.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 3 July 2006, <i> Official Report, </i>column 875W, on damages, what the cost is of obtaining the information requested; how many of his Department&#146;s lawyers worked on such cases of damages against his Department in the last period for which figures are available; how damages payments are accounted for in his Department&#146;s accounts; what steps he takes to minimise future claims; which Minister is responsible for monitoring such claims; and if he will make a statement.

 No central record is kept by either the Home Department or the Treasury Solicitors department of the number of cases in which damages were paid or what the total sum paid out was. This information could be obtained only by searching through some 10,000 transaction sheets and then identifying the damages elements of these payments. This would involve a disproportionate cost. Detailed figures are not kept on how many lawyers are or have been involved in claims against the Home Office. Such information could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The way that damages payments are accounted for in the departmental accounts is seen in section 29, Losses and Special Payments, of the annual Resource Accounts. Also in the 2004-05 accounts there is a record in section 25, Contingent Liabilities, concerning the claims for compensation received by the Criminal Records Bureau. Ministers take responsibility for their own areas. Therefore ministerial responsibility for claims against the Home Office will depend on the particular area of the Department that the claim is made against.</p>

 The Home Office undertakes a wide range of research activities that support the development of information-led policy, including surveys of public opinion that consider Home Office issues and its related areas of responsibility. The Department commissions such work only when it is justified by the specific needs of a particular policy or programme and when this is the most economic, efficient and effective way to achieve the purpose. Consulting and informing the public helps inform both policy formulation and the delivery of better quality public services. A table showing the available information on the subject matter of market and opinion research undertaken in 2004-05 has been placed in the Library. Where this is for a specific region this has been indicated in the table, otherwise the coverage is for England and Wales (except for immigration topics). Information on the costs of individual market and opinion research projects is not held centrally and could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The Home Office has used external public relations companies to help deliver messages and advice to the public in press and magazines as part of integrated communication campaigns, often with a local focus. Campaigns include Year of the Volunteer, Holocaust Memorial Day, Sexual Offences Act, Crime and Anti Social Behaviour. A table showing spend on a monthly basis between September 2004 and October 2005 has also been placed in the Library.</p>

The list on the website of the Office of Public Sector Information (OPSI), www.opsi.gov.uk, of Command Papers from 2001 onwards continues to be updated and allows searching by Department or numerically.

 The available figures are set out in the table. The definitions of senior management differs in some areas and figures are for Senior Civil Service grades except for the Prison Service, and Serious Organised Crime Agency where they list senior managers at Grade seven and above, and for Criminal Records Bureau which list their senior managers at Senior Executive Officer and above. Data is at 30 June 2006 except for National Offender Management Service staff in HQ and for the Immigration and Nationality Directorate which is for 31 March 2006. In addition the data for the National Probation Service was only available as at the end of 2005. As a result it has not been possible to provide a consistent figure for the total staff in NOMS. Forensic Science Service ceased to be a Home Office Agency and became a government limited company (Govco) in December 2006. Its figures are for the five SCS equivalent staff.</p>

 The drug driving offence under the Road Traffic Act 1988 is that of driving whilst unfit through a drug. Field impairment tests are intended to help an assessment of whether a driver is impaired and whether that impairment might be due to alcohol or a drug. Whether the drug is a controlled substance or obtained legally on prescription or over the counter is not relevant to the offence. There is no offence if the driver has a drug in his body but his driving ability is not impaired. We understand from the police that the tests are useful in making such an assessment. If impairment is suggested and it appears a drug may be responsible, the driver can be required to provide a specimen of blood or urine for laboratory analysis.</p>

 Under s 6C (1)(b) of the Road Traffic Act 1988 as amended, a device used to test a driver for the presence of a drug in his body has to be of a type approved by the Secretary of State. There are at present no devices which have received type approval. International research has suggested that such drug screening devices as are currently available commercially are not suitable for type approval for the purposes of the Act.</p>

The re-tabled question was answered on 6 February 2006 and I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 6 February 2006, <i> Official Report, </i>column 937W.</p>

Since the introduction of the Drug Interventions Programme (DIP) in April 2003, over 48,000 drug misusing offenders have entered treatment through DIP (May 2006). We are on track to achieve the overall target of 1,000 offenders a week into treatment by 2008 and we exceeded the interim (March 2005) target by 54 per cent.</p>

as well as the extension period of the sentence. All prisoners subject to probation supervision are required to report to their supervising officer and may be required to live where directed and to comply with a range of other licence conditions which assist the Probation Service to monitor their behaviour in the community. Failure to comply can result in the offender's licence being revoked and the offender's being returned to custody. Determinate sentence prisoners serving a sentence of three months or over but less than four years may be released up to 135 days before their automatic release date on the home detention curfew scheme. These prisoners are subject to an electronically monitored curfew and liable to recall if they breach the terms of the curfew. Young offenders (those aged under 22 years upon their release) who are serving a sentence of less than 12 months and who fall to be released under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 receive a period of statutory supervision upon their release, which runs for three months (or until the offender reaches 22 years of age).</p>

 The primary aim of the effective trial management programme is to reduce the number of ineffective trials by improving case preparation and progression from point of charge through to trial or earlier conclusion. By increasing the certainty of trial or hearing dates, the programme aims to bring more offences to justice and improve public confidence in the criminal justice system, particularly that of victims and witnesses. Effective trial management formed part of the wider criminal case management programme aimed at improving the end-to-end process, and which included the setting up of 165 Witness Support Units under the No Witness No Justice project, and the roll-out of the new charging scheme.</p>

Stakeholder confidence and satisfaction in the changes remains high, with effective trial management being a priority at local and national level.</p>

 There were four cases discharged due to the passage of time in the UK in 2005. Three of these were dealt with by Bow Street magistrates court, which deals with all extradition requests in England and Wales, and one by the Edinburgh sheriffs court. Additionally, one case was discharged in 2005 but the case was not formally confirmed until 2006, when an appeal against the decision was withdrawn and one was discharged for two reasons, the secondary reason being passage of time. Both these cases were also dealt with by Bow Street magistrates court. The cases were: Teresa Restas, where the alleged offences took place in 1985 and the European arrest warrant (EAW) was issued in 2005. Rafal Darek, where the alleged offences took place in 1995 and the EAW was issued in 2004. Ronaldas Pakstas, where the alleged offences took place in 1998 and the EAW was issued in 2004 Richard Rockiki (Scottish case) where the alleged offences took place in 1986 and the EAW was issued in 2004. The case where the appeal was withdrawn in 2006 was Peter Lewis, where the alleged offences took place in 1996 and the EAW was issued in 2004. The case discharged principally for another reason was Ravnik Bojan, where the alleged offences took place in 1992 and the EAW was issued in 2005.</p>

<p><a name="st_384"><a name="0609077006580"><a name="60904w0046.htm_spnew1"><a name="0609077016891"><b>Mr. Sutcliffe</b>
<i> [holding answer 19 June 2006]: </i>The recently published document &#147;Rebalancing the criminal justice system in favour of the law-abiding majority&#148; reflected the results of a review carried out inside Government, informed by experience and research and by consultation with the frontline on how the Human Rights Act impacts on the criminal justice system. This revealed that the Human Rights Act provides a powerful framework to protect the rights of individuals but secure a proper balance with the safety of the law-abiding majority. It gives effect in UK law to the provisions of the European Convention on Human Rights to which we have been bound for over half a century.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_287"><a name="60904w0046.htm_para0"><a name="06110810000001">The document stated that where the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg interprets the Convention in a way which prevents the proper application of this balance (in particular the 1996 Chahal case where the Court found the UK Government could not consider the protection as a balancing factor when arguing the case for the deportation of a dangerous person) we will work with European partners to challenge this.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_288"><a name="60904w0046.htm_para1"><a name="06110810000002">The review also identified the need to do more to ensure that the Human Rights Act is not misinterpreted to prevent action to protect the public. In the light of recent cases such as the tragic murder of Naomi Bryant the Government are conducting a thorough review of how police, probation, parole and prison service balance public protection and individual and collective rights. If necessary we will legislate to ensure that public protection is given priority. In other cases, the review identified instances where organisations are over-cautious in their interpretation of competing rights. To combat this, we will make better practical advice available to practitioners on how rights should be balanced between offenders and the wider community and create an advice service to allow front-line practitioners to obtain fast online access to relevant legal resources.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_289"><a name="60904w0046.htm_para2"><a name="06110810000003">We will also institute a routine process of review through a scrutiny panel (made up of practitioners and lawyers) reporting to the National Criminal Justice Board (which includes relevant CJS Ministers) which will scrutinise the application of rights and ensure that the approach to administration is robust and fair and propose further changes to the law and guidance where it detects problems or imbalances.</p>

 The Home Office works with the police and law enforcement agencies, including the Serious Organised Crime Agency, other Government Departments and the private sector to consider intelligence, information, surveys, and statistics which provide an indication of the scale of the problem of identity fraud. Evidence from CIFAS&#151;the UK&#146;s Fraud Prevention Service&#151;and our updated estimate of the cost of identity fraud to the UK economy, suggest that the problem has grown in recent years, but data covering the timeframe of this question are not yet available.</p>

 In the view of the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) there are two principal factors for the reduction in the number of recorded cases of passport applications made in the identities of deceased persons detected. The figures for the number of passport applications detected in which a deceased identity has been used are a combination of infant and adult death cases. The IPS received the infant death data from July 2001 in a number of tranches. Retrospective checks of the index of passports issued using this data identified a number of passports issued in the identities of deceased children. These retrospective checks significantly increased the number of cases of deceased identity fraud detected and confirmed between 2001 and 2004. Since then the rate of detection is based on the number of new fraudulent applications being detected. Secondly, since IPS started using this data 184 people have been arrested for making fraudulent passport applications. 82 of these people have been convicted of offences and 34 deported. Although deterrence is very difficult to measure, it is likely that this success has deterred other criminals from submitting applications in the identities of deceased persons.</p>

 The Government are concerned about identity fraud and there is ongoing activity within the EU and the G8 about security of travel documents and borders that will contribute to combating the problem. This includes the work at EU level on enhancing the security of travel and identity documents, such as ePassports (also known as biometric passports) that we began issuing in March 2006. The use of biometric information to link a person to a passport helps to detect counterfeit or manipulated documents and it confirms the identity of the individual.</p>

 The main Home Office website for the public&#151;www.homeoffice.gov.uk&#151;was redeveloped in October 2005. The information published on it follows a design and navigational structure that was heavily tested on actual public users of the website, who helped dictate its user-friendly structure. Indeed the main Home Office website was recognised in a recent independent report published by Precedent Communications as being the best of the 32 UK public sector websites they assessed.</p>

But, in addition to this the information aimed at the general public is cross- referred on the main site. Under the top-level navigational title &#145;Crime &amp; victims&#146;, there is a section that describes what government is doing to reduce crime (which has a page dedicated specifically to internet crime) and another section that describes what members of the public can do to prevent crime (which in turn has a page on how to stay safe online).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_310"><a name="60904w0048.htm_para1"><a name="0609077006825">In both of these cases there is a wealth of useful information about how to keep children safe online, as well as a link under &#145;Related Documents&#146; to a document called &#145;Guidance on how to search safely&#146;.</p>

While the Home Secretary would normally make a written statement to the House, due to the timing of recess and the Council, and to make this most useful to you, I preferred to write after the pre-Council COREPER. There will, of course, be a written statement on discussion at the Council after recess. Due to other commitments, the Home Secretary will not be attending the Council, but Baroness Ashton, the Attorney General, Lord Goldsmith, and I will be representing the UK. There will be a debate on the future of Europol with the presidency seeking to agree Council conclusions. While we are supportive of the Conclusions and in making Europol's legal instrument more flexible, we believe there is a need to consider the implications of changing the legal instrument before taking a final decision. The presidency will seek to reach a general approach on the European Evidence Warrant. Several issues remain to be resolved, including the terms of the ground for refusal based on territoriality and the concerns of those who wish to clarify the scope of the offences for which dual criminality will not apply. We are supportive of the presidency's proposals on the territoriality clause, which would allow us to refuse an EEW where the conduct concerned took place in this country and would be legal here. The UK does not share the concern of those who wish to provide clarification in the Framework Decision of the offences for which dual criminality will not apply but we are hopeful that a solution can be reached based on compromise proposals from the presidency. There will be discussion on the Framework Decision for the Mutual Recognition of Custodial Sentences within the EU. The presidency has put forward a proposal for the circumstances in which a prisoner could be transferred without his or the executing State's consent. The Government accepts the proposal, and believes that the prisoner's consent should not be required where the prisoner was to be transferred to the State in which he had his normal permanent residence. This has clear benefits for prisoners being able to serve sentences close to their communities and families and should have an impact in terms of likelihood to re-offend. There is likely to be a political discussion on the presidency proposal for a framework. Decision on certain procedural rights. The UK would like to continue discussion and at this stage and not to close down any options for taking forward the work.

General Approach to the proposed Regulation establishing a European Small Claims procedure. This text will provide improved and cost-effective access to justice for European citizens in small claims across borders and is an initiative which the Government has welcomed. The presidency will be seeking to achieve agreement on the Draft Conclusions on the Organised Crime Threat Assessment (OCTA). This is the first annual OCTA, which replaces the Organised Crime Situation Report. The UK welcomes the first annual OCTA and supports the priorities as currently drafted. There will be a report on the implementation of the EU Counter Terrorism Strategy/Action Plan. We expect the presidency to reach a general approach on the Council Decision on Asset Recovery Offices. The UK negotiated changes in relation to civil recovery proceedings, so that the initiative relates both to confiscation and civil recovery cases. The UK supports measures to strengthen international cooperation concerning the recovery of the proceeds of crime. The Austrian presidency will be seeking to agree a general approach on the New Financial Frameworks general funding programme "Security and Safeguarding Liberties" and to one specific programme within the general programme on "Fundamental Rights and Justice". The UK welcomes the presidency's efforts to secure agreement and considers the texts now represent a good basis for future funding activity. In the mixed committee formation, there will be a presentation on Common Visa Application Centres. Finally, there will be a political discussion on the outstanding issues on the regulation on the second generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the presidency will be hoping to resolve these. The UK does not participate in this Regulation. However we feel the text needs to be more explicit on access for asylum authorities. In the margins there will be presentations on reinforcing the EU emergency and crisis response capacities and the May 2006 external relations ministerial conference in Vienna and Sweden will raise security arrangements in relation to the World Cup and the list of safe countries for the purposes of asylum."</p>

 We held a nationwide knife amnesty from 24 May to the end of June during which just under 90,000 items were surrendered to police forces in England and Wales. Following the amnesty, many forces are focusing on enforcement operations, targeting those who carry knives without good reason. Operation Shield, run by the British Transport Police, continues to operate at mainline and underground stations using search technology to detect people carrying weapons on the transport network. Police, in conjunction with Trading Standards officers, have also carried out test purchase operations to identify retailers who are not abiding by the law and selling knives to young people under 16.</p>

We have also announced that we will increase the maximum sentence for carrying a knife in a public place without good reason from two to four years.</p>

 No. There is no right of appeal against a life sentence imposed following a conviction for murder because this is a mandatory sentence. However, it is appropriate that there should be a right of appeal against life sentence tariffs in murder cases because they are imposed by the court, according to what it thinks is appropriate taking into account the seriousness of the offence, on the basis of its assessment of the facts of the individual case.</p>

 There is no single percentage discount figure available on hotel bookings. The Home Office, through its appointed contractor, negotiates rates for individual hotels or hotel chains subject to city location. All hotels offer their standard rate (the rack rate) which will then be discounted either to a Government rate available to all individuals carrying out work on behalf of the Home Office or other public sector bodies or, subject to there being sufficient volume room usage, special rates for individual departments. Generally the Home Office achieve savings on average of 30 per cent. on standard rates.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his letter to the hon.

 It is not possible accurately to predict the development of the pharmaceutical narcotics industry in the UK in relation to oxycodone.

 In common with other major opiate manufacturing countries, the United Kingdom does not permit importation of such base material drugs domestically manufactured and readily available.

 In October 2005 the Home Office published a consultation document, Restructuring Probation to Reduce Re-offending, which set out proposals to give to the Secretary of State the statutory duty to make arrangements with others to provide probation services and to replace probation boards with probation trusts as the public sector providers with whom he may contract. 748 written responses were received, including some from the police, and a summary was set out in Working with Probation to Protect the Public and Reduce Re-offending which was published in March. There are no current plans to change the boundaries of probation areas.</p>

 The responsibility for delivering the Prolific and Other Priority Offenders (PPO) programme rests with the Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships (CDRPs). The Programme announced by the Prime Minister in March 2004, firmly placed the onus on CDRPs to prioritise locally targeted groups of problematic offenders within existing resources to reduce their offending behaviour. We have made no commitments for additional funding, centrally.

 The Home Office along with the Department for Communities and Local Government is developing the Respect agenda to assist local authorities in dealing with nuisance neighbours. The Respect Action Plan recognises the important role social landlords play in tackling antisocial behaviour, including local housing authorities. We have provided local authorities in their housing role with a wide range of tools and powers to tackle antisocial behaviour, including injunctive powers, demoted tenancies, antisocial behaviour orders (ASBOs) and acceptable behaviour contracts (ABCs). We have encouraged and supported them through the Together campaign in delivering preventative approaches, providing support to victims and witnesses, and taking enforcement action.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_340"><a name="60904w0051.htm_para1"><a name="0609077007168">As part of the Respect programme we will also intervene with highly problematic families that account for a disproportionate amount of antisocial behaviour. We will also establish Family Intervention Projects in 50 areas by the end of 2006 to address the causes of their behaviour, alongside supervision and enforcement tools to provide them with the incentives to change. In some communities, we know that there are premises which are a constant focus for antisocial behaviour and we will be consulting on a new power to allow the closure of any residential or licensed premises for a set period, regardless of tenure, that is causing significant, persistent and serious nuisance to local communities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_341"><a name="60904w0051.htm_para2"><a name="0609077007169">The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has also introduced a number of extra powers for local authorities to deal with nuisance neighbours under the Clean Neighbourhoods and Environment Act 2005.

 The Government introduced a measure in 2003 to record the amount of time that police officers spend on frontline duties in order to help to maximise the time spent on their core roles of preventing and reducing crime. More police officer time was spent on front line duties in 2004-05 (64.1 per cent.) than in 2003-04 (63.6 per cent.) and we are determined to see this improvement continue, with police authorities setting robust targets for improvement. The Home Office expects that the police service can increase this to a national average of around 72 per cent. in 2008. This will be a gain in time on frontline duties equivalent to an extra 12,000 police officers.

These are only available for 2002-03 and later years. To avoid imposing an excessive administrative burden on forces, the Home Office does not request these data at Basic Command Unit (BCD) level, so numbers of front line officers are not available for Milton Keynes specifically. They have instead been provided for the relevant force (Thames Valley). Numbers of officers at BCD level are available only from 2002 onwards, as they were not collected by the Home Office's Research, Data and Statistics Directorate before this time; again, where figures for Milton Keynes specifically are not available they have been provided for Thames Valley. It should be noted that non-front line functions include call-centres, training, custody suites and criminal justice units for the processing of cases.</p>

 From 1 January 2006 to 24 July 2006, the Home Office issued 365 authorisations under section 26 of the Police Act 1996 to police officers from forces in England and Wales in respect of travel overseas to provide assistance to an international organisation or other body engaged outside the UK in policing activities. The majority of these authorisations were in respect of short-term assistance, on a wide range of matters and to numerous countries. Longer term deployments are mostly in the form of support to international Peace Support Operations (PSOs), and last up to a year. On 24 July 2006 the United Kingdom had 140 serving police officers working in Peace Support Operations in Bosnia (11); Kosovo (58); Iraq (21); Jordan (47); Sudan (2) and Afghanistan (1). Of these 140 police officers, 67 are from forces in England and Wales. Those forces are: Avon and Somerset; Cheshire; Cleveland; Cumbria; Devon and Cornwall; Durham; Dyfed Powys; Essex; Greater Manchester; Hertfordshire; Humberside; Kent; Lancashire; Lincolnshire; Metropolitan; Merseyside; Norfolk; Northumbria; North Wales; Nottinghamshire; South Yorkshire; Surrey; Sussex; Staffordshire; Thames Valley; West Mercia; West Yorkshire and Wiltshire. The other serving officers on PSOs are from the Ministry of Defence Police, the Police Service of Northern Ireland and Scottish police forces. 10 other longer term deployments have been authorised since 1 January 2006 for officers from forces in England and Wales. All last for a year or more. Three authorisations were in respect of assistance to Trinidad and Tobago by officers from Wiltshire and Cambridgeshire. In respect of the remaining seven authorisations, there are sensitivities which mean I am unable to reveal further details of their deployment.</p>

 No curfew notices have been issued under this power as no local child curfew scheme has been established. However other powers have been introduced and used. My answer on 5 December 2005, <i> Official Report</i>, column 968W explained that section 30 of the Anti-social Behaviour Act 2003 provides the police with a power to disperse groups and remove under-16s to their place of residence, within designated areas. The Act also inserted paragraph 4A into Schedule 4 to the Police Reform Act 2002 to allow designated community support officers to use these powers. These powers came into force on 20 January 2004. From a Home Office data collection exercise, we estimated that 809 areas were designated between January 2004 and June 2005. Police officers and community support officer dispersed 14,375 people from the 293 areas where data were available. They also removed 520 young people under 16 to their place of residence from 236 areas where data were available.

 Information on the fuel efficiency of police vehicles is not collected centrally. Police forces in England and Wales are expected to have a strategy for the management of their vehicle fleets. Each year HM Inspectorate of Constabulary assesses the contribution of that strategy to operational policing performance and the accountability of the fleet management for resource use and performance. Increased efficiency in fleet management, including increased fuel efficiency, will contribute to forces meeting their overall efficiency target.</p>

 The public sector Prison Service's policy on tackling bullying is set out in Prison Service Order (PSO) 8010 &#147;Equal Opportunities&#148;. This makes clear that staff have the right to make complaints about bullying; and that managers have responsibility for ensuring a workplace free from bullying and for dealing with any complaints they receive. PSO 8460 &#147;Conduct and Discipline&#148; describes the procedures to be followed where allegations of bullying require formal investigation and identifies bullying as gross misconduct which, depending on the circumstances of the case, may result in dismissal from the Service. Copies of all PSOs are available in the Library of the House.</p>

<i> [holding answer 3 May 2006]</i>: Any offender sentenced to 12 months' imprisonment or more is subject to probation supervision and to licence conditions. The offender must adhere to any conditions attached to the licence, including standard conditions set in all cases, which require him to remain in contact with his supervising officer and live at a suitable address. Any offender in breach of licence conditions risks recall to prison. Although it is not possible from national data to categorise the breaches in question, the probation service has achieved a significant improvement in performance in relation to all breaches of licence conditions. Its target is to enforce 90 per cent. of breaches overall within 10 working days. In 1997-98 the enforcement rate for licences stood at  34 per cent. It is now 93 per cent.</p>

 The measure records subsequent contact with the criminal justice system by offenders who were under probation service supervision at a particular point in time. It is based on matching offenders who are recorded as being under supervision at the end of a given quarter with the Police National Computer (PNC). Once offenders are matched, automated programmes search for whether the offenders had an entry on the PNC in the two months following the end of the quarter. The PNC entries could be for (i) arrest, charge, summons, or report, and/or (ii) conviction, and/or (iii) caution. It does not show weekly data, only monthly summaries. The bulk of the entries are not proven offences; an arrest or charge cannot be equated with admission or proof of guilt. These data are in development, and are released as experimental statistics. At the moment, they have not been assessed as fit for purpose and could be inaccurate or misleading. The assessment of accuracy and fitness will proceed during the financial year 2006-07.</p>

 The average custodial sentence length for all offences at all courts in England and Wales, excluding life sentences, was 12.9 months in 2004, the latest year for which data are currently available. This figure is published in &#147;Sentencing Statistics 2004, England and Wales&#148;, (Home Office Bulletin No. 15/05), Table 2.14 and is on the Home Office website at: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs05/hosb1505.pdf Although care is taken in collating and analysing the returns used to compile such figures, the data are of necessity subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recording system. Consequently, although some figures may be shown to the last digit in order to provide a comprehensive record of the information collected, they are not necessarily accurate to the last digit shown. We have started a programme of work in the Home Office looking at the quality of existing court sentencing data and how this might be improved.</p>

 Information on the average length of time served by prisoners on non-life determinate sentences can be found in table 10.1 of the &#147;Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2003 and 2004&#148;, and tables 3.13, 3.14, and 4.11 of &#147;Prison Statistics in England and Wales 2000 to 2002&#148;. Copies of these publications are available in the House of Commons Library. The figures provided in these tables were drawn from administrative IT systems. Although care is taken when processing and analysing the returns, the detail collected is subject to the inaccuracies inherent in any large-scale recording system, and so is not necessarily accurate to the last whole number. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1991, those sentenced to determinate sentences of four years or more are eligible for parole halfway through their sentence. If parole is not granted then release occurs at the two-thirds point of the sentence (or at a subsequent parole review if earlier). Prisoners sentenced to determinate terms of under four years under the 1991 Act are generally released automatically at the half way point of their sentence. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced new arrangements for prison sentences. They apply only to offences committed on or after 4 April 2005. A new indeterminate public protection sentence was introduced. Those offenders judged to be dangerous, and who have committed serious sexual or violent offences, can be kept in prison until the Parole Board judges it is safe to release them. If they have committed less serious offences they may serve a determinate sentence followed by an extended period on licence after release of up to eight years for sexual offences and five years for violent offences. Other determinate sentence prisoners will be released automatically at the halfway point of their sentence. The Home Detention Curfew scheme (HDC) has been in operation since January 1999. Subject to meeting the eligibility criteria and passing a careful risk assessment, prisoners serving sentences of between three months and less than four years may be released up to four and a half months (135 days) early from prison subject to an electronically monitored curfew normally between 7 pm and 7 am. Information on the numbers of prisoners released under Home Detention Curfew (HDC) can be found in table 10.3 in the &#147;Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2004&#148;.</p>

Statistics compiled from police records show that, between 11 September 2001 and  31 March 2006, 997 people were arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 (TACT).

<p><a name="stpa_465"><a name="60904w0079.htm_para0"><a name="06090723000571">In January 2006, the Department published a report entitled &#145;Mathematics and Science in Secondary Schools: The Deployment of Teachers and Support Staff to Deliver the Curriculum&#146;. The research, sponsored by the Department, was conducted during 2005 by the National Foundation for Education Research. Their sample survey found that an estimated 66 per cent. of maths A-level curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a degree in maths, 15 per cent. by a teacher with a PGCE incorporating maths and 13 per cent. by a teacher with a B.Sc, BA with QTS or a B.Ed in maths. For further mathematics, an estimated 73 per cent. of curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a degree in maths, 13 per cent. by a teacher with a PGCE incorporating maths and 10 per cent. by a teacher with a B.Sc, BA with QTS or a B.Ed in maths.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_466"><a name="60904w0079.htm_para1"><a name="06090723000572">For biology A-level, the study found that an estimated 61 per cent. of curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a biology degree and 31 per cent. by a teacher with a degree in another (including general) science. For chemistry A-level, an estimated 61 per cent. of curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a chemistry degree and 26 per cent. by a teacher with a degree in another (including general) science. Finally, for physics A-level, an estimated 53 per cent. of curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a physics degree and 13 per cent. by a teacher with a degree in another (including general science). For physics it is useful to note that an estimated 17 per cent. of the curriculum time was delivered by a teacher with a B.Sc, BA with QTS or B.Ed in science, and 13 per cent. by a teacher with a PGCE in science.</p>

 The national minimum standards for fostering services make clear that proper consideration should be given to a child&#146;s racial, religious, cultural and linguistic background when making any decisions regarding the care of that child. In cases where a child is placed with carers who do not share his or her ethnicity or culture, the standards state that the responsible authority should provide the foster family with additional training, support and information to enable the child to receive the best possible care and to develop a positive understanding of his or her heritage. It is for fostering providers themselves to determine the most appropriate arrangements for doing so. Volume 3 of the &#145;Children Act Guidance and Regulations&#146; does, however, recognise that</p>

 The Government have carefully considered the Practitioners&#146; Group&#146;s conclusions about a National Behaviour Charter, in consultation with key partners in the education service represented on the Ministerial Stakeholders&#146; Group on School Behaviour and Attendance. The Stakeholders&#146; Group was mindful of the fact that events have moved on since the Practitioners&#146; Group reported, particularly with the clear new statutory framework for disciplining pupils in the Education and Inspections Bill. It was therefore concluded that the role of a National Behaviour Charter might more appropriately be fulfilled through the guidance which my Department is preparing for schools on the relevant provisions in the Education and Inspections Bill.</p>

 Research evidence, such as my Department&#146;s effective provision of pre-school education (EPPE) study, shows that the quality of the learning environment in the home (where parents are actively engaged in activities with children such as teaching songs and nursery rhymes, playing with letters and numbers, and reading to the child) promoted intellectual development, including literacy skills, in children at the end of key stage 1 compared to children whose parents did not engage in such activities. In fact the quality of the home learning environment is a more significant factor than parent&#146;s social class and education levels. A review of the literature on parents&#146; involvement in their children&#146;s education funded by my Department (Desforges and Abouchaar, 2003) also found that such parental activities in the home were associated with early literature and communication and skills development. In addition to the actual activities, the review found that the values a parent has, such as enthusiasm for learning and a positive parenting style, are associated with improved outcomes for the child such as increased self-perception as a learner, more motivation and self-esteem and higher educational aspirations.

The curriculum will be linked to the broad objectives of enterprise education but specifically focused on enterprise capability and personal, individual development of attitudes and qualities for enterprise. The business representatives will be present throughout the summer schools and they will be involved in the delivery of the pathfinders, as well as activities such as mentoring.

 Up to and including 2005, data on non-core teacher assessments was collected as an aggregate value in a variety of formats including paper forms. For 2006 NAA have changed the data collection so that all teacher assessment data including non-core is collected at an individual pupil level. The data is collected electronically alongside core subjects using the Common Transfer File format (CTF). The CTF is the same standard that is used for transferring pupil data from one school to another. The change to pupil level data has also reduced the burden on schools by removing the need to transcribe and manipulate the source data. The NAA supports the Protocol on Data Sharing and Rationalisation in the Schools Sector and recognises a collective responsibility to minimise the burdens of data collection on schools and local authorities and to ensure that data collected is used effectively to support individual learning, whole school improvement and system-wide capacity building.</p>

<i>  [holding answer 29 June 2006]: </i>The costs of fee loans (steady state in 2006/07 terms) were published on 10 November 2005, <i> Official Report,</i> column 22WS. For an average fee of &#163;3,010 the costs would be around &#163;620 million and for an average fee of &#163;3,910 the costs could be upwards of &#163;810 million<sup>(1)</sup>. In each case, we have used our existing assumptions: that a tuition fee loan is available to meet the full cost of tuition fees, that the total cost of providing tuition fee loans over their lifetime is 33 per cent. of their face value and that 80 per cent. of eligible students take them up. These estimates are approximate as significant changes in the fee level would be likely to have an effect on assumptions. The Government's policy is to have income- contingent loans where repayments are tied to salary (i.e. graduates make repayments of 9 per cent. of salary in excess of &#163;15,000 per annum) and the repayment period is not pre-determined, so estimates based on fixed repayment periods of five and 10 years have not been made. The maximum fee cannot be raised by more than inflation until 2 January 2010 and only then with the approval of both Houses of Parliament.</p>

The UK has pushed strongly for a Temporary International Mechanism to help meet the basic needs of Palestinians. The European Community has committed &#8364;105 million to it. G8 leaders decided that the mechanism should be expanded immediately to provide wider assistance to the people of Gaza.

<p><a name="stpa_524"><a name="60904w0088.htm_para0"><a name="06090723001914">The region has four Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB), three Environmentally Sensitive Areas, 14 National Nature Reserves, 60 Local Nature Reserves, 19 Special Areas of conservation, one Special Protection Area, 19 Ramsar sites (Wetlands of International Importance) and 439 Sites of Special Scientific Interest. It is covered by 26 Character Areas, which describe and define its natural and man-made landscape.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_525"><a name="60904w0088.htm_para1"><a name="06090723001915">Approximately 30 per cent. of the agricultural land in the West Midlands is managed under the provisions of agri-environment schemes. There are currently 4,890 live agreements and the annual spend totals &#163;27.63 million. Coverage is increasing annually towards the target of 70 per cent. of the land to be included in entry level schemes by 2008.</p>

The Countryside Agency supplies 75 per cent. of core funding for areas of outstanding natural beauty (80 per cent. for Conservation Boards) with the remainder supplied by the constituent local authorities; and up to 50 per cent. of project costs with the remainder provided by third parties.<br>
3. It is not possible for the Countryside Agency to provide precise funding figures prior to 2001, nor yet for 2006-07. The figures quoted are for the delivery of the full Countryside Agency areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty programme which includes core and project funding, information and publicity, legal advice, the initial set-up costs of creating the first two AONB Conservation Boards and the introduction of a sustainable development fund.<br>

 For a number of years now we have been actively seeking to raise awareness about the European Union's Protected Food Name Scheme and encourage more UK applications. The scheme provides a means for farmers to add value to their produce and market it in a more imaginative way, particularly given consumers' growing interest in food with a clear regional provenance. Promotion of the scheme forms part of our wider strategy of support for the quality regional food sector.</p>

Monitoring by the Environment Agency has shown compliance with the mandatory standard of the Bathing Water Directive has risen from 79.3 per cent. in 1990 to 98.8 per cent. in 2005. Compliance with its more stringent guideline standard has risen from 34.2 per cent. in 1990 to 83.8 per cent. in 2005.</p>

In all years since 1993 over 90 per cent. of rivers in Wales have been of good chemical quality. Table 3, shows the chemical quality of rivers from 1990-2004.</p>

 Although non-statutory and illegal armed groups present an obstacle to extending the authority of the Afghan Government, we do not assess that they pose a serious threat to stability. We assess that the recent upsurge in violence in the south of Afghanistan is in part&#151;if not wholly&#151;a response to the Coalition&#146;s current vigorous activity in the area, and that overall it does not represent an increased threat to the stability of the Afghan state.

 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has made no assessment of the impact on each African state&#146;s economy of Chinese migrant workers. The best way for Africa to reduce poverty and meet the Millennium Development Goals is through increased trade and investment. The movement of people to Africa, where well managed, can bring benefits to African economies and new skills, technology and knowledge which support growth and development. The Government have raised common issues of interest in Africa with the Chinese Government and we will continue to encourage China to engage with Africa in a way that reinforces the principles set out in the African-led New Partnership for Africa&#146;s Development agenda of democracy, transparency, promotion of peace and stability, competitiveness and sustainable growth.</p>

the last European Council under the UK presidency, member states agreed the &#147;Global Approach to Migration&#148; paper, a comprehensive, practical guide to managing migration in partnership with third countries in Africa and the Mediterranean. It lays out a number of priority actions, including:</p>

In response to the ongoing crisis in the Canaries, the UK is deploying two immigration officials to the area to assist in conducting nationality and identity interviews with intercepted migrants. Malta also faces acute socio-economic challenges as a consequence of illegal sea-borne migration from North Africa. In response to a request from the Maltese authorities via Frontex, the UK has deployed an official to Malta to assist with nationality and identity interviewing, offered strategic advice on returns and, pending the outcome of a forthcoming planning meeting, will assess the possibility of offering further assistance through an expert in maritime intelligence and experts in de-briefing irregular migrants for the purposes of intelligence gathering.</p>

<i>  [holding answers 26 June 2006]: </i>There are no specific regulations that govern the sale, supply, or purchase of DNA sequences. The potential chemical hazards associated with the sequence itself would be covered by the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 (as amended); if DNA sequences were to be used to create a biological agent, the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 2000 (as amended) are likely to apply. These provide for a high level of protection for human health and the environment (including animal and plant health). In addition, the Specified Animal Pathogens Order 1998 (SAPO), administered by DEFRA, regulates possession of nucleic acid derived from any animal pathogen specified under SAPO.

 The Department has not undertaken a formal assessment.

 A clinical judgment is based on several factors. These include a clinician's interview with the patient, and information from carers and others about factors such as memory and behaviour.

The national service framework (NSF) for older people includes hearing as one of the senses to be investigated in assessing an older person&#146;s health and social care needs. One of the aims of the Healthy Ageing programme, in &#147;A New Ambition for Old Age&#148;, which updates the NSF, is to reduce hearing impairment as a barrier to active ageing.</p>

The needs of older people and the NSF commitments will be taken into consideration in relation to the action plan.</p>

 Radiotherapy treatment is often fractionated, i.e. given over a number of days. This allows large doses of radiation to be given while sparing normal tissue too many side effects. Generally, radical treatments, with the aim of curing a patient, are given in more treatment fractions than palliative treatment, for symptom control.</p>

Localised data on PDS expenditure are only available for the financial year 2004-05. The data include regular PDS contract payments but excludes some additional payments authorised locally. They also exclude the cost of PDS services directly managed by NHS trusts such as some dental access centres. Data on PDS charge income may also be incomplete because some primary care trusts (PCTs) instituted temporary arrangements to collect charge income directly from dentists. These factors make it very difficult to make comparisons between the 2004-05 and 2005-06 data, when PDS pilot schemes rapidly expanded, and earlier periods.</p>

This patient charge regime was not sensitive to the new ways of working and treatment patterns associated with PDS contracts, and generally resulted in lower levels of charge income within PDS pilot schemes. In addition, as noted above, some PCTs have collected some patient charges direct from PDS dentists locally and this income may not be reflected in the centrally recorded data.

 National health service foundation trusts (NHSFTs) which became operational between 1 April and 1 July 2004 gave a commitment to implement Agenda for Change according to the same national timetable as the rest of the NHS. Applicants for foundation status thereafter were already covered by the national agenda for change agreement and therefore legally their staff on Whitley terms were entitled to the new contract and those on local contracts had to be offered the new terms and conditions. Business plans of NHSFTs are available from respective organisations.</p>

They are free to deliver healthcare without direction from central Government or performance management by health authorities. However, as independently regulated organisations with a duty to deliver on national standards and demonstrate financial viability, NHSFTs are expected to be model employers and build on their track record of maintaining and developing high standards of employment practice.</p>

<p><a name="st_938"><a name="06090723005897"><a name="60904w0108.htm_spnew12"><a name="06090723010614"><b>Caroline Flint:</b>
 The number of HIV tests offered and taken in the genito-urinary medicine (GUM) clinics within the London strategic health authorities (SHA) is shown in the table. The dataset used to compile this data was taken from the KC60 return, which is made by all GUM clinics to the health protection agency. Only tests offered and taken in GUM clinics are recorded in the KC60 return. Testing undertaken in other clinical settings, such as general practice, is not recorded in the dataset.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_742"><a name="60904w0108.htm_para23"><a name="06090723005898">The data do not represent the number of HIV tests offered and taken up by the population resident in each SHA, as many patients cross health boundaries to access GUM clinics. In addition, the gender and sexual orientation mix varies between clinics. Some clinics are attended by a high number of homosexual and bisexual men and consequently this influences the number of HIV tests offered and taken.</p>

 I refer my hon. Friend to the reply given on 5 June 2006, <i> Official Report,</i> column 384W, with regard to the availability component of the unitary charge. The table placed in the Library gives details of unitary payments for each private finance initiative scheme which has become operational over the last five years (the table shows what the percentage of these payments are against the trusts' annual turnover as opposed to expenditure). Unitary payments include the costs for hard and soft facilities management services as well as for construction and financing. It is not possible to separately identify costs attributable only to the non-services element of the contract, as the availability component includes costs attributable to providing hard facilities management services.</p>

No breakdown of the funding by initiative is shown in the individual PCT&#146;s allocations. It is PCTs' responsibility to decide how to use these funds.

Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust is engaged in this improvement programme, and a departmental team concluded a diagnostic assessment, and recommendations for action were due to be presented to the trust board on 25 July. The board will, with departmental support, be working up a detailed action plan to deliver the agreed reduction in MRSA cases.</p>

 The Department has placed the protection of individual rights at the heart of the new national health service care records service. The Department is working closely with the Information Commissioner to ensure that the requirements of the Data Protection Act 1998 are met in full, and is sympathetic to the Commissioner&#146;s call for increased penalties for those who misuse personal health and other information under Section 55 of the Act.</p>

The new system of electronic care records is therefore being designed to enable patients to restrict access to information that the NHS holds in confidence. Many older NHS systems were not designed to safeguard confidentiality in this way and these will be phased out over the next few years.</p>

Patients are not permitted to place restrictions on access to information where it is clear that to do so would put others at risk of serious harm. Also, exceptionally, patient restrictions may have to be overridden by a health professional where the public interest in sharing information outweighs obligations of confidentiality, for example in child protection cases. Where an individual&#146;s restrictions are overridden the system will generate an alert to enable senior staff to check that the decision was appropriate and lawful.</p>

 None of the national health service trusts referred to has dispensed with the national programme for information technology (IT).

We are adopting an incremental approach to replacing existing systems, and this strategy ensures that best use is made of the existing asset base. There is scope within deployment plans in each cluster for existing systems to be replaced in either the shorter or the longer term depending on the circumstances of NHS trusts and primary care trusts locally. It makes no sense to replace prematurely systems with appropriate functionality that are delivering demonstrable benefit to patients and staff when other NHS organisations have systems that are in urgent need of replacement.</p>

The approach is set out in programme-wide implementation guidance. The guidance which is aimed at providing structured and consistent mechanisms, and describing the critical tasks necessary to maximise benefits from the changes being enabled by the national programme, is published on the Department&#146;s NHS Connecting for Health agency&#146;s website at: www.connectingforhealth.nhs.uk/implementation The circumstances of the South West Yorkshire Mental Health Trust are slightly different.</p>

Due to the complexity of the current systems and the need to consolidate them it is not currently possible for the Trust to be an early development site for the national programme.

 A consultation document, &#147;Delivering 21st Century IT support for the NHS: National Specification for Integrated Care Records Service&#151;consultation draft&#148;, issued in July 2002, outlined the requirements for a national patient care records service and the national standards and specification which would underpin it. Its purpose was to provide an initial review of electronic patient records and to describe a direction of travel for the whole range of information technology standards in the national health service. Nearly 200 initial responses were received from organisations and individuals, and these were taken into account in drawing up the specification for a care record service used in the procurements phase during 2003. A broad spectrum of NHS stakeholders was then engaged to review the specification, including leading clinicians, practitioners, policy advisors, health informaticians, and managers.</p>

This is done by providing support and guidance to the NHS to realise benefits and achieve performance improvement through synergy with other change programmes and system reform, in particular through effective education, training and development. The emphasis is to optimise the use of technology to manage knowledge and information to improve care and treatment, safety and clinical governance, and to re-design processes, supported by appropriate information technology, to improve patient, clinician and managerial satisfaction.</p>

Forty-four national action teams have been established supported by National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, specialist libraries, and the Healthcare Commission to distil the current best practice derived from the NHS's knowledge bases into fifty national care pathways representing current best practice. By the end of June 2006 thirty-nine of the action teams will have produced their final reports, which will enable the distilled knowledge to begin to be integrated into national electronic care pathways.</p>

Good clinical management requires that health care professionals keep a record of key information about their patients, and national health service organisations are required to ensure that the information is held securely, and that confidential information is not shared inappropriately. Patients do not, however, have the right to determine the media on which patient records are kept, the physical location of the information or who manages the information systems involved.</p>

 Entitlement to access free national health service hospital treatment is based on whether someone is ordinarily resident in this country, not on British nationality or the past or present payment of national insurance contributions or UK taxes. Anyone who is not ordinarily resident is subject to the National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989, as amended. These regulations place a legal duty on NHS hospitals to establish whether a person is ordinarily resident, or exempt from charges under one of a number of exemption categories, or liable for charges, and to make and recover a charge for the full cost of treatment to those found liable to pay. The onus is on the patient to provide satisfactory evidence to support a claim for exemption from charges.</p>

current public health campaigns aim to tackle obesity through the promotion of healthy eating practices and increased physical activity. Examples of centrally funded schemes which contribute include the 5 A DAY programme, school fruit and vegetable scheme (SFVS), healthy schools initiative, and the local exercise action pilot (LEAP). The total cost of the SFVS is estimated at &#163;34 million during the period specified, and the Department makes a yearly contribution of &#163;9.6 million to the local healthy schools programme. The LEAP scheme has received &#163;1.3 million in funding from the Department to date. In addition primary care trusts allocate funding on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>

<i> [holding answer 25 July 2006]</i>: The weighted-capitation formula, used to inform revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs), is continuously overseen by the advisory committee on resource allocation (ACRA). The issues faced by rural areas have been looked at by ACRA on numerous occasions when considering the allocation of funds to PCTs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_843"><a name="60904w0122.htm_para3"><a name="06090723008747">In 1997 a team of researchers was contracted to examine the effect of rurality on the cost of providing certain services. Accident and emergency services and patient transport costs were examined but no evidence of unavoidable geographical costs were found for these services. However, geographical cost differences were found for emergency ambulance services. This led to the introduction of an emergency ambulance cost adjustment (EACA) from the 1998-99 health authority allocations. The results of this study are recorded in &#147;Study of Costs of Providing Health Services in Rural Areas Progress Report to Resource Allocation Group&#151;Volumes 1 and 2&#148;.

 Nationally, the Department rural proofs policy across much of its business. In policy development we ensure that all communities, including those in rural areas, are able to benefit from our national objectives for healthcare. Examples of our rural proofing activity can be found in the Commission for Rural Communities annual report on rural proofing at: www.ruralcommunities.gov.uk. This commends our White Paper &#147;Our health, our care, our say: a new direction for community services&#148; highlighting policies aimed at providing care closer to the home. Proposals for social care and integration, initiatives to support carers, such as a dedicated telephone helpline, and set of community hospitals will be particularly beneficial to rural populations.</p>

 The Committee on Medical Aspects of Air Pollution made a statement on swimming pools and asthma in August 2003. The committee was examining a paper that had been published in the Journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine 2003; 60:385-394.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_866"><a name="60904w0124.htm_para0"><a name="06090723009019">The committee felt that the study was of interest and that further focused research in this area was advisable to take further these preliminary findings. Members accepted that exposure to airway irritants such as chloramines could trigger the symptoms of asthma. It was argued that it was important to distinguish clearly between induction of asthma as a disease and the triggering of symptoms. The primary cause of most cases of asthma is unknown as are the reasons for the increase in asthma in the United Kingdom over the past 20 years. That exposure to chlorine and associated reaction products had played a significant part in causing this increase was felt to be unlikely.</p>

1. <i> Time waited (days):</i><br>
Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>
2. <i> Ungrossed Data:</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>

Many factors have to be taken into account in assessing causal relationships including temporal association, the possible contribution of concomitant medication and the underlying disease. Other factors such as the time since a drug was first marketed, media interest, the reason for prescribing or regulatory action can also influence the frequency of reporting. This means that reporting rates based on numbers of spontaneous reports and numbers of prescriptions are not true measures of the frequency of reactions or the ideal basis for comparisons between drug substances or classes. For these reasons, no firm conclusions can be drawn from a possibly higher reporting rate in 2005, of suspected adverse reactions with the more recently marketed atypical anti-psychotics, based on yellow card data, compared to more traditional anti-psychotics.</p>
