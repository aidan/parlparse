This takes into account relevant information the Government may hold, including from the Government&#146;s overseas posts who monitor local developments closely and note any information that comes to light that equipment supplied by the UK has been used in a manner inconsistent with the consolidated criteria. Should information come to light that goods have been diverted, the Government will take this into consideration when assessing any future applications.

1. <i> Finished admission episodes:</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. <i> Main operation:</i><br>
The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, e.g. time waited, but the figures for &#147;all operations count of episodes&#148; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>
3. <i> Time waited (days):</i><br>
Time waited statistics from Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>
4. <i> Ungrossed data:</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
5.<i>  Data quality:</i><br>
Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) are compiled from data sent by over 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. The Health and Social Care Information Centre liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
