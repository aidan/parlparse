To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport what plans he has for fostering excellence in sport; and if he will make a statement. [21586]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 I have today announced that Sheffield will be the headquarters of the New United Kingdom Sport Institute (UKSI).
<P>

<a name="71216w01.html_para0">The joint decision taken by Ministers and the United Kingdom Sports Council (UKSC) is an historic moment for sport. I believe it will provide our very best sporting talent with the facilities and backup to help them challenge and beat the rest of the world. Sheffield will be the heart of a network--setting the standards and giving leadership to the nationwide network of facilities.
<P>

<a name="71216w01.html_para1">We have decided to locate the headquarters site at Sheffield because the bid: offered an extremely cohesive site with good transport and infrastructure; had responded particularly well to the vision and strategy set out by the Government and UKSC on the framework for the network; and builds on the existing public investment in sports facilities in Sheffield.

To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster what proposals he has to allow hon. Members to challenge a refusal by a Minister to provide the information requested by means of a written parliamentary question. [21168]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 Ministers are committed to answering parliamentary questions in accordance with the Resolution of the House of 19 March 1997. If a Member believes that he or she has not received a satisfactory answer to a question, it is open to him or her to challenge the relevant Minister on those grounds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if the powers of Ministers to refuse to provide information requested in response to written parliamentary questions will be curtailed by the proposals included in the White Paper on Freedom of Information. [21167]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 Ministers are required by the House to answer parliamentary questions in accordance with the Resolution of 19 March 1997. This states:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"Ministers should be as open as possible with Parliament, refusing to provide information only when disclosure would not be in the public interest, which should be decided in accordance with relevant statute and the Government's <i>Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (Second Edition, January 1997)</i>".
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="71216w01.html_para2">At such time as a Freedom of Information Act comes into force, the House will no doubt wish to consider amending the reference in that Resolution to the Code of Practice accordingly.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if information relating to the Sovereign and her family in respect of their public roles will be available to the public under the proposals set out in the White Paper on Freedom of Information; and if he will make a statement. [21194]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 Such information, where it is held by Government Departments, would be within the scope of the proposed Freedom of Information Act. Whether the information can be disclosed in particular cases will depend on whether it passes the harm and public interest tests integral to the Act's access provisions.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster how long the consultation period in respect of the White Paper on Freedom of Information will last; and what target date he has for the introduction of a Bill to give effect to its provisions. [21142]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 Comments and views on the proposals in the White Paper "Your Right to Know" (Cm 3818) are invited by 28 February 1998. Later in the year we will publish a draft Bill, also for consultation. In the light of comments received about this, a Bill will be introduced to the House as soon as the legislative programme permits.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster if he will carry out an assessment to establish whether the test of substantial harm in the White Paper on Freedom of Information could obviate the need for the blanket exemption proposed for the security services. [21169]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 This issue was considered in developing the proposals set out in the White Paper. The reasons why an exclusion from the Act was considered necessary for the Security and Intelligence Services are explained in paragraph 2.3.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_wqn7"><B> Kali Mountford: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster how many non-departmental public bodies were in existence on 1 April; what percentage of appointments to these bodies were <i>(a)</i> women and <i>(b)</i> members of ethnic minorities; and when the annual list of such bodies will be published. [21504]

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 These figures are set out in the Cabinet Office (OPS) booklet "Public Bodies 1997", which is published today. Copies have been placed in the Library. On 1 April 1997 there were 1,128 non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs) in existence. As of 1 September 1997, 32 per cent. of the appointments to bodies listed in "Public Bodies" were held by women, an increase of 1 per cent. over the previous year; and 3.6 per cent. were held by members of the ethnic minorities, an increase of 0.3 per cent. over the previous year.
<P>

<a name="71216w01.html_para3">This Government are determined to keep the number of NDPBs to a minimum and Ministers are taking a personal look at the need for each NDPB they sponsor. The Government are also taking action to increase the number of women and members of ethnic minorities represented on the boards of such bodies.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Maude: </B> 
To ask the Minister without Portfolio what estimate he has made of the likely effect of the Millennium Experience in displacing visitors from other London attractions during 2000. [18618]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The British Tourist Authority predicts that the Millennium Experience will add considerable value to the tourism product offered by this country, estimating that visitors will on average extend their stay in Britain by more than a day in order to take in the Experience. Existing London attractions should regard the Millennium Experience not as a threat, therefore, but as an opportunity to attract more visitors themselves.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Howard: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether he and the Prime Minister were present throughout each session of the IGC at Amsterdam. [20474]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Doug Henderson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friends the Foreign Secretary and the Prime Minister were present at each session of the IGC at Amsterdam. Inevitably one or other had to leave the room from time to time, but at no time were both absent.

<a name="71216w01.html_sbhd7"><H4><center>Falkland Islands</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Faber: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs whether the status of the Falkland Islands is being considered as part of the Dependent Territories Review. [21202]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 The review of the Dependent Territories covers generic issues (such as nomenclature and constitutional status) relevant to all remaining DTs, including the Falkland Islands. Given the special factors which apply to the Falklands no individual review of their status is being carried out.




<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 1997 : Column: 80</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71216w01.html_para4">We are committed to upholding the right of the Falkland Islanders to remain British. We have no doubts about British sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and do not regard that sovereignty as negotiable.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Faber: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to the answer to the hon. Member for Weston-super-Mare (Mr. Cotter) of 10 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>596,</i> on the DTI/FCO Export Forum, if he will make a statement on his plans to help United Kingdom companies export their goods abroad. [21293]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 This Department will continue to give the highest importance to helping British business perform to its full potential in overseas markets. Our response to some Export Forum recommendations will need to await the completion of the DTI/FCO Comprehensive Spending Review.

To ask the Attorney-General if he will place in the Library the written observations drafted on behalf of the UK Government and submitted to the European Court of Justice in case C-409/95 between Helmut Marschall and Land NordRhein-Westfalen. [20290]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Attorney-General:</B> 
 It is not the practice of the Government to release copies of pleadings in cases before the European Court of Justice. Such pleadings are addressed to the Court and are prepared with the specific purpose of informing the Court and the other parties of the arguments of the party submitting the pleadings. The practice is in accordance with the exclusion in paragraph 4(e) of Part II of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information (information relating to legal proceedings).

<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w02.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Touhig: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement on the impact of his proposed reforms of non-departmental public bodies and agencies on the economy in Wales. [19383]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 The Government of Wales Bill provides for the merger of the Welsh Development Agency, the Land Authority for Wales and the Development Board for Rural Wales. This will achieve the Government's objective of reducing the number of unaccountable public bodies in Wales, and will provide for more efficient and effective economic development services across the whole of Wales.
<P>

<a name="71216w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales how many whole-time equivalent publicly funded officials were employed by non-departmental public

<P><I>16 Dec 1997 : Column: 81</I><P>
bodies in May; and what estimate he has made of the number to be so employed by 2000. [20125]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 As at May 1997, there were 2,169 full-time equivalent staff employed in executive NDPBs in Wales. Before the National Assembly for Wales is established in May 1999 the Government will take action to reduce the number of executive bodies in Wales from 19 to 14 and, thereafter, the assembly will be able to reduce further their number. This is likely to result in a reduction in the number of staff employed, but it is not possible at this time to estimate precisely what the actual numbers will be in 2000, as that depends on decisions yet to be taken.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 My Department employed some 2,300 whole-time equivalent civil servants in May 1997. Staffing levels for the year 2000 will be determined by the National Assembly for Wales.

<a name="71216w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Wales (1) if he will list the members of the Conservative Party whom he consulted prior to selecting a Conservative representative to sit on the Assembly advisory board;[20132]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list the representatives of the <i>(a)</i> Liberal Democrats and <i>(b)</i> Plaid Cymru whom he consulted prior to making appointments to the Assembly advisory board.[20139]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 I consulted a wide range of interests before deciding on the membership of the Welsh Assembly Advisory Group. These consultations were confidential, and will remain so.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales what were the operational costs of running his private office in <i>(a)</i> 1995-96 and <i>(b)</i> 1996-97; and what estimate he has made of the costs in (i) 1997-98 (ii) 1998-99 and (iii) 1999-2000. [20098]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Ron Davies: </B> 
 Costs vary with levels of Ministerial activity and time spent between London and Cardiff. The cost of Ministerial private offices in the Welsh Office was &#163;724,230 in 1995-96 and &#163;720,625 in 1996-97.
<P>

<a name="71216w02.html_para0">Some &#163;483,000 has been expended in 1997-98 to the end of November. The cost for the remainder of the year will reflect the nature and scale of Ministerial commitments.
<P>

<a name="71216w02.html_para1">Budgets for 1998-99 have yet to be determined. For 1999-2000 budgets will take account of the role of the Secretary of State following the establishment of the National Assembly for Wales.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Win Griffiths: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend proposes to make regulations to widen the scope of Welsh local authorities' discretion to charge up to the full council tax on second homes. The regulations will have effect in relation to council taxes for 1 April 1988 onwards.
<P>

<a name="71216w02.html_para2">For a dwelling to fall within one of the new prescribed classes it will not be necessary for it to have previously been a sole or main residence. Nor will it be necessary for the dwelling to have been unused as a sole or main residence for the immediately preceding six months.
<P>

<a name="71216w02.html_para3">We propose to prescribe two classes in the regulations. One class will relate to dwellings with a restriction on occupancy by law which prohibits their use for a period of at least 28 days in any 12-month period. The other class will relate to dwellings which have no such restriction on occupancy.
<P>

<a name="71216w02.html_para4">These changes will allow local authorities the discretion to charge owners of dwellings in both classes up to the full council tax, or to decide on different treatment for homes which have the occupancy restriction and those which have no such restriction.

<a name="71216w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I do not know which foreign military, security or police forces have been supplied with the Otec Ultima Multi Media Weapons training system but I understand that a marketing video for the system, which included a scene of a police officer firing a gun at rioters in a training simulation, was sent abroad by a British company. The scene was entirely inappropriate and, as 



<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 1997 : Column: 84</I><P>
I explained to my hon. Friend on 18 August, it has been dropped from the current marketing video. I am grateful to my hon. Friend for drawing the scene to my attention. The training system is used by the City of London, Metropolitan and Surrey police forces. None of these forces uses the system for baton round training. The training referred to in my letter of 18 August concerned an invitation to tender for the provision of a simulator to help in the training by the Royal Ulster Constabulary of its baton round gunners. That letter did not call upon Surrey police to take any action.
<P>

<a name="71216w02.html_para6">The Home Office has not discussed with the Association of Chief Police Officers circumstances in which officers would be permitted to use firearms against unarmed demonstrators because, as I said in my answer on 12 June 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, column <i>512</i>, it would be entirely wrong for police forces to train officers to fire on unarmed demonstrators. All officers trained in the use of plastic baton round launchers have been trained in accordance with Home Office guidelines on the use of baton rounds for dealing with public disorder. Any officer using force must comply with section 3 of the Criminal Law Act 1967 which provides that a person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in preventing crime or arresting an offender. I would expect chief officers to ensure that this is fully reflected in any training of officers.

 The Harmondsworth Detention Centre is managed under contract to the Home Office by Group 4 Total Security Ltd., and meals are prepared for detainees by contract caterers.

The contract caterers respond to comments from the adviser and monitor the "take up" rate of the menus offered, so as to be able to amend the meals and menus appropriately.
<P>

<a name="71216w03.html_para1">The centre is also regularly inspected for food hygiene by the Environmental Health Officer of the London Borough of Hillingdon in accordance with the Food Safety Act 1990.

<a name="71216w03.html_para2">Group 4's local managers check daily that meals prepared are within the "use by" date, and also sample the meals on a random basis and in response to any complaints. Meals are also regularly sampled by members of the Harmondsworth Visiting Committee, an independent body appointed by the Home Secretary to monitor the care and treatment of detainees. Immigration Service staff also occasionally sample meals.

 We fully recognise the value of work which section 11 grant has supported and the importance that local authorities and communities attach to this. We have commissioned a study to consider how such support needed for members of ethnic minorities can best be provided. The exercise is being conducted by my Department in collaboration with the Department for Education and Employment. I very much hope that local authorities and other interested parties will contribute views. The findings of the study, which are expected to be available in the spring, will inform our further consideration.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 It is our policy not to detain unaccompanied minors save only in very exceptional circumstances. Normal procedure is to grant temporary admission wherever possible, either into the care of a close relative or friend, or into the care of social services. In the few instances where detention is considered essential, accommodation appropriate to the age of the detainee is provided and a member of staff is appointed to act as a chaperon as necessary.

 The performance of private sector security companies employed under contract to manage and operate immigration detention centres is monitored by on-site Immigration Service staff and, where appropriate, by specialist Home Office personnel. In addition, Immigration Service staff based at Immigration Service Headquarters are involved in the quality assurance process and hold regular review meetings with senior management from Group 4 Total Security Ltd., and Wackenhut United Kingdom Ltd., in order to ensure that the highest standards are maintained and that all contractual obligations are met.
<P>

<a name="71216w03.html_para5">It is not normal policy or practice to detain unaccompanied minors and these are held only in the most exceptional of circumstances.

 Our normal policy is not to detain unaccompanied minors, and no accommodation is specifically set aside for their use in immigration detention centres.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w03.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Many of those who are liable to detention under powers conferred by the Immigration Act 1971, and who may at some stage have sought asylum in the United Kingdom, are not in possession of documents satisfactorily establishing either their identity or nationality. Some hold identity documents but claim to be younger than the ages shown therein. It is perhaps inevitable in these circumstances that there will be some cases where the precise age of the individual is in dispute.
<P>

<a name="71216w03.html_para6">During 1997, 12 persons claimed to be under 18 years of age while detained at Campsfield House. Information on when those persons first entered detention, under Immigration Act powers, at Campsfield House is given in the table. None of those persons were detained at Campsfield House as at 10 December 1997.
<P>

<a name="71216w03.html_para7">Age assessment remains an inexact science and definitive assessments cannot be made. The Immigration Service liaises closely with the Refugee Council's Panel of Advisers for Refugee Children. All cases where there is a dispute as to the age of an applicant are referred to the Panel.
<P>

<a name="71216w03.html_para8">While there is no minimum age below which a person may not be detained under powers conferred by the Immigration Act, under current guidelines detention is not usually considered appropriate for unaccompanied children or for persons under the age of 18. It is normal practice to grant temporary admission to those who are clearly unaccompanied minors, usually into the care of social services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on prison policy and rules relating to the <i>(a)</i> issue of and <i>(b)</i> payment for telephone cards and access to and use of prison telephones for contact with close relatives outside the jurisdiction; and how many minutes and how many calls are permitted each week for prisoners who are (i) on remand and (ii) on trial. [20337]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 In accordance with the rules and policy set out in Prison Service Standing Order 5 and Circular Instructions 61/1989 and 21/1992 (copies of which are in the Library) governing prisoner access and use of cardphones, prisoners may purchase from the prison shop phonecards using their earnings or private cash. Foreign nationals with close family ties abroad are exempted from the limits on access to private cash which apply under the Incentives and Earned Privileges scheme.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para0">Current policy on conditions of use allow all prisoners to have free access to a cardphone during association hours and at such other times as is reasonably practicable. Cardphones should normally be available for use of a period of not less than two hours a day. However, governors have discretion to impose time limits or a booking system for each prisoner if this is necessary to ensure equitable access to cardphones in their establishment.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many family telephone calls and of what duration Brian McHugh was permitted to make in <i>(a)</i> September, <i>(b)</i> October and <i>(c)</i> November 1997. [20332]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Mr. McHugh made 34 calls in September 1997; 28 calls in October 1997; and 30 calls in November 1997. All the calls made were to members of Mr. McHugh's family. The length of Mr. McHugh's calls varied from three to 20 minutes.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para1">The standard procedures concerning the use of telephones by high risk prisoners at Belmarsh Prison do not set an upper limit on the duration of any telephone call. Prisoners cannot, however, make calls when their phonecards have expired or when the call would prevent another prisoner's pre-booked telephone call taking place.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what submissions he has received from <i>(a)</i> the legal representatives of Roisin McAliskey and <i>(b)</i> others concerning her proposed extradition; and if he will make a statement. [20284]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Roisin McAliskey's solicitors submitted formal representations on 28 November 1997 asking me, exceptionally, either to reconsider the authority to proceed issued on 2 January 1997 or to take a final decision on surrender under section 12 of the Extradition Act 1989 before a decision is reached in the committal proceedings.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para2">The Divisional Court ruled in 1994 that the Secretary of State does not have the power to reconsider an order to proceed (which would extend to an authority to proceed), once issued. Nor does section 12 of the Extradition Act 1989 allow me to take a decision, either

<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para3">I have agreed, without prejudice to a final decision by the courts on committal or my own on surrender, to start considering the representations put before me.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para4">In respect of submissions from others, since Roisin McAliskey was arrested for the purposes of extradition on 26 November 1996, 7 Parliamentary Questions have been tabled: 16 letters from right hon. and hon. Members and 162 letters from members of the public have been received. One letter was handed in to the Home Office during a demonstration on 20 November and approximately 85 messages have been received via the Internet.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. NcNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the principal purposes of the draft Additional Protocol to the Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons approved by the European Committee on Crime Problems in June 1997 and indicate the policy of Her Majesty's Government towards the draft. [20286]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Additional Protocol was adopted by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in September and will be opened for signature on 18 December 1997.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para5">The Protocol has two purposes. First, where a national from one state who is serving a custodial sentence in another state escapes from custody and returns to his home state, the Protocol allows the sentencing state, with the consent of the home state, to transfer the remainder of the sentence to the home state to continue enforcement. The consent of the fugitive offender is not required to such a transfer. This provision will be of particular value where the home state, for legal or constitutional reasons, does not extradite its own nationals and where at present no action can be taken against the fugitive offender.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para6">The Protocol also enables a serving prisoner who is the subject of a deportation or expulsion order which will result in his eventual removal to be transferred, without his consent but subject to certain safeguards, to the state named in the order to serve the remainder of his sentence. At present, such orders are normally activated only at the end of the sentence. Early activation of the order would enable the state of destination to attach appropriate post-release conditions in more serious cases.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para7">The Government support the Protocol and are considering what primary legislation would be needed before it could be ratified by the United Kingdom.

<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the differences in prison regime for prisoners in each class of risk assessment within the Category A band separately indicating the conditions for those prisoners presently held in HMP Belmarsh who continue to occupy cells previously designated as a special secure unit. [20334]




<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Category A prisoners are assigned to one of three escape risk classifications: standard risk, high risk and exceptional risk.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para8">It is not possible to give a definitive account of prisoner regime by escape category. This will vary with the facilities available within each prison and in particular tends to be significantly different between remand prisons, such as Belmarsh, and dispersal prisons, such as Whitemoor, which hold convicted Category A prisoners.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para9">Within dispersal prisons, additional restrictions will apply to exceptional risk prisoners who are held apart from other prisoners within a Special Secure Unit and who are subject to closed visits. In general terms, high risk prisoners within dispersal prisons have a similar regime to standard risk prisoners with a few additional constraints such as searching, the conduct of visits, allocation to activities, and vetting of letters and telephone calls.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para10">Because of the additional complexities of a large remand prison such as Belmarsh, and in particular the greatly increased levels of prisoner movement with the associated increased risks of escape, high risk prisoners at Belmarsh are held apart from the rest of the prison population within the High Secure Unit (HSU). The regime within the HSU is similar to that within the rest of the prison with the exception that prisoners do not have access to other parts of the prison and all activities such as visits, exercise and gymnasium are conducted within purpose-built facilities in the HSU building itself.
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department in what circumstances family visits for remand prisoners previously held in the Special Secure Unit at HMP Belmarsh and currently on trial is permitted in respect of the use of <i>(a)</i> the visitors' children's room and <i>(b)</i> children's books, crayons or toys. [20335]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 There is no specific children's room for visitors to those prisoners previously held in the Belmarsh Special Secure Unit. A box of toys and games is available for the use of visiting children.

<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. McNamara: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what record is maintained of the number of occasions on which remand prisoners are unable to appear in court as a result of injuries sustained en route; if he routinely receives reports of such injuries; and to whom trial judges report concerns in such cases. [20333]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w04.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Between April 1993 and July 1997, the responsibility for transporting to court all prisoners other than those in the highest security category has progressively been contracted out to the private sector.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para11">The Prisoner Escort and Custody Services of the Prison Service monitor all such contracts and require the submission of reports on all injuries sustained by prisoners while in the contractor's custody. These include details of the injuries sustained, the circumstances in which they were received, for example a road traffic accident, self harm, etc., and the action taken. Any such incident which may call into question the actions of the contractors or their staff is fully investigated by the prisoner escort monitor.




<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 1997 : Column: 92</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para12">Incidents involving injuries to prisoners in the custody of escort contractors while on their way to court are extremely rare. Only two cases have been recorded where they were serious enough to prevent attendance.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para13">Incidents relating to category A prisoners are reported to Prison Service Headquarters as well as being subject to full reports. However, figures relating to injuries to remand prisoners while in transit to court are not compiled centrally.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para14">Trial judges are able to express any concerns about the late delivery or non-delivery of prisoners to the escort contractor, the escort monitor, the establishment dispatching the prisoner or Prison Service Headquarters.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para15">All cases relating to prisoners moved by private sector contractors are investigated by the escort monitor. If, as a result of this investigation, a prisoner custody officer (PCO) is found to have been at fault, the escort monitor has the power under the Criminal Justice Act 1991 to recommend the revocation of the PCO's certificate.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para16">Also, under the terms of the contract, the escort monitor may impose penalty points in cases where the contractor has failed to deliver the service specified. These penalties may lead to the imposition of financial remedies.
<P>

<a name="71216w04.html_para17">Where individual PCOs have not performed their duties satisfactorily they will be subject to the contractor's own disciplinary procedures.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w05.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 There is currently only one special secure unit in operation at Whitemoor prison. Sir Donald Acheson visited the unit last month and I expect him to submit his report to the Prison Service shortly.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many persons currently serving a prison sentence in England and Wales will be subject upon completion of their sentence to an expulsion or deportation order to <i>(a)</i> Ireland, <i>(b)</i> states that are party to the European Convention on the Transfer of Sentenced Persons and <i>(c)</i> elsewhere. [20285]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Reliable information on those persons currently serving a prison sentence who may, on completion of their sentence, be subject to deportation action can be obtained only through examination of individual case records. Such information is, therefore, available only at disproportionate cost. Persons subject to deportation action are entitled to appeal against their stated removal destination and, hence, the issue of which country a person is to be removed to will not be resolved until their relevant appeal rights have been exhausted. In practice, reliable information on removal destination is not available centrally until removal has been effected. I regret that the information requested is not, therefore, available.

 Under the new school framework, recurrent funding will be provided by LEAs for community, foundation, and voluntary schools under revised local management of schools (LMS) arrangements.

<P>

<a name="71216w06.html_para0">LEAs will be responsible for all the costs of capital work at foundation schools, as they will be for community schools.

<a name="71216w06.html_para2">The majority of students over 50 are part-time and are therefore ineligible for student loans.

It provides for such treaties to be laid before Parliament for a period of 21 sitting days before the United Kingdom ratifies, accepts, approves or accedes to them. Since 1 January 1997 such treaties when laid before Parliament have been accompanied by an Explanatory Memorandum (copies of guidance for Departments entitled "Guidelines on Explanatory Memoranda for Treaties" were placed in the Libraries of both Houses).

<P>

<P>
<a name="71216w09.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The average cost per hour of any proceedings in the High Court is &#163;231.19. This includes the cost of maintaining the court room, paying the judiciary and providing administrative assistance. Detailed information is not collected on the cost per hour of proceedings in a VAT tribunal, but the Court Service estimates it to be about &#163;137. Neither figure includes the cost to HM Customs and Exercise of defending a VAT ruling.

 <i>(a)</i> My Department has commissioned no research specifically following up the concerns expressed in the NAO survey. However, both Professor Baldwin's recently published book "Small Claims in the County Courts in England and Wales" and the statistical monitoring undertaken by the Court Service are relevant. <i>(b)</i> Consideration is being given as to the feasibility of such a project.

<a name="71216w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 The report of Professor Baldwin's research "Monitoring the Rise in the Small Claims Limit: Litigants' Experiences of Different Forms of Adjudication" was published on 15 December. He was asked to interview two groups of litigants who had been involved in cases in the range &#163;1,000 to &#163;3,000: a control group whose cases had gone to trial in open court, and those whose cases had been dealt with as small claims arbitrations, and to report his findings.

 The small claims limit was increased to &#163;3,000 in January 1996. During 1996, 712 applications were made to rescind the automatic reference to arbitration, of which 586 were granted. Between January and October this year 696 applications were made and 539 were granted.

 In April 1994, the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council took over responsibility for research and postgraduate training in biochemical engineering from the former Science and Engineering Research Council. The accompanying figures show expenditure (in cash) on research and training over the last ten years. The research expenditure figure for 1994-95 is inflated because the SERC funded the research on the basis of claims whereas the BBSRC uses an expenditure profile. Similarly, the figures for expenditure on training after 1993-94 are best initial estimates, as the data were calculated on a different basis by the two Councils concerned.

 Benchmarking is a widely used management tool and the DTI's Management Best Practice Directorate has been closely involved in developing and promoting it. The Department has a dedicated central point which can advise on these and other quality tools and put staff in touch with others involved in benchmarking activity both within Government and elsewhere. The Department's own Quality Tool Kit also includes information on benchmarking. No consultation exercises have been undertaken on the use of these techniques.

<P>
<a name="71216w12.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Evans: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade if she will list her responsibilities in respect of issuing licences for oil exploration; what monitoring of companies after the issuing of such a licence is undertaken by her Department, with particular reference to the interpretation of clauses within the licence; what sanctions her Department has available in respect of companies found to have caused environmental damage through breach of their licence conditions; and what action her Department has taken in the past three years against such companies. [20107]

<P>
<a name="71216w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The Secretary of State grants licences to search and bore for, and get petroleum within Great Britain and her Continental Shelf. In issuing the licences, I seek to ensure the thorough exploration for and economic exploitation of petroleum, while having due regard to the interests of other users of the sea (where appropriate) and the possible impact of licensed activities upon the environment.
<P>

<a name="71216w12.html_para0">Activities carried out under petroleum licences are subject to the obligations contained in Model Clauses attached to the licence as well as the separate conditions controlling their timing, extent and method. The drilling of wells and the development of any discoveries are subject to separate consents which may attract conditions. Failure to comply with these obligations and consents may lead to the revocation of the licence. Compliance monitoring is undertaken by a team of inspectors based in the Department's Aberdeen office, as well as through returns submitted by licenses about their operations and random surveillance flights carried out on a regular basis.
<P>

<a name="71216w12.html_para1">Where petroleum operations have led to suspected breaches of legislation, then papers have been sent to the Procurator Fiscal for consideration of further action. In 1997, there have been three such cases.

 The UKAEA Board endorsed recommendations relating to the Dounreay Intermediate Level Waste Shaft at its meeting on 4 November. My officials immediately started studying the UKAEA's recommendations.

It is clearly important to allow time to give proper consideration to such important issues and it is my intention to consult the Scottish Office and DETR before making a decision.

<a name="71216w13.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The latest available information is as follows. Data are only available up to and including the third quarter of 1997. Similar data for the years 1998, 2008 and 2018 are not available. The previous Administration published energy projections for the UK as Energy Paper 65 in March 1995, which is available in the Libraries of both Houses. While these projections implicitly included the contribution from imports to the UK's energy supply, projections of imports themselves were not separately made.
<P>

<a name="71216w13.html_para1">It should be borne in mind that the UK also exports fuels, and has been a net exporter of fuels in both volume and value terms in each year since 1993. In 1996, net exports of fuels benefited the UK Balance of Payments by &#163;4.2 billion. Indications are that net exports of fuels will benefit the UK economy by a similar amount in 1997.

<a name="71216w13.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Garnier: </B> 
To ask the President of the Board of Trade what is the known extent of the United Kingdom's indigenous sources of coal, gas and oil; and what is her estimate, based on present consumption levels, of when each will run out. [21272] 
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w13.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 Remaining reserves in present discoveries of oil on the UK Continental Shelf at the end of 1996 are estimated to be up to 2,025 million tonnes. For gas the estimate is 1,960 billion cubic metres. These existing reserves, at 1996 depletion rates, could last for 16 and 22 years respectively. However, additional reserves continue to be discovered each year, and it is therefore likely that production of oil and gas will continue beyond these dates. Allowing for the full potential from as yet undiscovered reserves raises the estimates of reserves to 5,075 million tonnes of oil and 3,795 billion cubic metres of gas. At 1996 depletion rates, total oil and gas reserves could thus last for 39 and 42 years respectively. However these estimates are highly uncertain and future depletion rates will be affected by prices and the utilisation of the UK-Belgium gas interconnector which will provide opportunities for sales into Europe.
<P>

<a name="71216w13.html_para2">For coal, the remaining reserves at existing mines, which could be extracted economically, were estimated to be around 1 billion tonnes at the end of 1994, sufficient for 20 years at current rates of production. However, additional coal reserves in the UK are substantial and their availability and rate of depletion will depend on future energy prices and the demand for coal.

 The information requested is not available centrally, although vacancies, including those which have lasted for more than three months, are monitored at 31 March by the Pay Review Body, and the indications are of a small increase in the levels in 1997 compared to 1996 for Scotland.

 The production standards of the United Kingdom Register of Organic Food Standards (UKROFS) require abattoirs slaughtering organically reared animals to be registered with an approved organic inspection and certification body. Six such bodies exist in addition to UKROFS itself. Registration is designed to ensure that there is an audit trail to demonstrate that meat sold as organic has come from organically reared animals and to provide reassurance on welfare and handling standards. In order to register, the abattoir must demonstrate, to the inspection and certification body, compliance with the requirements. The costs vary, as each body has its own scale of charges, but typically would be in the region of &#163;210 per annum for registration and inspection plus compliance costs, for example of record keeping.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food when he will introduce further controls on specified risk material in Great Britain; if they will apply to imports; and if he will make a statement. [21486]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="71216w15.html_spnew15"><B> Dr. John Cunningham: </B> 
 I received advice from the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) in May that our existing controls on specified bovine material and heads of sheep and goats should be extended to cover the spleen of all sheep and goats and the spinal cord of sheep and goats aged over 12 months or with one permanent incisor tooth erupted through the gum. In addition, SEAC advised that all the controls should be applied to imports. I was pleased, therefore, when the European Commission adopted in July Decision 97/534/EC which provides for Community-wide controls on the use and destruction of specified risk material (SRM) and for controls on products of animal origin imported into the Community to ensure they are SRM-free. In reaching agreement on that Decision I accepted that the Community-wide controls should take effect from 1 January 1998. However, it subsequently became clear that the Decision would create serious practical difficulties, in particular for importers of pharmaceutical and medical products. The Commission therefore proposed a new Decision to replace 97/534/EC which took account of these problems.
The Standing Veterinary Committee failed to agree on a new Decision to replace 97/534 but did agree to postpone its implementation until 1 April 1998. As I have made clear previously, however, I am not prepared to tolerate any slippage in the introduction of Community-wide controls on SRM. I have therefore decided, in the interests of public health, to introduce unilateral interim controls in Great Britain. I have accordingly laid before Parliament today the Specified Risk Material Regulations 1997 and the Specified Risk Material Order 1997, both of which will come into force on 1 January 1998. Together, these consolidate existing national legislation providing for destruction of certain bovine materials and heads of sheep and goats and extend 



<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 1997 : Column: 135</I><P>
them to the spleen of all sheep and goats and spinal cord of sheep and goats over 12 months of age. They will also prohibit imports of specified risk material (SRM) except where they are for technical use. Imports of certain animal products for food and animal feed, including imports from EU Member States, will need to be accompanied by official veterinary certification confirming that they do not contain and were not derived from SRM. Products manufactured before 1 January 1998 and those containing material derived from Australia and New Zealand will be exempt from this requirement.
Equivalent legislation is being introduced in Northern Ireland to come into force at the same time.

 I am pleased to announce that Professor Krebs' Report on Bovine Tuberculosis in Cattle and Badgers is published today, as is the Government response to the report.
In November 1996, Professor John Krebs FRS began scientific review on behalf of the then Government into the links between bovine tuberculosis and badgers. His terms of reference were:

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>"To review the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle and badgers and assess the scientific evidence for links between them; to take account of EU policies on reducing and eliminating the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle; to take account of any risk to the human population; and accordingly to review, in the light of the scientific evidence, present Government policy on badgers and tuberculosis and to make recommendations".</FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="71216w16.html_para0">Professor Krebs was assisted in his review by Professor Roy Anderson FRS, Professor Ivan Morrison, Professor Douglas Young, Professor Tim Clutton-Brock FRS, and Dr. Christl Donnelly, as well as by two research assistants.
<P>

<a name="71216w16.html_para1">The Government are most grateful for the vigour, and rigour with which Professor Krebs and his Team have tackled their remit. They believe that the report represents the best available scientific advice across this difficult area which is of great interest both to farmers, whose livelihood can be badly affected by bovine tuberculosis, and to conservation groups. The Government are disposed to accept the recommendations in the report in principle, subject to further consideration of the public expenditure, legal and practical implications.
<P>

<a name="71216w16.html_para2">The report concludes that the available evidence, albeit largely indirect, strongly supports the view that badgers are a significant source of TB in cattle; but that it is not possible to state how large a contribution badgers make to cattle infection.
<P>

<a name="71216w16.html_para3">The main recommendations are that:
<P>

<a name="71216w16.html_para4">(a) the current policy of limited culling of badgers should end, and be replaced by a policy of no culling in most of the country;




<P>
<P><I>16 Dec 1997 : Column: 137</I><P>

<P>

<a name="71216w16.html_para5">(b) a trial should be set up in certain areas with a history of repeated occurrence of TB to quantify the efficacy and cost effectiveness of badger culling to control bovine TB. Culling of all badgers will take place in some of the trials areas on a carefully designed experimental basis. This will be compared with the culling of all badgers assumed to be linked with bovine TB outbreaks in other trial areas, and no culling of badgers in a last set of trial areas. The aim will be to establish a rigorous scientific foundation for policy in the future, which should benefit all with an interest in this area;
<P>

<a name="71216w16.html_para6">(c) outside the culling trial areas, there should be an experimental comparison of the effectiveness of different cattle husbandry methods in controlling bovine TB. The livestock industry should take the lead here, with help from Government;
<P>

<a name="71216w16.html_para7">(d) the Government's research strategy for bovine tuberculosis should be redirected, and in particular there should be new work on developing a vaccine to protect cattle against TB.
<P>

<a name="71216w16.html_para8">The Government recognise that the subjects covered by the report are of profound concern both to those in badger conservation groups, and to livestock farmers. Account also needs to be taken of the fact that bovine tuberculosis can be transmitted to humans, although the number of cases is very low because of measures such as milk pasteurisation.

<a name="71216w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The last time the European Commission submitted a proposal on farm animal welfare for consideration by the Council of Ministers was in June 1997. This was the proposal concerning additional standards for road vehicles used to carry livestock on journeys exceeding eight hours, which is currently under discussion in the Council. We have been pressing the Commission hard--but so far fruitlessly--to bring forward their overdue proposals to update the EU rules on the welfare of laying hens and the welfare of animals and poultry at slaughter, as well as their promised proposal to safeguard the health status of breeding pigs resting at staging points. These are all subjects we wish to progress during our forthcoming Presidency. We will keep up our pressure on the Commission.

<a name="71216w20.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Existing franchise agreements already include commitments by franchisees to introduce new rolling stock. However, we want to see even more new rolling stock orders and we expect the rolling stock leasing companies to play a big role in procuring new trains, taking reasonable commercial risks to achieve high levels of investment in the rail industry.

 Earlier this year, some American cars failed the pilot single vehicle approval test for various reasons related to at least one of the following--lighting, rear-view mirrors, interior fittings, exterior projections and deep-tinted glazing. However, the recent proposals to relax the SVA requirements and recognise American standards would reduce the reasons to lighting and, for a few cases only, mirrors and exterior projections.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 1997]:</i> We have received nearly 1,600 such representations, the majority of which are pre-printed duplicates. The mandatory aspects of SVA that were due to come into effect on 1 January 1998 for cars originating outside the European Union have for the time being been postponed until 1 May 1998, because the European Commission has instructed us to defer implementing the proposals set out in our recent consultation.

 I understand that Railtrack's rules and procedures for signalling works testing are set out in mandatory Railway Group Standards.

The safe maintenance and testing of railway signalling is a matter for Railtrack, unless there is reason to believe that their systems are deficient. The Health and Safety Executive has informed me that Railtrack's overall performance in terms of signalling safety demonstrates a high standard, and that it has no reasons at present for major concerns on this subject.

 The Government are currently in the middle of their Comprehensive Spending Review. We are also working hard on developing an integrated transport strategy, the conclusions of which will be published in a White Paper next Spring.

<a name="71216w22.html_para1">The Government are committed to retaining public expenditure next year within the overall planned spending limits and some tough decisions have had to be made. Within my Department's total spending ceiling, however, I shall be making some changes. In particular, I shall make some extra resources available for health and safety and environment protection, and make sure that we derive the best possible value from transport expenditure. With the latter in mind, I shall be increasing 1998-99 provision for trunk roads maintenance compared with provision this year to prevent further wasteful deterioration and for grant aimed at taking freight off the roads.

<a name="71216w23.html_para3">Two of these submarines (Renown and Repulse) are to undergo defuelling, prior to interim storage afloat pending disposal. These are the only submarines which contain high level waste in the form of the spent fuel cores. I am withholding information about the exact amount of high level material contained within the submarines under exemptions 1a-c of the Code of Practice on Access to Government information.
<P>

<a name="71216w23.html_para4">Immediately after the defuelling process there are 75 tonnes of intermediate level material and 140 tonnes of low level material, which will decay in time, in each submarine. Within the intermediate level material there is a mix of long life and short life material, decaying at different rates, and it is not possible to estimate readily the tonnages of radioactive material on individual submarines at this time. During storage afloat, the submarines are regularly monitored and maintained to ensure that they pose no health hazard to dockyard workers or the public.

<P>
<a name="71216w23.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 In 1994 the First Battalion, The Royal Irish Regiment was stationed in Cyprus as a resident battalion, the manning requirement for which was 539 officers and men. It returned to the United Kingdom in May 1995 and converted to its current primary role of a mechanised infantry battalion with a manning requirement of 625 officers and men. Since then the battalion has completed one six month operational tour in Northern Ireland from December 1995 to June 1996 and on 15 December 1997 it deployed on another such tour, also in Northern Ireland. In both cases the minimum manning strength required is 510 officers and men. On current plans, the battalion is unlikely to be deployed on another operational tour in the next two years.
