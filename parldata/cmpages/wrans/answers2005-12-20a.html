 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the effect on flooding in the Severn Basin of the strategy to reduce water levels in the Clywedog Dam; and if she will make a statement.  [37111]</p>




<p><a name="st_40"><a name="51220w05.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Environment Agency is the principal authority with responsibility for flood risk management in England. The extent to which both the Clywedog and Vyrnwy Reservoirs can help mitigate the effects of flooding in the Severn Basin is limited as any beneficial effect to alleviate flooding rapidly diminishes downstream. Other parts of the catchment also contribute floodwater and the proportion that the reservoir &quot;holds back&quot; becomes smaller as the total catchment area gets bigger.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51220w05.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_35">The catchment area above Clywedog Dam is 2 per cent. of the entire catchment draining to Shrewsbury and 1 per cent. of the catchment draining to Bridgnorth. Previous studies have indicated that the influence of floodwater storage at Llyn Clywedog has extended only as far as Buttington.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51220w05.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_36">A study in 1999 for the Environment Agency confirmed that existing reservoir flood drawdown controls, in place for many years, adequately maximise the opportunity for local flood alleviation. The findings of this study have been reviewed as part of the Fluvial Severn Flood Risk Management Strategy, which was issued for public consultation (including to local MPs) in the summer of 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51220w05.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_37">The Environment Agency&#039;s strategy to lower water levels in these reservoirs means more storage being available to hold water during periods of heavy rainfall. This assists flood risk management in the Severn Basin insofar as the reservoirs influence this. However, it should be remembered that the primary function of the reservoirs is to maintain flow in the River Severn during dry periods.

Approximately 90 per cent. of these were non-native species. Of these, only one species, the Melbourne trap-door spider (Stanwellia grisea), is considered to be venomous to man. One confirmed, and two unconfirmed, specimens of this species were intercepted on tree ferns imported from Australia in 2004. This spider has very large fangs and can inflict a painful, but not dangerous bite. Since this find, tree ferns have been subject to greater control prior to export from Australia and New Zealand and so live invertebrates such as this are less likely to be encountered on this commodity.

1. If the average temperature has been recorded as, or is forecast to be, 0 C or below over seven consecutive days at a weather station, then a cold weather payment is &quot;triggered&quot; for all eligible customers whose postcode is linked to that weather station.<br>

2. The weather station associated with postcodes in Midlothian did not trigger last winter.<br>

3. The amount for Scotland is based on the number of people who were estimated to qualify because the weather station linked to their postcode triggered last winter. The number of estimated qualifiers was obtained from the benefit systems at the end of October before last winter. It excludes people on income support and income-based jobseeker&#039;s allowance who qualified because they had a disabled child aged five or over and who received support for that child via child tax credit.<br>

<p><a name="st_88"><a name="51220w11.html_spnew2"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The increase in expenditure by the national health service on abortions is likely to be due to a number of factors.

 In the United Kingdom mifepristone (RU486) and the emergency contraceptive pill (as Levonelle-2) have been available as prescription-only medicines since 1991, following advice from the then Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) that was based on a review of all the available evidence for safety, efficacy and quality.

<a name="qnpa_23">The safety of mifepristone and the emergency contraceptive pill are also monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) on a continual basis using both UK and international data. Thus, yellow card reports of suspected adverse drug reactions, periodic safety update reports submitted by marketing authorisation holders and new research published in the medical literature are reviewed regularly. In the event that these processes identify information that changes the balance of risks and benefits of a medicine, advice is sought from the Commission on Human Medicines, formerly the Committee on Safety of Medicines, and its expert advisory groups.

</p>


<p>

 Health Service Guidance 95(18) sets out the arrangements for the handling and laundering of linen and states the importance of securing the disinfection of used and infected linen, including uniforms. The guidance recommends that a wash at 65 degrees Celsius ( <sup>0</sup> C) for not less than 10 minutes, or at 71 <sup>0</sup> C for not less than three minutes, is more than adequate for uniforms. Most uniforms can be safely processed at this temperature; indeed white garments

<i>[holding answer 26 October 2005]:</i> The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has been commissioned to prepare definitive guidance on the prevention, identification, management and treatment of obesity. This is expected to be published in February 2007, after full consultation. The Department&#039;s interim Obesity Care Pathway is intended for use by frontline health professionals in primary care to help manage patients who are overweight and/or obese. As part of the process of developing the draft Obesity Care Pathway, early drafts were shared with some interested stakeholders between September and November, to ascertain their views on how the care pathway might be implemented.

<p><a name="st_169"><a name="51220w20.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Byrne: </b> 
 As set out in &quot;Commissioning a Patient Led NHS&quot;, primary care trusts (PCTs) will be required to strengthen their commissioning function. They will need to ensure access and choice to a range of high quality health services and to ensure that the Government&#039;s commitments to health, reducing health inequalities and health services are delivered for local people. They will also be required to manage contracts on behalf of their practices and public, engage with local people and other local service providers to ensure patients&#039; views are properly heard, and to be responsible for emergency planning.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51220w20.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_125">The policy, in relation to service-provision, is that this will be a matter for PCTs to determine locally. Any move away from direct provision of services will be a decision for the local national health service within the framework set out in the forthcoming White Paper and after local consultation, including staff.

Notes:<br>

1. Due to small numbers, the calculation of the median wait is prone to fluctuation at PCT and strategic health authority level. Care should be taken when interpreting these figures.<br>

2. Waiting times apply to consultant-led appointments only. Services in many areas are now run by multi-disciplinary teams.<br>

<p><a name="st_176"><a name="51220w21.html_spnew3"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton </b> 
<i>[holding answer 8 December 2005]:</i> Quality assurance is an integral part of all screening programmes. Quality assurance standards have been developed and piloted by the UK National Screening Committee&#039;s national screening programme for sight threatening retinopathy. A full list of the quality assurance standards can be found on the National Screening Programme&#039;s website at: www.nscretinopathy.org.uk. Screening programme managers are responsible for ensuring that programmes meet overall quality requirements. Strategic health authorities are responsible for ensuring action is taken on quality assurance recommendations.

In 2000, weighting to compensate for non-response was introduced to the GHS. This is described in detail in the 2000 report. The effect of weighting on the smoking data is slight, increasing the estimated overall prevalence by one percentage point.<br>

The unweighted base for 2003 is of similar size to the unweighted base for earlier years. In 2000, weighting to compensate for non-response was introduced to the GHS. This is described in detail in the 2000 report. The effect of weighting on the smoking data is slight, increasing the estimated overall prevalence by one percentage point.<br>

The planned reductions made in funding for the risk provision associated with the ship&#039;s combat system and funding for setting up initial support arrangements, which were listed in the 2005 major projects report, do not materially change the ship&#039;s capability. The reduction in funding of the incremental acquisition plan listed in the 2004 and 2005 major projects reports means that a number of capabilities over and above those originally planned for the first of class ship are not currently expected to be fitted to the class. These included enhanced electronic warfare capabilities. However, the Type-45 has been designed to enable its capability to be upgraded through life, and these capabilities may be added at a later stage.

Assessment of suitability is often facilitated through completion of a pre-qualification questionnaire.

<a name="51220w40.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_142">There is no reason to believe that the introduction of home information packs will have an adverse effect on the housing market. These reforms are designed to improve the home buying process by making it more transparent and reducing the current high rate of transaction failure. A more efficient system will have clear benefits for the housing market and the UK economy. The information in the pack will help achieve the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s goal of sustainable home ownership, by ensuring that buyers are not faced with unexpected repairs and other commitments they cannot afford. A more efficient housing market will also facilitate greater flexibility and labour mobility. The partial regulatory impact assessment on home information packs shows that the cost of the new system will be broadly neutral and a copy of this has been deposited in the Library of the House. The only new cost being imposed on the system overall is the cost of a home condition report in a proportion of transactions. Any new and additional costs will be offset by savings from a reduction in wasted costs that are currently running at over &#163;1 million per day.

The estimates published in 2002 were the mid-2001 population estimates and these were the first mid-year population estimates to use the 2001 Census results. The standard &#039;cohort component&#039; methodology was used, in that Census data were updated to reflect births, deaths, migration, and ageing of the population between the date of the Census and the mid-year point (approximately 9 weeks). In a Census year the mid-year estimates are rebased on the most recent Census before the method is applied.</p>

This was in respect of the internal-migration component of the population estimates. This change was widely consulted on before introduction. It was extensively peer-reviewed both within the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and by external academic and local authority experts. The then Liaison Group on Population Statistics (now the Central Local information Partnership (CLIP) Population Subgroup) was also fully consulted on the change. This change, in simplified terms, introduced the use of patient records to allocate migration within (former) health authorities instead of electoral roll information. This was widely thought to be a more reliable method for calculating internal migration. This change was documented in Population Trends 101. No specific racial impact assessment was carried out as part of this methodological change. However, consultation confirmed the recommendation that the methodology should be implemented to improve the quality of population estimates.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_170">The closest available geography to electoral wards, for which population estimates are available, is Census Area Statistics (CAS) wards. This geography was created for outputs from the 2001 Census and is based mainly on 2003 electoral wards. It is necessary to convert electorate counts to the CAS ward geography and therefore the electorate counts are not necessarily consistent with data published elsewhere.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_171">The latest available population data available at ward level is for mid-2002, published in April 2005. The ward electorate counts are for December 2002 parliamentary electors, including attainers. No adjustment has been made to reflect the difference between these two timepoints. There are a number of wards that are split by parliamentary constituency i.e. they fall within two or more parliamentary constituencies. These are shown by an asterisk * alongside their ward name, and appear under both constituencies (except where the split is across the English/Welsh border). Electorate and population figures for the whole ward are shown. Some wards will therefore be double counted. It is not possible to split the data for these wards.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_172">There are a number of limitations with the data that mean that some care should be taken with interpretation of the results.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_173">There is inevitably some double counting of the registered electorate as electoral registration officers vary in how quickly they remove people from the registers after they have moved away from an area or after they have died. In addition, people can register in more than one place.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_174">The population data are estimates and as such are subject to a margin of confidence. This margin of confidence is proportionately larger for ward level estimates than for local authority level estimates. These estimates have been published with the status of &quot;experimental statistics&quot;. Therefore, the estimates, and figures derived from them, should be treated with some care.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_175">Finally, there a number of other definitional differences between electorates and population estimates. Population estimates include all those usually resident irrespective of nationality, whereas the parliamentary electorate excludes foreign nationals (but Commonwealth and Irish citizens are included). Overseas electors are included in electorate data but not population estimates. Comparable ward counts of local government electors are not readily available.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_176">There is a relatively small number of wards (11) where the electorate counts are more than 10 per cent. greater than the population estimate. The majority of such cases are likely to be attributable to a limitation in the methodology used to convert electorate counts to a CAS ward geography, though the other limitations set out above will also have an effect.</p>

The cost of the refurbishment is provisionally estimated at &#163;150 million over 30 years, as against relocation options ranging from &#163;155 to &#163;250 million. The NAO points out, however, that these figures would need to be offset against current annual expenditure on maintaining and operating the existing BPR building of some &#163;4.4 million, which, discounted over 30 years, would equate to about &#163;81 million.

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has raised Building Regulations energy efficiency standards in 2002 and 2005 and will do so again in 2006. From next April standards will be improved by around 20 per cent. for new dwellings and up to 27 per cent. for other new buildings to levels that are up to 40 per cent. higher than those in place in 1997. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister is also working with the construction industry, including building control bodies, to facilitate compliance.

 I would draw my honourable friend&#039;s attention to the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&#039;s press notice of 13 September in which it was announced changes to the Building Regulations and the implementation of the technical provisions of the EU energy performance of buildings directive. These measures come into effect in April 2006 and will make a major contribution to the UK&#039;s commitment to combat climate change delivering increased energy standards of up to 27 per cent. for new buildings. This is on top of significant improvements in energy efficiency in the 2002 changes to building regulations. There is a three-year derogation period within the directive to apply fully the administrative provisions requiring the provision of information.

 Planning policy guidance on development and flood risk is contained in PPG25, published in 2001. It aims to ensure that flood risk is taken into account at all stages in the planning process to avoid inappropriate development in areas at risk of flooding and to direct development away from areas at highest risk. On 5 December the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister issued for consultation proposals for a new PPS25 which will strengthen and clarify the policy, and a flooding direction which will provide greater scrutiny for major developments proposed in flood risk areas.

 Expenditure on concessionary fares is funded via the formula grant settlement. Formula grant is an unhypothecated block grant. This means that councils are able to spend the money on any services. It is not therefore possible to calculate how much funding has been allocated to each authority with respect to concessionary fares.

 Northamptonshire recently received a boost to its higher education provision when the University College in Northampton gained the Royal Charter and official university status. This is good news for the communities of Northamptonshire who will benefit from the university located at the heart of the county and the university is looking to expand its provision significantly over the next five years. In addition, the Tresham Institute serves the communities of North Northamptonshire, providing Post-16 education, vocational training and a wide variety of adult learning courses.

 It was recently announced that Home Information Packs will become mandatory from 1 June 2007, and the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has no plans to postpone this date. We have listened to views from across the industry, in order to achieve a date that represents the appropriate balance between the various interests. The Government are satisfied that this date provides the time needed to ensure that home information packs can be introduced successfully throughout England and Wales.

<p><a name="st_219"><a name="51220w47.html_spnew1"><b> Yvette Cooper: </b> 
 No specific research has been commissioned on this, as there is no reason to believe that the introduction of home information packs will have a significant effect on house prices. The only new cost being imposed on the system overall is the cost of a home condition report in a proportion of transactions. Together with the rest of the information in the pack, this will help to ensure that house prices are set more realistically and buyers are not faced with unexpected repair bills and other commitments they cannot afford. The reforms are designed to improve the home buying process by making it more transparent and reducing the current high rate of transaction failure. A more efficient system will benefit the housing market and the UK economy.

The Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation applies equally to UK Overseas Territories as it does to the UK. Article 5 provides that airlines are not required to seek prior permission for non-stop flights across the territory of another state or to make a non-traffic stop in another state. Refuelling is a non-traffic stop (i.e. where no passengers or cargo are taken on board or dropped off).

Notes:<br>

1. Staffordshire county council area was not included in a single social fund district, but used to be part of the area covered by Staffordshire and Derwent and Trent social fund districts. It is now part of Staffordshire Jobcentre Plus district. The latter was formed in November 2002 by combining Burton-on-Trent (from Derwent and Trent social fund district) with Staffordshire social fund district. Tamworth borough council area used to be part of Staffordshire social fund district and is now part of Staffordshire Jobcentre Plus district. The three areas for which data is given above are thus different, so the data is not comparable.<br>

2. Initial awards do not include awards made after review.<br>

 The Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003 amends the Road Traffic Act 1988 to authorise the police to conduct compulsory roadside test for impairment and for the presence of drugs. Any equipment used to test for drugs by testing a specimen of sweat or saliva must be of a type approved by the Secretary of State. Since there is as yet no such equipment, tests cannot at present be conducted. It is therefore not possible to give the unit cost per test or the cost of the equipment necessary to conduct the test.

We aim to acknowledge all new applications within one week of receipt. If there is a problem with the payment in connection with an application, the applicant will receive a reply rather than an acknowledgement. Other casework-related correspondence is not at present routinely acknowledged. General Group deals with casework correspondence as part of substantive consideration of applications.

 The Government are keen to use education as part of a penalty where it is appropriate. Rehabilitation courses for persons convicted of drink driving have been available nationally since 2000 and have proved successful. On this basis, we propose through the Road Safety Bill, currently under consideration in another place, to provide the courts with powers to refer people convicted of speeding and careless driving offences to retraining courses with the incentive of a reduction in disqualification or penalty points. There are no plans to extend the scope to non- endorsable offences including seat belt offences.

 The Department completed research into the effectiveness of airbags in motor vehicles in 2003. The principal findings were presented at the International Research Council on the Biomechanics of Impact International Conference 2002. This project focused on obtaining an improved understanding of the overall benefits and risks involved with both front and side airbag deployments for a range of vehicle occupants. The project determined that in general frontal airbags offer extra protection to vehicle occupants, with significant overall benefits for head injuries. The benefits for thoracic injuries are less clear, and airbags are less effective at reducing injuries in certain types of accidents (such as angled impacts, pole impacts and high intrusion impacts). There is insufficient data available at present to draw any firm conclusions on the risks and benefits of deploying side airbags.

 The performance regime the Department has in place with franchised train operators takes account of all train lateness on a train-by-train basis. When financial calculations are made every four-weeks, a single payment encompasses all the bonus and penalty elements occurring during that time period. These in turn aggregate into annual sums shown on the following table, which represent the net performance bonus to (or penalty payment from), each train operating company in each year requested.

 Since the introduction of Local Transport Plans in 2000, East Sussex has received around &#163;58 million for local transport improvements and maintenance schemes.

Funding for trunk roads is neither allocated nor recorded on a county by county basis but we can say that around &#163;22 million has been invested in the following schemes in East Sussex since 2000: A27 Polegate Bypass (&#163;19.3 million); A27 Ashcombe Roundabout (&#163;1.3 million) and A21 John&#039;s Cross Roundabout (&#163;1.7 million).

 The Department for Transport does not issue operating permits to foreign aircraft operating on a non-commercial basis and consequently does not hold information of this nature.
