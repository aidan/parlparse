<i>[holding answer 16 December 2003]:</i> The report referred to by my hon. Friend is an early draft of the European Parliament's Opinion on a proposed Directive on the management of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste. The final version was issued on 1 December 2003, reference A5&#150;0442/2003.
<P>

<a name="31217w01.html_para3">The Government shares the European Parliament's opposition to the draft Directive. Our views are set out in Explanatory Memorandum 8990/03, a copy of which is in the Library. Proposals for developing a policy for the long-term management of solid radioactive waste in the UK were consulted on in 2001. The Committee on Radioactive Waste Management has now been established to assess all of the options and to make recommendations to Government.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on schemes for emissions trading which are

<P><I>17 Dec 2003 : Column 901W</I><P>
compliant with EU legislation on emissions trading, with particular reference to the <i>(a)</i> energy and <i>(b)</i> aviation sectors.  [143060]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The EU Emissions Trading Scheme is due to start in 2005 and will cover carbon dioxide emissions from certain industrial activities throughout the EU, including from the power generation sector. The UK is on course to meet the deadline of the end of the year to introduce the Regulations that will implement this scheme in the UK.
<P>

<a name="31217w01.html_para4">The first phase of the scheme runs from 2005 to 2007. The scheme can be expanded in future phases to include other gases and industrial sectors. The European Commission is required to report to the European Parliament and Council by June 2006 on, inter alia, how and whether the scheme should be expanded to other sectors, including transport.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mrs. Spelman: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what studies the Government has made of <i>(a)</i> nitrogen oxides and <i>(b)</i> sulphur oxides trading schemes in those countries where such a scheme is operating.  [143280]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government are aware of a number of emissions trading schemes around the world, including those covering nitrogen oxides and sulphur oxides such as the US Acid Rain Programme and the RECLAIM programme for nitrogen oxides and sulphur dioxide emissions in the Los Angeles basin. The consultants that worked on the UK's National Allocation Plan for the EU Emissions Trading Scheme had previously studied these programmes in the US.
<P>

<a name="31217w01.html_para5">Defra is currently drafting the implementing regulations for the EU ETS and while doing so officials have assessed emissions trading schemes in other countries, including those mentioned above, to find examples of best practice in other schemes.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many speeches have been made by each Minister in her Department since 1 January on fisheries, excluding fresh water fishing, and what percentage this represents of the total number of ministerial speeches made by her Department's ministers in that time.  [142727]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w01.html_spnew7"><B> Margaret Beckett: </B> 
 Since 1 January, three formal speeches on fisheries issues have been given by Defra Ministers, and represent just under 3 per cent. of the total number of Ministerial speeches made on the Departments areas of responsibility, which also include: sustainable development; the environment (i.e. all water issues, air quality, local environment including noise, waste, climate change, biodiversity, energy efficiency and fuel poverty); all agriculture, including GM; food and rural affairs.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how much money was invested in flood defence schemes in the Yorkshire and Humber region in each of the past five years.  [143306]

<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Defra provides grant aid to the flood and coastal defence operating authorities to support their capital schemes to reduce flood risk. These projects must meet specified criteria and an appropriate priority score to attract Defra funding but decisions regarding which projects to promote and their timing rest with these authorities. The principal operating authority for flood risk is the Environment Agency (EA) but local authorities (LAs) and, in areas with special drainage needs, internal drainage boards (IDBs) also carry out works on a much smaller scale overall.
<P>

<a name="31217w01.html_para6">Investment in flood defence schemes in Yorkshire and Humber was as set out in the table. For the Agency, this represents their total capital expenditure; for LAs and IDBs the figures represent grant payments from Defra which form a proportion of the total grant eligible cost (25 per cent. (45 per cent. for tidal or sea defence schemes) up to April 2001 and 45 per cent. thereafter). Local authorities are eligible for further support for their balance of grant costs from the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister through its local authority funding mechanism.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what guidance has been given to local authorities in receipt of DEFRA funding for coastal and inland flood protection projects on the use of timber from legal and sustainable sources; and if she will make a statement.  [142229]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 On 28 July 2000 the then Environment Minister, the right hon. Michael Meacher, announced the Government's policy that central departments and their agencies will actively seek to procure timber and timber products from sources independently validated as legal and sustainably managed. Mr. Meacher also wrote to all English Local Authorities in 2002 exhorting them to adopt responsible timber procurement policies.
<P>

<a name="31217w01.html_para8">Concern over the use of tropical hardwoods was identified in the mid 1990s. In 1994 the Chief Engineer of the former Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, a predecessor of this Department, wrote to Maritime District Councils to encourage them to consider the use of alternative materials and to procure timber from well-managed and sustainable sources.
<P>

<a name="31217w01.html_para9">The Department's Flood Management Division also organises an annual conference that is well attended by local government representatives. One of the papers in this year's conference was 'Responsible Use of Timber in Coastal and Fluvial Engineering' which covered the selection and procurement of timber and made the government position clear.

 When the Regulatory Impact Assessment was carried out in 1998 it was estimated that the total cost of compliance would be in the region of &#163;370 million. However the actual costs are not known as most of the compliance is being achieved through industry self-regulation.

 Through the continued efforts of the member states under EC Regulation 2037/2000 and other Parties to the Montreal Protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer, there has been a decline in the amount of chlorine in the upper and lower atmosphere. This is a good indicator of when the stratospheric ozone layer will recover. At the present rate the ozone layer is expected to start recovering by the middle of the century.
<P>

<a name="31217w02.html_para6">If action had not been taken under EC Regulation 2037/2000 and the Montreal Protocol the ozone layer would have continued to be destroyed, resulting in more ultra violet radiation reaching the ground, which would have had a detrimental affect on plant and animal life.
<P>

<a name="31217w02.html_para7">In the UK, the increase in ultra violet radiation could result in increases in skin cancer and eye cataracts as well a damage to marine life, which also form part of the food chain.

We have given priority of time and effort to completing these regulations, and now to working on associated guidance which needs to be in place in order for the exclusions and restrictions system to open for business. As a result of this, the timetable for the remaining regulations has been delayed, but we are firmly committed to ensuring the necessary regulations are made in time to allow the new right of public access under the Act to be rolled out as planned.

<a name="31217w03.html_wqn0"><B> Mrs. Helen Clark: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether the pollutant which caused the pollution incident on the River Nene earlier this year has been identified; what levels of the pollutant are still present; how much of the pollutant was discharged; whether the polluter has been identified; and what action is being taken.  [143260]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency (the Agency) has not identified the pollutant that caused this incident. Unusually in this case no immediate impact, such as fish mortality, was observed and the effects of the pollutant were identified following routine monitoring of the River Nene by the Agency in May of this year. This makes it likely that considerable time elapsed between the pollutant being discharged to the river and the environmental impact being observed. Under these circumstances, it is difficult to determine how much pollutant was discharged and to establish a link between a pollutant source and the incident.
<P>

<a name="31217w03.html_para0">The Agency await a report from its Special Enforcement team on whether it is possible to link evidence obtained from a possible source with the incident. However this may not be possible due to the probable time lapse between the incident and detection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Environment Agency vigorously follows the polluter pays principle. However, in this case the polluter has not yet been identified. It has not therefore been possible to initiate action to recover costs.

<P>
<a name="31217w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government support the Commission's objective to improve sheep and goat identification but are very concerned that they have failed to take full account of the particular needs and requirements of the UK's stratified and extensive sheep industry.
<P>

<a name="31217w03.html_para1">We are currently undertaking negotiations in the Council of Ministers and are pressing hard for a satisfactory outcome for the UK industry.

<a name="31217w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government are committed to sustainable forest management and is playing a leading role in international negotiations on forests in a number of fora, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF). The Government are also playing a major role internationally to combat illegal logging and its associated trade, in addition to seeking to ensure that the import of endangered timber species is in compliance with CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species.




<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 2003 : Column 908W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="31217w03.html_para2">Under EU law, a ban on the import of illegally logged timber can only be imposed at EU level. We are therefore playing an active role within the European Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT) process. On 13 October the EU Council of Ministers adopted Council Conclusions providing a broad endorsement of the FLEGT Action Plan, which addresses development co-operation, trade in timber, public procurement, private sector initiatives, financing and investment safeguards, money laundering and conflict timber
<P>

<a name="31217w03.html_para3">The Government are also keen to discourage consumers from purchasing illegally logged timber. For over three years UK central departments and their executive agencies have been required to actively seek to purchase their timber and timber related products from legal and sustainable sources. We believe the UK to be the first country to implement such a policy. The challenge is considerable and implementation has not been without difficulty, but already the effect is being felt in the UK and abroad. The UK Devolved Administrations and many local authorities in England have indicated that they have adopted similar policies or are considering doing so. Additionally, the UK Timber Trade Federation is developing a sustainable timber procurement policy for its members to consider adopting.

<P>
<a name="31217w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 December 2003]:</i> Water company leakage data are published annually by the Director General of Water Services in the annual "Security of supply, leakage and the efficient use of water" reports, which are available from the Library of the House. The reported leakage figures for the period 1993&#150;94 to 2002&#150;03 in Megalitres per day were as follows:

<P>

<a name="31217w05.html_para3">2. We have undertaken major refurbishment of both our UK offices during this period and the contracts have explicitly banned the use of any asbestos materials. During the refurbishment works we were able to remove (under controlled conditions) all materials containing asbestos and we are now confident that our UK offices are asbestos free.
<P>

<a name="31217w05.html_para4">3. Where DFID directly engages in building activities overseas, strict measures are taken in dealing with existing materials containing asbestos; and no new construction contains asbestos products.

<P>
<a name="31217w05.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK is the second largest bilateral donor of HIV/AIDS assistance to developing countries. Our bilateral funding has increased seven-fold, from &#163;38 million in 1997&#150;98 to more than &#163;270 million in 2002&#150;03. The UK was instrumental in setting up the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB and Malaria and has committed US$ 280 million over seven years to ensure it has long term stability of funding. The Government published its Call for Action on HIV/AIDS on World AIDS Day, which emphasises the UK's commitment to AIDS and highlights the need for stronger political direction; better funding; better donor coordination and better HIV/AIDS programmes.

 To ask the Secretary of State, Department for International Development what action his Department are taking to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS in Asia.  [144420]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w05.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 HIV/AIDS in Asia is a critical development issue. With 7.4 million Asians already infected, we are now seeing the epidemic spreading into previously unaffected areas and countries. If current rates of growth continue, there may be as many as 25 million people infected in India and 15 million in China, by 2010. Infections on this scale are of grave concern. If they continue at current rates and meaningful action is not taken, it is likely that by 2020 Asia will overtake Africa as the centre of the epidemic.
<P>

<a name="31217w05.html_para5">DFID's strategy in Asia is to focus efforts on preventing the further spread of the epidemic. In most countries the epidemic is still concentrated in vulnerable groups, principally sex workers and their clients, injecting drug users, and men who have sex with men. The challenge is to prevent spread into the general population. We have seen some success in Thailand and Cambodia from which it will be important to learn.
<P>

<a name="31217w05.html_para6">In addition to support through mechanisms such as the Global Fund for AIDS, TB and Malaria, and to e.g. vaccine research, DFID supports major HIV/AIDS control initiatives in eight countries in Asia. Current commitments are in excess of &#163;260 million. Our focus at country level is on support to the development and implementation of effective national AIDS strategies and plans, in partnership with governments, civil

 To ask the Secretary of State, Department for International Development what discussions he has had with British companies about the support they could offer his Department in assisting developing countries to reduce the impediments to formalising land ownership rights for poor people in these countries.  [144414]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w05.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </B> 
 DFID has had contact with a range of British companies and other sources of expertise such as government-owned agencies, research organisations, universities and non-government organisations in the context of its work in Ghana, Guyana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda and Southern Africa (South Africa and Lesotho). Our contacts range from simple exchange of information to more detailed discussions about implementation of projects. We fully appreciate the skills and expertise that British companies bring to these programmes. We also endeavour to bring in developing country and international experience where appropriate.

 To ask the Secretary of State, Department for International Development what recent assessment he has made of the impact of the security fence on the humanitarian situation of Palestinians.  [144415]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w05.html_spnew8"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The livelihoods of thousands of Palestinians have been drastically affected by the separation of villages from their agricultural land and water resources. The fence fragments communities and isolates people from vital social support networks. Residents are being cut off from schools, universities and medical care. According to the latest Israeli Government projections approximately 210,000 acres, or 14.5 per cent. of West Bank land, excluding East Jerusalem, will lie between the fence and the Green Line. This land is some of the most fertile in the West Bank and is home to 274,000 people. Of those, some 70,000 do not have Israeli residency permits and, as a consequence, may feel it necessary to move east of the fence in order to retain access to basic services.

<a name="31217w06.html_para2">DFID has assisted the Mozambique Government both through support to the general budget and to specific flood-recovery projects. An example of the latter is a &#163;7.4 million project to repair the main national road crossing the Limpopo valley which was washed away in the floods.

 Gender equality and the empowerment of women are very important for the elimination of poverty. A large percentage of the poor in developing countries are women.
<P>

<a name="31217w06.html_para5">All DFID staff have a responsibility to ensure that gender issues are addressed in development programmes. However, social development advisers work as part of teams in all DFID country offices and have special expertise in gender issues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w06.html_spnew5"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 DFID accounts for expenditure on forestry but does not distinguish between different types of forests. The following figures apply to forests in general and not specifically to rainforests. They relate to bilateral expenditure and are exclusive of spending on research under the Forestry Research Programme, which has averaged about &#163;2.5 million per annum since 1997.
<P>

<a name="31217w06.html_para6">In financial year 1997&#150;98 expenditure was &#163;22.1 million, on 199 projects. In financial year 2002&#150;03 expenditure was &#163;20.6 million, on 99 projects. Expenditure was fairly constant during this six-year period but there was a steady decline in the number of projects. This is a consequence of a focus on a smaller number of larger projects, more directly in support of poverty reduction. In addition, the last six years has seen the closure of a number of smaller programmes, particularly in Latin America.

 DFID's Policy Division has established a team on 'Poverty Reduction in Difficult Environments'. This team is developing innovative policy options for working more effectively in places where the state is unable or unwilling to take an active role in delivering poverty reduction. This includes states seen as 'weak and failing' as well as most conflict-affected states.
<P>

<a name="31217w06.html_para8">Through a series of seminars, studies and workshops we are seeking to improve our understanding of the internal and external causes of states that do not focus their policies on poverty reduction. This includes whether it is possible to identify in advance potential problem states, and then use preventative measures.
<P>

<a name="31217w06.html_para9">This issue is a high priority for the Department for International Development. We are also working closely with the Prime Minister's Strategy Unit to develop cross- Government policy on 'weak and failing' states.

<P>
<a name="31217w06.html_spnew7"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The UK Government are committed to playing their full part in helping countries to achieve the Education for All goals. DFID is the fourth largest bilateral donor supporting basic education and the Department's investment is set to increase further over the next five years&#151;to more than &#163;1 billion&#151;including substantial additional funding for FTI countries such as Ethiopia and India.
<P>

<a name="31217w06.html_para10">At the Fast Track Initiative meeting held in Oslo on 20&#150;21 November 2003 it was agreed that FTI funding will now be extended to all low-income countries that are working towards the EFA goals, and that most additional funding will be secured at country level rather than through a global funding mechanism.
<P>

<a name="31217w06.html_para11">Accordingly, DFID will continue to channel our growing support to education through our bilateral country programmes in the form of long term, flexible and predictable funding in support of the Government's own development plans. We believe this is the best way to provide flexible financing, improve harmonisation and reduce transaction costs. We will continue to press for closer donor collaboration to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of all external education assistance. The FTI has an important role to play in this. DFID will continue to play an active role in the development of the FTI, and will take over chair of the initiative in 2004.

<a name="31217w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There are currently five police force areas out of a maximum 51 in Great Britain who are not yet participating in the safety camera netting off scheme. These areas do not recover their camera-related costs from fine income and therefore there is no obligation on them to inform central Government about camera activity or number of cameras in operation in their areas. We expect all but Durham to be part of the netting off programme by July 2004.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w07.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Jamieson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 8 December 2003]:</i> The rules for netting off allow fine revenue to be used only to fund safety camera activity which includes education about how effective speed management can improve road safety. Other aspects of road safety education and highway engineering improvement are funded separately in the usual way. The rules for netting off were designed to ensure there would be no benefit to the partnership for installing cameras at places where there were no casualty savings.

<P>
<a name="31217w07.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Each safety camera partnership makes available locally for public scrutiny information about its operational case having taken regard to sensitive operational matters such as the speeds at which cameras are triggered to enforce the limit. Operational cases for 2004&#150;05 are to be produced in common format to allow publication without compromising operational sensitivities.

<P>
<a name="31217w08.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Sutcliffe  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 15 December 2003]:</i> The safety of toys is covered by the Toys (Safety) Regulations 1995 which are supported by European harmonised standards. A new part eight to the BSEN 71 series of toy standards, which introduced a maximum saddle height of 600mm for carousels and rocking activity toys, was recently agreed by the European technical committee which develops the standards. The primary intention of this measurement is to identify which toys need to undergo stability testing and it was not intended as a restriction on the maximum height of rocking horses. It has been accepted that an unintentional oversight has occurred and steps are being taken to rectify the matter. In the meantime, the DTI and LACORS (the Local Authorities Co-ordinators of Regulatory Services) have issued advice to local authority enforcement departments and testing laboratories on the current legal situation, emphasising that rocking horses with a saddle height greater than 600mm have not 'become' unsafe as a result of the new standard nor are any already on the market now unsafe for use.
<P>

<a name="31217w08.html_para5">Although trampolines are not covered by the standard, it does specify safety requirements for toys incorporating crossbars eg climbing frames and swings.
<P>

<a name="31217w08.html_para6">The BSEN 71 series of standards are a means of meeting the essential safety requirements of the toys safety Regulations. Those Regulations apply to all toys supplied on the UK market for use in play by children under 14 years of age.

 Although the Government very much share the concerns of those immediately affected by plans to offshore services work, the question of redundancies is a commercial matter for the Norwich Union Aviva Group. Earlier this month, Aviva said that it hopes that the bulk of job cuts will come through natural staff turnover or voluntary redundancies. However, we do nevertheless need to understand better what is happening, and to this end we have launched a consultation document and will hold a round-table seminar in the New Year, to help inform the debate on the impacts of offshoring.

<a name="31217w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Under the DTI's &#163;20 million First Phase of the Major Photovoltaic Demonstration Programme, the target for Stream 1 (small-scale individual systems 0.5&#150;5kWp) in 2002&#150;03 was 300 approvals. This was later revised downwards to 200 approvals to reflect expected demand. This was confirmed by the fact that only 210 applications were actually received, of which 190 were approved. There is no annual target for Stream 2 (group housing and medium/large-scale non-residential buildings 5&#150;100kWp), but the target for the three-year first phase is 140 projects, of which 45 were approved in the first year. 71 of the 190 approvals under Stream 1 were installed during 2002&#150;03, but installation tends to lag three to six months behind approval. For Stream 2, no installations were completed in the first year as the time lag here tends to be six to twelve months from approval.

 The Department have made no such study.

For the rural network the Post Office has made a firm commitment to maintain the network and prevent avoidable closures. The Government have underpinned that with &#163;450 million of funding. We have also made available an additional &#163;2 million fund to support community post office initiatives.

<a name="31217w09.html_para3">The urban reinvention programme is necessary to ensure the long-term viability of that part of the network. In return for Government investment in this programme, the Post Office has guaranteed that at the end of the programme 95 per cent. of people living in urban areas will be within a mile of a post office, and the majority within half a mile. Offices in deprived urban areas can only be closed in exceptional circumstances. In addition special arrangements have been put in place to help post offices in the most deprived wards and where there is no other post office within half a mile. The scheme in England provides grant for capital improvements of up to &#163;50,000. Similar schemes have been set up in Scotland and Wales.

 In our consultation paper, "Policing: Building Safer Communities Together", which was published on 4 November, the Home Office sought views on the introduction of a single, three-digit, non-emergency number for accessing local services. This built upon a previous proposal to introduce a single non-emergency number for the police. The closing date for contributions to the consultation is 27 January 2004. Work has begun to look at the possible scope of such a system. There are a number of models worldwide, including the American 311 system. We shall develop the proposal following the consultation feedback and the scoping work.

<a name="31217w12.html_para0">Ofcom (Oftel until 29 December 2003), which administers the UK's National Numbering Scheme, has advised us that it may be possible to allocate a three digit number for this service. That will be subject to a public consultation, run by Ofcom, to establish whether the service, which it is intended should be available through all networks and service providers, is objectively justifiable and whether the change required is proportionate to the benefit. That consultation will commence once we are clearer about the scope of the service.

<a name="31217w12.html_para4">On 6 October 2003 the Government published a consultation document entitled "Carriers' Liability: Charging Procedures: A Guide for Carriers" setting out proposed amendments to that published guidance. In particular, the document proposes changes to the circumstances in which charges will be waived in respect of stowaways and explains in greater detail what is expected of carriers. Copies of the consultation document can be found in the Library and on the Home Office website www.ind.homeoffice.gov.uk/default.asp?pageid=4156.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence pursuant to his Answer of 3 December 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 68W, on school places, in what format his Department holds information on the proportion of funding spent by his Department on school places for service personnel which was spent on the independent sector in each year since 1996; and if he will publish that information.  [143871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w13.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Caplin: </B> 
 Expenditure data on Service Education Allowances is only accessible for named individuals. While it is possible to identify what has been spent on any named individual it is not possible to capture cumulative data totals electronically. Manual capture of this data could be provided only at disproportionate cost. Even if this total data were produced it would not identify the proportion spent in the independent sector schools as the same allowance rates are paid irrespective of the type of school and hence independent sector spend could not be isolated.

 The Barker Report suggests that the recent increase in refusals may have resulted from a failure on the part of some housebuilders to respond to the changed policy environment, following recent policy changes, including those set out in Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 (Housing) 2000. It is expected that the rate of refusals will decrease over time, as the policy changes are more widely understood and adopted.

<a name="31217w15.html_para7">In 2003 significant changes were introduced to the assessment of writing at KS1. For the first time marks for spelling contributed to the pupils' overall writing level instead of separate level for spelling being reported. In addition there were changes to the format of the writing test and a new mark scheme was introduced. These new testing arrangements have produced a different distribution of marks and it is difficult to draw conclusions through comparisons with previous years' results. For example a larger proportion of pupils secured the higher levels in writing than in previous years. The percentage of all pupils achieving Level 2B or above in writing rose from 60 per cent. in 2002 to 62 per cent. in 2003; the percentage of boys achieving that level rose from 52 per cent. to 54 per cent. The percentage of all pupils at Level 3 rose from 9 per cent. in 2002 to 16 per cent. in 2003; the percentage of boys achieving that level rose from 7 per cent. to 11 per cent.
<P>

<a name="31217w15.html_para8">It remains a point of concern that boys' achievement in writing at KS1, as at all Key Stages, lags behind that of girls, and the Primary Strategy will continue to support teachers in raising standards further. In spring 2004 new support materials will be offered on improving boys' writing. We will also be piloting the development and delivery of a specialist support package for early years practitioners so that they can begin to tackle the challenges faced by disadvantaged children as soon as they enter the Foundation Stage. A particular focus for the specialists will be to improve the speaking, listening and communication skills of these children.

 Education for Sustainable Development (ESD), which includes environmental awareness, is a statutory part of the programmes of study for Science, Geography, Design and Technology and Citizenship within the National Curriculum. The Department and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) also encourage schools to consider sustainable development issues within the teaching of all subjects. Since 2001, the Department has funded QCA to provide on-line guidance for teachers.

<a name="31217w16.html_para4">Aimhigher (previously called Excellence Challenge) provides grants mainly to schools and colleges to raise the aspirations and attainment levels of young people. The Higher Education Funding Council for England's (HEFCE) Partnerships for Progression provides funds to universities for outreach.

 Ofsted's report confirms that the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategies have brought about an overall improvement in the quality of teaching of literacy and mathematics, and have successfully introduced teachers to a broader range of teaching approaches designed to motivate and engage pupils. Our new Primary Strategy will continue to support teachers in ensuring that their teaching reflects an appropriate balance of approaches, including both direct teaching and opportunities for collaborative learning, and is appropriate to the needs of their individual pupils. For example, all primary schools have recently received new guidance on strategies for improving pupils' speaking and listening skills, which was a need highlighted by Ofsted's report, and we will be making available in spring 2004 new support on improving boys' writing.

 The National Literacy Strategy (NLS) has dramatically increased the Key Stage 2 reading results. Since 1998 there has been a 10 percentage point increase in the percentage of pupils achieving the expected level for their age in the Key Stage 2 English tests, with an increase of 10 percentage points in reading. There have also been increases in reading results at Key Stage 1, with a 7 percentage point increase in the percentage of pupils achieving level 2B or above in the Key Stage 1 Reading tests since 1998. The work

We will continue to

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2003]:</i> My hon.

<P>

<a name="31217w18.html_para0">Ministers have received a number of letters and e-mails about Cumbria Learning and Skills Council's proposals to reorganise sixth form provision in Carlisle. (David Hart, National Association of Headteachers, and John Dunford, Secondary Heads Association, and Eric Martlew, constituency MP for Carlisle, have been invited to meet Alan Johnson and Ivan Lewis at separate meetings to be arranged for the New Year.)

<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w18.html_spnew1"><B> Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2003]:</i> In its strategic area reviews of all post-16 provision the LSC's criteria include that the pattern of provision should:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>meet learner, employment and community needs;
<P>
<BR>
improve choice of provision, ways of delivery and learner experience including, where appropriate, developing more distinct provision for 16 to 19&#150;year-olds;
<P>
<BR>
raise standards and participation;
<P>
<BR>
enhance responsiveness of the infrastructure and employers' involvement; and
<P>
<BR>
strengthen collaboration and progression in the 14&#150;19 phase, the post-19 phase and with HE including supporting the development of foundation degrees.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31217w18.html_para1">Where such proposals require reorganisation, there is a national framework of criteria for all reorganisation proposals requiring them to extend participation, improve achievement and standards and be affordable. Proposals also have to show that adequate consultation has taken place and that proper consideration has been given to alternatives.
<P>

<a name="31217w18.html_para2">When considering proposals for 16&#150;19 reorganisation the LSC will also have regard to the five key principles that should underpin the organisation of 16&#150;19 provision agreed by Ministers in September. These are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>underpinning all consideration of 16&#150;19 provision should be a requirement that all provision for all learners should be high quality, whatever their chosen pathway;
<P>
<BR>
distinct 16&#150;19 provision to meet the particular pastoral, management and learning needs for this age group will be the norm, wherever they learn. All young people should be attached to a 16&#150;19 base, including those in work-based training when attending college. Popular and successful sixth-form provision&#151;whether in schools, sixth-form colleges or new distinct sixth-form centres in FE colleges&#151;will be an important part of the pattern of provision and should be encouraged, particularly where there is little or no such provision;
<P>
<BR>
there should be diversity to ensure curriculum breadth. Together, providers need to support a wide curriculum offer for all 16&#150;19 learners in an area. Well-managed collaboration can 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>17 Dec 2003 : Column 965W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>enable popular and successful small providers, including sixth forms, to remain viable and to share and build on their particular areas of expertise;
<P>
<BR>
the pattern for 16&#150;19 provision should respect learner choice. Learning provision for 16 to 19-year-olds will normally be in one or more of the following settings: school sixth forms, sixth-form colleges, distinct sixth-form centres in FE colleges, private or voluntary sector training providers and work-based learning providers;
<P>
<BR>
plans should offer value for money. Any net costs should be commensurate to the expected improvement in learning opportunities.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2003]:</i> The Department's statutory guidance makes clear that local Learning and Skills councils should fully involve local diocesan authorities in proposals for the reorganisation of post-16 provision.
<P>

<a name="31217w18.html_para4">In addition Ministers published in September five key principles that should underpin the organisation of all 16&#150;19 provision. The principles are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>underpinning all consideration of 16&#150;19 provision should be a requirement that all provision for all learners should be high quality, whatever their chosen pathway;
<P>
<BR>
distinct 16&#150;19 provision to meet the particular pastoral, management and learning needs for this age group will be the norm, wherever they learn. All young people should be attached to a 16&#150;19 base including those in work based training, when attending college. Popular and successful sixth form provision&#151;whether in schools, sixth form colleges or new distinct sixth form centres in FE colleges&#151;will be an important part of the pattern of provision and should be encouraged, particularly where there is little or no such provision;
<P>
<BR>
there should be diversity to ensure curriculum breadth. Together, providers need to support a wide curriculum offer for all 16&#150;19 learners in an area. Well-managed collaboration can enable popular and successful small providers, including sixth forms, to remain viable and to share and build on their particular areas of expertise;
<P>
<BR>
the pattern for 16&#150;19 provision should respect learner choice. Learning provision for 16&#150;19 year olds will normally be in one or more of the following settings: school sixth forms, sixth form colleges, distinct sixth form centres in FE colleges, private or voluntary sector training providers and work based learning providers;
<P>
<BR>
plans should offer value for money. Any net costs should be commensurate to the expected improvement in learning opportunities.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="31217w18.html_para5">Strategic Area Reviews by the Learning and Skills Council will be based on the principles, which will also provide a benchmark against which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will assess reorganisation proposals that come to him.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the <i>(a)</i> intrinsic value and <i>(b)</i> relative value of the Programme for International Student Assessment 2000 education survey compared to other recent studies.  [143982]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w18.html_spnew3"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 International comparisons of pupil attainment such as the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) offer insights into how the outcomes of our education system compare with those of other countries. PISA, which in 2000 focused on "reading literacy" of 15-year-olds, allows us to compare pupils at the end of compulsory schooling. Together with PISA, other international comparisons studies, such as the IEA's Progress in International Literacy Study (PIRLS) and Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), with their different age cohorts and subject content, help give us an objective picture of performance across the primary and secondary sectors in relation to our world partners and competitors, complementing the data coming out of our own national assessments. It seems clear that we are not alone in finding these studies valuable, given the large number of countries routinely taking part in them.

 All Department for Work and Pensions information on Direct Payment account options is based on the Government policy in this area which was set out by my hon. Friend the former Minister of State for the Department for Trade and Industry on 17 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 119&#150;120W.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para3">Jobcentre Plus staff have recently been reminded of the need to ensure that new customers are paid by Direct Payment (including the Post office card account) from the outset of their claim. This advice was intended to equip staff with the factual information they need to provide to customers in order for customers themselves to choose the account which best meets their needs and circumstances. The Post Office card account will not be the best option for them as it cannot receive payments of wages. Post Office Ltd. have also had the opportunity to comment on DWP information material for our customers, including leaflets.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para4">Customers are being provided with all the information they need on all of their account options, including those accounts, which can be used at Post Office branches. It will be up to the customers themselves to decide which type of account they wish to have their money paid into.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para5">The Department has a published Public Service Agreement (PSA) target that, by 2005, 85 per cent. of customers will have their benefits paid by Direct Payment. There are no targets for the number of customers paid directly into a standard current account, basic bank account and Post Office card account.

 We have always recognised that there will be a small number of people who we cannot pay directly into an account. Our plan is to design an exceptions method of payment to properly meet the needs of

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what research his Department has collated about the impact of council tax on older peoples' incomes.  [142231]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
 The Department holds information about the impact of council tax on older peoples' incomes from a variety of sources.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para6">The Family Resources Survey is a large-scale annual survey of private households run by the department which collects detailed information about income and about certain expenses, including council tax.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para7">Regularly published information from this survey includes estimates of pensioners1 net incomes after the deduction of taxes, including council tax payments. The Pensioners' Income Series 2001&#150;02 shows that between 1996&#150;97 and 2001&#150;02 the average net income of pensioners before the deduction of housing costs increased by 17 per cent. in real terms, while after housing costs it increased by 23 per cent.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para8">Data from administrative sources shows the number of pensioners receiving council tax benefit. In 2002, 2.4 million families over 60 received council tax benefit.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para9">The Department also publishes estimates of the level of take-up of council tax benefit, in the annual publication income related benefits: Estimates of take-up.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para10">The Department further estimates that with the introduction of pension credit almost 1.9 million pensioner households will be eligible for more help, or help for the first time, with council tax or rent payments.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para11">The Department also carries out calculations to establish the level of income at which pensioners are eligible for help with their council tax. From October 2003, a single person over 65 with no entitlement to disability benefits and an income of &#163;116 could be eligible for maximum council tax benefit.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para12">The Department also regularly receives research from other organisations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what progress has been made in 



<P>
<P><I>17 Dec 2003 : Column 980W</I><P>
reducing sickness and absence in his Department; what the principal causes of sickness and absence are in his Department; and what remedial work his Department has under way or is proposing.  [140649]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w22.html_spnew7"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The Department for Work and Pensions has targets set by Cabinet Office to help contribute to a reduction in public sector sickness absence. These involve an average working days lost figure of eight days by March 2006, and an interim target of 10 days by March 2004. The cumulative average working days lost figure for the period April to October 2003 was 12.3.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para13">Ministers and senior managers in the Department fully recognise the importance of good attendance. The Department's Executive Team, chaired by the Permanent Secretary, reviews sickness absence on a monthly basis.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para14">The remedial work we have in place includes the following:
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para15">A new Departmental attendance management policy was implemented in February 2003. This aims to encourage good attendance and provide support to enable people to return to work as quickly as possible following an illness. Formal unsatisfactory attendance action can be considered when an absence reaches eight days in a rolling 12 month period. To measure the effectiveness of the policy, an evaluation exercise will start shortly.
<P>

<a name="31217w22.html_para16">Each of the businesses within the Department has initiatives in place aimed at getting sickness absence levels down. Jobcentre Plus has an 'Improving Attendance' task force in operation. Its emphasis is on reducing long-term absences (i.e. those over 28 days duration), by either facilitating a return to work, or effecting a termination of an individual's contract. The Department is also participating in the 'Well-being at work' pilots that are being run by the Health and Safety Executive. This initiative is intended to combat workplace stress. In addition, the Department is committed to discharging its responsibilities to disabled people by making reasonable adjustments to the workplace to facilitate an individual's return to work, or to avoid people going off in the first place. A pilot will also commence in January that will involve the early intervention of occupational health nurses in addressing, quickly, those absences that have the potential to become long-term.

Strategic, high-level planning has been undertaken for the remaining two years of the programme, 2004&#150;2006, but I am not yet able to provide firm details of premises disposals or surrenders due for that period. Similarly, information on costs and savings from future disposals is unavailable.
<BR>
We have not carried out an external benchmarking exercise on the disposal of Jobcentre Plus premises. Because of the diversity of the districts, service delivery planning for Jobcentre Plus is a locally-driven activity. In undertaking such exercises local managers have to take account of a wide range of factors relevant to the local community before any changes are made to the premises available to them.
<BR>
I hope this is helpful.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As Jobcentre Plus is an Executive Agency, the Secretary of State has asked me to reply direct to your question on what plans he has to centralise <i>(a)</i> Jobseekers Allowance and <i>(b)</i> Labour Market Appeals; and what the implications of the plans are for (i) appellants and (ii) staff. This is something that falls within the responsibilities delegated to me as Chief Executive of the Agency.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Jobcentre Plus was formed in 2002 from the Working Age elements of the former Benefits Agency and the Employment Service. Since that time, the organisation has undergone an unprecedented rollout programme, bringing together both parts of the formerly separate operations.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An internal review recommended that appeals would be delivered more efficiently through teams of appeals staff covering all Jobcentre Plus benefits, and also for appeals teams to be organised on a district basis and accountable to the District Manager. This work is now underway and is being led by the Deputy field Director of East of England, supported by district, regional and national tiers throughout Jobcentre Plus.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Improvements to Jobcentre Plus decision making and appeals processes are to be further supplemented following recommendations from the recent National Audit Office report "Getting It Right, Putting It Right&#151;Improving Decision Making and Appeals In Social Security Benefits". It was their view that the centralisation of appeals work, reconsiderations and complex decision making, would achieve financial savings for the organisation and lead to improved standards, better communications and better customer service.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Pressures on staff to achieve demanding targets will be relieved as more resource is freed when these plans are implemented. Centralisation and a more defined management, training apd communications structure will also lead to improved skills of and support to those staff employed to process complex decisions, handle reconsiderations and write appeals. This will provide a better service for Jobcentre Plus customers.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the investment by Remploy in maintaining and upgrading exisiting sites, as specified in the Remploy 21 agreement.  [143229]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w24.html_spnew3"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Remploy 21 is the company's modernisation strategy to establish itself in businesses that mirror growth sectors of the economy. Since 2000, Remploy has moved from 36 disparate businesses mainly in traditional manufacturing to 10 competitive national businesses with an increasing focus on the service sector. To support this programme it has invested &#163;4 million in the maintenance and upgrading of existing sites.
<P>

<a name="31217w24.html_para2">Remploy is in the process of surveying all sites as part of this activity; the expectation is that at least &#163;1 million annually will be allocated to further site improvements.
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w24.html_wqn4"><B> Adam Price: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions if he will make a statement on the strategic decision by Remploy management to close owned factories and to move to leased units.  [143230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w24.html_spnew4"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Remploy owns a significant majority of its factory sites and this will continue to be the case following the modernisation plans the Company currently considers necessary over the next few years. In the long-term, if Remploy were to carry out all potential relocation plans, they would have a total of 50 sites owned and 31 leased. In every case Remploy will consider upgrading the existing site, purchasing or building at a new site or leasing a site. Remploy has only entered into agreements to lease factory sites where it has made business sense.
<P>

<a name="31217w24.html_para3">Leased premises tend to be acquired for a minimum of 15 years and occasionally for longer periods. This is normal commercial practice and recognises that, because business requirements evolve over time, there must therefore be a corresponding ability to evolve the estates strategy to ensure that the facilities match business and learning objectives.




<P>

<P>

<a name="31217w24.html_para4">The Company's approach to providing better and more modern facilities in Remploy locations is primarily to improve business opportunities that will in turn lead to more opportunities for growth in employment levels.
<P>

<a name="31217w24.html_para5">Since 2000, Remploy has invested in new or improved sites in Acton, Barnsley, Bradford, Gateshead, Lanarkshire, and North Staffordshire. There are also plans, some of which are already under way to replace existing facilities in Abertillery, Bristol, Holloway, Preston and St. Helens. All these sites are leased.
<P>

<a name="31217w24.html_para6">The above sites produced proceeds of sale of &#163;5.7 million. At the same time, the Company invested &#163;5.9 million on fitting out the replacement sites; consequently that has been a net outflow of investment. The majority of the sales proceeds arose from the sales of Acton and Bristol (&#163;3.5 million of the &#163;5.7 million) where there were opportunities to take advantage of site development potential. In other cases, the proceeds were very modest, reflecting the individual constraints of the existing site.
<P>

<a name="31217w24.html_para7">The Company's growth and investment plans are discussed with the Government on a regular basis. It should be noted that Remploy cannot sell a factory without securing the Government's approval. The Government will only agree to the sale where a case is presented which demonstrates the business sense of the proposal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w25.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Increasing patient choice will require a change in culture for national health service staff and indeed, for patients. Staff and patients are broadly supportive of the principle of extending patient choice. However, we need to work closely with staff and patients on the detailed implementation of our patient choice policies to ensure that we retain that support. The new financial framework, Payment by Results, will provide new incentives to providers to attract patients. Our plurality policies will help secure the capacity needed to deliver the improved waiting times patients expect, and will allow a greater range of choices for patients. The biggest safeguard against any institutional resistance, however, is likely to be the attitude of the patients themselves. The experience from London and other choice pilots is that once offered choice over where and when their treatment is provided, many patients exercise these new opportunities.

<a name="31217w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We recognise that patients in isolated rural communities may find it more difficult to access the same range of choices as others. We are exploring options for primary care trusts to provide greater support for patients living in more isolated rural communities. These could include peripatetic patient care advisers, the use of mobile service, for example, the mobile cataract surgery service being introduced in many areas from the spring of 2004. We will be including rural representatives of patients, patient groups and local authorities in these discussions, so that they are able to influence the Department's final policy guidance on choice at referral.

<P>
<P>
<a name="31217w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We are investing in substantial and sustainable increases in national health service capacity to improve quality and allow us to deliver the shorter waiting times patients expect. Choice of hospital for patients requiring elective surgery will be introduced alongside this additional capacity. By December 2005, patients will choose at the point of general practitioner referral, so patient choice will not be directly dependent on the inpatient occupancy rate.

Curriculum content for pre-registration education and training programmes for healthcare professionals is determined by individual higher education institutions (HEIs) in the light of recommendations from the relevant regulatory bodies. Post registration training needs for all national health service healthcare staff is determined locally through skills auditing of teams against priority local needs and through the appraisal process. In addition there are a number of central initiatives to increase healthcare professionals' access to knowledge, such as the development of the National Electronic Library for Health's specialist 'branch' library for diabetes and 'Diabetes NSF Zone' and the Department of Health's commitment to establishing a National Knowledge Service.

All people with diabetes will receive a service that encourages partnership in decision-making and supports them in managing their diabetes. This is reflected in the "Planning and Priorities Framework for the NHS 2003&#150;06", that includes targets for the diabetes NSF. One such target states the need for primary care trusts to update practice-based registers for people with diabetes by March 2006. This will help to ensure that they receive systematic treatment regimens and advice, including the provision of information, education and psychological support, to help them in managing their own condition.

 In February 2003, we published an action plan for epilepsy services which addresses the key recommendations in the National Clinical Audit of Epilepsy Related Deaths audit and the Chief Medical Officer's 2001 Annual Report on epilepsy. This will be complemented by two key initiatives, which are planned for publication next year. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) is developing a clinical guideline for the diagnosis, management and treatment of epilepsy, which it plans to publish next July. It is also looking at the clinical and cost effectiveness of new anti-epilepsy drugs in children and adults and plans to publish an appraisal in the new year. These will help address any variations in clinical practice and contribute to the improvement of services. We are developing the national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions, which will focus on improving the standard of general neurology care across England for people with conditions such as epilepsy. The NSF will address a range of key issues, for example: the need for equitable access to a range of services; good quality information and support, for patients and carers; the ability to see a specialist and get the right investigations and diagnosis as quickly as possible; and, maintaining independence and quality of life. We currently plan to publish the NSF late next year for implementation over 10 years from 2005.

This agreement is available to all national health service trusts and health authorities in England, although it is not mandatory. There are 59 suppliers on the agreement, all of which are based in the United Kingdom.

 Following the Wanless final report, my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in his 2002 Budget, announced the biggest ever-sustained real terms growth in history of national health service, to create a world-class health system. Health spending is to grow on average by 7.2 per cent. per annum in the United .Kingdom in real terms over next five years&#151;from &#163;68.1 billion to &#163;109.4 billion in 2007&#150;08.
