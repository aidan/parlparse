1. The source of this information is the Poverty and Income Inequality in Scotland: 2008-09 publication.<br>
2. The income measures used to derive the estimates shown employ the same methodology as the Department for Work and Pensions publication 'Households Below Average Income' series, which uses disposable household income, adjusted (or 'equivalised') for household size and composition, as an income measure as a proxy for standard of living.<br>
3. The figures are based on OECD equivalisation factors.<br>
4. Figures are based on survey data and as such are subject to a degree of sampling and non-sampling error.<br>
5. Numbers of children in low-income households have been rounded to the nearest 10,000 children.<br>
6. Each of the measures is defined as:<br>
Relative poverty: percentage of children living in households with less than 60% of contemporary median household income.<br>
Absolute poverty: percentage of children living in households with less than 60% of 1998-99 median household income held constant in real terms.<br>
Low Income and Material Deprivation: percentage of children living in households in material deprivation and with less than 70% of contemporary median household income, before housing costs.<br>
7. Income after housing costs (AHC) is derived by deducting a measure of housing costs from the before housing costs (BHC) measure of income. These include (1) rent (gross of housing benefit), (2) water rates, community water charges and council water charges, (3) mortgage interest payments, and (4) structural insurance premiums (for owner occupiers), ground rent and service charges.<br>
8. BHC and AHC figures are given for the relative and absolute poverty measures. The combined material deprivation and low income measure is defined using before housing costs income.<br>

 We acknowledge that people who are permitted by social services to provide 'kinship' care for children of relatives undertake an extremely valuable role, often taking on this responsibility in difficult circumstances. Such carers are usually entitled to benefits available to birth parents, including child benefit, child tax credits or pension credit, subject to meeting the normal conditions of entitlement. Relevant discussions with ministerial colleagues have therefore focused on wider issues concerning benefits for parents.</p>

 The Food and Environment Research Agency's (Fera's) National Bee Unit's BeeBase database is a vital tool in controlling bee pests and diseases. Knowing the location of apiaries is essential if these harmful organisms are to be controlled quickly and effectively. An action plan is in place to increase the number of beekeepers who are voluntarily registered on the database. Depending on the success of this plan, compulsory registration may be considered but current policy remains one of encouraging voluntary registration.</p>

As a result, BeeBase registrations are increasing.</p>

 An element of the BIS overall pay award for staff below the SCS is allocated to non-consolidated variable pay related to performance. There are two types of award:</p>
<a name="101027w0001.htm_brev0"><a name="10102754000304"><ul><p class="tabletext">1. Annual performance awards, that reward staff who achieve a highly successful annual performance rating.</p>
</ul><a name="101027w0001.htm_brev1"><a name="10102754000305"><ul><p class="tabletext">2. In-year awards that recognise strong performance in particularly demanding tasks or situations.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_319"><a name="101027w0001.htm_para11"><a name="10102754000041">These non-consolidated variable pay awards are used to drive high performance and do not add to future pay bill costs, as they are funded from within existing pay bill controls, and have to be re-earned each year against pre-determined targets. The payments made for both types of award are entirely related to staff performance. The in-year scheme was suspended on 9 July and no payments have been made to staff since that date.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_320"><a name="101027w0001.htm_para12"><a name="10102754000042">Performance awards for the SCS are part of the pay system across the whole senior civil service, and are used to reward high performance sustained throughout the year, based on judgments about how well an individual has performed relative to their peers. The performance related pay scheme is designed to help drive high performance and support better public service delivery. Performance awards are non-consolidated and non pensionable. The percentage of the pay bill set aside for performance-related awards for the SCS is based on recommendations from the independent Senior Salaries Review Body.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 October 2010]:</i> Airlines are required by European rules on air fare transparency to indicate at all times the final price to be paid, including all applicable taxes, charges, surcharges and fees which are unavoidable and foreseeable at the time of publication. Any optional price supplements should be clearly communicated at the start of the booking process. We expect to introduce an enforcement regime for these requirements early in 2011, including penalties for non-compliance.</p>

 Delivery structures across probation areas vary as do the requirements of specific roles and the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) does not routinely report on the proportion of working time spent in face to face contact with offenders. In December 2008, NOMS undertook a snapshot survey over a one week period, based on a small sample of probation officer (PO) and probation service officer (PSO) staff. It reported that across England and Wales 24% of PO/PSO time was spent in direct contact with offenders, 41% was involved in computer activity and 35% of time was spent on non-computer-dealing with correspondence, meetings, travel, etc.</p>

 The Ministry of Justice does not hold information on the number of transgender people who are serving custodial sentences. There are difficulties in collecting information on the numbers of transgender prisoners.

The procedure must provide for complaints to be managed within clear timescales.

<i> [holding answer 8 September 2010]:</i><i> </i>The Department for Education does not hold information on the funding of individual Connexions services funded by grant from the Department. It is for Brighton and Hove city council, and for councils in other areas, to decide the level of funding for Connexions and other services supporting young people, and where to make savings. While the Department's area based grant (ABG) to local authorities was reduced by £311 million as part of the local government contribution to deficit reduction in 2010-11, the reduction in ABG does not imply a direct cut to the services funded by the grant. The Government have made it clear that local authorities should have the maximum flexibility to make efficiency savings from all their funding sources, taking into account their statutory responsibilities and the need to protect front line services as much as possible. We do not expect that cuts should fall disproportionately on Connexions services over others.</p>

 The Royal Air Force's (RAF) use of simulators already forms a key element through the full spectrum of training provided to RAF personnel from basic training onwards. The use of simulators offers cost-effective and practical training for a wide range of appropriate and relevant skills and the RAF is working closely with the Ministry of Defence, allies and industry to maximise the benefits available from this approach. In particular, the RAF is currently developing two major simulator-based projects. The first links realistic simulation environments for training fast jet pilots, ISTAR (Intelligence Surveillance Targeting, Acquisition and Reconnaissance) and aviation specialisations. This is planned to enter service with the RAF in 2013. The second aims to deliver an enhanced training capability in support of the RAF's air transport capability, including the C130J and A400M aircraft. This project is also planned to be in use by 2013. However, it needs to be recognised that a significant irreducible element of live flying training by the RAF will be required to maintain the safe operation of front-line aircraft for the foreseeable future.</p>

 As stated in the White Paper on the Strategic Defence and Security Review (SDSR), the Army will significantly reduce its non-deployable administration structure in order to enhance its focus on front-line capabilities. The current four regional divisional headquarters will be replaced with a single UK Support Command and at least two regional brigade headquarters will close.

 Of the 66 strong Typhoon fleet, 23 aircraft are multi-role capable and can carry out close air support activity. The number of aircraft that can be used for close air support will grow as more Tranche 1 aircraft are upgraded to a multi-role capability. These multi-role aircraft can employ the following weapons: Paveway and Enhanced Paveway II Laser Guided Bombs, which are supported by Litening III Laser Designator Pods; and 1,000 lbs Freefall Bombs. An enhanced air-to-surface capability is expected to be integrated on Tranche 2 aircraft from 2012.
