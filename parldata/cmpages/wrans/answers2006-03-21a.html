 The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that of the 46 million women who have an abortion each year, 19 million are estimated to be unsafe. That is, carried out by persons lacking the necessary skills or in an environment lacking the minimum medical standards. They do so because they do not wish to go through with an un-intended or unwanted pregnancy. One important reason for this is that many millions of women still lack access to reproductive health and family planning services, and thus have no choice about when and if to have children.

 Following the tsunami, the Government allocated &#163;75 million to meet the immediate needs of those affected. To date &#163;68 million has been disbursed through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross Movement and non-governmental organisations such as Oxfam, Save the Children Fund, CAFOD and Help the Aged.

<a name="stpa_4">The complexity of the response and the changing situation on the ground meant that some organisations have not been able to spend funds according to their original timetable.

Some of the funds have been put into a multi-donor trust fund which provides grants for a range of reconstruction activities including housing, infrastructure, and land titling projects. Additional funds have been used to support the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP)&#039;s livelihoods programme and to support a range of smaller technical assistance packages. Of this, &#163;13.5 million, we estimate that &#163;12.5 million has actually been spent. It is difficult to be precise about how much of the UK funds have been spent from the Multi-Donor Fund because it is a pooled funding mechanism. The Multi-Donor Fund estimates that it will have spent $102 million of the $228 million received from donors by the end of March.

 The threat of avian influenza is of global significance and requires a co-ordinated global response. On 18 January, at the International Pledging Conference on Avian and Human Pandemic Influenza in Beijing, the UK pledged &#163;20 million to help achieve this. We also expressed our willingness to consider requests from developing country Governments to reprioritise DFID country programmes to finance work on influenza.

The remaining &#163;550,000 has been given as a grant to the World Health Organisation (WHO) which is leading the international response to avian influenza. The WHO will use the funds to support the Government of Nigeria at both federal and state level in reducing the opportunity of human infection, ensuring that the surveillance systems are in place and active, and undertaking assessment of laboratory facilities.

Flooding has been most intensive in the lower Zambezi and Pungue river basins. Nonetheless, the DNA is optimistic that any further large scale flooding on the Zambezi will be avoided, because the amount of water entering the lake behind the Cahora Bassa dam is falling, thus reducing the need, to increase discharges into the lower river. Based on historic patterns the likelihood of more extensive flooding will diminish from the end of March.

 The relief effort in Guatemala in the aftermath of Hurricane Stan is coordinated by the Guatemalan Government Agency, CONRED (Co-ordinadora Nacional para la Reduccion de Desastres) and involves a wide number of Government Departments, non-governmental organisations (NGOs), donors and local community groups. Rehabilitation programmes are planned for periods of six-12 months and activities have begun for many of the 1,063 affected communities.

Waterborne disease remains a risk for affected communities and the Ministry of Health have been supported in the provision of transportation services, basic health kits including mosquito nets, and training for communities in health and nutrition awareness. Overall progress in reconstructing sanitation units has been slow, which in many cases has only reached 10 per cent. of target so far. However, some areas have benefited from intensive NGO efforts to ensure safe water, with as many as 10,000 water filters being provided and treatment plants in three municipalities.

DFID and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) have been in discussions with the Guatemalan Government to assess how those worst affected by Stan can begin to rehabilitate their livelihoods.

 There is no universal definition of a small firm.

In international development usage, small firms with less than 10 employees are generally termed &quot;micro enterprises&quot;.

 Street Children in Latin America are victims of deprivation and exclusion. Overwhelming poverty, unemployment and social dislocation leave many children with no option other than to leave home to find work and by-pass the education system.

 Up to now the impact of restrictions on the operation of humanitarian organisations in West Darfur has been minimal, despite the reduction in the number of international staff working in the region. This has been due to the agencies themselves anticipating the deteriorating security situation last January, and pre-positioning relief materials. This has enabled basic water, food and medical supplies to be provided through national staff and local non-governmental organisations (NGO)s.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60321w03.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_28">However, security restrictions mean that the UN and NGOs can undertake only emergency life saving interventions in some parts of West Darfur. This, and the reduction in staff numbers, means that the international community is now less able to respond to a major challenge such as an outbreak of disease or a further large-scale displacement of the population. Reduced staff numbers mean that the UN&#039;s ability to afford protection of civilians is also more limited.

 Talks at the G6 Ministers (EU, US, Brazil, India, Australia and Japan) meeting in London on 11 March were intense, but unfortunately delivered no major progress. As reflected in my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister&#039;s joint statement with President Lula, the UK remains committed to an ambitious, balanced, pro-development outcome to the round. We believe that all the main parties in the talks need to take bold steps to go beyond established negotiating positions to improve their offers on agricultural market access and domestic support, NAMA and services. Those offers must also take account of the needs of developing countries by delivering improved market access in both agricultural and non-agricultural goods that is comparably high, but in a balanced and proportionate manner, consistent with the principle of special and differential treatment.

Notes:<br>

1. Table 1 is based on the PSNI District Command Unit in which an offender&#039;s address falls. The structure of police District Command Units became operational in April 2001. However, for the purposes of comparability, calendar year 2000 data are also disaggregated by DCU, rather than police division. It is not possible to disaggregate data by DCU for 1999.<br>

2. Figures include convictions for the offences of &quot;assault with intent to rape&quot;, &quot;indecent assault on female&quot;, &quot;indecent assault on male&quot;, &quot;indecent assault on female child&quot; and &quot;indecent assault on male child&quot;.<br>

3. &quot;Missing&quot; data includes those convictions for which DCU information is not available.<br>

4. Data is collated on the principal offence rule, thus only the most serious offence for which an offender is charged is included.<br>

5. At present there is no means of tracking an offence from when it was reported to the police to whether there was a conviction for the offence, thus the conviction figures included should not be compared with the number of sexual assaults reported. <br>

 This Government have given an unprecedented high profile to tackling bullying and supporting those who have been bullied. Since 1999 it has been compulsory for every school to have an anti-bullying policy in place which details how the school will tackle bullying. Our anti-bullying work, including the anti-bullying Charter for Action, takes an integrated approach to preventing bullying, to addressing causes of bullying&#151;for example prejudice&#151;and to helping those who are bullied.

<a name="stpa_83">As recommended by the Practitioners Group on Behaviour and Discipline, the recent White Paper committed the Department to producing specific guidance for schools on prejudice driven bullying. At the beginning of this month, we launched our new advice &#039;Bullying around racism, religion and culture; how to prevent it and what to do when it happens&#039; as the first of this suite of materials. The advice is presented as a set of interactive web pages on the teachernet website and is being supported by a national programme of dissemination events. Feedback from schools and local authorities so far has been overwhelmingly positive. We will be following this with specific advice on countering homophobic bullying later in 2006.

It is an important arm of the Department&#039;s longer term policy to promote positive behaviour and attendance.

Good information on labour market and skills trends is essential for the council&#039;s work in steering post-16 education and skills provision. In developing its plans the LSC takes account of a wide range of information about current and future skill needs, including the national employer skills survey, research into learner and employer views of learning, and data contained in the Working Futures 2004 to 2014 reports, commissioned by the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA). The LSC is also required to consult and take account of the plans of other organisations, including local authorities and the regional development agencies, and, at the national level, sector skills councils help to identify the skills that are needed for each sector.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60321w11.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_95">Each year the LSC produces an annual statement of priorities. Plans are then formally reviewed throughout the year by the LSC&#039;s management group, and adjustments are made in the light of changing priorities if necessary. Changes to the LSC&#039;s internal organisation will further strengthen its research capacity, and ensure even more effective delivery against individual and employer needs at national, regional and local level.

Notes:<br>

1. Robust data from the new IT system (CS2) covering period March 2003 to March 2004 are not currently available, and is under development.<br>

2. Maintenance Direct is an arrangement in which the Agency have carried out a maintenance calculation or assessment, and the non resident parent then pays his/her maintenance liability directly to the parent with care. As the Agency is no longer directly involved in the case, it is not possible to say definitively if payment is received where such an arrangement is in place.<br>

3. December 2005 is the latest data currently available.<br>

<sup>(26)</sup> As at 31 March of each year.<br>

Data on pharmacy numbers.<br>

From October 2002, PCTs took over responsibility for community pharmacies from HAs. Thereforedata on the number of pharmacies in England with NHS contracts is broken down to HA level until 2001&#150;02, and PCT level from 2002&#150;03 onwards. The change from HAs to PCTs may have resulted in some boundary changes and this is reflected in the data.<br>

Information on the number of community pharmacies is collected from PCTs via the annual PHS1 data collection. The latest data available on General Pharmaceutical Services (1994&#150;95 to 2004&#150;05) was published on 27 January 2006. See the following link for this publication: www.ic.nhs.uk/pubs/genphmsvcengwaldecade05<br>

The survey collects information on openings and closures of community pharmacies. Changes of address, relocations within the PCT are excluded. However, pharmacy minor relocations across PCT boundaries are included as an opening or closure as appropriate. Establishments that close under old ownership and re-open under new ownership within 10 days are regarded as staying open, even if the period between closing and opening straddles review periods.<br>

Data for 2005&#150;06 is not yet available. <br>

<a name="stpa_193">The NHS Improvement Plan, published in June 2004, reiterated the Government&#039;s commitment to increase numbers of frontline NHS staff. This built on the NHS Plan which made a commitment to increasing nursing staff numbers&#151;over 20,000 more nurses working in the NHS and 5,500 extra nurses, midwives and health visitors being trained each year by 2004. These targets have already been met and exceeded. The extra investment announced in the 2002 Budget, builds on the NHS Plan target; by 2008 we expect the NHS to have net increases of at least 35,000 nurses, midwives and health visitors.
