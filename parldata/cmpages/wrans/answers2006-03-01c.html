 Good progress is being made overall in Asia to reduce the number of people living in extreme poverty, and the region is on track to meet this target by 2015. Progress on other Millennium Development Goals is uneven. Areas of particular concern are the high rates of maternal mortality, the spread of HIV and AIDS, the quality of and access to education, especially for girls, and the need to improve access to sanitation.

<p><a name="st_8"><a name="60301w01.html_spnew8"><b> Hilary Benn: </b> 
 Corruption is both a symptom and a cause of poor governance. DFID supports a wide range of governance reforms to prevent, detect and take action against corruption. For example, DFID is helping countries to reform their judicial system in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Malawi, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. DFID also supports public financial management reforms in Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Uganda and Zambia, DFID also provides technical and financial support to dedicated anti-corruption commissions in Sierra Leone, Uganda, Nigeria and Zambia. DFID also helps civil society hold African governments to account for the proper use of public resources. For example, DFID supports the international NGO Transparency International and its country chapters.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w01.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_11">In addition, African countries are working together to tackle corruption regionally as well as in their countries. For example, DFID is helping the East and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering Group (ESAAMLG) to build capacity in the region to prevent and detect money-laundering.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w01.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_12">Both developed and developing countries must play their part to reduce corruption in Africa. In 2005 at Gleneagles, G8 countries committed to a set of actions at home to help stop corruption in Africa. DFID is working with other Government Departments to meet these commitments in the UK. For example, secondary legislation is now in place to enable the UK to ratify the UN convention against corruption, the first global anti-corruption standard. We expect to ratify imminently.

<p><a name="st_22"><a name="60301w03.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Thomas: </b> 
 DFID is active in assessing the role of remittances in development and poverty reduction, and uses the resulting findings to inform its aid programming.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w03.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_22">In general, studies indicate that remittances reduce poverty in developing countries. For example:

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_0">Recent research from Guatemala and the Philippines show that remittances reduce the level, depth and severity of poverty. Households receiving remittances were found to spend around 50 percent. more than households with no remittances.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_1">In Bangladesh, remittances from internal migration can represent the majority of household income. Households receiving remittances have higher nutritional and health status, higher levels of educational investment, and pools of money available for emergencies.</p>
</ul>
<p>

</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w03.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_23">At the level of the economy, research suggests that remittances provide valuable foreign exchange for developing countries, and strengthen the balance of payments situation. Unlike other financial flows, remittances are counter cyclical, thus alleviating macroeconomic shocks. Remittances can also provide investment capital for economic activity, contributing to economic growth. Where remittance flows are saved rather than spent, they provide a higher deposit base for the banking system, which is necessary for economic growth.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w03.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_24">DFID has funded a number of studies and also analyses relevant research by other organisations such as the World Bank. DFID funded a study in 2003 on remittances to developing countries in general which found a positive poverty reduction role for remittances. This finding was supported by DFID studies in 2004 and 2005 in Nigeria, Ghana and Bangladesh. DFID funded a household survey in the UK amongst the Bangladeshi community last year, which explored the impact on recipients of remittances to Bangladesh. DFID has recently commissioned a wider household survey to better understand the volume and value of remittance flows from key ethnic minority communities within the UK, and their impact on respective recipient countries.

DFID also funded a study to determine the contribution of UK based diasporas to development and poverty reduction. The study noted wider benefits from remittances and other forms of assistance from diasporas and migrant communities. These benefits were in the form of relief from war and disaster and in post war reconstruction (e.g. Somalia, Sri Lanka), and in education and health. .
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w03.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_25">DFID has used this research to design aid strategies in reducing barriers to remittance flows and further enhance their developmental impact. In particular, DFID has initiated remittance country partnerships programmes with Bangladesh, Nigeria and Ghana. These partnerships include work to extend access to remittances to poorer and more rural people, encourage greater competition and lower remittance prices, and improve data. This will be achieved by working with the private sector to extend access and outreach, and working with central banks and government, to address regulatory, data, competition and consumer issues.

<p>
<a name="60301w03.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_26">In terms of work in the UK, DFID has recently set up a taskforce comprising of banks and money transfer companies, in order to lower remittance prices and improve the services they provide to low income migrants.

<i>[holding answer 13 February 2006]:</i> In England and Wales, water resources are the responsibility of the Environment Agency, which produced in 2001 Water Resources for the Future&quot;. This strategy document considers four different future scenarios for water use, based on the Environmental Futures&#039; framework from the DTI&#039;s Foresight programme. Annual updates to the strategy keep it up-to-date. For example, the 2004 update draws from water company projections of water use that take account of population increase. Water Resources for the Future also considers demand from increased housing, which is to some extent associated with population increase. Increases in housing might also be expected to impact on rural areas and the environment. In 2004 Defra published the Entec report, Study into the Environmental Impacts of Increasing the Supply of Housing in the UK&quot;, which was partly driven by anticipated population increase. The ODPM also have an interest in housing supply increases, through their work on buildings and sustainable communities. Defra&#039;s Horizon Scanning and Futures team is currently preparing the groundwork for a study on the environmental impacts of increasing population. T his work will look at impacts on both urban and rural environments. Other elements of Defra&#039;s work include human population growth as a component: for example, population increase is factored into our air quality and emission projections.

<i>[holding answer 27 February 2006]:</i> Science infrastructure is funded by the DTI through a number of routes. Universities are funded directly via the Science Research Investment Fund. Other investments are channelled through the Research Councils, who fund infrastructure both within the university sector and within their own institutes. Councils can also draw on the centrally-held Large Facilities Capital Fund for the largest new capital projects. The Research Councils or individual universities and research institutes are responsible for taking decisions on investments in science including new scientific infrastructure. Each Research Council has mechanisms for ensuring decisions are taken impartially in the best interests of the UK scientific community, overseen by a governing Council. The Department organises periodic prioritisation exercises carried out by the Research Councils to inform on the allocations of

Child tax credit provides support to families with children, which is payable alongside child benefit to the main carer (usually the mother), regardless of whether they are in work or not. Budget 2005 announced a commitment to increase the child element of child tax credit at least in line with average earnings up to and including 2007&#150;08. From April the child element of child tax credit will be worth up to &#163;1,765 a year for each child.

This figure is a snapshot provided on a monthly basis. Private law includes applications for parental responsibility, residence and contact, where parents have been unable to reach agreement and Rule 9.5 cases under the Family Proceedings Rules (1991), in which a child involved in a private law case is represented by a Guardian ad Litem. Of the private law reports unallocated, 326 or 3.8% were unallocated less than 10 weeks before filing date, which is our performance indicator agreed with Government for private law.</p>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_52">The allocation of cases, particularly in private law, is now under review as part of our <i>Every Day Matters</i> consultation programme, which has been focusing on all aspects of our professional strategy and performance. A key shift will be towards an early intervention model in those cases, which will benefit most from that. We also now have dispute resolution schemes in place in our local teams, and families who can benefit from this service now receive a prompt and timely service.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

Pay and conditions of service are subject to negotiations between employers, their staff and their representative trade union bodies. The Government plays no part in this.

Notes:<br>

1. Finished consultant episode (FCE)<br>

An FCE is defined as a period of admitted patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Please note that the figures do not represent the number of patients, as a person may have more than one episode of care within the year.<br>

2. Patient counts<br>

Patient counts are based on the unique patient identifier hospital episode statistic identification(HESID). This identifier is derived based on patient&#039;s date of birth, postcode, sex, local patient identifier and national health service number, using an agreed algorithm. Where data are incomplete, HESID might erroneously link episodes or fail to recognise episodes for the same patient. Care is therefore needed, especially where duplicate records persist in the data. The patient count cannot be summed across a table where patients may have episodes in more than one cell.<br>

3. All diagnosis count of episodes<br>

These figures represent a count of all FCE&#039;s where the diagnosis was mentioned in any of the 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in a HES record.<br>

4. Diagnosis (primary diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the hospital episode statistics (HES) data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

5. Secondary diagnoses<br>

As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 13 (six prior to 2002&#150;03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>

6. Ungrossed data<br>

Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, that is the data are ungrossed.<br>

<p><a name="st_172"><a name="60301w21.html_spnew6"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Department recognises the effect of obesity on disease conditions in children and adults, as shown in summary research evidence reported by the National Audit Office, the World Health Organisation, the Health Select Committee, and the 2003 Health Survey for England. Obesity is an important risk factor for a number of chronic diseases such as heart disease, stroke, some cancers, and type two diabetes. In addition, obese people are more likely to suffer from a number of psychological problems such as low self-image and confidence, social stigma, reduced mobility and a poorer quality of life.

<p><a name="st_173"><a name="60301w21.html_spnew7"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 Tackling obesity is a key priority for the Government. In July 2004, a public service agreement target has been set to halt the year-on-year rise in obesity among children aged under 11 by 2010 in the context of a broader strategy to tackle obesity in the population as a whole.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w21.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_171">The Department has a range of ongoing initiatives to tackle obesity in both children and adults. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) has been commissioned to prepare definitive guidance on the prevention, identification, management and treatment of obesity due in early 2007. Pending NICE guidance, tools are being developed to support the national health service in tackling obesity including an obesity care pathway for both adults and children, a weight loss guide and an obesity toolkit. Guidance on measuring children&#039;s height and weight was published on 11 January 2006. An obesity social marketing campaign is being developed to be launched in the autumn of 2006, mainly targeting children and their parents.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w21.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_172">In addition, specific action on diet and physical activity includes healthy start, school food, food in hospitals/prisons/armed forces, work on salt, fat and sugar, promotion of foods especially to children, five a day, local exercise action pilots, football and health, pedometers, and sustainable travel towns.

The widespread introduction of targeted BCG vaccination means that the majority of children at high risk of tuberculosis will now be vaccinated in early life.

 Land in NI is categorised under three classifications namely lowland (LL), disadvantaged area (DA) and severely disadvantaged area (SDA). The introduction of DARD&#039;s new computerised mapping system, the Geographical Information System (GIS), provides accurate information relating to land parcels in terms of both their location, size and classification. This year the GIS has enabled DARD to compare land classification with the original disadvantaged area map agreed with the EU in the 1980s and amend classifications where these were incorrect.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures for 2000&#150;03 are sourced to the Northern Ireland Office and are based on a principal offence rule. Thus only where illegally importing or distributing drugs is the most serious offence tried at a court sitting, will that individual be counted in the above table.<br>

2. 2004 figures are sourced to the Public Prosecution Service. Figures may include offenders who have been convicted of other more serious offences. However where one offender has been 



convicted of several offences of illegally importing or distributing drugs as part of the same criminal case, only the most serious of these is recorded.<br>

<br>&nbsp;<br><i>1 Mar 2006 : Column 786W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Order 1997. EHS has not identified, on the basis of these investigations, a widespread problem of illegal disposal of toxic sludge along the border with the Republic of Ireland. There is currently one active investigation into a County Armagh site close to the border. Prosecution files have been prepared regarding two additional sites at which sludge wastes from the Republic of Ireland were deposited. Residues arising from illegal diesel laundering operations are dealt with by local government, or other statutory agencies such PSNI or HM Revenue and Customs. EHS records indicate that 170 tonnes of illegal fuel laundering waste were re-consigned for authorised disposal since January 2003. Most originated from the Armagh, and Newry and Mourne council areas.

 The Waste Licensing Regulations (Northern Ireland) 2003 permit the spreading of certain commercial sludges on agricultural land, providing that activity results in benefit to agriculture.

Any unauthorised disposal of commercial sludge causing environmental damage would be investigated with a view to prosecution.

It is an independent report based on the personal experience of the Urban Task Force members on the ground, designed to stimulate public debate and encourage new thinking&quot;.

This new report acknowledges that there have been some notable successes, and that English cities are very different places from the post-industrial centres of unemployment and failing public services of 20 years ago. The report also identifies challenges to the continuation of the urban renaissance and provides recommendations on steps necessary to strengthen the progress already made.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w28.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_221">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has welcomed the task force&#039;s new report as a useful contribution to our ongoing work on urban design and the cities and regional policy agenda, and will take full account of the report&#039;s recommendations in the context of other research and analysis undertaken by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and elsewhere. For maximum effectiveness any new approaches must also be integrated with policy developments emerging from, for example, the December 2005 EU Ministerial informal, the Government response to Kate Barker&#039;s review of Housing Supply and the consultation on the draft PPS3 document and the Code for Sustainable Homes.

2. &#039;Claimant&#039; figures include all incapacity benefit (IB) claimants, including IB credits only cases.<br>

3. Figures do not include severe disablement allowance (SDA) as claimants can remain entitled to SDA past state retirement age.<br>

4. These figures take no account of claimants who may flow on or off the benefit in the future.<br>

5. A woman born before 6 April 1950 attains pension age when she reaches the age of 60. For women born between 6 April 1950 and April 1955 &#039;Equalisation rules&#039; have been applied to gradually raise the pension age.

 The Home Office Trends in Crime model is an empirical model which attempts to explain annual changes in recorded crime in England and Wales by reference to annual changes in a number of economic, demographic, and criminal justice variables. It has been developed by joint external and internal research effort with the purpose of providing the Home Office with a tool for identifying those determinants of crime that are both within and outside of its control.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w33.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_253">The model is robust, but highly aggregated. As such it cannot account for all the factors that impact on crime rates. It has nonetheless demonstrated that economic and demographic factors have been important determinants of changes in crime over time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60301w33.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_254">The model has not been used to attribute annual changes in crime to each of the explanatory variables. However, the model predicts that, if other factors remain constant, a permanent 1 per cent. increase in the growth rate of consumption expenditure reduces the growth rate of crime by about 1.7 per cent. On a similar basis, an increase of 1 per cent. in the growth rate of the proportion of young males in the population would increase the growth rate of crime by about 0.5 per cent.

Greater Manchester police are currently placing emphasis on early intervention of low level disorder, in particular through issuing fixed penalty notices, with a view to preventing disorder escalating.
