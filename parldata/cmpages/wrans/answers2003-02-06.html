<a name="30206w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 While I am always very pleased to visit schools, I understand that Local Authority officials have met this week with the St. Andrew's Infant and Junior Schools to discuss accommodation issues and future developments. It might be best if we wait to see the outcome of that meeting before a visit is planned.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The standard academic year is 30 weeks and student support arrangements are based around this. The Student Loans Company collects information from institutions on term dates for the purposes of administering the student support system. However I do not give guidance nor does my Department collect any additional information on the length of university terms.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 We know that the main reason for the social class division in higher education participation is differential attainment in schools and colleges. We are reforming education in secondary schools and our 14&#150;19 strategy will promote higher aspirations and levels of attainment by age 19.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what measures he will take to ensure that headteachers of schools are <i>(a)</i> provided with details of how much they are set to receive, and when, following spending reviews and <i>(b)</i> better able to plan on a long-term basis and provided with details about future funding.  [94910]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Government announced the provisional level of local education authorities' education formula spending shares on 5 December. Final figures are due to be confirmed on 3 February. It is for each authority to determine the level of resource that their schools receive via the local formula funding methodology, although the Secretary of State has power to determine a minimum size of an authority's total schools budget. On 10 December, a letter from the Department confirmed the Government's policy of encouraging authorities to move towards giving schools indicative three year budgets. We told LEAs that we would publish as much information as possible about future funding on a three year basis, so that authorities could commit themselves to issuing three year indicative budgets to their schools in return for more detailed controls on local school balances. A technical note was included in the letter to allow authorities to begin the process of drawing up three year budgets.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 In my Statement to the House on Higher Education on 22 January I said that 30 per cent. of students would benefit in full from the new Higher Education Grant of &#163;1,000, available for those whose income was below &#163;10,000. I have since received more up-to-date data which indicate that within the 30 per cent. of students to be supported, we may be able to afford to raise the threshold for the full grant higher than the proposed &#163;10,000. The revised data are currently being checked and validated and I will make a further statement to the House when this has been completed. I shall also write to my hon Friend at that point with a more detailed answer to her question.

<P>
<a name="30206w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 All primary pupils have to study design and technology, including work with food and textiles within the national curriculum. Typically primary pupils learn food preparation and cooking skills, including food hygiene, and are encouraged to develop positive attitudes to healthy eating and food choice. The Government strongly encourage secondary schools to offer pupils the opportunity to study food technology, and around 90 per cent. do so. Food, nutrition and healthy eating are also taught within science and personal, social and health education (PSHE) at both primary and secondary level. Many secondary pupils also have the opportunity to study textiles through both design and technology and art and design. Home economics is still available as a GCSE title and includes food and nutrition, textiles and child development. Both food technology and textiles technology GCSE courses have proved extremely popular and more young people now take these courses, than previously entered for home economics before the introduction of the national curriculum.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w01.html_wqn8"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the cost is of training learning support assistants to become primary teachers in this financial year; and if he will invest in such training in areas of substantial teacher shortage on the fringes of London.  [95759]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 In 2002&#150;03 funding for higher education based postgraduate primary teacher training is &#163;5,400 per trainee. Postgraduate trainee teachers may also be eligible for a &#163;6,000 bursary. Training providers receive &#163;4,400 for each year of training for undergraduate primary trainee teachers.
<P>

<a name="30206w01.html_para0">For the Graduate Teacher Programme route into teaching, grants of up to &#163;17,500 are available towards trainees' salary, training and assessment costs. So far this academic year, 770 former teaching assistants have begun training through this route.
<P>

<a name="30206w01.html_para1">My Department's recent consultation paper "Developing the roles of school support staff" proposes ways of improving career progression routes for teaching assistants and other support staff, including routes to qualified teacher status (QTS). Funding will be provided to support training for those who wish to take on higher-level roles and the training they receive will provide a first step towards QTS for those who wish to progress further.

<a name="30206w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Damian Green: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the likelihood of the Sector Skills Development Agency meeting its target of licensing eight sector skills councils by 31 March; and if he will make a statement.  [95540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Ivan Lewis </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 4 February 2003]:</i> No target for the licensing of Sector Skills Councils has ever been set. My Department has told the Sector Skills Development Agency from the outset that they should work to a standard, not a deadline. It is more important that they take the time to ensure that applicants develop their proposals properly, with full involvement of sector

employers, and so have the ability to deliver our ambitions for the new network. Good progress is being made in developing the network. Five trailblazer Sector Skills Councils were announced in December 2001 and nine further sectors are in the final phase of developing Sector Skills Council proposals for consideration by the Sector Skills Development Agency. We expect the first SSCs to be licensed early in 2003.

 In the last year 33 victims have contacted the Attorney and myself personally complaining of unduly lenient sentences.

 Victim Personal Statements, were introduced in October 2001 to give victims the chance to explain how the crime has affected them. They help the court when sentencing.

<P>

<a name="30206w02.html_para4">The Highways Agency is already subject to the following targets, which it successfully achieved in the last year: that no more than 15 per cent. of its housing stock is vacant on 31 March in any year; and that no more than 3 per cent. of habitable properties are empty for more than six months.
<P>

<a name="30206w02.html_para5">Although the number of vacant properties as at 31 December 2002 exceeds the 15 per cent. target (17.3 per cent.) it is not uncommon to be above the target level at that time of year and current forecasts indicate that the target is likely to be reached by 31 March 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) is responsible for matters relating to the safety of sea-going passenger vessels which ply for hire privately around the UK coast. The vessels must be surveyed, operated and certificated to specific standards.
<P>

<a name="30206w03.html_para1">The MCA Codes of Practice cover commercially operated vessels under 24 metres in length, operating with up to 12 passengers. The MCA or an authorised Certifying Authority will issue Code Vessel Certificates.
<P>

<a name="30206w03.html_para2">The skipper of such a vessel is required to hold a qualification appropriate to its operation. The MCA does not require insurance as part of the issue of a Code Vessel Certificate, but insurance is strongly recommended.
<P>

<a name="30206w03.html_para3">Vessels that have Code of Practice certificates are not required to hold Local Authority licences. However, under the provisions of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, Local Authorities may still issue licences provided that the vessel has a UK Load Line or Load Line Exemption Certificate. Such licences are acceptable in place of certificates issued to vessels under the relevant MCA Code of Practice.
<P>

<a name="30206w03.html_para4">There is no requirement for a vessel to be registered at the Registry of Shipping and Seamen.

[95676]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Enforcement of the national minimum wage is carried out by the Inland Revenue's National Minimum Wage Compliance Teams, on behalf of the Department of Trade and Industry.
<P>

<a name="30206w03.html_para5">Compliance Officers investigate every complaint received about employers failing to pay their workers the minimum wage. This includes complaints from individual workers and from third parties. They ensure that the appropriate minimum wage is being paid and that the workers receive any arrears of wages due to them. The officers also investigate other employers identified as being most at risk of non-compliance.
<P>

<a name="30206w03.html_para6">There are no figures of the number of inspections carried out on employers of UK registered ships.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport when London Underground were first informed of the problem of motors breaking free on high speed underground trains; what subsequent reports they received; and what action was taken.  [95085]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w04.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 3 February 2003]:</i> I understand from London Underground that they first became aware of problems on the Central line train fleet on 3 September 2001 during a routine maintenance check at Hainault depot, when a train was found to have a dislodged motor. London Underground carried out an immediate ultrasonic examination of the relevant area on other motors, which revealed no further instance of failure.
<P>

<a name="30206w04.html_para1">An independent investigation commissioned by London Underground concluded that the problem was loose bolts. A check of motor bolts on all Central and Waterloo & City line trains was immediately carried out and revealed one instance of a motor with fractured bolts, where the motor was held in place by its safety bracket.The whole fleet was initially fully checked twice, after which a regime of checking all bolts at least once every 3 months was instigated.
<P>

<a name="30206w04.html_para2">On 20 September 2002, a train which was not in service but was entering Loughton sidings was derailed when a motor dropped off. An investigation revealed that the motor bolts had fractured and the safety bracket had failed to retain the detached motor as it was designed to do.
<P>

<a name="30206w04.html_para3">Because of this, the most stringent checking regime possible was introduced with each train being checked every 5 days as a rolling programme across the fleet.
<P>

<a name="30206w04.html_para4">Further independent investigation was also undertaken as a result of the Loughton incident. This highlighted a new concern over the safety bracket bolts and these were specifically included within the 5-daily check regime.
<P>

<a name="30206w04.html_para5">The HSE are also conducting a full investigation.

 This information is not yet available. Until the World bank has conducted Debt Sustainability Analyses for all the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC), particularly those affected by conflict, it is not possible to calculate the total cost of debt cancellation for these countries under the HIPC Initiative.

 During 2002, the Independent Scientific Group (ISG) Vaccine Scoping Study Sub-Committee (VSSSC) met six times and will report to my right hon.

 With regard to animal health controls on the importation of live animals and their genetic material it is Government policy that, where trade has not been harmonised under EU rules such imports remain prohibited except under the authority of an import licence issued in accordance with bilateral agreements. All imports of such commodities have to be accompanied by health certification in accordance with the legislation in place.

<a name="30206w05.html_para1">The Government has commissioned several advisory reports on livestock cloning, including "The implications of cloning for the welfare of farmed livestock" from Farm Animal Welfare Council, 2002. The Government accepts the findings of this report that the cloning of livestock is ethically acceptable, providing it is carried out within the framework of the general principles laid down in the Banner Committee's report of 1995, which considered the 'Ethical Implications of Emerging Technologies in the Breeding of Farm Animals'.

The UK supported the proposal for this fund, provided that the Community financing could be found within the limits of the Berlin Financial Perspective. The Commission has yet to come forward with a fund that meets this condition.

The Commission noted that funds would be freed in some member states if the Council curtailed aid paid for building new vessels.

<P>
<a name="30206w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 There is no financial aid available in England and Wales for this type of capital expenditure. However, help is available in the form of guidance and advice, and the Environment Agency is working with the petroleum retailers industry to ensure that this reaches those who need it. Given that underground petrol tanks may, in the course of maintenance, need replacing, the Downstream Oil Industry Forum, which is made up of Government and industry representatives, is currently looking into the cost and safety of re-lining as an alternative option for such tanks. The Forum is due to report later this year.

<a name="30206w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 EU Foreign Ministers discussed EU sanctions against the Mugabe regime at a General Affairs Council meeting in Brussels on 27&#150;28 January. The meeting proved inconclusive, as did a subsequent discussion among Permanent Representatives in Brussels on 30 January. We have made our position clear; that we want to see a roll-over of the EU sanctions on Zimbabwe, including the travel ban, when they expire on 18 February. This will require consensus among all EU member states, and has not yet been achieved.

<i>[holding answer 27 January 2003]:</i> The Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment Act) 1985 provides protection to members of the reserve forces who are called out for permanent service. In general, it places an obligation on an employer to re-instate reservists who apply to them for this following a period of called-out service. The obligation is to reinstate in the occupation in which they were last employed before call out and on terms and conditions not less favourable than those which would have been applicable had they not been called out. Where this is not reasonable and practicable, they must be taken into employment in the most favourable occupation and on the most favourable terms and conditions as are reasonable and practicable in the particular case.
<P>

<a name="30206w09.html_para3">In addition, section 217 of the Employment Rights Act 1996 provides that, where those individuals resume employment with their previous employer within six months of the end period of service with the armed forces of the Crown, the period of service does not break their continuity of employment as far as the statutory

provisions of the 1996 Act are concerned. The Ministry of Defence also has powers to make payment to individuals and their employers to maintain membership of an employer's pension scheme while the individual is called out.
<P>

<a name="30206w09.html_para4">Together these provide robust and practicable safeguards for the employment rights of individuals who are reservists when they are called out.

The UK Broadband Taskforce&#151;this is a joint initiative between DTI and OGC. The DTI contribution places a Regional Broadband Coordinator in each devolved Administration and RDA to support and promote the aggregation of public sector demand for broadband and to ensure that through such aggregation there is an extension of broadband availability, particularly in rural areas and for small and medium enterprises.

Attempts to negotiate a settlement have so far failed and the case has been referred to the International Chamber of Commerce for arbitration. The arbitration tribunal reached a decision on IMS's liability to the Iranian Ministry of Defence in 2001, but IMS is challenging the outcome in the Dutch courts. The amount of the Ministry of Defence's potential liability will be influenced by the result of the appeals process. Until that process is concluded we will not know the size of any liability.

 The Skill Force initiative is part of Ministry of Defence's work in the wider community as a force for good. The objective is to reduce the number of pupils not in employment, education or training on completion of mandatory education at 16. More immediately, the aim is to reduce truancy, school exclusion and juvenile crime. This is done by using the skills and experience of ex-Service instructors to deliver a vocational alternative for one day a week in school time. The course develops Wider and Key skills through a range of awards and qualifications ranging from St. John's Ambulance young lifesaver to Duke of Edinburgh and Key Skills qualifications. The course is structured around the ASDAN modular vocational award studied at Bronze/Silver level. Pupils gain self-confidence and team skills while working with strong positive role models from the armed forces.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what his estimate is of the cost of theft and fraud to <i>(a)</i> his Department, <i>(b)</i> its agencies and <i>(c)</i> non-departmental public bodies in 2002.  [89892]<P>

<P>
<a name="30206w14.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Reported estimates of the cost of fraud and theft are maintained for the sake of consistency in respect of financial years only and relate to a combination of suspected and proven non-procurement and procurement frauds and thefts with estimated values refined from time to time as investigations, sometimes lasting a year or more, reach a conclusion. A major element of estimated cost usually relates to "at risk" estimates applied to suspected procurement fraud cases which are often resolved as "no crime" or have a proven value lower than original estimates. The reported figures for the Department, its agencies and non- departmental public bodies for the financial year 2001&#150;02 are as follows.

 In 2002 it is estimated that 'Total Income from Farming' in Northern Ireland fell to &#163;129 million. For full-time farm businesses the average net farm income is forecast to be &#163;4,600 for the year ending March 2003, some &#163;3,700 lower than in the previous year. These figures are disappointing but reflect lower producer prices in 2002, particularly for milk, and increased expenditure on purchased feedstuffs, a reflection of the poor weather experienced during the summer of 2002. At present there are some encouraging signs which, if maintained, should lead to an improvement in farm incomes. These include the firming of milk prices and the significant strengthening of the euro relative to sterling. In addition the Vision Action Plan, recently announced by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development, addresses many of the challenges currently facing the industry and provides a clear strategy to work towards a viable and sustainable agriculture sector for the future.

 Government policies for delivering an urban renaissance are set out in the Urban White Paper "Our Towns and our Cities: the Future" published in November 2000. Although this does not require policies to be systematically urban proofed, it does provide a comprehensive framework for action for Government policies and programmes affecting urban areas in England. Progress against the White Paper's recommendations is monitored regularly across Government through an Implementation Plan, available on the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's website. The Urban Summit, held last year, brought together Ministers from across Government to reaffirm our commitment to tackling urban issues in an integrated way.

 The decision on whether or not to call-in the planning application by the Royal borough of Windsor and Maidenhead for the development of a civic quarter has been postponed for a short period.

 The long term cost of a Right to Buy sale compares the financial costs and benefits to the public sector over 30 years from a RTB sale compared to if the sale had not taken place. There are three elements to this:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the receipt from the sale&#151;a financial benefit;
<P>
<BR>
rental income foregone and expenditure saved from the home no longer being in the public sector&#151;usually a cost;

the grant needed to build a replacement social home, in the year when the home sold under RTB would have been available for letting if it had not been sold&#151;a cost
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30206w19.html_para2">The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's analysis indicates that these three elements together represent a cost per sale of &#163;17,000. This includes allowance for any net rental subsidy. Multiplied by 52,000 RTB sales in 2001&#150;02 suggests a total long term cost of these sales of &#163;885 million.

<a name="30206w20.html_spnew0"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 It is a tragedy for any child to become involved in prostitution. Children involved in prostitution are primarily victims of abuse and adults who take advantage of them, whether by exploiting them as pimps or by buying sexual services from them, are child abusers.
<P>

<a name="30206w20.html_para0">The Government issued guidance for agencies working with children entitled "Safeguarding Children in Prostitution" in May 2000. This was followed by the "The National Plan for Safeguarding Children from Commercial Sexual Exploitation", which was published in September 2001.
<P>

<a name="30206w20.html_para1">The message of both documents is that those under 18 who engage in prostitution are almost invariably victims and must be treated as such. A further message is that wherever possible criminal justice action should be pursued against those who abuse children through prostitution or seek to exploit them as prostitutes.
<P>

<a name="30206w20.html_para2">"Setting the Boundaries: Reforming the law on sex offences", the report of the Review of Sex Offences published in July 2000, did not specifically review the law on prostitution but did consider matters relating to exploiting the prostitution of others, especially children. It made recommendations to clarify, and make more effective the legislation relating to sexual exploitation. The Government announced their response to this document in the command paper "Protecting the Public" in November 2002, and introduced the Sexual Offences Bill to Parliament on 28 January 2002. This Bill proposes four new offences to directly tackle the commercial sexual exploitation of children, which will carry severe penalties. These new offences are:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Paying for Sex with a Child to tackle the demand side of this terrible trade. It will be an offence to pay for sex with a child or promise such payment or have sex with a child in the knowledge that another person has paid for or promised payment for this. 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>6 Feb 2003 : Column 427W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The maximum penalty ranges from seven years to life imprisonment depending upon the age of the child involved, and the nature of sexual activity engaged in.
<P>
<BR>
Causing or Inciting Child Prostitution or Pornography tackles those who for their own or another's gain cause or encourage a child to become involved in prostitution or pornography. The maximum sentence for this offence is 14 years imprisonment.
<P>
<BR>
Controlling a Child Prostitute or a Child involved in Pornography covers the extremely repugnant issue of pimping, where a person directs or controls the activities and movements of a child in the course of their sexual exploitation. A man who, for example, made a child stand on certain street corners, or instructed the child to participate in the making of a pornographic film would be guilty of this offence. The maximum sentence for this offence is 14 years imprisonment.
<P>
<BR>
Arranging or Facilitating Child Prostitution or Pornography covers, for example, the landlord or parent who knowingly, and for their own, or another person's gain, arranges for or allows their house to be used for the filming of a pornographic video in which children are abused.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30206w20.html_para3">These proposed new offences cover the sexual exploitation of children up until the age of 18.
<P>

<a name="30206w20.html_para4">The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 introduces a new offence of trafficking persons to control them in prostitution. This offence carries a maximum penalty of 14 years in prison. The Sexual Offences Bill includes more comprehensive trafficking legislation, carrying the same penalties but covering a wider range of activities, which are intended to replace this provision.
<P>

<a name="30206w20.html_para5">In addition, the Home Office continues to fund six prostitution initiatives as part of the "What Works: Tackling Prostitution" scheme, funded by the Crime Reduction Programme. These projects address the issues of child prostitution, policing and the process of exiting a lifestyle of prostitution and seek to better inform us of successful strategies for dealing with and managing the nuisance caused by the activities of prostitutes, the behaviour of those involved in the exploitation of others and ways of supporting those involved in prostitution who wish to exit the trade.

 The estimate of Criminal Record Bureau fees (&#163;117,276,161) quoted in the answer to Matthew Taylor's question of 21 March 2002 were based on a charge of &#163;13.80 for a disclosure, &#163;345 for a registered body and &#163;5.75 for a countersignature. These were estimated to generate &#163;131,264,580 gross revenue, which minus the cost of free disclosures for volunteers (&#163;13,988,419) results in a net revenue of &#163;117,276,161. The demand for enhanced and standard Disclosures was forecasted to be 3,330,595 and for basic Disclosures, 5,990,000.

<a name="30206w21.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Stephen Moore's terms of reference require him to take full account of inquiries being undertaken by the Bedfordshire Police and the Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service. He is also required to conduct his inquiry in a way that would not impede any criminal investigation. Criminal trials arising out of the events at Yarl's Wood on 14 and 15 February are listed for April 2003. Consideration is therefore still being given as to when the report can be completed and published.

 No firm decision about that part of the Yarl's Wood site that was destroyed by fire has yet been taken. However, work has started with a view to the installation of sprinklers in the remaining part and places will become available as soon as this installation and other associated work are complete. We are working towards opening the centre in late April or early May to house single females, and later families, both asylum and non-asylum cases. There is also the matter of the outstanding insurance claim to be settled and negotiations are continuing on this.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will ensure that sole practitioner solicitors can be indemnified for fraud; and if she will make a statement.  [95337]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w21.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 It is a general principle of English law that one cannot be indemnified against one's own dishonesty. So in that regard it is not possible for a sole practitioner solicitor, or any other person, to have insurance cover against his/her own fraud. For this reason most professional indemnity insurance policies contain a dishonesty exclusion which excludes the liability of the insurer to indemnify any person involved in the dishonesty, or fraudulent act, giving rise to the claim. Any "innocent" partners or employees not involved in the dishonesty or fraud will still have the benefit of cover under the policy. The current position, whereby solicitors obtain indemnity insurance from commercial providers, does not differ from the previous arrangements under which indemnity cover was provided by the Solicitors Indemnity Fund.
<P>

<a name="30206w21.html_para0">However, the Law Society continues to maintain a Compensation Fund, under which it is possible to make a claim for loss arising out of the dishonesty of a Solicitor, including a sole practitioner, in circumstances where the claim is excluded from the practice's professional indemnity cover. Any payments from the fund are made on a discretionary basis by the Law Society, having regard to the statutory provisions, rules and guidelines pursuant to which the fund is maintained. The level of cover provided by the Compensation Fund is up to &#163;1 million per claim.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w21.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 I understand from the Law Society that the number of solicitors with practising certificates as at 31 July 1992 was 59,563, and as at 31 January 2003 was 90,358.

 None to date. I understand that the Electoral Commission is shortly to commence a review of the voting age, and its work will include the preparation of a paper which is expected to be issued widely for public consultation this summer. The Government welcome this review, which will help to inform the debate on the age that the right to vote should be set. It will give careful serious consideration to any recommendations the Electoral Commission may make following its review.

<P>
<a name="30206w21.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The National School Fruit Scheme will entitle children aged four to six to a free piece of fruit each school day by 2004. The original pilots are now being expanded in selected regions in England with funding from the New Opportunities Fund.
<P>

<a name="30206w21.html_para1">During this expansion the scheme is open to children in reception, Year 1 and Year 2 classes within local education authority maintained infant, primary and special schools as well as children in nursery classes attached to these schools. Free fruit is offered to whole classes and therefore some three and seven-year-olds also receive fruit if they are in these classes. Nursery schools that are not attached to infant, primary or special schools are not eligible and there are currently no plans to include them.
<P>

<a name="30206w21.html_para2">These early stages of expansion are being carefully evaluated to learn lessons that will inform all aspects of the Scheme in 2004, including the practicalities of delivery to large numbers of schools.
<P>

<a name="30206w21.html_para3">In the consultation document, "Healthy Start", we put forward proposals to enable children in nurseries to have the choice of either a piece of fruit or milk via the Welfare Food Scheme. Decisions on the future of the Scheme will not be taken until the outcome of the consultation on the proposals has been assessed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w21.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The 999 system is designed to put callers in touch with the emergency services locally. If an ambulance service receives a call that is outside their area then it is their responsibility to pass it on to the ambulance service in the appropriate area.
<P>

<a name="30206w21.html_para4">If a call is made close to the London Ambulance Service's boundaries the nearest ambulance is immediately dispatched in accordance with nationally agreed control procedures. This action is taken before, or at the same time as, the call details are being transferred to the service responsible for the call. Once connected to the appropriate service a joint decision is taken between the staff of both services as to whether the first ambulance should continue or be cancelled in favour of a local ambulance resource that may be closer to the call.

<a name="30206w22.html_wqn1"><B> Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health pursuant to Ref.PQ02260, 29 January 2003, whether statistics on the numbers of people experiencing bone fractures while being cared for in NHS hospitals will be collected as part of the proposed national reporting and learning system for adverse events.  [95567]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The national reporting and learning system will collect reports from National Health Service staff, patients, carers and the public on all kinds of adverse events and near misses involving NHS patients, including those relating to bone fractures.
<P>

<a name="30206w22.html_para0">The system will enable the National Patient Safety Agency (NPSA) to identify trends and patterns of adverse events, including avoidable injuries such as bone fractures, and to use this information to seek effective solutions to stop them recurring.
<P>

<a name="30206w22.html_para1">The NPSA is currently looking into interventions to prevent hip fractures occurring to those who fall while under NHS care, including the use of hip protectors. The NPSA is also collaborating with the National Institute for Clinical Excellence in the development of guidelines for falls prevention in acute settings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the effectiveness of brain cooling technologies in treating brain damage.  [92289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w22.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Researchers have suggested that cooling the body may limit a chemical chain reaction in which injured brain cells release toxic chemicals that damage neighbouring cells. Clinical trials in rat populations with traumatic brain injuries suggest hypothermia does reduce permeability of the blood brain barrier, bruising and swelling of the brain, and neural cell death and injury. In recent years, there have been human clinical trials studying the connection between hypothermia and traumatic brain injury outcomes.
<P>

<a name="30206w22.html_para2">Some of the trials showed promising results, while one showed no benefit and, in fact, indicated hypothermia may be harmful to patients over 45 years of age. It has now been recognised that larger trials are required that provide the statistical power necessary to give clear answers both in children and in adults.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w22.html_spnew5"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Unaccompanied asylum-seeking children are supported by local authorities' social services departments under the Children Act 1989. This requires authorities to undertake a needs assessment as specified in the Government guidance, the "Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families".
<P>

<a name="30206w22.html_para5">This multi-disciplinary assessment will determine the type of support the young person will receive, depending on their needs, wishes and capabilities. If the child becomes looked after, a health assessment must be undertaken and then reviewed annually by an appropriately qualified registered medical practitioner.
<P>

<a name="30206w22.html_para6">If not a looked-after child, support may be less intensive but will still be in line with the framework guidance.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w22.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 I met with the president and chief executive of the Health Professionals Council (HPC) on 4 December 2002 at which all aspects of the HPC's proposals were discussed.
<P>

<a name="30206w22.html_para7">The HPC consulted about which titles should be protected by law and has undertaken extensive market research to understand the public's perception of titles currently in use by healthcare professionals. The HPC's decision to propose the protection of both chiropodist and podiatrist reflects the general perception that these titles are used interchangeably. The titles indicate that those registered have met HPC's standards of competence. All applicants for registration will be expected to meet standards of proficiency, whether they are applying through the transitional arrangements, as international applicants or as UK applicants who have completed an approved course.
<P>

<a name="30206w22.html_para8">The HPC proposes using subsections of the register to distinguish between modalities of care but believes that to distinguish between skill levels would be confusing and unnecessary. The HPC has no plans to introduce a sub-register for those practitioners who do not meet the Council's standards of proficiency and who would not therefore be able to use the protected titles. Ultimately, it is for the Health Professions Council to propose and the Privy Council to determine the protected titles that will be associated with parts and subsections of the Health Professions Register.

 The Government has made no assessment of the effect on the self-esteem and recovery of long term patients in mental health in-patient units being reliant on the National Health Service for clothing. However, empowering patients to take an active role in their own care is a key theme in the NHS Plan. In addition, the National Institute for Mental Health for England (NIMHE) is in the process of gathering examples of positive practice in the provision of clothing needs for long term patients in mental health in-patient units. We hope to make such examples of positive practice available on the NIMHE website in the spring.

 The increases in National Insurance, announced by my right hon. Friend, the Chancellor of the Exchequer on 17 April 2002, will come in to effect in April 2003. A table is attached showing the percentage increase on the provider's total cost base. As the NI increase is 1 per cent., on pay, and pay is two thirds or more of costs, this averages about 0.7 per cent. increase on total costs.

<P>
<a name="30206w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Gender reassignment surgery consists of a series of different surgical procedures, for example, female to male gender reassignment may require a mastectomy and a hysterectomy and a series of operations to construct a phallus. The Department collects Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) from national health service trusts on operations specifically for sexual transformation, but those procedures such as mastectomies or hysterectomies are collected separately and it is not possible to identify if these were carried out as part of a gender reassignment operation. Details of the NHS trusts who have undertaken any operations for sexual transformation in the past five years are listed in the table.

 The original timetable for appointing the Health Protection Agency (HPA) shadow chief executive officer (CEO) had been for the end of October 2002, to enable the incoming shadow chair of the HPA to participate in the appointment procedure.
<P>

<a name="30206w24.html_para0">Following advertisements in the national press and professional journals, it was felt that the field of responses could be strengthened and that, given the importance of the role of the new Agency, the assistance of executive search consultants should be sought to advise on and co-ordinate the appointment. This was undertaken during November and December 2002, enabling competitive interviews to be held in early January.
<P>

<a name="30206w24.html_para1">The result of that process has been the announcement of the CEO appointment, Dr Pat Troop, on 27 January 2003.

[94957]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w24.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Blears: </B>

<P>
<a name="30206w24.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Decisions have not yet been made on the Department of Health central budget programme for 2003&#150;04 so the overall sum available to the Health Protection Agency including funding for any redundancies is not yet finalised. The HPA will not be able to agree its organisational structures until after its board has been appointed, so staff could not be identified as being at risk of redundancy until then. If staff are identified as being at risk they will be guaranteed employment for a period of 12 months from 1 April 2003 under the agreed change management protocol.

 We received over 200 written responses to the consultation paper on the Health Protection Agency (HPA). Our decision to proceed with the HPA's creation, first as a special health authority and subsequently as a non-departmental public body, takes account of the widespread support for establishing the HPA.
<P>

<a name="30206w24.html_para3">Because the consultation paper set out proposals for creating the HPA by Regulatory Reform Order, it did not simply invite views on general principles but made relatively detailed proposals about the nature of the legislation needed. Many of the responses similarly made detailed points. We are continuing to consider these points in deciding on the details of the legislation to establish the agency. We aim to publish a report on the consultation exercise at the same time as our proposals for changes to primary legislation, since at that stage we shall best be able to show how we have taken into account the detailed points made.

 Staff transferring to the Health Protection Agency (HPA) will retain their terms and conditions of employment, which apply at the time of transfer, until harmonised terms and conditions of employment are agreed with recognised trade unions.

 The Commission for Health Improvement (CHI) reviews and monitors compliance with the national infection control standard for acute trusts during their routine clinical governance reviews. The CHI undertakes a rolling four-year inspection of hospital trusts' systems and processes for monitoring and improving services. These clinical governance reviews, among other things, assess the compliance with national standards and identifies where further action needs to be taken. Conversely, the CHI also praises and highlights best practice from which the rest of the National Health Service can learn.

<a name="30206w24.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Disregarding annual inflationary awards, we estimate that reducing all junior doctors' hours to below 56 per week will result in a saving to the national health service pay bill of some 15 million between 2003&#150;04 and 2004&#150;05.
<P>

<a name="30206w24.html_para8">This saving must be offset against potential costs where it may be necessary to either employ more doctors or other staff to cover hours lost or to make appropriate alternative service provision.

However, consumers may use Kava-kava for many reasons. The test for making a prohibition order under section 62 of the Medicines Act 1968 is whether this is necessary in the interests of safety.

 Full information on environmental tobacco smoke is published by the Department in the leaflet, "Passive Smoking&#151;What it is and what you can do".
<P>

<a name="30206w26.html_para3">We are working closely with the hospitality trade to develop the Public Places Charter designed to provide customers with clear information on the type of smoking policy operating in a particular establishment and allow them to make an informed choice.
<P>

<a name="30206w26.html_para4">We are also increasing the visibility of health messages highlighting to smokers the risks environmental tobacco smoke presents. This is through regulations to transpose into United Kingdom law the EU Directive on the Manufacture, Presentation and Sale of Tobacco Products. These regulations require tobacco products to carry larger and starker health warnings, on both the front and back of the packet. The dangers of passive smoking are highlighted in two of the new warnings which include ''Smoking seriously harms you and others around you" and "Protect children: don't make them breathe your smoke" The contents of tobacco smoke are also highlighted in a warning saying, "Smoke contains benzene, nitrosomines, formaldehyde and hydrogen cyanide".
<P>

<a name="30206w26.html_para5">We are encouraging all employers to introduce smoke-free work places. This year the Department is funding local tobacco control alliances across England to carry out projects in close co-operation with local

These projects vary in nature from the production of smoke-free guides to pubs and restaurants to the provision of advice and support to managers wishing to introduce policies. We hope that many will be suitable for national application.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w26.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The Government's vision in the NHS Plan is to provide fast and convenient care, available when people require it and tailored to their individual needs.
<P>

<a name="30206w26.html_para6">We are taking forward programmes of work to increase capacity and deliver a wider range of services in primary and community settings, using general practitioners and nurses with specialist skills, in a modern, efficient and integrated way, which is convenient for patients. This will involve, for example, millions more outpatient appointments taking place in the community rather than in hospital.
<P>

<a name="30206w26.html_para7">In addition, the day surgery operational guide, published in August 2002 makes it clear that, where a patient requires a procedure that can be performed as a day case, it should be assumed that the procedure will take place as a day case, unless it is not possible or the patient asks to be admitted as an inpatient. Patients receive treatment that is suited to their needs and which allows them to recover in their own home. The risk of hospital acquired infection is also reduced.
<P>

<a name="30206w26.html_para8">To support this, we are also creating additional capacity in diagnosis and treatment centres, which provide high quality, scheduled, booked care for a pre-defined range of elective treatments and diagnostics. These will be geared towards patient convenience.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30206w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 The value for money public service agreement (PSA) target requires that value for money in the national health service and personal social services will improve by at least 2 per cent. per annum, with annual improvements of 1 per cent. in both cost efficiency and service effectiveness.
<P>

<a name="30206w26.html_para9">It is therefore the cost and quality of the delivered output rather than the volume of output that will be used to measure progress against the PSA target.
<P>

<a name="30206w26.html_para10">For the NHS, the cost element of the PSA will be measured using changes in reference costs. The quality element of the target will be assessed by comparing the estimated expenditure on increasing service effectiveness with data on quality. A key element of this

will be the value that can be placed on the lives saved from reducing mortality following health care interventions.
<P>

<a name="30206w26.html_para11">For personal social services, costs will be based on unit costs of services, after some adjustments to allow for increases in funding for quality improvements. The quality element will be based on the quality indicators published by the Department.

<P>

<a name="30206w26.html_para14">The transfer of laboratories away from PHLS does not represent a fundamental change in the provision of clinical microbiology: it has long been the case that the bulk of such services have been provided by NHS trusts and there are several precedents for laboratories transferring from PHLS to the NHS.

 Total payments to national health service trusts in England, Scotland and Wales from the recovery of charges following road traffic accidents are expected to reach &#163;100 million for 2002&#150;03.

<a name="30206w27.html_para0">The amounts recovered for future years will depend on the number of people who are injured in road traffic accidents and who then make successful claims for personal injury compensation. However, increases in amounts recovered are expected when increases in the tariff and ceiling of charges introduced in January 2003 take full effect, which is expected to be around July 2004.

 The United Kingdom does not routinely collect comparable data for the countries of the Council of Europe.
<P>

<a name="30206w27.html_para3">The 1999 report from the World Bank, entitled "Curbing the Epidemic", stated that "policy makers who are interested in controlling tobacco need to know whether cigarette advertising and promotion affect consumption. The answer is they almost certainly do, although the data are not straightforward. The key conclusion is that bans on advertising and promotion prove effective, but only if they are comprehensive, covering all media and all uses of brand names and logos". The World Bank suggests that implementation of EU Directive 98/43/EC could have reduced cigarette consumption within the European Union by nearly 7 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30206w27.html_para4">"Effect of Tobacco Advertising on Tobacco Consumption", the "Smee" report produced by the Economic and Operational Research Division of the Department of Health in 1992, concluded that a reduction of cigarette consumption in the order of 2.5 per cent., might be expected in the long run. This would save up to 3,000 lives a year.
