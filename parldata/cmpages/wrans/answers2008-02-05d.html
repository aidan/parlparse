<p><a name="stpa_420"><a name="80205w0001.htm_para14"><a name="08020544000132">There has been an overall increase in proportions of state school entrants across the whole of the higher education sector since the PIs were introduced in 1997. In fact the latest available figure of 86.9 per cent., for young full-time first degree entrants to English higher education institutions in 2005/06, is the highest ever.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_421"><a name="80205w0001.htm_para15"><a name="08020544000133">This information is taken from the annual Performance Indicators in Higher Education, which are currently published by the Higher Education Statistics Agency.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_422"><a name="80205w0001.htm_para16"><a name="08020544000134">For each institution, the state school proportion is shown against a benchmark. This is a sector average which is adjusted for each institution to take into account the following factors: subject of study, qualifications on entry and age on entry. The benchmarks can be used to show how a university is performing compared to the sector as a whole, and also help to determine whether a meaningful comparison can be drawn between two or more universities.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_423"><a name="80205w0001.htm_para17"><a name="08020544000135">The table includes the numbers of young entrants to each institution. From this it is clear that the number of students at each institution varies widely, and some have less than 100 students. Figures based on small numbers such as these should be treated with care.</p>

 Train to Gain is a service specifically designed to give employers access to the advice and support they need to help them identify and then meet the skills their businesses need to succeed. It was launched in April 2006. Up until November 2007, the latest period for which figures are available, the Train to Gain service reports that 317,010 people have started a programme of learning and 153,300 have thus far successfully completed their learning activity, including over 131,00 full level 2s. However it would be misleading to simply use these output measures to calculate a percentage or success rate because many learners are still working to complete their course and new people are starting learning programmes through Train to Gain every day. DIUS and LSC officials are working to establish a sound methodology to enable a true success rate to be derived once sufficient data has been collected. This will be published as soon as it becomes available.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 February 2008]:</i> The MOD offers a number of ways to help parents ensure that their children's education does not suffer as a result of family moves. Although operational requirements come first, the Service Assigning Authorities make every effort to take into account individual preferences for location and timing, especially in relation to the school calendar. Where assignments fall during a key educational stage, service personnel may retain family accommodation at the current location in order to provide continuity of schooling.</p>

 The UK funded a review of the Afghan Government's national drugs control strategy (NDCS) and the institutional framework supporting it in the summer of 2007.

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="80205w0008.htm_para1"><a name="08020544001160">Recycling rates are growing fast, but there will always be some wastes that cannot be recycled. 11 per cent. of waste is currently incinerated in England, but an increase is likely to be needed to be able to meet landfill directive targets, despite big improvements in waste recycling and minimisation. Recovering energy from waste (including via incineration) offers a considerable climate change benefit compared to the alternative of landfill. This is primarily through avoided landfill methane emissions, with energy generated from the biodegradable fraction of waste also offsetting fossil fuel power generation.</p>

In England and Wales a child under 10 is below the age of criminal responsibility and so cannot be prosecuted and convicted, so by definition those of this age on the DNA Database had not been convicted of any offence. Also, in England and Wales the police have no power to take a DNA sample from an under 10 without the consent of a parent or guardian. In Scotland the age of criminal responsibility is eight, so the nine children whose details had been submitted by Scottish forces may have been convicted of an offence.</p>

The majority of the seizures of cocaine and heroin took place outside of the UK. Trafficking routes frequently involve a number of countries and the route from producer to the UK will be deliberately circuitous to avoid detection by law enforcement. These are the same routes used to traffic drugs to other European states and it is, therefore, impossible to determine accurately what proportion of an individual shipment will be destined for the UK.</p>

There is a commitment set out in &#147;A Sustainable Future for Cycling&#148; to provide 250 links to schools, which will form part of the National Cycle Network (NCN) and to build other infrastructure, such as cycling routes to business parks, which are also likely to be a part of the NCN.</p>

 There are a number of ways to measure exclusion. One method is to look at people or places that have a combination of linked problems, such as unemployment, discrimination, poor skills, low incomes, poor housing, high crime, bad health and family breakdown. Recent analysis by the Social Exclusion Task Force found that around 140,000 families with children (or 2 per cent. of all families with children) in Britain experienced five or more disadvantages in 2004.</p>

The 2008-09 Operating Framework, published on 13 December 2007, calls on PCTs to work with all trusts to agree, publish and implement stretching local plans for improvement.</p>

1. More accurate validation processes in 2006 have resulted in the identification and removal of 9,858 duplicate non-medical staff records out of the total work force figure of 1.3 million in 2006. Earlier years&#146; figures could not be accurately validated in this way and so will be slightly inflated. The level of inflation in earlier years&#146; figures is estimated to be less than 1 per cent. of total across all non-medical staff groups for headcount figures (and negligible for full-time equivalents). This should be taken into consideration when analysing trends over time.<br>
2. On 25 January 2008 Alan Johnson announced &#163;330 million in extra funding for maternity services over the next three years, which will ensure growth in the maternity work force where it is needed as well as the best possible care and a full range of choices for mothers.<br>

 The DFID Southern Africa office and the British high commission in Pretoria hold regular discussions with the Government of South Africa on the issue of HIV and AIDS. In order to progress the UK's &#163;30 million HIV and AIDS programme, DFID officials recently met with the South African Ministers for Health and Social Development and the vice chair of the South African National AIDS Council, which oversees the South African responses to AIDS.</p>

 South Africa has the highest burden of HIV and AIDS in the world. Over 5.5 million people are infected, and it is estimated that in 2007 over one sixth of the world&#146;s population with HIV live in South Africa. Recent data from antenatal clinics suggest a modest decline in prevalence rates: in 2006 29 per cent. of all pregnant women had HIV, down from 30 per cent. in 2005. However, the UNAIDS Global update states that there is no evidence of a decrease in HIV among young South Africans.</p>

On 3 May the South African Cabinet approved a new national strategic plan for AIDS, with interim targets that put South Africa on track to achieve universal access by 2011. The plan is overseen by a re-vitalised South African National AIDS Council which brings together all government departments and 17 civil society sectors, including people living with HIV and AIDS, business, researchers, women, faith based organisations and traditional leaders. The UK provided technical assistance, through UNAIDS, to this revitalisation process.</p>

<i> [holding answer 4 February 2008]:</i> A variety of work has been developed to improve the emotional wellbeing and mental health of school children. The National Healthy Schools programme which has existed since 1999 promotes a whole school approach to both physical and emotional health, and one of its core themes is emotional health and wellbeing. To achieve national healthy school status, schools now need to satisfy the criteria for all four core themes and last year new guidance was issued on promoting emotional health and wellbeing to support work in this area. Currently 95 per cent. of schools have joined the National Healthy Schools programme and 55 per cent. are meeting the new standards.</p>

Approximately 60 per cent. of primary schools have voluntarily adopted SEAL, and 15 to 20 per cent. of secondary schools are expected to start implementing it by July 2008.</p>

 There has been no change in Government policy towards small rural schools. The Department has taken, and will continue to take, measures to support both schools and communities in rural areas.

 The distribution mechanism for DSG does not include value for money criteria in relation to education services in rural areas.

 Under the current rules governing reviews by the boundary commissions, the electorate of any constituency must be as near the electoral quota (broadly, this is the average number of electors in each constituency) as is practicable. The boundary commissions may depart from strict application of the rules in specified circumstances, in particular if special geographical considerations apply. The Government agreed in their response to the Committee on Standards in Public Life&#146;s Eleventh report, &#147;Review of the Electoral Commission&#148;, that it would be appropriate to review the current legislation in relation to the conduct of parliamentary boundary work.

Similarly there are prisoners eligible for release on home detention curfew, with a tag, who cannot be released because they do not have an address at which they can be curfewed. The service enables prison governors to make decisions to release such people. It is not in the public interest to keep in prison people who do not need to be there.</p>
