 All authorised bee medicines in the UK are available as general sale products. There are no plans to put the supply of medicines for bees under the control of veterinary surgeons and licensed pharmacists. Changes in European legislation, implemented by the Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2005, require medicines for food producing animals to be POM. This change will take effect on 1 January 2007 before which the Commission are due to produce a list of exemption criteria for the POM requirement. The UK has proposed to the Commission that bee medicines should be in the exempt list.

The UK has asked for bee medicines to be exempted from the POM requirement. If this is not agreed, a beekeeper will have to be registered as a suitably qualified person (SQP) if they wish to supply these products. My officials have discussed the SQP requirements with the British Beekeepers Association and are aware of their wish to progress the provision of training for beekeepers as SQPs who are able to prescribe and supply products to treat diseases in bees. The British Beekeepers Association will be meeting the Animal Medicines Training Regulatory Authority early in 2006 to discuss this. If the exemption is agreed, the current sales arrangements for bee medicines will continue.

2. It is not possible to determine the cost of lap top and desktop computers in 2004&#150;05 as VOSA pay Atos Origin on a managed service basis, rather than for just the supply of equipment. Therefore, the equipment costs are wrapped up into a monthly charge for service provision (including all network costs, software, hardware, the helpdesk etc.).<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to the answer of 17th October 2005, <i>Official Report,</i> column 678W, on heavy goods vehicles, why the United Kingdom opposed the proposal made at the GRE Committee of the UNECE to make ECE 104 retro-reflective tape mandatory on the side and rear of heavy goods vehicles; and how many countries <i>(a)</i> supported and <i>(b)</i> opposed the United Kingdom&#039;s position.

 We have been concerned that the mandatory use of retro-reflective marking tape will add additional burdens on the haulage industry associated with the cost of fitting and maintaining the tape. In light of this the UK proposed that fitment of the tape should be optional.

This will enable companies and their members to benefit from the immediacy of electronic dialogue. However, the Government recognise that electronic communications will not suit everyone. A change to the use of electronic communications will need to be approved by a resolution of the members of the company.

<i>[holding answer 15 November 2005]:</i> The Government have received a number of representations from different parts of industry, including the packaging sector, as well as from many other stakeholders on all aspects of the proposed REACH Regulation (Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals). These included responses to the UK&#039;s public consultation last year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51121w09.html_para2">
<a name="stpa_84">Within the UK, REACH was subject to a regulatory impact assessment in 2004, and a further impact assessment was carried out this year, which examined the implications of the regulation for some downstream sectors, including can coatings, taking into account information supplied by metal packaging manufacturers.
</p>


<p>
<a name="51121w09.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_85">Across the EU, REACH has been subject to over 50 regulatory impact assessments. This includes the European Commission&#039;s extended impact assessment of October 2003, which estimated that changes made to its draft proposals could save up to &#8364;10.6 billion. The Commission also carried out a further impact assessment this year in partnership with industry, trade union, consumer and environmental organisations. That assessment considered the impact of REACH on certain downstream users of chemical substances, including flexible packaging manufacturers.

Nangarhar saw the greatest decrease, with opium poppy cultivation dropping by 96 per cent. to 1,093 hectares. Success can be partly attributed to an effective Government of Afghanistan communications campaign in late 2004&#150;05, which we supported, alongside Governor-led eradication initiatives and a market adjustment to high levels of cultivation in 2004.

 We believe that only those measures to support the G8 Global Partnership that fall within Community competence should be financed by Community instruments.

Our priorities include helping disadvantaged adults gain basic and Level 2 skills for employability and progression to Level 3.

We are jointly conducting a review with the Department for Work and Pensions, the DTI, the LSC, Ufi learndirect, Jobcentre Plus, and the Sector Skills Development Agency to help determine how best to achieve this goal, which will be concluded by the end of 2006. We are extending the learndirect telephone service on a trial basis from January 2006 to provide more intensive personal guidance to inform the review. Adults throughout England seeking to progress in their careers; wanting to gain the skills for jobs typically requiring a Level 3 qualification; and returning to work from career breaks, will benefit from the new service.

From 2008 we will look to bring consistency to the treatment of student retention and achievement across school sixth forms and colleges which we expect to narrow the gap by a further 3 per cent.. Beyond that we will work to establish a common funding approach across the two sectors as part of the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s Agenda for Change.

For example, the ETP Year 2 Evaluation carried out by the Institute for Employment Studies and published alongside the White Paper, shows that brokers have been very successful in helping to engage hard to reach employers. The evaluation showed these employers found the role of brokers in carrying out a training needs analysis a major attraction. 63 per cent. of hard to reach employers cited the help of brokers linking training to business needs as an attraction of ETP (as did 55 per cent. of easy to reach employers) and thus helping to maximise the added value of the programme. Employers saw the support given to help them access flexible and responsive provision that meets their needs as a major attraction of the pilots (76 per cent. of employers cited flexibly delivered training as an attraction of ETP and 19 per cent. said it was the most attractive feature). Helping to broker the right learning for the employers and learners helps to reduce dropout and ensure high success rates.

 The White Paper &quot;Skills: Getting on in business, getting on at work&quot; published in March this year clearly states that &quot;at the heart of the National Employer Training Programme is a brokerage service that will work on behalf of the employer.&quot; Skills brokers will provide independent and impartial advice to employers on the best type of training available and then source its delivery, to meet employer needs. Brokers will help employers find their way through the often complex world of skills training and help them develop relationships with training providers which will give them the best return on their investment. Brokers are there to make the employer&#039;s search for suitable training simpler and cost-effective. Once a training relationship to meet employer&#039;s needs is in place, it is for the employer and training provider to work directly together. So long as the employer is satisfied with the quality of training they are getting, the training provider can carry on supplying it.

 An overall figure for the number of people stopped is not available as the Police Service of Northern Ireland does not maintain a record of those who were warned or given advice. Enforcement activity in respect of failure to wear seatbelts is largely by way of non-endorsable fixed penalty notices and figures in relation to this have been placed in the Library. Figures relating to prosecutions for failure to wear a seatbelt are not available for 2000&#150;03, however I can confirm that the number of prosecutions in 2004 was 1,756.

or, for example, a flick knife. The police have a number of stop-and-search powers do deal with persons suspected of carrying knives. Under the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 (PACE) police have powers to stop and search a person or vehicle where they have reasonable grounds for suspecting that they will find any article in relation to an offence of having an article with a blade or sharp point&#151;with the exception of certain folding pocket knives&#151;in a public place. The Public Order (Northern Ireland) Order 1987 allows police to stop and search any person or vehicle for offensive weapons or dangerous instruments whether or not they have reasonable grounds for suspicion in order to prevent serious violence in a locality. It is also an offence to have a knife or offensive weapon in a school, and the police may enter a school to search for such items. My Officials have been in contact with the Police Service of Northern Ireland in relation to knife crime and legislation and following consultation with the Home Office I have decided to extend to Northern Ireland those provisions in the Violent Crime Reduction Bill which will raise the age at which a person may lawfully be sold a knife from 16 to 18 years of age. I have no immediate plans for further change but I will keep the law in this sensitive and difficult area under review.

 The Department for Constitutional Affairs is taking forward a Judicial Diversity programme which is aimed at increasing applications for judicial office from groups currently under-represented in the judiciary, including women. The Judicial Diversity programme focuses on three main areas:
</p>

</p>


<p>

<a name="stpa_266">As part of the work to encourage applications and raise awareness, the Department is conducting a number of outreach events.
