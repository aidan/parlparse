 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement about the economic circumstances of Palestinians living in the occupied territories.  [30495]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The on-going violence and Israel's response to the second intifada&#151;above all its policy of closures&#151;has caused an enormous drop in incomes and living standards and a sharp drop in economic activity in the occupied territories. Levels of poverty have increased considerably from 21 per cent. at the start of the intifada, to at least 35 per cent. This means that about 1 million people exist on less than $2 per day. Unemployment is very high. Many people are just getting by thanks to savings and humanitarian aid.

<P>
33. <a name="20205w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions he has had with the Archbishop of Canterbury about his meetings with other faith leaders and their implications for the middle east peace process.  [30514]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We warmly welcome the inter-faith meetings convened by the Archbishop of Canterbury at Lambeth Palace and in Alexandria between 17 and 21 January. Dialogue and debate between the faiths is an essential part of mutual understanding. We particularly welcome the First Alexandria Declaration on the situation in the middle east, with its condemnation of the killing of innocents, and its call for a religiously sanctioned ceasefire and a return to negotiations.

15. <a name="20205w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Wareing: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what efforts are being made to ensure the safe return of Serbs who were forced to flee <i>(a)</i> Krajina and <i>(b)</i> Kosovo.  [30496]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Croatian Government have committed themselves to ensuring the safe return of Serbs to their former homes in Croatia by the end of 2002. We are continuing to remind the Government of the importance of honouring this commitment.




<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2002 : Column 796W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20205w01.html_para0">We strongly support the right of Kosovo Serbs who fled their homes to return in safety. Belgrade and Pristina are now co-ordinating closely on this issue. Efforts are being spearheaded by the newly established UNMIK Office of Returns and Communities.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent action he has taken to support the peace process in Colombia.  [30497]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The UK strongly supports the Colombian peace process, as I made clear in a press release on 23 January. We are particularly active in the EU. We have invited the Colombian presidential candidates to the UK to exchange views on the situation in Colombia, including prospects for the peace process.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what diplomatic steps he is taking to secure the safe transportation of food and the essential supplies throughout Afghanistan.  [30498]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The continuing provision of emergency humanitarian assistance to the Afghan people remains a key priority for the international community. To support this aim we continue to have an open dialogue with Afghanistan's neighbours, especially Pakistan, Iran and Uzbekistan, on keeping open the most important land corridors for the delivery of aid.
<P>

<a name="20205w01.html_para1">We are also working with the Interim Administration, the UN and other members of the international community to ensure that the security situation in Afghanistan continues to improve so that supplies can be delivered to the most vulnerable people.

<P>
20. <a name="20205w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Blizzard: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what assessment he has made of the capacity remaining for a base for international terrorism in Afghanistan.  [30501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Prior to 11 September, al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan trained an estimated 10,000 extremists a year, some of whom went on to carry out international terrorist attacks. As a part of the highly successful coalition military campaign in Afghanistan, all these camps have been closed. While pockets of resistance remain, these have little opportunity to train and develop networks of terrorists.

<P>
24. <a name="20205w01.html_wqn7"><B> Judy Mallaber: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what recent discussions the Government have had with Afghan women's organisations on women's rights.  [30505]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 During her visit to London on 31 January, Dr. Sima Sumar, the Vice Chair of the Afghan Interim Administration and Minister for Women, met my right hon. Friends the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary, the Secretary of State for International Development, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, the Secretary of State for Defence and myself. We discussed her priorities for improving the lives of women in Afghanistan and emphasised the Government's support for her work.

<P>

<a name="20205w01.html_para2">My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I met my hon. Friend the Member for Lewisham, Deptford (Joan Ruddock) and a delegation of Afghan women from the UK Women's Link with Afghan Women on 24 January to discuss their priorities for reconstruction in Afghanistan.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_wqn8"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps the UK Government are taking to ensure the protection of women from violence in Afghanistan, with particular reference to sexual violence.  [30421]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The UK Government condemn all violence against women. The restoration of security and stability in Afghanistan will be an essential step towards ensuring their protection. The UK-led International Security Assistance Force is working with Afghans to establish security in and around Kabul. The establishment of trained police services will also be key. We welcome the offer by the German Government to train police in Afghanistan.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_wqn9"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps the UK Government are taking to <i>(a)</i> recognise and <i>(b)</i> act on the demands of Afghan women addressed to the international community, as set out in the Brussels Proclamation of the Afghan Women's Summit in December of last year.  [30422]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Government believe that it is extremely important that the international community consults the women of Afghanistan themselves about their priorities. The UNIFEM Afghan Women's Summit, held in Brussels last December, marked a positive start.
<P>

<a name="20205w01.html_para3">The summit was the largest global gathering of Afghan women leaders to focus on the role of women in the new post-Taliban Afghanistan. It addressed the crucial needs of all the people of Afghanistan, focusing on health care, education, refugees and human rights. We hope that the international community will support the aims of the summit declaration, calling for a greater role for women in the future decision-making process in Afghanistan.
<P>

<a name="20205w01.html_para4">We welcome the pledge made by the Chair of the Afghan Interim Administration, Hamid Karzai, at the Tokyo Donors' Conference on 21 January to ensure that the needs of women are a priority in the reconstruction process. We welcome his commitment to ensure that girls get back to school.
<P>

<a name="20205w01.html_para5">We also welcome the establishment of the Women's Ministry and fully support the work of Dr. Sima Samar, Vice Chair of the Interim Administration and Minister for Women. We have long said that, while the form of the Government and constitution is for the Afghan people to determine, the future Government must be broadly based and representative of all Afghans. We have encouraged the involvement of women in the Afghan Interim Administration and the Special Commission for the Convening of the Loya Jirga, established under the Bonn Agreement, and expect that women will be involved in any future Government of Afghanistan.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_wqn10"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps the UK Government and the international community are taking 



<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2002 : Column 798W</I><P>
to ensure that the interests and role of women are being acted on during the initial phase of peace-building in Afghanistan.  [30424]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We welcome the pledge made by the Chair of the Interim Administration, Hamid Karzai, at the Tokyo Donors' Conference that the needs of women should be a high priority in the reconstruction process. The people of Afghanistan are beginning to see real improvements in their lives. Girls are returning to school and university. Access to television and to international media will allow women to be better informed about the situation both inside their country and the wider world. Better access to health care and to education will afford women an improved standard of living.
<P>

<a name="20205w01.html_para6">As women return to work, their financial situation will improve. This is especially important for all the female heads of household who were destitute when deprived of their livelihoods by the Taliban restrictions on female working. Afghanistan has more than a million war widows. NGO and UN-run projects to get women back to work will have a huge impact on the lives of many Afghan women and children. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has also agreed to fund a project by a local Afghan women's NGO to help establish a quilt weaving co-operative as a means to providing a trade and an income for destitute women.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_wqn11"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what training is funded by the UK Government for staff involved in projects working with women in Afghanistan.  [30426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We have given an allocation of $1 million to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) for a programme to support Afghan women's leadership through awareness raising, capacity building and gender mainstreaming as well as local level, quick impact recovery projects supporting women. We are also in discussion with the Ministry for Women on how we can provide other support activities.
<P>

<a name="20205w01.html_para7">Our funding for UNIFEM will include support for gender mainstreaming within the reconstruction and peacebuilding strategies of the UN, inter-governmental bodies and regional organisations. This will involve awareness building and training initiatives.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_wqn12"><B> Joan Ruddock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps the UK Government and the international community are taking to ensure that the monitoring of the reconstruction work within Afghanistan takes into account its impact on women.  [30428]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w01.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We strongly support the common programming approach under the United Nations-led Strategic Framework for Afghanistan, which is intended to provide a principled, co-ordinated and coherent approach to programming. One of its key themes is the protection and advancement of human rights, with particular emphasis on gender issues.
<P>

<a name="20205w01.html_para8">We recognise the need to build the capacity of Afghanistan's women to enable them to take full part in the reconstruction of their society, including the new Interim Administration, and to ensure that legal, constitutional and other provisions are not discriminatory against women. Our funding for support of Afghan 



<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2002 : Column 799W</I><P>
women during the recovery and reconstruction of Afghanistan is being channelled through United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations, who will work closely with the Interim Administration and who have expressed a commitment to involving Afghan women in the design, implementation and monitoring of their strategies and programmes.
<P>

<a name="20205w01.html_para9">To date this includes an allocation of $1 million to the United Nations Development Fund for Women (UNIFEM) for a programme to support Afghan women's leadership through awareness raising, capacity building and gender mainstreaming as well as local level, quick impact recovery projects supporting women. We are also in discussion with the Ministry for Women on how we can provide other support to its activities.

 Promotion of human rights is at the heart of our foreign policy. Britain is an active and committed member of the Commission on Human Rights. We are making preparations within Whitehall, with EU partners and with NGOs. I will go to Geneva myself in March to deliver the UK speech.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps he has taken to help ensure that elections in Zimbabwe will be fair.  [30503]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 On 28 January the EU decided to impose targeted sanctions on senior members of the Government of Zimbabwe if the election is assessed as not being free and fair. On 30 January the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group (CMAG) called on the Government of Zimbabwe to ensure that all parties in the election be allowed to campaign freely. It called for 



<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2002 : Column 800W</I><P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The United States Government have expressed strong concern at the situation in Zimbabwe over a number of months. In addition, the Zimbabwe Democracy and Economic Recovery Act invites the US Administration to consult and co-ordinate with international partners on action against Zimbabwe. The US Administration are yet to impose sanctions but are urgently considering their next steps.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what steps he is taking within the UN to promote human rights in Sierra Leone.  [30510]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w02.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The formal ending of the conflict in Sierra Leone on 18 January 2002 marked the beginning of the restoration of human rights for the long-suffering Sierra Leonean people. An important element in this process is the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, in which the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights is leading the way. We have funded preparatory work for the UN, to facilitate the commission, and will continue to strongly support its establishment. We have also led in the UN Security Council to secure the special court for Sierra Leone, which will bring to justice those responsible for the worst of the atrocities committed in Sierra Leone during the last few years.

<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The UK has been at the forefront in supporting UN Security Council resolution 1315 (2000) for a special court for Sierra Leone. This institution will bring to justice those most responsible for gross human rights abuses committed during the conflict, and send a strong signal to others, wherever they are, that they will be brought to account for their actions. The agreement establishing the court was signed in Freetown on 16 January. We are contributing &#163;6.6 million over three years towards the court's estimated budget of &#163;40 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w02.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 There has been no recent peace agreement in Sudan. However, we were delighted to hear last month that as a result of the efforts of the US special envoy, with whom we have been working closely, the parties agreed on 19 January to a limited ceasefire in the Nuba mountains. Under the terms of the agreement civilians will be allowed to move freely within the region currently held by the SPLA. There will be two demilitarised zones to allow the Nuba people to access fertile land, and humanitarian assistance will be allowed

 The power to make orders still appears in the Southern Rhodesia Act 1979. Other powers were later repealed but the section 3 powers were not. It would technically be possible to make an order, but it would have to relate to unconstitutional action that had taken place in Southern Rhodesia before independence.

 We welcome the supplementary report of the monitoring mechanism. We believe the report accurately highlights the continuing destabilising impact of UNITA in Angola.

 As with all candidates for EU membership, Turkey can only start accession negotiations once it has met the Copenhagen political criteria (relating to democracy, the rule of law, respect for human rights and minorities). Turkey has begun to make progress against the EU Accession Partnership which sets out priorities for reform. But it is important that Turkey picks up the pace of reform, notably with regard to human rights.

Free Television Licences

<a name="20205w04.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Paul Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many over 75-year-old pensioners in Shrewsbury and Atcham have received free television licences.  [32590]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w04.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 TV Licensing, which administers the free television licence scheme for the BBC as Licensing Authority, is not able to provide geographical breakdowns of the number of free licences issued. However, estimates based on the 1991 Census indicate that there were approximately 6,500 people aged 75 or over in the Shrewsbury and Atcham constituency.

[33386]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w04.html_spnew13"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government have provided general guidance to the BBC and to the Independent Television Commission on priorities in planning the use of currently unused spectrum for transmitting terrestrial television services. This guidance was last reviewed in 1997. We published on 11 December 2001 a consultation paper inviting views on the basis on which we should plan the use of the spectrum currently used for analogue television broadcasting once analogue transmissions cease.

 I have made no such assessment and have no plans to do so. However, we know that an estimated 97.5 per cent. of households have television and therefore have or should have a television licence. Oftel's latest estimate, which was published on 29 January, is that 45 per cent. of households in the UK are now connected to the internet. All such homes will therefore be able to access BBC online.

 The information is as follows.
<P>

<a name="20205w06.html_para0">(a) The number of days of annual leave for full-time staff, outside the senior civil service, within the Department for Culture, Media and Sport depends on the individual's length of service. The initial allowance is five weeks, and after 10 years' service six weeks, and has been so for the past four years. Those staff who work part-time are allowed a proportion of the annual leave allowance, according to the length of their working week.
<P>

<a name="20205w06.html_para1">(b) The annual leave entitlement for members of the senior civil service is currently set by Cabinet Office at 30 days per year and has been so for the last four years.
<P>

<a name="20205w06.html_para2">(c) In addition to annual leave, full-time staff, including the senior civil service, are entitled to 10 full days and one half day each year by way of public or privilege holidays.

<P>
<a name="20205w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, pursuant to his answer of 6 December 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 514W, on outsourcing, what the estimated size is of the reduced cost to his Department from the outsourcing of IS and IT services.  [30140]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. McCartney: </B> 
 The Department first outsourced its IT data centre and mainframe operations in 1995, and subsequently outsourced the development and maintenance of its IT systems in 2000. Costs and benefits associated with the outsourcing of all of these IS/IT services were forecast on the basis of initial planning assumptions known at the time that the contract was let. A prudent approach was taken in the calculations in terms of spending on IT systems development and maintenance, and data centre and mainframe operational services.
<P>

<a name="20205w07.html_para0">Based on these factors, a positive net present value was delivered representing a reduction of 3 per cent. in costs over the life of the contract. However, a fuller assessment of the actual financial impact of outsourcing is not available, since the contract is only in its early stages.
<P>

<a name="20205w07.html_para1">Additionally, this contract cannot be viewed within the context of cost reduction alone. Various non-financial factors were also of considerable importance in the decision to proceed with strategic outsourcing. In particular, the transfer of high levels of risk associated with new IT development to the service provider.

 Information is not available in the form requested. Since its inception in 1992, decisions about entitlement to DLA have been made on the basis of all the available evidence about a severely disabled person's care and/or mobility needs. In some cases, this evidence includes a report from the claimant's general practitioner or from an examining doctor, but there is no "medical test" which determines entitlement.

<P>
<a name="20205w07.html_spnew8"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Information on representations received regarding inadequately qualified and experienced doctors undertaking examinations for disability living allowance is not collected.

Team has cost; how many local authorities have applied for money from the Help Fund; which have been given grants and of how much; and what evaluation has taken place of the local authorities involved in piloting the Performance Framework.  [29489]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w08.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 I am pleased to announce that 32 of the 104 bids submitted to the Help Fund have been successful. As many of these are joint bids from groups of local authorities, the allocations, totalling &#163;1.638 million, will help around 250 local authorities overall. The Help Fund was set up to address core problems in housing benefit delivery at a local level and is a practical demonstration of the Government's commitment to working with local authorities to improve the standard of housing benefit administration. The funded projects will make significant improvements in areas such as training, customer service and IT capabilities. I am placing a full list of the successful bids in the Library today.
<P>

<a name="20205w08.html_para0">As at 1 February 2002, 242 local authorities are compliant with the Verification Framework. A list has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20205w08.html_para1">The Help Team is a partnership initiative to support local authorities which are working to improve the administration of housing benefit. Help Team visits to local authorities began in March 2001. The total forecast costs for the project until March 2002 are &#163;970,000.
<P>

<a name="20205w08.html_para2">14 local authorities participated in the pilot work for the Performance Framework. The Benefit Fraud Inspectorate had inspected 11 of them before the pilot and one has now had a best value inspection. The pilots provided useful information and views on the realism of the standards, and input from these authorities has helped us improve their specification.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I have today agreed that 30 local authorities will pilot new methods of voting at local and mayoral elections this May.
<P>

<a name="20205w08.html_para3">These electoral modernisation pilots build on the 2000 local election pilots and will test new and easier arrangements, such as early voting, all postal ballots and mobile ballot kiosks.
<P>

<a name="20205w08.html_para4">The earlier successes of postal voting ensure it will play a key role in the pilot programme. In the 2000 local elections, most postal pilots recorded a 50 per cent. or greater rise in the number of votes cast compared with previous local elections in 1999. The 2001 general election saw a record number of postal votes cast&#151;some 1.4 million, compared with 738,614 postal votes at the 1997 general election. Postal voting has shown that it can make a difference. The pilot programme aims, therefore, to build upon these successes and explore all-postal ballots and other techniques to make the voting process simpler, accessible and more efficient for the electorate.
<P>

<a name="20205w08.html_para5">In addition over half of the pilots will explore innovative ways in which people can vote electronically using mobile phone text message services, touch telephone, local digital television and on-line voting methods using home computers, local libraries and council-run information kiosks. The councils involved will be working with IT suppliers.
<P>

<a name="20205w08.html_para6">This marks an important first step towards e-voting across the country. The pilots will be crucial in building public confidence and testing technical robustness to ensure that the integrity of the poll is maintained. We are particularly keen to engage younger voters and feel these new innovations will help. Our aim is to learn from these pilots so we can confidently modernise our voting arrangements&#151;making the most of new technology so that voting is more accessible for everyone, but at the same time secure and efficient. We propose an ever more extensive programme of pilots at future local elections to open up the possibility of an e-enabled general election some time after 2006.
<P>

<a name="20205w08.html_para7">My announcement reflects the Government's commitment to modernising our democratic processes. My Department has worked with the Electoral Commission, the Local Government Association and the Office of the e-Envoy in considering all of the 41 bids received. The successful authorities, together with a brief description of the activity to be undertaken in the pilot, are listed in the table. Of the remaining authorities, three withdrew their bids, eight applications were judged to fall outside our published criteria or the scope of the enabling legislation.
<P>

<a name="20205w08.html_para8">The Electoral Commission will be providing support and advice to pilot authorities. We will be providing financial support for the costs of IT investment&#151;up to &#163;3.5 million. Officials will now be discussing allocation details with the pilot authorities and the IT suppliers.

 The Government have not carried out a national audit of greenfield allocations to complement the national land use database of brownfield sites. Our planning policies for housing give priority to re-using previously-developed land within urban areas in preference to the development of greenfield sites. We set up the national land use database to help local authorities establish how many additional homes can be built in urban areas on brownfield sites.

 The Secretary of State is a statutory consultee in the preparation of development plans and through the Government offices has been examining emerging plans carefully to identify unnecessary greenfield releases. Just over 300 objections to plans on PPG3 grounds were made in the period 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2001. Information on the hectarage of greenfield de-allocations is not collected centrally.

If the Secretary of State decides that the proposal should be the subject of a non-statutory public inquiry and subsequent consideration by him, the local planning authority will be informed. The development plan comprises both the adopted structure plan and the local plan where applicable.

A scheme will, therefore be established under section 155 of the Local Government and Housing Act 1989. Grant will be paid to cover 85 per cent. of the eligible costs above a threshold, which the authority incurred in dealing with the rail crash.

 Under current Treasury guidance to Departments on the carrying out of investment appraisals (the "Green Book") the discount rate to be used is 6 per cent. in real terms.

 The Unitary Payment (UP) is set at &#163;14.037 million per annum in March 1999 prices, to be indexed annually by the RPI. Assuming no inflation, therefore, the Treasury would pay &#163;491.3 million over the 35 year contract term.

[32202]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w11.html_spnew18"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The total additional payment over the lifetime of the project would have been &#163;6.568 million per 0.1 per cent. increase in the bond spread. The NPC impact of a 0.1 per cent. increase is &#163;1.329 million (discounted at 6 per cent. real), and the annual increase in the Unitary Payment would have been &#163;110,00 as at 31 March 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w11.html_spnew19"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The contract with EP provided for a cap of &#163;14.2 million on the Unitary Payment (i.e &#163;13.981 at the time the contract was signed in August 1999) if funding was subsequently secured through the bond route.

<P>
<a name="20205w11.html_spnew20"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B>

 The Board of Inland Revenue has discretion to pay financial rewards to informers. There is no right of appeal against the exercising of that discretion.
<P>

<a name="20205w12.html_para4">Reward payments are exceptional and are made only where information provided leads to a recovery of duty. It follows that no consideration as to whether to pay a reward can be made unless and until actions to recover duties are concluded. It also follows that where there is no recovery of duty there can be no reward payment and, therefore, no need for further consideration.
<P>

<a name="20205w12.html_para5">If following the recovery of duty it is considered that a reward payment should be made, or where the informer claims that a payment should be made, the facts are reported to technical advisers at Inland Revenue Cross- Cutting Policy for consideration in line with guidance at IH 1295. There is no requirement as to who should make that report.

House officials have been in regular discussion with their counterparts in the Scottish Parliament on this matter and will continue to keep it under review. In the meantime, there is a webcam service which can be seen at www.scottishparliamentlive.com.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave him on 17 July 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 142W. Most of the Throckmorton site, formerly known as the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA) Pershore, is now owned by QinetiQ. The remainder of the site, used last year to deal with some of the consequences of the foot and mouth outbreak, is in the final stages of being transferred to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA).
<P>

<a name="20205w15.html_para0">As part of the PPP process, all activities carried out by DERA were reviewed, and those which did not need to be retained within Government were transferred to QinetiQ on 1 July 2001, including those carried out at Pershore. Legally enforceable safeguards are in place to ensure that QinetiQ continue to provide key strategic facilities and services required by the Ministry of Defence. Against this background the company is free to explore other business opportunities.
<P>

<a name="20205w15.html_para1">The future provision of an accommodation centre for asylum seekers is the responsibility of the Home Office, and although QinetiQ's site at Pershore has been identified as a potential site, a final decision has yet to be made. Subject to consultation, with QinetiQ as landowner, the local planning authorities, and the local community, the final decision with regard to siting one of these centres at Pershore rests with the Home Secretary.

<P>

<a name="20205w15.html_para3">The MOD does not have an allocation for development as such. The development expenditure is budgeted for within the overall equipment programme allocation and does not fall into a separate budget. The amount that is quoted for statistical purposes, in any one year, is largely a consequence of the state of the procurement cycle at which major equipment projects happen to be in, in the year in question.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w15.html_spnew3"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The law on the tax exemption of wound and disability pensions awarded to service personnel first came into force in the Finance Act 1919. The relevant provisions have since been brought forward into the various consolidating Taxes Acts which have been introduced since then. The most recent consolidation Act was the Income and Corporation Taxes Act (ICTA) 1988 where the exemption can be found at section 315. A previous consolidation Act was passed in 1952 but this did not introduce or change this tax exemption.

The campaign is intended to raise awareness of, and interest in, the TA in advance of the March TV campaign, by encouraging principally young people to contact their local TA for help in getting fit, and encouraging those who are already fit to join the TA and take their fitness one step further. The campaign has been a great success and has received widespread and favourable media coverage. At the end of January, some 25,500 registrations have been achieved, which is double the expected number, 70 per cent. of them via the internet. In view of this success, no direct ministerial involvement is currently planned for the campaign.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 All registered fingerprint experts are trained to be capable of dealing with the non-numeric standard. There are currently 1,470 police fingerprint experts on the fingerprint register in England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="20205w18.html_para0">As part of the change to the evidential standard, the training programme for all fingerprint experts in England and Wales has been revised. All new fingerprint officers undergo the new modular training programme which incorporates the change from the previous 16 point standard. All fingerprint experts trained prior to 11 June have been made aware of these issues through their local bureau trainers.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on Government plans to increase the number of officers in the Metropolitan police.  [18726]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Government are committed to increasing police numbers and have set up the Crime Fighting Fund (CFF) to enable forces to recruit 9,000 officers over and above previous plans in the three years to March 2003.
<P>

<a name="20205w18.html_para1">The Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) has been allocated 2,044 recruits over the three years of the CFF. The number of police officers in the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) is the responsibility of the Metropolitan Police Authority (MPA) within funding limits defined by government grant and council tax precept set by the Mayor and Greater London Assembly. The mayor has indicated that he proposes to increase the police precept to secure a significant increase in the total number of police officers in London. The actual number will depend on the result of the budget process within the MPA and GLA.
<P>

<a name="20205w18.html_para2">I am advised by the Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis MPS that police officer recruitment to the Metropolitan police is at an all-time high with an average of over 1,100 applications received a month.
<P>

<a name="20205w18.html_para3">The MPS has also benefited from the Home Office funded National Recruitment Campaign, from the provision of free rail-travel within a 70-mile radius of London and from the last year's &#163;3,327 increase in London Allowance for officers recruited on or after 1 September 1994 and not in receipt of housing allowance.
<P>

<a name="20205w18.html_para4">In addition, Metropolitan Police Officers will benefit from the starter home initiative through which about 550 London police officers and support staff will be helped to buy a first home over the next three years.

<P><I>5 Feb 2002 : Column 864W</I><P>
2001&#150;02 is 26,254 and on 31 December 2001 the actual strength of the Metropolitan Police Service (MPS) was 25,994.
<P>

<a name="20205w18.html_para5">I am also told that the budgeted work force total for detectives for 2001&#150;02 is 5,439 and the actual detective strength on 31 December 2001 was 4,228. The MPS is actively recruiting towards its budgeted work force total.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w18.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The White Paper invited comments by 21 January 2001. We received approximately 1,100 representations, of which the vast majority were from police officers. We are still considering representations and will place a summary in the Library.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Last month the Police Negotiating Board agreed in principle ways to deliver a fair and more consistent approach towards early retirement due to ill health, so that forces can ensure wherever possible that officers continue in employment where they are capable of performing sufficient duties to make their retention operationally justifiable. This should enable forces to reduce the level of ill-health retirement still further and match the performance of the best quartile of forces by 2005.
<P>

<a name="20205w18.html_para6">In the White Paper the Government also announced that they will establish a national occupational health strategy for the police service, which should assist forces to manage cases of ill health more effectively at the outset.

 The information is given in the table. The grants included are those paid solely to the councils except in the case of Drug Action Teams, the Crime Reduction Programme and the Partnership Development Fund. In those cases, the council is a member of a partnership and funding is allocated to one or more of the partners, for the benefit of the partnership as a whole.

<P>
<a name="20205w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Association of Chief Police Officers (ACPO) drew particular attention to the problems associated with this type of air weapon last July when they asked for the definition of "readily converted" under the terms of section 1(6) of the Firearms Act 1982 to be revised. But, this section only applies to imitation firearms and could not be used in respect of air cartridge pistols which are already defined as firearms (although not subject to certification). We have been consulting further with the Forensic Science Service who in turn have been liaising with the police in order to establish the full extent and nature of the problem. This has confirmed the ease with which these weapons can be converted to fire cartridge ammunition. This is wholly unacceptable and the company concerned has decided not to import these weapons pending a fully informed decision on what should be done either by way of further modification to the weapons or changes in existing controls.

<a name="20205w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 29 January 2002]:</i> Police recruits undertake supervised street patrol with a tutor constable on completion of their initial training, normally after 20 weeks' service and follows their foundation training course (15 weeks at National Police Training, and 18 weeks at Hendon for the Metropolitan police). This training equips recruits with the knowledge and skills to perform the full range of police duties, and is consolidated through further training in force during the remainder of the probationary period of two years. Most recruits are considered ready for unsupervised street patrol after 32 weeks' service.

 Staff attend a 10-day training course in the Immigration Rules before joining the Immigration and Nationality Enquiry Bureau (INEB). They then join a mentoring programme in INEB where they progress from listening to calls with experienced members of staff to taking a number of calls with a mentor listening in.
<P>

<a name="20205w21.html_para4">When their mentor and the new agent feel they are ready they are listened in to by a senior mentor and their line manager before they are allowed to take calls without another member of staff listening in. The length of time this takes varies from person to person and can take between 10 days and several weeks. Also, agents receive regular mentoring and training on all aspects of the Immigration Rules throughout their time in INEB.

<P>
<a name="20205w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 For information on how graduate teacher programme places are allocated, I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave to my hon. Friend the Member for Stoke-on-Trent, North (Ms Walley) on 16 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 290W.
<P>

<a name="20205w23.html_para6">In 2000&#150;01, there were 1,507 new entrants to the graduate teacher programme. In 2001&#150;02, 2,250 fully funded places are available. These attract grants of up to &#163;4,000 towards training costs and of up to &#163;13,000 towards the trainee's salary costs. In addition to that, over 1,000 places with funding of up to &#163;4,000 each are being offered this year to schools willing to meet trainees' salary costs from their own budgets. In the current academic year to date, the Teacher Training Agency has received a total of 3,307 applications for places on the graduate teacher programme, 2,350 of which have been approved.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills when schools were given details of the number of places on the graduate teacher scheme.  [32637]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 The Teacher Training Agency informs schools of the likely number of graduate teacher programme places that will be available in each of the three annual allocations rounds approximately six weeks before the deadline for submission of applications.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills if she will make a statement on the number of teachers taken on by schools who have not received funding under the graduate teacher scheme.  [32639]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w23.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Information on the number of unqualified teachers whose schools are not receiving funding under the graduate teacher programme is not collected centrally. There is no requirement that schools should appoint prospective trainees before receiving confirmation that a place on the programme will be offered.

 A representative from the Department of Trade and Industry was part of an interdepartmental shortlisting panel selection workshop last December in Sheffield, where a consensus was reached on all 31 expressions of interest received for Trailblazer status.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w24.html_spnew1"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 From the 31 expressions of interest received, the following five sectors were invited to form a Trailblazer Sector Skills Council:

<P>
<a name="20205w24.html_spnew2"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 I am very pleased that the Chairman for Ceramic Training and Development has shown this level of interest in the development of sector skills councils. I understand that he has already met with an official from my Department to discuss options for the ceramics industry. It is, I believe, appropriate during the development of SSC's or during the negotiation of other arrangements, that contact remains between officials and potential SSC members. I have asked officials to continue the dialogue with the ceramics industry and look forward to receiving a report on the progress in due course.

 The following table shows allocations for the Standards Fund for Westminster local education authority and for Kensington and Chelsea local education authority in 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02. The figures include both Government and local authority contributions. The amount actually paid to schools depends on local expenditure decisions by schools and the local authority.

 <i>[holding answer 4 February 2002]:</i> Crossing the performance threshold promotes a teacher to point 1 of the upper pay scale. Further progress is by discretionary performance points recommended by heads and awarded by governing bodies. Teachers on point 1 since September 2000 will first become eligible for a performance point from September 2002. To make best use of these points, heads and governors will need to distinguish the most effective teachers from those who are doing a satisfactory job. I recognise that these decisions will sometimes be difficult, but I believe that heads and governors are fully capable of making them.

 I refer my hon. Friend to my answers of 31 January 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 470&#150;71W. The Government and the devolved Administrations on 12 September launched a national debate in our consultation paper "Managing Radioactive Waste Safely". A copy of the paper is in the Library. Disposal is one of the several waste management options that, the paper proposes, we need to review. The consultation period closes on 12 March and we would welcome comments from all over the UK.

<P>
<a name="20205w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 9 January 2002]:</i> Under the waste framework directive, waste operations are subject to appropriate periodic inspections by the Environment Agency. In carrying out inspections at licensed sites, including landfill sites, the agency must have a regard to the guidance provided in Waste Management Paper No. 4, which provides a system of risk-based inspections, known as the Operator Pollution Risk Appraisal (OPRA). OPRA takes into account the performance of the operator and the environmental risks of the waste operation in determining how often a site is inspected, with a minimum inspection frequency of one every three months. The environmental risks include the type of waste operation and the amounts of waste involved.
<P>

<a name="20205w25.html_para3">The period of time of each inspection will vary and will depend on a number of factors, including the nature and size of the landfill, the terms and conditions of the licence, and any issues arising during the inspection.




<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2002 : Column 890W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20205w25.html_para4">The agency has issued guidance on an appropriate inspection methodology for use by their inspectors and is available at www.environment-agency.gov.uk/ commondata/105385/methodology.pdf.

<P>
<a name="20205w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The principal regulations governing the transport of live animals are: The Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997, which makes general and specific provisions for the welfare of animals during transport&#151;a breach of the Order is punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding &#163;5,000 (or &#163;1,000 per animal if more than 10 animals are involved)&#151;and The Transport of Animals (Cleansing and Disinfection) (England) (No.2) Order 2000, which requires vehicles to be cleansed and disinfected after the journey is completed. A breach of the Order is punishable on conviction by a fine not exceeding &#163;5,000. A transporter's authorisation to transport live animals under WATO can also be suspended or revoked.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of the impact of the European Commission's decision on the levels of <i>(a)</i> the sheep annual premium and <i>(b)</i> the less favoured area supplement on the future viability of the UK sheep industry; and if she will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="20205w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 At the Sheepmeat Management Committee on 18 January it was agreed to set the final rate of the Sheep Annual Premium (SAP) for 2001 at 9.086 euros (&#163;5.62). The Less Favoured Area supplement remained at 6.641 euros (&#163;4.11).
<P>

<a name="20205w25.html_para5">A number of factors depressed returns to sheep farmers in 2001, in particular the closing of export markets because of foot and mouth disease. We expect returns to improve in 2002, with the reopening of export markets and the introduction of a fixed rate Sheep Annual Premium set significantly above the final rate of the premium for 2001.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w25.html_wqn7"><B> Mrs. Ann Winterton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what estimate she has made of the level of the sheep annual premium that would be payable to United Kingdom sheep producers if the British market price for lamb were used in the calculation of the sheep premium in place of the average European Union price; and if she will make a statement.  [31521]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w25.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The calculation of the rate of the Sheep Annual Premium prior to the changes agreed in December 2001 was based on several factors related to sheep production in the European Union, not only on the 



<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2002 : Column 892W</I><P>
average market price; for this reason it is not possible simply to substitute the British average market price for the European Union one. However, in 2001 the average market price for sheepmeat in Great Britain was some 24 per cent. below the European Union average price, and calculating the rate of the Sheep Annual Premium separately for Great Britain and for the rest of the European Union would have increased the rate in Great Britain and reduced it elsewhere.
<P>

<a name="20205w25.html_para6">From 2002 the Sheep Annual Premium will be at a fixed rate of 21 euros per eligible animal, and will not be affected by fluctuations in market prices.

<a name="20205w26.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Luff: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what discussions she has had with the <i>(a)</i> Ministry of Defence and <i>(b)</i> Home Office about the proposed asylum accommodation centre on land adjoining her Department's land at Throckmorton, Worcestershire; and what assessment she has made of the implications for compensation claims for local residents following the burial of foot and mouth carcases at the site.  [31724]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w26.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 No discussions of this matter have taken place with either the Ministry of Defence or the Home Office. Since the land does not belong to this Department nor does the possible use fall within its remit, we have not made an assessment of the implications for any compensation claims made by local residents following the burial of foot and mouth carcases in the area.

<a name="20205w26.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Bercow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what has been the average annual leave entitlement of staff in her Department in each of the last four years.  [31753]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w26.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following the creation of DEFRA, all staff were given an annual leave entitlement of 30 days from 1 August 2001 as one of the first steps towards harmonising terms and conditions of service for then ex-MAFF and ex-Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions staff who joined together to form the new Department.
<P>

<a name="20205w26.html_para0">Prior to the creation of DEFRA, MAFF's entitlements, including those of its executive agencies (excluding the Veterinary Laboratories Agency, whose chief executive will reply direct), were determined by grade and length of service as given in the table. Details of average annual leave entitlements could be provided only at disproportionate cost.

<a name="20205w26.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 For physical security the Department already has a wide range of measures in place which can be varied or adapted to meet specific needs or changed circumstances for any of our sites around the UK. Measures typically include access control (including guard services and pass wearing procedures), staff and visitor checks, staff awareness, intruder detection systems, good liaison with local police etc.
<P>

<a name="20205w26.html_para2">As to fraud, the Department has a fraud policy statement which is available to all staff. It has also issued guidance for managers on how to handle suspected instances of fraud. Staff are in no doubt that fraud is regarded very seriously, and that the Department will always prosecute perpetrators and also take disciplinary action against staff where these actions are considered appropriate. Professional investigation, legal and internal audit advice is always available in support, and the Department seeks to maintain an awareness of current practice and developments in the detection and prevention of fraud.

 <i>(a)</i> Surveys carried out by the Natural Environment Research Council for the Home Office and the Scottish Executive over the past 20 years have shown that the British population of breeding grey seals is growing at a rate of about 6 per cent. per annum since 1984. There is considerable variation around this rate of increase at English and Welsh colonies.

<a name="20205w27.html_para1"><i>(b)</i> The common seal population of eastern England (few breed elsewhere in England and Wales) crashed in 1988 due to an outbreak of phocine distemper virus. Prior to this, the population was over 4,000; in 1989 the numbers approximately halved. It has now recovered to between 3,800 and 4,500.
<P>

<a name="20205w27.html_para2"><i>(c)</i> The majority of the bottlenose dolphin population in English and Welsh waters is located in Cardigan Bay. The population has remained stable over the last decade, with an estimated population of 127 in mid 1990s compared with an estimated 121 in 2000. No assessment has been made of trends of other dolphin populations in the waters around England and Wales.

 In respect of the Lord Chancellor's Department, none. Responsibility for administering and enforcing the Data Protection Act 1998 lies with the Information Commissioner, who carries out these responsibilities independently of Government, but is sponsored by the Lord Chancellor's Department. I understand that the Commissioner currently employs 169 staff on data protection matters at her offices in Wilmslow, Cheshire.

 The Information Commissioner, who carries out her responsibilities independently of Government, has a duty under the Data Protection Act 1998 to disseminate information about the operation of the Act. The commissioner launched a public information campaign on 17 January 2002 to alert organisations to the fact that while they may need to be on the register of data controllers, they should not be misled by businesses who have no statutory powers to maintain the register. Notices were placed in a number of national newspapers and the commissioner has set up a dedicated website at www.doineedtonotify.co.uk to help organisations establish whether they need to notify. She has also made available a self-assessment guide which can be obtained by phoning 0870 9027 522.
<P>

<a name="20205w28.html_para5">I understand that the commissioner is prepared to take legal action against the companies concerned wherever possible and appropriate and that she is liaising closely with the Office of Fair Trading, trading standards authorities and the police on the matter.

<P>

 Since the Lord Chancellor's Department assumed responsibility for data protection issues in June 2001, I have received representations about the level of fees chargeable for subject access under the Data Protection Act 1998, in particular with regard to manually held health records. The issue here is to strike a balance between ensuring that cost is not a barrier to individuals requesting access to their health records and allowing the NHS to recoup costs incurred in servicing requests, so that essential resources are not diverted from patient care. 



<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 2002 : Column 903W</I><P>
The Government are committed to continuing discussion with key interest groups and to working closely with the information commissioner with the aim of achieving a long-term solution.

<P>

 The Lord Chancellor's Department has a wide range of security measures in place to deter and detect theft and fraud. These include physical security standards for all departmental buildings, personnel security procedures and arrangements to safeguard valuable departmental assets. The security of buildings is reviewed on a periodic basis and security arrangements in general are reviewed in the light of any emerging threats or serious incidents. The Department's programme to achieve compliance with BS7799, the British Standard for Information Security Management, will quality assure existing practices and introduce improvements where these are found to be necessary. Measures include more extensive use of risk assessment, security education and awareness for staff and reviews of physical security arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20205w29.html_para0">The Department also maintains sound systems of internal control, which include controls to prevent and deter fraud. These systems are kept under review and are subject to regular audit coverage. All incidents of suspected or detected fraud are subject to rigorous investigation and appropriate action is taken against those found guilty of wrongdoing. Where fraud occurs, in addition to the investigation of the particular incident consideration is also given to whether controls need to be improved to prevent any further re-occurrence. The Department maintains an effective capability to investigate incidents of fraud. This includes a cadre of trained staff.
<P>

<a name="20205w29.html_para1">The Department has anti-fraud policies, together with policies on confidential reporting (whistleblowing), staff conduct and disciplinary procedures. These are communicated to all staff.

 The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), acting under its mandate provided by the Geneva Conventions, is responsible for assisting war detainees in Afghanistan. ICRC delegates visit detainees, register them and, with the consent of the detaining authority, offer psychological support and extra help to make their conditions of detention more acceptable, such as exchanging correspondence with families. Since November 2001, the ICRC has registered almost 5,000 detainees, in some 40 places of detention.

 The United Nations estimates that almost 1.2 million Afghans are displaced inside Afghanistan, primarily due to conflict and drought, with the north and west of the country accounting for over 60 per cent. of the total displaced. Significant numbers do not reside in camps, but are hosted by already vulnerable communities. The United Nations currently lists over 900 centres where significant numbers of internally displaced people (IDPs) have gathered, both in organised camps and among host communities.
<P>

<a name="20205w30.html_para4">International organisations are helping to support the return of IDPs to their homes. Nevertheless significant numbers remain displaced. The largest organised camps are at Maslakh in Herat, Spin Boldak near the Pakistani border, and in Mazar-i-Sharif city. The International Organisation for Migration is currently re-registering the estimated 200,000 population of Maslakh camp and opening a new camp in Herat to accommodate new arrivals.

 In late September last year, the UN launched an inter-agency donor alert for $584 million (&#163;413 million) to cover the humanitarian needs of Afghans over the winter months from October 2001 to March 2002. This was subsequently revised to $657 million (&#163;464 million). Latest UN figures indicate that donors have contributed almost $583 million (&#163;412 million) towards that appeal. My Department has contributed &#163;60 million since last September.

<a name="20205w30.html_para5">Based on a preliminary needs assessment, the UN Secretary General announced at the Tokyo conference on Afghan reconstruction last month that $10 billion (&#163;7.1 billion) will be needed over the next five years to cover the costs of recovery, reconstruction and on-going humanitarian needs in Afghanistan. Of this some $1.3 billion (&#163;0.9 billion) is needed in 2002 to cover immediate needs. Overall, donors have pledged $4.5 billion (&#163;3.2 billion) over the next five years; $1.8 billion (&#163;1.3 billion) of which is for commitments over this next year. The Department for International Development has committed &#163;200 million over the next five years for both reconstruction and humanitarian assistance. This pledge is in addition to the significant sums that DFID contributes to the World Bank, European Union and Asian Development banks who will also be channelling funds into Afghanistan over coming years. DFID's share of the European Union pledge alone will be 20 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20205w30.html_para6">My Department has a well-earned reputation for rapid and flexible disbursement of funds.

 We strongly support the common programming approach under the United Nations-led Strategic Framework for Afghanistan, which is intended to provide a principled, co-ordinated and coherent approach to programming. One of its key themes is the protection and advancement of human rights, with particular emphasis on women's empowerment.
<P>

<a name="20205w30.html_para7">We recognise the need to build the capacity of Afghanistan's women to enable them to take full part in the reconstruction of their society, including the new Interim Administration, and to ensure that legal, constitutional and other provisions are not discriminatory against women. Our funding for support of Afghan women during the recovery and reconstruction of Afghanistan is being channelled through United Nations agencies and non-governmental organisations who will work closely with the Interim Administration and who have expressed a commitment to involving Afghan women in the design and implementation of their strategies and programmes.

 Thanks to the efforts of the UN-led humanitarian system, and with the support of the international community, a potential humanitarian catastrophe has been averted in Afghanistan. However, there are some remote areas of Afghanistan (especially in the west) where the humanitarian situation remains serious because of the drought. Worsening weather conditions in the north and north-east are making food deliveries increasingly difficult. The precarious security situation in some parts of Afghanistan continues to restrict access for humanitarian agencies. As a result there are pockets of unmet needs where vulnerable people cannot be reached. WFP and other humanitarian agencies are continuing to do their best to deliver life-saving assistance to those in need.

 The lead agency for the provision of emergency food aid is the UN World Food Programme (WFP).

 The UK was one of the first donors to make a pledge to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria. DFID has committed &#163;200 million over five years from its budget.

 The UK and others have worked hard to ensure that one of the criteria for assessing applications to the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and malaria (GFATM) will be the level of domestic Government, public sector and civil society commitment (both financial and political) to fighting the three diseases. This will be a strong in-built incentive for increased domestic health spending.
<P>

<a name="20205w31.html_para1">The UK has also made clear that for the fund to realise its full potential, donors will need to increase spending on health through bilateral and multilateral channels in tandem with their fund contributions, not least to ensure that health systems are able to deliver the drugs and commodities the fund will finance.

The guidelines also explain the proposal review process.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w32.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Allocations to health authorities are based on an overall assessment of the resources required to cover inflationary pressures and deliver national targets. Allocations to health authorities in 1999&#150;2000 and 2000&#150;01 were made net of 3 per cent. efficiency savings. This means that health authorities needed to achieve the efficiency target to fully fund delivery of national targets and inflation.

 Remuneration paid to community pharmacies is intended to reward them for the national health service pharmaceutical services they provide. The total remuneration to be paid for services in any given year is known as the global sum. The global sum is distributed through a system of fees and allowances, some of which relate directly to the number (and type) of prescriptions dispensed, some of which do not. For 2001&#150;02 the global sum for England and Wales is &#163;806.6 million, an increase of 3.7 per cent. over 2000&#150;01.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will make a statement on the effect of the inhalation of bioaerosols on human health.  [29621]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w32.html_spnew7"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The health effects of bioaerosol inhalation depend upon the type of biological material contained in the aerosol, its pathogenicity and virulence, the quantity inhaled and the susceptibility of the individual who inhales the aerosol. Health effects from the inhalation of a bioaerosol range from none to very serious, often fatal, disease. It is not possible to detail all the potential health effects of bioaerosol inhalation within the scope of this answer, as there are many pathogens that can be transmitted through the bioaerosol route. There are also non-pathogenic bioaerosols that can have adverse health effects varying from mild allergic reactions to acute asthma attacks.
<P>

<a name="20205w32.html_para7">While the health effects of many specific pathogenic microbial bioaerosols, such as those containing Anthrax spores, Legionella bacteria or Aspergillus fungal spores, are well known, the health response to non-specific diverse bioaerosols is less well understood. For these bioaerosols, such as those produced during harvesting or composting, which contain a mixture of micro-organisms in combination with organic and inorganic particles. The nature of the human response varies greatly and can also change as a result of sensitisation due to repeat exposure to the bioaerosol. For such bioaerosols there has been no detailed study undertaken into the associated health effects.
<P>

<a name="20205w32.html_para8">Consideration of the health effects of bioaerosols inhalation falls to a number of bodies within us.
<P>

<a name="20205w32.html_para9">The Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens (ACDP) advises Health and Agriculture Ministers and the Health and Safety Commission on the health risks to workers and the public from dangerous pathogens, including bioaerosol risks. The ACDP assesses risks and advises on the containment measures and precautions to be taken to minimise the risk of exposure to dangerous pathogens. The Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 1999 cover occupational exposure to bioaerosols. These place obligations upon employers to prevent, or minimise, the risk of exposure to harmful bioaerosols.
<P>

Specific environmental and general control strategies have been put in place to prevent exposure to this bioaerosol risk in hospitals through National Health Service Estates.

 <i>[holding answer 9 January 2002]:</i> We are keen to help ensure that all disabled people, including those with head injury, are able to play a full part in society. One important way of doing this is by helping people return to work whenever possible. Currently local authorities are taking the lead on Joint Investment Plans on Welfare to Work for disabled people initiative.

A Finished Consultant Episode (FCE) is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant in one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as one person may have several episodes within the year. Data for 1995&#150;96 to 1997&#150;98 are adjusted for both coverage and unknown/invalid clinical data. 1998&#150;99 to 2000&#150;01 data are not yet adjusted for shortfalls. <P>

 If a national health service body is not performing one or more of its functions adequately or at all, or there are significant failings in the way the trust is being run, the Secretary of State for Health has the powers, under section 13 of the Health and Social Care Act 2001, to intervene.
<P>

<a name="20205w34.html_para1">In the case of trusts that have recently received a zero star performance rating they are required to provide an action plan, agreed with the Department, to address the particular areas of performance which they need to improve. Franchise arrangements will be considered only if these trusts fail to make progress against their action plan.

<P>
<a name="20205w34.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We are committed to increasing general practitioner numbers in line with the NHS Plan target for at least an extra 2,000 by 2004. To deliver this we are, in consultation with the profession and others, exploring and implementing change to make general practice more attractive.
<P>

<a name="20205w34.html_para2">These changes already include increasing the number of training places, recruiting from overseas, providing additional training and support for new GPs; improving GPs' working lives by reducing bureaucracy and introducing family friendly packages; giving better support by providing better information technology, better buildings and different ways of working; developing flexible career options; and offering cash incentives to new GPs or returning GP retainees. These measures are intended to attract new GPs, to retain those now practising, and to encourage the return of those who are qualified but not currently working in general practice.

<a name="20205w34.html_wqn9"><B> Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what his definition is of other sensitive sites referred to in the Stewart report on "Mobile Phones and Health"; and whether this includes sites directly on top of homes.  [31345]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20205w34.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 In May 2000, the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP), chaired by Sir William Stewart, issued a report on "Mobile Phones and Health". This report included a number of recommendations designed to provide more information to people about base stations in their area. It included a recommendation that there should be an independent random on-going audit of all base stations to ensure that exposure guidelines are not exceeded outside the marked exclusion zones and that the base stations comply with their agreed specifications. The group said that particular attention should be paid initially to the auditing of base stations near to schools and other sensitive sites. The group was particularly concerned about schools, as at open meetings held by the group around the country, concern had been expressed about the potential exposure of children in schools and this was seen as a sensitive issue. The group was not specific about other sensitive sites. There was no specific concern about homes directly underneath base stations as the radio signals are generally directed to the horizon and not downwards.
<P>

<a name="20205w34.html_para3">The IEGMP was also concerned about possible interference caused by the use of mobile phones in hospitals and other sites where the radio frequency radiation could possibly interfere with sensitive equipment. They, therefore, made a recommendation that health authorities/health boards should issue guidance on the use of mobile phones and should ensure that all hospitals comply. This guidance includes the placing of visible warning signs at entrances to buildings to indicate that mobile phones should be switched off. In addition, health care establishments have liaised carefully with mobile phone organisations to ensure that any risk is negligible to patients and staff when considering the location of base stations on their premises.

<a name="20205w36.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Kidney: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what instructions he has given to health authorities on the distribution of funding to <i>(a)</i> primary care groups and <i>(b)</i> primary care trusts for 2002&#150;03; and what arrangements he is putting in place for the funding of primary care trusts from 2003 onwards.

<P>
<a name="20205w36.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Health Service Circular 1998/171 set out the principles for health authorities to follow in setting primary care group and primary care trust allocations. For 2002&#150;03 these principles continue to apply but are supplemented by additional guidance set out in HSC 2001/34, "Health Authority Revenue Resource Limits 2002&#150;03". Copies of these documents have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20205w36.html_para0">From 2003&#150;04, the intention is that allocations will be made direct to primary care trusts. This is subject to the passage of legislation through Parliament. Allocations will continue to be based on the principle of weighted capitation.
