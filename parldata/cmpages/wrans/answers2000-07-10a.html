<P>
<a name="00710w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 It is estimated that age-related macular degeneration (AMD) affects one in 100 people over the age of 75, with some 500,000 people affected overall. There are two major types of AMD: wet and dry. Some 20 per cent. of patients have 'wet' AMD which is sometimes susceptible to laser treatment. Visudyne is a light-activated compound which has been used in a trial of an alternative photodynamic therapy. Visudyne has not yet been approved for use here or in the other countries of the European Union, but the EU Commission is expected to make a final decision on the approval of an application in the next few months. Visudyne is also among the topics we are considering for appraisal by the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) during the remainder of the current year and in later years. We will make an announcement as soon as possible.
<P>

<a name="00710w01.html_para3">Consideration of the need to review arrangements for screening, including wider use of Amsler grid tests, would follow any consideration by NICE.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00710w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We have already made good progress towards improving access to dental services in Cornwall and Devon. Investing in Dentistry grants amounting to &#163;1,095,165 have been approved in the area in return for promises of up to 110,200 new National Health Service registrations. Since 1998, a dental access centre pilot has been operational in Cornwall and the NHS Executive is currently working with North East Devon and South West Devon Health Authorities to develop two further dental access centres.
<P>

<a name="00710w02.html_para0">We have accepted in full the recommendations of the Doctors' and Dentists' Review Body, which include an annual &#163;17 million scheme to reward the loyalty and commitment of NHS dentists in England.

 The data requested are not collected centrally. We take the issue of delays in diagnosis very seriously. Through such initiatives as the national booked admissions programme, the cancer services collaborative, action on cataracts and action on orthopaedics, we are encouraging hospitals to streamline their services so that tests are carried out, and a diagnosis made, as quickly as possible and with the patient making the minimum number of visits to hospital.

 Our media campaign on teenage pregnancy will begin in autumn 2000, following a period of research into promising approaches by similar campaigns elsewhere. Levels of funding for this current year are to be decided, and for future years will depend on the outcome of the Spending Review.

<a name="00710w02.html_spnew8"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Every area in England now has a local teenage pregnancy co-ordinator, jointly nominated by the local authority and health authority. In total there are 141 co-ordinators, with some working to social services boundaries and some to health authority boundaries, depending on local circumstances.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what plans he has to provide funding <i>(a)</i> under section 64 and <i>(b)</i> generally for the Council for Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction.  [128329]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00710w02.html_spnew9"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Although project funding has been provided in the past, the Department has no current plans to fund this organisation under the section 64 scheme or generally in this financial year. The very high level of demand for cash limited funds has resulted in many worthy applications having to be rejected. This does not prelude the Council for Involuntary Tranquilliser Addiction from seeking funding in future years.
<P>

<a name="00710w02.html_para4">The problems of dependence upon tranquillisers have been recognised for many years. In 1994, the Department issued copies of "Guidelines for the Prevention and Treatment of Benzodiazepine Dependence", published by the Mental Health Foundation, to all health authorities and recommended their use by general practitioners. Various treatments may be offered in general practice or by the specialist mental health services for those who have developed dependence upon tranquillisers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00710w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Contributions towards the National Health Service pension scheme are based on actual levels of pensionable remuneration. Therefore, where increases have been phased in the past, the amounts paid by way of contributions into the pension scheme by both the employer and employee have been based on the actual pensionable remuneration that was paid.

 It is the main concern of the Commission to ensure that the Comptroller and Auditor-General has the right resources to undertake his work. The Commission last met on 2 December 1999 to consider the Supply Estimate for the National Audit Office for 2000-01. The Commission took account of the growing work load of the National Audit Office and recommended additional funding for 2000-01 as a result.
<P>

<a name="00710w03.html_para0">While the Commission will continue to monitor the situation, I am satisfied that, at present, the current level of funding for this work is adequate and that, were the Comptroller and Auditor-General to need more staff or other resources in the future, he would request extra funding from this House when compiling his annual Supply Estimate.

 In 1999, some 68 per cent. of the national stipends pay bill, excluding the stipends of Bishops, archdeacons and cathedral clergy, was financed by giving. However, the proportion will vary from parish to parish. A large part of the remainder of the bill is met by allocations from the Commissioners, individual grants, fees and glebe and trust income.

<P>
<a name="00710w03.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Stuart Bell: </B> 
 The costs of bishops' stipends, administrative support (including staff salaries) and (for diocesan bishops) housing are met by the Commissioners. While the level of that support varies between individuals according to their particular resource needs arising, inter alia, from the nature of their ministry, we none the less meet those needs in full, subject to our guidelines and budgetary procedures. It is therefore not possible to isolate a discretionary element in our provision.

A memorandum setting out how the Government intended to implement each of the requirements of the EU Directive, including draft postal services regulations, was published for consultation on 8 July 1999. Subsequently, the Postal Services Regulations (S.I. 1999/2107) transposed the Directive into United Kingdom law and amended the Postal Privilege (Suspension Order) 1981/1483 to include the words

This had the effect of adding a weight threshold of not less than 350 grams to the existing &#163;1 price threshold in order to be compliant with the Directive. The price threshold was already within the limit required by the Directive of five times public tariff for an item of correspondence in the first weight step of the fastest standard category. The Statutory Instrument was laid before Parliament on 27 July 1999 and came into force on 1 September 1999. The Minister responsible for postal issues at that time was my right hon.

However, management of cars and commercial vehicles is not core MOD business and as a consequence the Department is actively pursuing the provision of vehicle and support services through a competitively let Private Finance Initiative contract.

 The properties at Arborfield were included in the sale, on a 999 year lease, of most of the Service Families Quarters in England and Wales to Annington Homes Ltd. (AHL) in November 1996. At that time there was a requirement for the properties to house Service families and they were underleased back from AHL. The properties have since been declared surplus to Service requirements and, under the terms of the sale agreement a total of 105 have been handed back to AHL. The option of sale on the open market is therefore a matter for the owners, AHL.

<P>
<a name="00710w06.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 To date it has been premature to discuss the issue of environmental appraisals with Selby District Council (SDC). The Ministry of Defence, or the site's eventual developer, will, prior to the submission of any planning application(s), liaise with SDC over the provision of an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) for those aspects of the development for which one may be required under planning/environmental legislation.

 Under the Town and Country Planning legislation it is the duty of the local planning authority (LPA) to consult with environmental and conservation bodies, where necessary, over any applications for development.

It would be premature for us to initiate these discussions as our plans are being tested at the Local Plan Inquiry.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00710w06.html_spnew8"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Under the Town and Country Planning Acts it is an obligation of the local planning authority (LPA) to consult with the parish councils once they receive a planning application for redevelopment. In August 1998, my Department submitted an application for redevelopment of part of the Church Fenton site and the LPA should have consulted the parish councils. Their response is not known. We subsequently agreed to hold any decision on that application in abeyance until the result of the current Local Plan Inquiry was known. As for our submissions to, and appearance at, the Local Plan Inquiry, the local parish councils would have been part of the LPA's consultation process throughout the preparation of the plan. However, they were also specifically advised of our proposals by letter from our planning consultants in early June of this year.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security how many households would be taken off <i>(a)</i> Housing Benefit and <i>(b)</i> Council Tax Benefit in each tenure category if a flat rate housing allowance was introduced for recipients of Working Families Tax Credit and Disabled Persons Tax Credit at (i) &#163;10, (ii) &#163;15, (iii) &#163;20, (iv) &#163;25 and (v) &#163;30 per week.

<P>
<a name="00710w07.html_spnew1"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Precise estimates cannot be made because of the uncertain behavioural effects that would result from the introduction of such an allowance. However, we estimate that introducing a flat rate housing allowance of &#163;30 per week for all recipients of the Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC) would move some claimants off Housing Benefit (HB) in Great Britain in a full year. Assuming that eligible rent in Housing Benefit is reduced by the amount of the housing allowance, the estimated numbers moving off benefit is dependent on the way in which the extra income is treated in the assessment of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit (CTB). The following table gives estimated results based upon either disregarding the housing allowance as income so that claimants do not lose in net income terms, or counting the housing allowance as income so that claimants actually lose in net income terms:

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Estimates are based on the Family Resources Survey.<P>

2. There is currently no administrative data to link WFTC receipt with HB or CTB, so estimates based solely on household survey data should be treated as illustrative only.<P>

3. This household sample does not have an adequate sample size or the necessary information on disability to be able to produce corresponding estimates for Disabled Persons Tax Credit. The reduction in the number of recipients of Housing Benefit as a result of introducing the allowance for recipients of Disabled Persons Tax Credit is, however, likely to be small.<P>

 The Government seek to minimise regulatory burdens where possible and consults the industry on their impact. Standards for organic farming are contained in Regulation (EEC) No. 2092/91. Additionally, the private sector bodies that certify organic farmers are able if they wish to impose standards which go further, and some do. Rigorous production controls are important if public confidence in organic food is to be maintained. It is for producers to decide with which certifier they wish to register.

<a name="00710w08.html_para2">No precise estimates are available for the proportion of these fish that were bound for Scottish rivers or the River Tweed and its tributaries. However, a joint MAFF and Scottish Office report on "Salmon Net Fishers" (1991) estimated that 80 per cent. of the salmon and grilse taken by the total North East coast fishery in 1987-88 were bound for Scottish rivers and that 40 per cent. were bound for the Tweed. The "Report of the Technical Working Group on the English North East Coast Salmon Fishery" (1997) suggested that up to 50 per cent. of the sea trout caught in the North East coast fishery may be bound for Scottish rivers, the majority of these to the Tweed. Based on the above approximate percentages, the estimated numbers of salmon, grilse and sea trout caught in the North East coast fishery in the past five years that were bound for Scottish rivers and the River Tweed and its tributaries are given in the table.

The Government stopped the large scale sales of forest land by the Commission when they took up office in May 1997. The Commission may now only sell agricultural land, land associated with houses and other buildings, unplantable land and relatively small and isolated blocks of forest land which do not make a significant contribution to its objective and which are surplus to its requirements. The Commission may also sell areas for development where this is in the public interest. Areas of forest land which are important for public access will not be sold unless an access agreement is in place.
<BR>
Most of the sales in 1997 and 1998 were agreed before May 1997.

 No explicit estimates are made about the proportion of the demand for new housing that arises from population migration. Trend-based household projects are just one of the considerations taken into account. These are derived from trend-based population projections that contain assumptions about inter-area migration. The migration assumptions are set out in Table 6 of the Office for National Statistics 1996-based Sub-national population projections, England, Series PP3 No. 10, published by TSO.
<P>

<a name="00710w11.html_para2">However, this publication does not include information on migration flows between specific areas. The Office for National Statistics has therefore provided the additional information on projected migration in relation to the South East Planning Region, given in the table.

In the meantime, authorities considering this option will need to undertake detailed preparation to enable them to meet the demanding criteria which will apply. Our overall aim, set out in the Housing Green Paper, is to ensure that all social housing reaches a decent standard within 10 years.

 Tram and light rail systems can have an important role to play in delivering integrated transport in major conurbations. Decisions on whether to provide central Government support for tram and light rail systems are taken on a case-by-case basis on the merits of the particular scheme. Where systems cannot be funded entirely from local sources or by the private sector, promoters must demonstrate that their scheme provides good value for money and forms an essential part of a local transport plan, and that the objectives of that plan cannot be met in other ways. In the Department's appraisal process, the wider economic impacts of a particular scheme, including any regeneration benefits are considered.

 While the Government have from time to time commissioned studies of the extent and nature of housing need to inform our views on the requirement for affordable housing in England, we believe that neither national nor regional estimates can adequately reflect the wide diversity of needs and priorities which exist at the local level.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00710w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The software which failed on 17 June was a Flight Data Processing System known as the National Airspace System (NAS). The current software version was introduced in January 2000, with an interim upgrade in April 2000. In addition to this, the system's database and configuration parameters are modified each month. Until June this year, this software version had continued the excellent track record of reliability established by the NAS system in recent years.
<P>

<a name="00710w13.html_para2">The failure was cleared by reverting to a previous version of the software and as an additional precautionary measure a system message was input which actively prevented the system from exercising the faulty code sequence. Subsequently a permanent software design solution was devised, tested, and successfully installed. This has enabled National Air Traffic Services Ltd. (NATS) to restore capacity levels in the key Scottish sectors which carry a substantial amount of North Atlantic traffic.

<P>
<a name="00710w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The costs of the Galileo project would depend on decisions taken by the Council of Ministers on the project later in the year. The Government have not made an independent estimate of the costs, but the European Commission's current estimate of the capital cost is 3 billion euro for the period 2000-08, of which an estimated 1.25 billion euro would be provided by member states through European Community Programmes and the European Space Agency (ESA). The UK makes its contributions to the EU budget as a whole, not to specific programmes. We estimate that the UK share of the EU budget is around 18 per cent. The UK is contributing about 7 million euro to ESA's work on the definition phase of Galileo. A decision on whether to proceed to the development phase of Galileo may be taken by the December Transport Council. No decision has yet been made as to the UK's contribution to ESA's share of the development costs.

<a name="00710w14.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Railtrack, as infrastructure controller, is responsible for the safe operation of its platforms. The Health and Safety Executive's (HSE's) Railway Inspectorate (HMRI) publish "Railway Safety Principles and Guidance" which, among other things, sets acceptable stepping criteria between trains and platforms. In areas where there is a large gap between the railway platform and the train, warning notices reading 'Mind the Gap' with hatching along the platform edge, or other agreed measures such as public announcements, may be required.

<P>
<a name="00710w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hill: </B>

However, Railtrack have acknowledged that at 76 per cent. of their 2,454 stations there are one or more platforms that do not comply with the specifications for acceptable stepping criteria between trains and platforms as set out in HMRI's "Railway Safety Principles and Guidance". Railtrack is developing a strategy of identifying and dealing with these on a prioritised basis. HSE is monitoring progress.

<a name="00710w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Following the success of three pilot studies to encourage and assist householders to carry out radon remedial works, I am pleased to announce that we are embarking on a new programme in partnership with 31 local authorities from the areas most affected by radon.
<P>

<a name="00710w14.html_para1">The radon measurement programme, carried out by successive Governments since 1987, has meant that every home in England with a greater than 5 per cent. probability of being above the radon 'Action Level' has been offered a Government-funded radon test. In total, some 40,000 homes have now been found to be above the radon Action Level. However, only 10-20 per cent. of these households have taken any action to reduce radon levels in their homes. Radon is a naturally occurring, radioactive gas. Without proper action to lower levels in the home it can add to the risk of lung cancer.
<P>

<a name="00710w14.html_para2">To encourage action, DETR, with the support of the Department of Health, has been working in partnership with Derbyshire Dales, Cherwell and Mendip district councils in pilot studies to encourage and assist householders to carry out remedial work. In this new approach the local authority has been the main point of contact with householders, supported in the background by Central Government Departments.
<P>

<a name="00710w14.html_para3">The pilot studies have been very successful both in terms of the numbers of householders seeking advice and the numbers that have subsequently gone on to carry out remedial work. I should like to pay tribute to the enthusiasm, commitment and hard work of the three local authorities involved.
<P>

<a name="00710w14.html_para4">The 31 local authorities listed in the table, which all have areas within their districts with notable levels of radon, responded to the Department's invitation to work in partnership with us to extend the approach used in the pilot studies to other parts of the country.
<P>

<a name="00710w14.html_para5">In order to assist these authorities, and other with a radon problem, we have produced a "Good Practice Guide" based on the lessons learned and the experience gained in the pilot studies. This guidance has been made available in draft to all of the authorities involved in the new programme, and is being published today. I have arranged for copies to be deposited in the Libraries of both Houses.

To the end of March 2000, about 10,800 lone parents in Wales had attended an initial interview. More than 10,000 of these (93 per cent.) agreed to participate in the scheme, which provides advice and guidance on finding and retaining suitable work.

<a name="00710w15.html_para6">To date, some 3,600 lone parents in Wales have secured jobs through the New Deal.

 <i>[holding answer 29 June 2000]:</i> The Government's work-life balance campaign was launched by the Prime Minister on 9 March. Work-life balance describes any set of policies and practices that both help people to achieve better balance between work and their lives outside work and benefit the business.
<P>

<a name="00710w15.html_para7">The campaign aims to increase the number of employers who adopt work-life policies and practices. By introducing flexible working policies employers can increase job opportunities and recruit from a wider pool, especially from those with caring responsibilities, such as lone parents, or those with disabilities.
<P>

<a name="00710w15.html_para8">The discussion document "Changing Patterns in a Changing World" describes how we will take the campaign forward in partnership with an alliance of 22 leading businesses committed to promoting the business benefits of work-life balance. Our campaign builds on and complements the work of the National Work Life Forum.
<P>

<a name="00710w15.html_para9">Last month we invited employers to apply for our new &#163;2.25 million Work-Life Balance Challenge Fund. Successful applicants will receive free consultancy advice about implementing flexible policies which improve both their business and help their employees balance work and the rest of their lives.

 Latest figures to end April 2000 for the categories requested in Dumfries and Galloway are set out as follows. However, they are expressed as leavers from New Deal rather than returners as everyone starting either of the New Deals is already claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. We cannot therefore describe them as returning to other benefits or unsubsidised employment.

 New Deal 50-plus is a major new programme of personal advice, support and financial help for people over 50 who are looking for work. The programme is aimed at unemployed and economically inactive people in receipt of benefit for six months or more and their dependent partners. The table shows those people who are directly eligible for New Deal 50-plus. However, in addition dependent partners of these benefit recipients will also be eligible, as will be men aged 60-65 receiving National Insurance credits automatically.
<P>

<a name="00710w15.html_para10">The &#163;170 minimum income guarantee applies to those people going into full-time work and additionally receiving the Employment Credit of &#163;60 per week. It is not possible to say how many people will be eligible for the Employment Credit but our assumption is that about 90 per cent. of those that apply will be eligible.

The timetable for the new AS/A level examinations caters for an increased number of papers and although slightly longer than its predecessor has approximately the same number of written papers scheduled in May.

 Secondments and attachments are part of the Interchange Initiative, which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the Civil Service and other organisations. Before an Interchange can occur, all parties must be satisfied that no conflict of interest arises.
<P>

<a name="00710w19.html_para0">The secondees to the Cabinet Office between May 1997 and December 1999 as listed in the answer of 11 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 134W, worked in a variety of jobs from Cabinet Office Band B2 (broadly equivalent to Higher Executive Officer) to the Senior Civil Service. They worked in a wide range of areas, many of them concerned with the Modernising Government initiative, where we are keen to benefit from best practice from all sections of the economy.
<P>

<a name="00710w19.html_para1">I am not prepared to identify individual secondees by name or job title. Secondees are employed on the basis that they can contribute valuable expertise and good practice to the Civil Service, and on the basis that no conflict of interest arises. Where appropriate, their names are published in directories such as the Civil Service Year Book, as are those of permanent staff. But they are not separately identified as being on secondment.

 The Media Monitoring Unit (MMU) operated as a pilot between December 1997 and March 1998. The MMU's set-up and running costs for this period were absorbed by a wide range of Departments. This information is not held centrally and can be provided only at disproportionate cost. In the 1998-99 financial year, the total cost of the unit was &#163;478,878. These costs were recovered from a large number of Departments out of their existing funds.

Those present agreed on the need to ensure that the police had sufficient powers to deal effectively with drunken, loutish, anti-social behaviour. The chief officers present were broadly supportive of the idea of fixed penalty fines. My right hon. Friend the Prime Minister concluded that the Home Office should work closely with the Association of Chief Police Officers and others to work up this and other options for tackling disorder in the coming weeks. The Home Office has continuous discussions with Chief Constables about measures to deal with anti-social behaviour.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to market-test Brixton prison.  [130212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00710w20.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Last November, I announced in the wake of serious concern about conditions at Brixton prison, that it must be regarded as a failing institution and that there must be rapid and fundamental improvement. I made it clear that unless big improvements were made quickly, Brixton could be subject to market testing. It is now over eight months since then, and progress at the prison has been kept under close review.
<P>

<a name="00710w20.html_para0">I am not satisfied with the rate of progress being made, nor that the necessary improvements will be in place within 12 months. In particular, there has not been adequate improvement in compliance with standards, the quality of regime remains poor, there are serious concerns about commitment to equal opportunities within the prison, costs remain high, and there is a lack of commitment to changes to free up resources to improve the regime. This judgment, accepted by the Director General, has been confirmed in a recent visit by Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons, who found that although certain improvements have been made in many areas, basic conditions, including cleanliness in the health care centre, were still unacceptable.
<P>

<a name="00710w20.html_para1">I have, therefore, reviewed the position and am clear that I would be failing in my public duty to all those at the prison--staff and prisoners alike--if we did not set a new path for the establishment. The Director General agrees with me that there should be a market test of Brixton prison. The new management team will be responsible for quickening the pace of improvement and for putting together an in-house bid, which will be judged alongside bids which will be invited from private sector operators.

 It is for the police and local authorities concerned, in Wales as in England, to apply to the courts for an anti-social behaviour order if they consider it appropriate in order to protect their local communities. Anti-social behaviour orders (ASBOs) provide an effective weapon to tackle such behaviour. Over 80 ASBOs have been made in the past year in a variety of English local government areas. I very much hope that the new guidance we have recently issued will help to increase their use further still, including in local government areas within England and Wales in which no such orders have as yet been made.

<P>
<a name="00710w23.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Prisoners serving four years and over are eligible for parole at the half way point in sentence under a system of discretionary conditional release. Section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991 allows for release from prison at any time on compassionate grounds in exceptional circumstances. In the last 12 months, one prisoner serving a sentence for inflicting grievous bodily harm has been released on compassionate grounds prior to his parole eligibility date.
<P>

<a name="00710w23.html_para0">Prisoners serving under four years are not subject to parole but are released automatically at the halfway point in sentence. The majority of such prisoners are eligible for consideration for the Home Detention Curfew (HDC) scheme which provides for their release up to 60 days before their automatic release date.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the announcement made on 27 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 262-64W, of the Government's decision on the regulation of mortgages.
<P>

<a name="00710w24.html_para0">That decision was the outcome of a consultation exercise that gathered a great deal of evidence, including that from borrowers and consumer groups, about what can go wrong with mortgage lending.

<P>

<a name="00710w24.html_para2">Following the announcement of the Government's decision, the Treasury has received helpful views on the definition of a mortgage, and is also drawing on the expertise of the Financial Services Authority and other Government Departments. The Government will consult on any proposed legal definition at the appropriate time.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what has been the policy since 1989 on writing annually to those of his Department's staff who are paying reduced rates of National Insurance contributions, reminding them of the rules governing the payment of reduced rates, as recommended in the Inland Revenue guidance note on reduced rate National Insurance contributions for married women.  [129478]<P>

 The Inland Revenue Guide to Employers states that employers may consider it worthwhile to have arrangements in place to issue a periodic reminder to married women employees for whom they hold a certificate of election, advising them of the need to tell the employer if their marriage ends by divorce or annulment or that they are no longer entitled to pay reduced rate National Insurance contributions. All of my Departments with such employees follow this advice either by an annual notice in their staff bulletins or in individual letters issued annually.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer for what reasons money received on redundancy as pay in lieu of notice and holiday pay is treated for tax purposes as income for the tax year in which it is paid, in circumstances where it relates to a period of time within the following tax year; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>

 <i>[holding answer 5 July 2000]:</i> The earnings of all employees and directors, including money received on redundancy as pay in lieu of notice and holiday pay, are taxed in the year in which they are received instead of the year for which they were earned. This way of taxing earnings was introduced in the 1989 Budget in order to simplify the method of assessment. There are no current plans to change this treatment.

<P>

<a name="00710w24.html_para3">Where goods are moved in transit through other EC countries while en route to non-EC countries, exporters are required to state the final country of destination on their customs declarations.

The European trade statistics system does not allow for the identification of these movements.
