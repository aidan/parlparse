<a name="80205w01.html_para1">There was a change in recording practice from the second quarter of 1991 which relates to the recording of intentionally homeless households which have been excluded from acceptance figures since then. Estimated figures for England on this revised basis have been produced for the period prior to the change and the answer uses these adjusted figures. Similar estimates have not been made at county or local authority so the figures for Winchester and Hampshire for the years up to 1991 may include some acceptances of intentionally homeless households.

<a name="80205w01.html_para2">We have no powers under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to introduce accessibility requirements for minicabs. Our priority is to use the powers which are currently provided by the Act to bring forward accessibility regulations for taxis, buses and coaches and rail vehicles. We understand that access to minicabs is of concern to some disability organisations and we will keep the issue under review.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State announced on 21 January that he had asked the Rail Regulator to conduct an urgent and wide-ranging inquiry into the operation of the rolling stock market. The Regulator has been asked specifically to examine the scope for the rolling stock companies to abuse their market power either through excessive pricing, through inadequate investment in new or refurbished rolling stock or more generally through their response to the requirements of train operators to secure improvements in performance. The Regulator has been

 Taxation is a matter for the Chancellor of the Exchequer.

My Department is currently conducting research into these costs and benefits to inform the Chancellor's consideration of whether to proceed in principle to develop a minerals extraction tax.

 Grants under Part I of the Housing Grants, Construction and Regeneration Act 1996, including Home Repair Assistance, do not and should not depend on the ethnic grouping of the applicant. They are housing grants and eligibility depends on the type and age of the dwelling and the applicant's interest in the property. My Department is currently reviewing the criteria for eligibility for Home Repair Assistance in so far as they relate to the site on which a mobile home is situated.

 As indicated in my previous answer on 10 December 1997, <i>Official Report</i>, columns <i>627-28</i>, there were 1,333 complaint cases against the police in Scotland in 1996-97. It is not possible, however, to distinguish from the records held centrally on these cases the total number of individuals who made complaints.

 The Green Paper, "Working Together For A Healthier Scotland", is published today. Copies have been laid before the House and are available in the Library of the House and the Vote Office.
<P>

<a name="80205w05.html_para1">The Green Paper seeks views on a range of proposals for improving health in Scotland, in a way which recognises the relationship with poverty, poor housing, unemployment and the environment as well as the importance of healthy lifestyles in addressing Scotland's major health problems such as coronary heart disease and cancer. Particular emphasis is placed on the need for a concerted approach across Government and involving local authorities and other bodies whose policies impact on health.
<P>

<a name="80205w05.html_para2">The Green Paper will be widely distributed and comments are invited by 30 April 1998, with a view to the publication of a White Paper later in the year.

 The Immigration and Nationality Directorate Caseworking Programme is a privately financed project where the supplier, Siemens Business Services, shares the efficiency benefits as payment for the Programme. Any substantial increase in casework output in order to reduce backlogs would require additional funding. The future funding levels will be decided in the light of the outcome of the Comprehensive Spending Reviews. Siemens Business Services forecast that, when fully effective, the new systems will improve efficiency by 40 per cent.

 <i>[holding answer 4 February 1998]:</i> No advice has been issued because the allocation of resources to particular areas of police activity is a matter for individual chief officers and their police authorities to determine in accordance with local needs and priorities.
<P>

<a name="80205w06.html_para0">Chief officers attach high importance to the enforcement of drink driving legislation. Police forces in England and Wales administered a total of 781.100 screening breath tests during 1996. This figure represented an 11 per cent. increase over the number of tests taken in 1995.

 The reply was incorporated in my composite letter of 30 January 1998 to each hon. Member about the present position on the compensation scheme.

 Project licences authorise programmes of work regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. They are not granted to establishments but to individuals.
<P>

<a name="80205w07.html_para2">Under sections 6 and 7 of the Act, establishments where animals are used in scientific procedures or where animals listed in Schedule 2 of the Act are bred or supplied for such use must be designated in a certificate issued by the Secretary of State.

<a name="80205w07.html_para5">We do not propose to bring all animals which are protected under the terms of section 1 of the Act within the scope of Schedule 2.

<P>
<P>
<a name="80205w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Section 27 (1) of the Data Protection Act 1984 provides that personal data are exempt from the Act's registration and subject access provisions if the exemption is required for the purpose of safeguarding national security. The previous Administration determined in 1986, under section 27 (2) of the Data Protection Act 



<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 1998 : Column: 747</I><P>
1984, that all personal data held by the Security Service were required to be exempt from the registration and subject access provisions of that Act in order to safeguard national security. Similar determinations were made for all personal data held by Security Intelligence Service and Government Communication Headquarters.
<P>

<a name="80205w07.html_para7">My Department has been considering with the Security Service and the intelligence agencies whether such a blanket exemption will still be necessary under the Data Protection Bill now before Parliament.

 Passive drug detection dogs were used in 28 establishments in 1997 to search visitors and staff for drugs on entry into the establishment or the visits area. Active drug dogs are used occasionally to search visits areas before or after visits. Although drug detection dogs may pass through visits areas as a deterrent during visits it is not policy to allow dogs to roam in visits areas during visiting times.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what is the time elapse after which it is not possible to detect heroin in prisoners using present drug detecting equipment.  [27512]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80205w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Using the testing processes and cut-off levels employed on behalf of the Prison Service, it is possible to determine that a positive test result was definitely due to heroin in a urine sample taken up to 12 hours after last use. Heroin degrades to morphine, which can be detected for up to seven days after last use. In these circumstances, it is not possible to be certain that heroin was the drug used.

At 1 February 1998, around 18,000 claims received in the Firearms Compensation Section after 1 September 1997 had received no payment, and 11,477 claims received on or before that date, the great majority of which are mixed claims which have received a payment under Options A and B of the compensation scheme, were awaiting payment under Option C.

 Our representative at the Council of Europe Ministerial meeting in May will adopt the same approach to the issue of human rights in Turkey as the government has consistently maintained to date. We remain concerned at Turkey's poor human rights record, but believe that legitimate criticism of Turkey's shortcomings must be backed up by constructive assistance.
<P>

<a name="80205w08.html_para5">We have stressed to the Turkish authorities that the imprisonment of democratically elected politicians for the non-violent expression of their views can only damage Turkey's international standing.

 We first approached the Venezuelan authorities in 1994 regarding a bilateral Prisoner Transfer Agreement but could not agree a mutually acceptable text.

<P>

<a name="80205w08.html_para6">A priority of our Presidency of the European Union is to encourage countries that have not already done so to accede to the Convention. We will raise the subject again with the Venezuelan authorities at the earliest opportunity.

 After a detailed and careful review of existing procedures in which the interests of not discriminating against the individual have been balanced against the requirements of national security, I have approved several changes to the nationality rules for employment with GCHQ and the Secret Intelligence Service. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary has 



<P>
<P><I>5 Feb 1998 : Column: 753</I><P>
approved the same changes with respect to the Security Service. The new rules still require that an applicant or employee should be a British citizen, (and hold no other citizenship) but those relating to parental nationality have been simplified. The requirement is now that at least one parent should be British or have substantial ties with the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="80205w08.html_para7">The rule restricting the nationality of spouses and cohabitants to limited categories of countries has also been relaxed. It will, however, continue to be the case that the circumstances of each applicant are examined in detail as part of the security vetting process in order to assess any risks. The new rules will come into force with immediate effect.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on progress towards meeting the Dayton Agreement with respect to Bosnia.  [25682]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="80205w08.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 Implementation of the Dayton Peace Agreement in Bosnia is progressing steadily. The Bonn Peace Implementation Conference in 1997 found that notable progress had been made. However, much more could have been achieved had the authorities in Bosnia contributed their full share to the construction of a civil and democratic society in the country.
<P>

<a name="80205w08.html_para8">A copy of the conclusions of the Bonn Peace Implementation Conference has been placed in the Libraries of the House today.
<P>

<a name="80205w08.html_para9">Since the Bonn conference, the pace of implementation has been maintained, in particular by the High Representative Mr. Carlos Westendorp making use of the enhanced powers given to him at Bonn to impose deadlock-breaking decisions.
<P>

<a name="80205w08.html_para10">The international community also welcomes the formation in January of a new government in the Republika Srpska committed to co-operation with Dayton implementation. The detention by SFOR troops in January of a further war crimes indictee also demonstrated that the international community continues to attach high priority to this important aspect of Dayton implementation.

 In its notice to importers, published in the <i>Official Journal</i> of the European Communities on 8 November, the European Commission advised importers that if preferential certificates issued by Israel proved to be invalid, such certificates have already engendered, or could give rise to a customs debt. HM Customs and Excise gave this notice wide publicity through trade associations and journals.

 <i>[pursuant to his reply 31 July 1997, c. 466]:</i> The Ministry of Defence has run a competition, on behalf of the Royal Household, for the provision of a helicopter service for the Royal Family. As a result of the responses to the competition it became clear that the option of using an aircraft with civilian aircrew operating out of a civilian airfield would provide greater savings to the taxpayer than a military operated solution. The Royal Household therefore decided that they wished to pursue this option and have now decided to place contracts for such a civilian service with Sikorsky and Air Hanson.

<P>
<a name="80205w11.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 Under a Competing for Quality and Public/Private Partnering initiative, the Naval Recruiting and Training Agency (NRTA) entered into a 15 years contract with Flagship Training Limited in July 1996. Flagship is a public limited company set up specially for the provision of training administrative and support activities, Income Generation and Public/Private Partnership initiatives in a Partnering Arrangement with the NRTA. Flagship's equity is held by Vosper Thornycroft, GEC Marconi and Johnson Controls Limited.
<P>

<a name="80205w11.html_para5">Under this pathfinder project, Flagship will market NRTA's irreducible spare training capacity and provide support services in return for fixed maximum charges. The NRTA has wholeheartedly embraced Partnering. Certain Support Services (mainly the already contractorised catering and cleaning) have already been transferred to NRTA's considerable advantage.
<P>

<a name="80205w11.html_para6">I am pleased to announce that, following detailed negotiation between the Agency and Flagship, agreement has been reached over the transfer to Flagship of the first and major phase of support service activities. This agreement centres on the provision of activities in the General, Administration and Training Support areas; 434 Civil Service posts and 550 uniformed posts presently deliver these activities. The net result of transferring the posts to Flagship is expected to be the creation of approaching 300 new civilian jobs and release of much needed uniformed personnel to fill gaps elsewhere in the Navy. A conservative assessment of the net cash savings to the NRTA is &#163;29 million over 13 years from this first phase of transfer; with downstream savings of a similar amount expected from later phases.
<P>

<a name="80205w11.html_para7">Under Income Generation, approximately &#163;20 million worth of contracts have already been secured by Flagship, and, prospective business worth about &#163;300 million over 13 years has been identified, with the potential for creating up to a further 100 jobs in areas affected by previous reductions in the Defence budget. The recently awarded Kuwait contract typifies the benefits that Partnering offers the UK. The provision of naval training for a ship order secured by another nation is unprecedented, and indicates the value of combining Flagship's commercial expertise with Naval training internationally recognised as second to none.
<P>

<a name="80205w11.html_para8">National and Local Trades Unions have been informed regularly of the progress and I have recently approved, in principle, the signing of a formal contractual agreement involving the transfer of the activities and employees from the NRTA to Flagship in a phased manner beginning on 5 May 1998, subject to the outcome of formal consultation with Departmental Trade Unions. A copy of the consultative document has been placed in the Library of the House.

 No terrorist weapons or explosives have yet been dealt with by the Independent International Commission on Decommissioning.

It is now for those in possession of illegal arms to take this important confidence building step.

 The Standing Advisory Commission on Human Rights was established by the 1973 NI Constitution Act. Its remit is defined by that Act. In order to fulfil that remit, SACHR does commission research and make recommendations on policy. I have not issued any separate guidance. SACHR's role is to advise on the adequacy and effectiveness of the law in preventing discrimination, but not to provide remedies for people who may have been discriminated against. The Government very much welcomes the advice given by SACHR, which they take into account in making policy decisions.

 The Government's policy on devolution is that the National Assembly will take over virtually all the functions of the Secretary of State for Wales. My right hon.

The Government are committed to the creation of a new rail authority, combining functions currently carried out by the Franchising Director and the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, to ensure effective and accountable regulation of the railways throughout Great Britain. It will in due course be necessary to define the Assembly's relationship with the new rail authority.

 I am afraid that information to establish the proportion of European Community fish consumption accounted for by fish caught by Member States fleets in the various fisheries outside EU waters is not available. Neither UK nor EU statistics make it possible to identify where landings by Member States' fleets operating in international fishing zones or third countries have occurred. Nor do consumption figures indicate the origins of the fish consumed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what research his Department has <i>(a)</i> commissioned and <i>(b)</i> evaluated into radiotherapy damage resulting from radiotherapy treatment;  [24536]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="80205w14.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 In 1994, the Department of Health issued guidance to the National Health Service on quality assurance in radiotherapy, "Quality Assurance in Radiotherapy--A Quality Management System for Radiotherapy". This is monitored through the Inspectorate for the Ionising Radiation Regulations (1988).
<P>

<a name="80205w14.html_para4">More recently, the Department's Central Audit Unit has funded two pieces of work. The first was guidelines on the management of women with adverse effects following radiotherapy treatment. They were produced by the Royal College of Radiologists (RCR) through a group chaired by Dr. Jane Maher. The guidelines were issued to the NHS by the Department in October 1995. The second was a confidential clinical review of 126 consenting members of Radiotherapy Action Group Exposure (RAGE)--a support group representing those suffering damage following treatment by radiotherapy for breast cancer--which was also conducted by the RCR and disseminated by the College to its fellows.
<P>

<a name="80205w14.html_para5">We are concerned to ensure that all patients and their families, including cancer patients who may have particular worries about the disease and its treatment, receive information which is clear, concise and easily understood, not only about the proposed treatments, but about possible alternatives and any substantial risks, so that they can make a balanced judgment about accepting treatment.
<P>

<a name="80205w14.html_para6">In 1995, the support group British Association of Cancer United Patients (BACUP), in conjunction with the Royal Colleges and other charities like CancerLink, Breast Cancer Care and RAGE, produced a series of three leaflets about radiotherapy for breast cancer and early detection of any adverse effects. This was partly funded by the Department of Health.
<P>

<a name="80205w14.html_para7">Copies of the leaflets were sent to each breast care nurse and oncologist with details of how to obtain a stock from BACUP for distribution to patients as needed. It was considered that these professionals were in the best position to make the leaflets available to patients at the appropriate stage in their treatment. Copies will be placed in the Library.

 18,804 hysterectomies were carried out for menorrhagia in National Health Service hospitals in England in 1995-96, the latest year available. The estimated average cost of a hysterectomy, based on 1995-96 prices, is approximately &#163;2,400.
<P>

<a name="80205w14.html_para8">The Department of Health issued an Effective Healthcare Bulletin on 'The Management of Menorrhagia' in 1995. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists is currently preparing clinical guidelines on the management of menorrhagia in both primary and secondary care. The guidelines, which are funded by the Department of Health, are expected to be published later this year.

<a name="80205w16.html_para0">In household surveys, about 40 per cent. of adults aged 16 and over who report a gross income below their personal tax allowance also report that they hold no interest-bearing accounts. This would imply a total of about 8 million adult non-taxpayers with no interest-bearing accounts in the population. Similar sources yield an estimate of about 6 million children under 16 holding no interest-bearing accounts.

<a name="80205w17.html_para4">My Department has worked with the Treasury to produce a Booklet "EMU: Practical Information for Business", some 65,000 copies of which have been distributed. My Ministerial colleagues and officials also emphasise the need for firms to prepare for the single currency in their contacts with business. To reinforce this approach, the Government are also planning an awareness and information campaign to alert British business to the effects of EMU from 1 January 1999 and help them prepare.

<a name="80205w17.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 The issue of university infrastructure and equipment needs is being considered within the Comprehensive Spending Review. In the meantime, the Government have demonstrated their commitment to maintaining state of the art equipment within UK universities through the increased funding of &#163;13 million provided by the Research Councils, the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE) and the Department for Education and Employment for the 1997 round of the Joint Research Equipment Initiative (JREI). This raised the total amount of public funds for this round of the scheme to over &#163;34 million, which with the associated contributions from the private sector, has provided research equipment worth some &#163;80 million. We also announced in January that the JREI would continue on an annual basis.

 The future of the UK coal industry will be influenced by many factors, some of which are currently the subject of reviews initiated by the Government, others of which are the subject of action already taken by the Government. I believe that the Government will be better placed to report to the House on their views of the future of the industry once we are in a position to report on the outcomes of those reviews.

 In its communication "Agenda 2000", published on 16 July 1997, the Commission outlined in general terms its approach to the reform of the Structural Funds. We expect the Commission to publish more detailed draft regulations covering the future operation of the Funds in March or April this year. These draft regulations, covering the period 2000-2006, will then need to be negotiated in the Council of Ministers and approved by the European Parliament. Only once the final regulations have been agreed will we know which specific regions or areas will be eligible for Structural Funds. I and other Ministers have raised the specific treatment of Cornwall and other similar UK areas with low per capita GDP directly with the Commission. The Government will be working hard to ensure an outcome which is fair to the UK's regions and to the UK as a whole.

 We are required to ensure that, as a major purchaser of solid fuel, our purchasing does not discriminate between suppliers of fuels. Such discrimination is unlawful under Article 30 of the EC Treaty (Treaty of Rome) and under Articles 4 and 63 of the ECSC Treaty (Treaty of Paris). In addition, the Public Procurement Supplies Directive (93/36/EEC) imposes obligations of non-discrimination, spelt out particularly in the provisions relating to technical specifications. It is necessary that required specifications are not used in a potentially discriminatory manner. Specification of manufactured smokeless fuel products by brand name is not permitted.

<i>Notes:</i> 1. All estimates are rounded to the nearest &#163;10 million. 2. Gross costs were estimated by the Government Actuary's Department (GAD). 3. The effect on income tax revenues were estimated by Inland Revenue. 4. Means-tested benefit offsets were calculated using the 1995-96 Family Resources Survey and the May 1996 Income Support Quarterly Statistical Enquiry, both uprated to 1997-98 prices, benefits and earnings levels, and calibrated to the forecasts underlying the 1997 Departmental Report. 5. The lower earnings limit and the upper earnings limit are legally linked to the rate of basic State pension; The Class 2 and Class 3 rates are all tied to the basic State pension rate by convention. GAD have assumed that all these limits and rates will continue to be linked to the RP rate. Hence altering the basic State pension rate has an automatic knock-on effect on several aspects of the contributions system. 6. Inland Revenue are not able to estimate the effect of increasing the linked benefits on income tax revenues. The net costs of increasing contributory RP and the linked benefits have therefore been calculated by subtracting the estimated increase in income tax receipts from increasing contributory RP only from the net DSS costs of increasing contributory RP and the linked benefits. 7. Since income related benefits and income to tax revenues do not form part of the NI Fund, the revenue raised from increasing National Insurance Contribution rates on the basis shown will be insufficient to meet the extra expenditure falling on the Fund from the stated benefit increases. <P>

 When calculating the cost to the department of "empty properties" it has been assumed that reference was being made to properties that are wholly vacant and not to vacant space within the department. The value of such Crown properties has been calculated to be &#163;429,000. The last valuation exercise was conducted in June 1995, information for 1996 to date could be obtained only at disproportionate cost. The amount of commercial rent that is payable on the property that is also vacant, for the period 1997-98 is approximately &#163;1.01 million.
<P>

<a name="80205w20.html_para0">There are properties on the estate that have been identified as having space that is vacant, but as the building is still used to house staff employed by the department these properties have not been included in calculating the figures used in this response. The disposal of surplus space has formed part of the recently signed PRIME contract whose aim is to reduce the overall running costs to the department of the space needed to deliver the department's business.

The number of families who benefit from the child care disregard reflects the lack of affordable, quality child care. The development of a National Child Care Strategy will seek to ensure that the provision of affordable, quality child care meets the needs of parents so that they may successfully balance their family and working lives.

<P>
<a name="80205w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Keith Bradley: </B> 
 The Department's spending plans assume existing levels of take-up of benefits, taking into account any observed trends. Unclaimed benefit does not, therefore, represent a saving on published spending plans. Latest estimates are that between &#163;670 million and &#163;890 million of Income Support was unclaimed by around a million pensioners in 1995-96. We are determined to get help to this group, and have already commissioned research to find out why they do not make a claim. From April, we will be spending &#163;15 million on a number of pilot projects to find the best way of encouraging them to make a claim.

<a name="80205w21.html_para4">In 1996-97, the Benefits Agency spent over &#163;5 million on publicising all benefits. It is not possible to identify how much of that figure directly related to Income Support for the elderly.

The UK would also work towards agreement on legislation and other action to modernise and improve the long-standing rules that coordinate the operation of Member States' statutory Social Security schemes for people moving between Member States.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Entitlement to DLA is primarily based upon the needs of a customer arising from their disability or illness rather than the diagnosis of a customer's illness or disability.

There has been a move away from the reliance of a medical assessment and more emphasis is placed upon a person's day to day care and mobility needs.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Similarly, in keeping with other decisions on DLA the emphasis on decisions made by Disability Appeal Tribunal's (DATs) is on the customer's own evidence of how their disability or illness affects them rather than a purely medical assessment. There may be some situations where further medical information may be the only way a DAT could reasonably reach a decision. For these cases procedures are in place whereby a medical examination can be undertaken or other medical information collected prior to the DAT hearing. It is also open for an appellant to produce any supportive evidence from carer's or other sources which can be presented to the tribunal.</FONT></UL>

<a name="80205w22.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 There are already requirements and opportunities for pupils to study issues related to international development through the National Curriculum, particularly in geography and history. The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority is due to give formal advice this Spring on the scope and nature of possible revisions to the National Curriculum after 2000. Meanwhile, the new flexibility in the primary curriculum will give schools more opportunity to offer intentional development education if they wish.

been dismissed. Two have moved to posts at Director level on promotion, 1 has returned to DfEE at this level having been on loan to another Department and 1 has returned to the Department at this level after a secondment to an outside organisation. No one at Director level has moved to another Department or been offered and rejected an alternative position, either within the Department or in another Department. None of the circumstances listed have applied to anyone at Director General (broadly equivalent to the former grade 2) level and above in DfEE since 1 May 1997 although further restructuring of the DfEE Board later this year is likely to involve 1 early retirement and 1 change of job.

 I refer the hon. Member to my reply on 1 December 1997, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>11</i>. I expect the Authority to submit its Corporate Plan to my right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State, in the very near future. He will then determine the Authority's grant in aid. My Department has indicated to the Authority that a sum of around &#163;53 million will be available.
