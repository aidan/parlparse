<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Livsey: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proposals he has to share information on immigration matters with other EU states. [9835]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The participation of member states of the European Union in the work on immigration and asylum policy taken forward under the third pillar provides a framework for the sharing of information on immigration matters. The clearing houses, CIREA and CIREFI, have been established for this purpose. The United Kingdom participates fully in these arrangements. Additionally, we exchange information bilaterally with other European Union countries where there is a particular reason to do so.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Clappison: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he plans to announce his decision as to whether or not to implement the provisions of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997 relating to minimum sentences for persistent burglars and drug dealers. [10369]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 An announcement will be made as soon as we have completed our consideration of the relevant provisions of the Crime (Sentences) Act 1997.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Hanson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will undertake consultations with interested parties with regard to the prohibition of the sale and supply of cigarette lighter fuel products to persons under the age of 16 years. [10222]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 Under the Intoxicating Substances (Supply) Act 1985 it is an offence to supply a substance to a person under 18 knowing or having reasonable cause to believe that the substance is, or its fumes are, likely to be inhaled for the purpose of causing intoxication. We agree with the view of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs that amendment of this legislation would be unlikely to increase the level of protection of children, although work with the industry continues in order to reduce the extent to which lighter fuel refills can be abused.

<a name="70724w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Compulsory Competitive Tendering</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Todd: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to replace compulsory competitive tendering with a duty on police authorities to obtain best value. [10867]




<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 1997 : Column: 678</I><P>
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 The Government are keen to involve the police service in the development of best value, and it will be open to police authorities to bid to be included in the pilot scheme to run best value projects announced today by my hon. Friend the Minister for Housing and Local Government.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para0">As part of our proposals to drive forward best value in the police service, we will encourage all police authorities, whether or not they are selected for pilot status, to co-operate in the development of best value by building on work already under way to promote value for money initiatives.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para1">At the same time, my hon. Friend's proposals to modify the current compulsory competitive tendering regulations and guidance, also announced today, will form the basis of discussions between my officials and representatives of the police service and police authorities.

<a name="70724w01.html_sbhd4"><H4><center>Huntingdon Life Sciences</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_wqn4"><B> Ms Fiona Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action he has taken in response to the allegations against Huntingdon Life Sciences broadcast on television on 26 March. [10874]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. George Howarth: </B> 
 We were extremely concerned about the events shown in the Channel 4 programme "Countryside Undercover: It's A Dog's Life", and we know that these concerns are shared by members of the public, and by scientists and animal technicians, the vast majority of whom are responsible and caring towards animals.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para2">The Home Office took prompt and firm action. On the morning after the programme was broadcast, the Home Office asked the police to investigate possible offences under the Protection of Animals Act 1911 and, as a result, two individuals have been charged with such offences. In replying to this question, we cannot therefore comment, at this time, about these two individuals or their actions as this might prejudice the prosecutions.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para3">The chief inspector, who heads the animals (scientific procedures) inspectorate, has also carried out a comprehensive and detailed investigation into the allegations arising from the programme and into the management and control of animal work at the establishment. We understand that in excess of 250 man-hours of time were spent in viewing more than 20 hours of unbroadcast video material, studying journals and company records, visiting the establishment and interviewing staff (both present and ex-employees). A report detailing his findings and recommendations was submitted to the Home Office last week and we commend the chief inspector for the speed and thoroughness of his investigation.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para4">The investigation has shown breaches of two of the standard conditions which apply to all certificates of designation. Shortcomings relating to the care, treatment and handling of animals, and delegation of health checking to new staff of undetermined competence demonstrate that the establishment was not appropriately staffed and that animals were not at all times provided with adequate care.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para5">My right hon. Friend therefore proposes to revoke the certificate of designation for this establishment, subject to 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 1997 : Column: 679</I><P>
the consideration of any representations made under section 12 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. However, if the proposed revocation took immediate effect, we estimate that up to 1,000 dogs; 10 baboons; 200 marmosets; 450 macaques; 13,000 mice; 35,000 rats; 2,000 rabbits; 4,000 guinea pigs; 3,000 birds; 4,000 fish; and smaller numbers of various other species undergoing scientific procedures would have to be destroyed. In addition, any ongoing work might need to be repeated; this would require the use of more laboratory animals. It is therefore proposed that the revocation will take effect on 30 November 1997.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para6">Revocation would shut down the company with the consequent loss of 1,400 jobs. Whilst the failures and omissions at the establishment are extremely serious, this outcome would not necessarily be warranted. An application for a replacement certificate could, therefore, be considered if my right hon. Friend can be assured that measures have been put in place to prevent any recurrence of the events shown in the television programme. Sixteen stringent conditions have been set which must be met before any new application can be considered.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para7">In addition to the two individuals facing prosecution, my right hon. Friend proposes to revoke the personal licence of a third animal technician--again, subject to the right to make representations--and it has been decided that letters of admonition should be sent to two other technicians.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para8">The Home Office, and specifically the animals (scientific procedures) inspectorate, was criticised for having missed alleged mistreatment, for failure to implement the requirements of the "Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals Used in Scientific Procedures", and for having conducted inspections during which no checks were made on the animals being cared for by the undercover investigator.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para9">We are satisfied that any alleged mistreatment of animals would not have taken place in front of inspectors; that there was compliance with the code of practice; and that an appropriate proportion of inspectorate resources was directed at the establishment concerned. On each of the visits of inspection witnessed by the investigator, animals in other parts of the dog unit were checked and the performance of regulated procedures observed. The current inspection policy will, however, be reviewed and we have already announced that we will be considering ways of strengthening the inspectorate.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para10">Whilst no breaches of the "Code of Practice for the Housing and Care of Animals Used in Scientific Procedures" were identified, we are aware of public concern about the conditions in which the dogs were kept. We have, therefore, decided that the inspectorate will audit all commercial dog facilities to identify best practice and innovations with respect to the housing and care of animals, and that this information will be used to inform national standards.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para11">It has also been deduced that the need for a code of conduct for the control of dogs and other species in all establishments should be considered.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para12">The Animal Procedures Committee is keen to consider and promulgate to establishments any other general lessons which can be learned in order to help prevent similar occurrences in the future. We welcome this.




<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 1997 : Column: 680</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para13">The chief inspector's report contains information which was provided in confidence and which cannot, therefore, be disclosed under section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. It cannot therefore be published in full.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Hopkins: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the resources available to the Prison Service. [10940]
<P><P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what are his plans for budgetary adjustments within the Prison Service to reflect the forecast rise in the prison population in each of the next three years. [10098]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 In order to ensure that the Prison Service can accommodate the projected numbers safely, it will be able to spend up to an extra &#163;43 million during this year and next. This will create 290 new places on top of the existing building programme, and provide additional staffing and funding for regime activities to support the placing of an additional 1,830 prisoners in existing accommodation, 630 of whom are already being detained.
<P>

<a name="70724w01.html_para14">I will tomorrow place in the Library a report of the findings of the audit of Prison Service resources which has been carried out in accordance with our manifesto.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department for what period the contract for Operation Quantum will be awarded. [10091]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 It is anticipated that any contract will be awarded for a period of up to 10 years from completion of implementation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the number of posts remaining within the Prison Service at administrative and executive grades after the completion of Operation Quantum. [10096]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 I am not in a position to make an estimate of the number of posts which will remain within the Prison Service at this stage. Final decisions have not yet been made on the scope of the project, nor on whether the services in question should be contracted-out or remain in-house.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w02.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which companies have been invited to tender for Operation Quantum. [10089]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Prison Service has not yet issued invitations to tender for Quantum. Three suppliers have taken part in a study of the Prison Service's requirements. These are:

<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) if he will place in the Library a copy of the report of the Prison Service inquiry into the death of Geoffrey Thomas; [10094]
<P>
<UL>(2) if an offer of compensation to Mrs. Marina Davis, the mother of Geoffrey Thomas whose death was the subject of the Prison Service inquiry has been made; and what negotiations regarding the matter are in progress; [10093]
<P>
(3) for what reasons the disciplinary proceedings against five members of the staff of Cardiff prison arising out of the use of physical restraints upon Geoffrey Thomas whilst a patient in the University Hospital of Wales at Cardiff have commenced and been adjourned; and on what date the proceedings will re-commence. [10095]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 At present, the Prison Service does not publish investigation reports into the deaths of prisoners. The policy on the disclosure of such reports is currently being reviewed.
<P>

<a name="70724w02.html_para0">The Prison Service has not made an offer of compensation to Mrs. Marina Davis in respect of her son, Geoffrey Thomas, and no approach has been made to the service by her, or her representatives regarding compensation.
<P>

<a name="70724w02.html_para1">Disciplinary proceedings were instituted against five members of staff at Cardiff prison following the death of Geoffrey Thomas. The first hearing took place on 19 May. Three of the cases have been concluded: one case was proven and two were not.
<P>

<a name="70724w02.html_para2">The Prison Governor's Association has questioned the legality of the actions of the governor in the investigation of the cases. The disciplinary proceedings against the other two members of staff were suspended on 22 May, pending the resolution of these legal issues.

Figures and percentages are based upon a 91 per cent. response to a voluntary staff survey of ethnic origin. There is no legislative requirement to monitor the ethnic origin of Northern Ireland Court Service employees and no figures are available. I have asked the chief executives of the Land Registry and the Public Record Office to reply separately.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how often since 1992 his Department has been responsible for employment advertisements which contained age restrictions upon those who could apply. [9501]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 This reply is given on behalf of the Court Service, the Land Registry, the Northern Ireland Court Service, the Public Record Office, Lord Chancellor's Department headquarters and its associated offices, and the Public Trust Office.
<P>

<a name="70724w02.html_para7">The Land Registry and the Public Record Office do not include age restrictions in their recruitment advertisements.
<P>

<a name="70724w02.html_para8">An advertisement for a combined recruitment scheme for direct entrant executive officers in the Court Service, Public Trust Office and LCD HQ in 1992 contained age restrictions; but there have been no instances since then when either the Public Trust Office or LCD HQ have included upper or lower age limits in their advertisements.
<P>

<a name="70724w02.html_para9">As regards the Court Service, all advertisements for usher and bailiff posts until July last year specified a lower age limit. As such advertisements were placed locally by the courts concerned, it would not be possible to identify how often they have appeared between 1992 and July 1996 without incurring disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="70724w02.html_para10">The Northern Ireland Court Service has included age restrictions in 18 advertisements placed since the beginning of 1992.
<P>

<a name="70724w02.html_para11">In addition, there have been around 25 occasions on which advertisements for judicial appointments have been placed since October 1994, all of which will have included upper and lower age limits.

<P>
<a name="70724w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Scottish Office, the Office for National Statistics and other Government Departments work closely together to publish a wide range of official statistics for Scotland and for the UK. Working across government, the Government statistical service has recently initiated several related development tasks aimed at improving the range, value and accessibility of official statistics. Scottish Office GSS staff are closely involved in that work. They are reviewing what statistical information is published about Scotland and how it is made available, consulting closely with local authorities, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and other key customers.
<P>

<a name="70724w03.html_para0">Wherever possible, key statistical information is published at both Scotland and UK level. Where data are based on surveys, however, the sample size may be too small to allow statistically reliable data to be produced. In other cases, strict comparisons between Scotland and the rest of the UK may not be possible, or must be treated with caution, because of differences between the systems, such as in education.
<P>

<a name="70724w03.html_para1">The latest edition of "Regional Trends", published by ONS on Thursday 10 July, gives key social and economic statistics for both Scotland and the UK. Information at UK level on those with low incomes is available in "Households Below Average Income", published annually by the Department of Social Security and the latest edition, for 1993-94 data, included some information for Scotland.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland how many hospital patients are currently occupying beds in each health board area because of local authorities' inability to provide placements in nursing homes. [9699]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Galbraith: </B> 
 In March 1997, health boards reported that around 750 patients throughout Scotland were ready for discharge from hospital but were awaiting appropriate accommodation and packages of care in the community, including in nursing homes. There are many reasons why such patients may need to remain in hospital. Information on the number of patients ready for discharge to the community is not collected routinely.

 Some &#163;67 million has been set aside for provision of pre-school education in Scotland in 1998-99 compared with &#163;47.3 million in 1997-98. This will enable Government funding of part-time education on the current basis for all children in the pre-school year. Local

<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The training of school bus drivers is a matter for the operator and the relevant education authority. The Public Service Vehicle (Conduct of Drivers, Inspectors, Conductors and Passengers) Regulations 1990 enable a bus driver to remove any passenger who puts at risk, or unreasonably impedes, or causes discomfort to, any other passenger or to operating staff and to request a police constable to remove such a person. If the vehicle is operating under contract to an education authority, any additional grounds on which drivers may refuse the right of carriage are a matter for the operator under the terms of the contract. It is for each education authority to decide whether to provide supervisors on buses hired by them. In doing so, they will take into account that education authorities' common law duty of care for pupils is supplemented by a statutory duty under the Schools (Safety and Supervision of Pupils) (Scotland) Regulations 1990 to take reasonable care for the safety of pupils when under their care.

Since 1992, the counties of Clackmannan, Stirling, West Lothian, Fife, Aberdeen, Kincardine, Ayr, Dumfries, Kirkcudbright and Wigtown have been made operational.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w04.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Wallace: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Scotland if he has made a decision for the award of subsidy for the operation of passenger ferry services to Orkney and Shetland; and if he will make a statement. [10873]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w04.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Dewar: </B> 
 I intend to lay before the House as soon as practicable a draft undertaking to secure the continuation of these ferry services. The draft undertaking will propose the payment of a block grant subsidy for the operation of the northern isles passenger ferry services to P and O Scottish Ferries. The duration of this agreement will be from 1997 to 2002. The Government have taken this decision following an evaluation of the bids received in response to an open competitive tendering exercise. I propose to commence a new open tendering exercise next year for the award of a longer-term subsidy agreement commencing in 2002. The Government expect that, by 2002, new vessels will be needed for these services and an early decision will allow sufficient time for the successful operator to build new ships. Prior to initiating a new competition, the Scottish office will, as part of the Government-wide comprehensive spending review, be re-evaluating northern isles services. The future service specification will be based on this review.
<P>

<a name="70724w04.html_para2">The Government have examined the option of allowing a bid from Caledonian MacBrayne for the immediate block contract. It is clear that CalMac does not have vessels in its fleet capable of taking over the northern isles services in the short-term, nor does the current second hand vessel market currently offer suitable tonnage. However, the Government have decided to invite CalMac 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 1997 : Column: 690</I><P>
to consider whether it can identify a basis for entering the open tendering exercise for the new subsidy agreement commencing in 2002 which would be consistent with the overall level of public expenditure affordable for shipping services.
<P>

<a name="70724w04.html_para3">The previous Government initiated the open competitive tendering exercise in June 1995. Three bids were received and, after thorough consideration, the Government now conclude that P and O Scottish Ferries offers the best value for money.
<P>

<a name="70724w04.html_para4">The Government's agreement with P and O Scottish Ferries will safeguard the existing pattern of services for the next five years and includes guarantees for the export of livestock and the carriage of hazardous goods. Under the agreement, P and O Scottish Ferries will be paid a basic annual block grant of &#163;11.018 million subject to clawback arrangements should profits exceed current forecasts.
<P>

<a name="70724w04.html_para5">The profitability of northern isles passenger ferry services has been declining over a number of years due to fierce competition from freight-only operators. This competition has resulted in a sharp fall in tariffs which, whilst good news for businesses and consumers in the northern isles, reduces the income from passenger ferry services which carry a substantial amount of freight.
<P>

<a name="70724w04.html_para6">Passenger ferry operators are also required to adhere to much stricter safety regulations than freight operators. The latest regulations, the Stockholm agreement--introduced following the Estonia tragedy--will require either expensive modifications or the withdrawal of non-compliant vessels by 2002. By that date, P and O Scottish Ferries' three passenger ships will be some 30 years old. Costly upgrades to ships this old are not judged worthwhile. Instead, the Government have agreed to cover the increased depreciation charges required to write down the vessels to a realistic market value by 2002. If any modifications to P and O Scottish Ferries' three passenger ferries are required to meet safety of life at sea--SOLAS--95 regulations in the period before 2002, the Government will fund these by capital grant.
<P>

<a name="70724w04.html_para7">Declining freight profits and the additional cost of depreciation require an addition to subsidy costs compared with previous years, even although P and O Scottish Ferries' bid was lower than any other. The alternative would be to impose significantly increased fares on islanders or visitors, which the Government have rejected. This subsidy agreement represents a substantial financial commitment by the Government to safeguarding the passenger ferry services to Orkney and Shetland and to keeping fares down.

<P>
<a name="70724w05.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. David Clark: </B> 
 As part of its programme to clean up politics, the Government are determined that all unelected public bodies should be fully answerable for what they do. They should conduct their business so that they are both efficient, effective and economical in providing their expert advice and services to the public and to Government, and accessible, responsive and transparent to the public whom they ultimately serve. The White Papers on Scotland and Wales show that this democratic approach is central to the Government's plans for devolution. Our purpose is the same for public bodies which operate on a United Kingdom or Great Britain basis, those covering England alone and those serving England and Wales.
<P>

<a name="70724w05.html_para0">I propose in the autumn to issue a discussion paper considering how democratic oversight of those bodies might best be enhanced, not least through the full implementation of the recommendations of the Nolan committee. In the light of consultation, I shall bring forward proposals in the forthcoming White Paper on better Government.

Association, the Audit Commission, the trade unions and the private sector. I shall be writing to each shortly to invite nominations.
<P>

<a name="70724w06.html_para3">We are also to consult local authorities and other interested parties on proposals to modify the current CCT regulations and guidance. This follows a short review carried out by a working group comprised of representatives from my Department, the Welsh Office and the Local Government Association.
<P>

<a name="70724w06.html_para4">Our proposals are designed to enable authorities to adopt best value practices consistent with the current primary legislation. They provide a real incentive for authorities to take the voluntary route to competitive tendering, and significantly reduce many of the prescriptive elements of CCT that have so frustrated authorities and the private sector alike. Full details of our proposals are contained in a consultation paper which I am placing in the Library tomorrow morning. At the same time we shall be consulting on revised guidance on good tendering practice which will promote fairness and transparency in procurement decisions, and a draft will also be available in the Library tomorrow.
<P>

<a name="70724w06.html_para5">Taken together, these changes will build on the renewed interest of both local authorities and the private sector in the provision of quality cost-effective local services. They will release both public and private sectors from the sterile exchanges that have bedevilled CCT in recent years, and encourage innovation and best value to the benefit of those who use and pay for local services.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) how many monitoring experiments concerning the release of genetically modified organisms and bacteria the Health and Safety Executive has carried out on discharges from laboratories licensed to undertake activity under the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1992; and if he will list the dates and places of such monitoring; [10213]
<P>
<UL>(2) how the need for monitoring concerning the release and survival of genetically modified bacteria has been taken into account in the proposal for certificates of exemption for discharges of certain live GMOs in liquid wastes under the Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1992. [10214]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w06.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The Genetically Modified Organisms (Contained Use) Regulations 1992 require that effluent from higher risk GMOs be inactivated prior to discharge. Users have to monitor the effectiveness of this inactivation. So far as low risk GMOs are concerned, the regulations require that suitable control measures are used to limit their contact with the general population and the environment. The effectiveness of these control measures has to be tested and monitored by those undertaking the activities.




<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 1997 : Column: 697</I><P>

<P>

<a name="70724w06.html_para6">The Health and Safety Executive has not carried out any monitoring experiments. However, HSE specialist inspectors evaluate and discuss monitoring data with users during inspections.
<P>

<a name="70724w06.html_para7">The proposed exemption certificate would allow direct discharge of those untreated liquid wastes containing GMOs which, on the basis of a thorough risk assessment, were judged not to pose a risk of harm to human health and/or the environment. A key factor in this assessment would be that the GMOs were capable of only limited survival in the environment. The conditions attached to the proposed exemption certificate would require compliance with all other provisions of the contained use regulations, including monitoring.
<P>

<a name="70724w06.html_para8">The Advisory Committee on Genetic Modification will shortly be evaluating the outcome of a recent consultation exercise on the proposed exemption certificate. The HSE will then consider its advice before agreeing with relevant Departments--so far as matters relate to the environment--whether the certificate should be issued.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to revise circular 13/96: "Planning and Affordable Housing". [10866]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w07.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Planning Policy Guidance Note 3 "Housing" (PPG3) states that local planning authorities may seek to negotiate an element of affordable housing in respect of new housing developments on a substantial scale. The intention behind this policy was that a site should be large enough to accommodate a range and mix of types of housing. The site thresholds were introduced in circular 13/96 as a way of defining what the Department considered to be a substantial site for the purposes of the policy.
<P>

<a name="70724w07.html_para0">Since the circular was issued, the Department has been hearing from many local authorities and registered social landlords who argue that the threshold has had the effect of restricting the amount of affordable housing they are able to secure via the policy. I have given careful consideration to the views that have been expressed and, although I accept the principle of the use of thresholds, I have come to the conclusion that there is a case for looking again at the levels at which they were set.
<P>

<a name="70724w07.html_para1">I can announce today that my Department has issued for consultation proposed revisions to circular 13/96. In particular, we are proposing to lower the thresholds below which local authorities should not seek an element of affordable housing, and to clarify the way in which financial or other contributions should be secured through planning obligations where the parties consider that such contributions towards the provision of affordable housing on a different site are preferable.

<P>
<a name="70724w07.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Glenda Jackson: </B> 
 Nothing in law prevents local traffic authorities from permitting motorcycles to use bus lanes, although the necessary traffic signs require departmental approval. The Government are interested in experimental projects such as those which have been implemented in Bristol and Reading but are aware that they have generated concerns from cyclists on safety grounds. We will study the evidence from such schemes carefully to assess advantages and disadvantages for motor cyclists and other vulnerable road users, as well as their implications for balanced transport planning.

 Loop type seat belts can offer the same level of protection as a seat belt bolted to a fixed anchorage if they are approved to a recognised standard and properly fitted. Such belts should be secured to a part of a seat or the vehicle structure which is strong enough to take a high accident loading, has no sharp edges and positions the belt so that it can be worn properly.

 The Denver summit agreed to promote more effective co-ordination of international responses to outbreaks of infectious diseases and to develop a global surveillance network working through organisations such as the World Health Organisation. There was also a commitment to accelerate AIDS vaccine research, to enhance international scientific co-operation and collaboration, and to ensure that the United Nations programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS) fulfils its mandate.
<P>

<a name="70724w08.html_para0">We welcome the commitment to improve international collaboration on the surveillance, monitoring, and research of communicable diseases. The UK has a strong record in combating communicable diseases, both internationally and at home, and this work will continue in the future.

 The timetable for reporting is determined by the treaty itself or by the respective treaty monitoring committee. The UK's next reports are due on the following dates: International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights--ICCPR--June 1999; International 



<P>
<P><I>24 Jul 1997 : Column: 705</I><P>

We aim to submit these reports as closely as possible to the due dates except in the case of ICERD where it is proposed to hold submission back until April 1999 so that the report can take account of possible developments in this field that are currently under consideration: the secretariat of the committee is being informed.
<P>

<a name="70724w08.html_para6">The relevant monitoring committees have not yet given dates for public examinations of these reports, except for the CEDAW committee which has set January 1999 as the date for the examination of the previous and next reports.

<P>

<a name="70724w08.html_para7">The UK also submits reports in respect of those dependent territories to which particular treaties apply. The due dates are not the same in all cases, but we aim to submit reports under ICERD and CAT together with those of the UK itself. The initial dependent territories' reports under CRC and the latest dependent territories' reports under ICCPR, ICESCR and CEDAW are now overdue but steps are being taken to ensure that these are completed and submitted as soon as possible.

They are also required to make a declaration of their financial interests.

 I have received representations from across the meat supply/disposal chain, from representatives of producers to those of renderers, about the costs of disposal of animal by-products. These generally supported the continuation of Government financial support to the rendering industry.
<P>

<a name="70724w09.html_para1">I and my agricultural ministerial colleagues have considered the representations put to us very carefully. Having taken into account the impact on the meat industry of withdrawing support, the original purpose of the support and the considerable additional cost of extending it, for which we have no provision in our public expenditure plans, we have concluded that the support should be phased out, as already provided for, by the end of 1997-98 within the existing spending limit of &#163;59 million.

 The Government have no plans to seek an end to the payment of export refunds on live cattle. However, we welcome the fact that the ratio between refunds for live bovines and those for carcase meat has been moving towards favouring meat exports.
<P>

<a name="70724w09.html_para3">In the longer term, GATT Uruguay round commitments setting progressively decreasing limits on the volume and value of export subsidies are likely to bring further pressure to bear on refund levels.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what assessment he has made of the impact on pension funds of <i>(a)</i> changes to advance corporation tax in the Budget and <i>(b)</i> the introduction of the windfall tax; and if he will make a statement. [7647]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w10.html_spnew2"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Changes to the corporation tax system announced in the Budget will encourage long-term investment. The windfall tax funds the new deal for young and long-term unemployed, for lone parents and for schools. This is a significant investment in human capital. Pension funds should benefit over the long-term from the improved company performance resulting from the strong and stable economy which this Budget promotes.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many representations he has received from <i>(a)</i> hon. Members and <i>(b)</i> members of the public concerning his windfall tax proposals. [9887]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w10.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </B> 
 Some 30 hon. Members have written attaching constituents' letters. Some 130 letters have been sent direct by members of the public. The vast majority were in favour of the Government's proposals to introduce a windfall tax on the excess profits of the privatised utilities.
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w10.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Beith: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if, under his proposals in the Finance Bill, any liability to windfall tax can arise <i>(a)</i> in respect of the profits earned by privately owned statutory water companies, and <i>(b)</i> where such companies have been taken over by privatised companies, in respect of any part of the profits attributable to that part of the business which was previously in private ownership. [10146]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Robinson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 22 July 1997]:</i> The windfall tax applies only to companies previously within the public sector which were privatised by flotation and are subject to economic regulation by statute; that definition excludes water companies which have always been in the private sector. The tax is charged on the difference between the value of the floated company, calculated by reference to profits made in the initial period after flotation, and the value placed on the company at the time of flotation. Where the floated company has produced group accounts, these are used to produce the relevant profit figure.

<a name="70724w10.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make available the terms of reference for the separate departmental spending reviews making up the comprehensive spending review announced by the Chief Secretary on 11 June. [10807]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w10.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Darling: </B> 
 The terms of reference of the departmental and cross-departmental reviews have been placed in the Library today.
<P>

<a name="70724w10.html_para0">The comprehensive spending review aims to allow the Government to bring public spending programmes into line with its priorities and objectives. It will be truly comprehensive, embracing all items of public expenditure. It will also be focused on the long term, looking at the shape of public spending to the end of the century and beyond.
<P>

<a name="70724w10.html_para1">Ministers have agreed that they will examine each and every item in his or her Department to consider whether it meets the public interest, whether it contributes to the achievement of the Government's objectives, whether it is the most effective way of achieving those objectives, and whether there is scope for improving efficiency and effectiveness. This will include a thorough look at whether the best use is being made of public assets, with a view to disposing of those which are surplus and which could be used more productively elsewhere and making more use of public-private partnerships.
<P>

<a name="70724w10.html_para2">The review will be thorough. As well as looking at Departments' spending it will also address issues that stretch across departmental boundaries. There will be several self-standing cross departmental reviews, including reviews of the criminal justice system, the local

government finance system, the countryside and rural policy and housing. In addition, each Department will examine jointly with other Departments those areas where important issues cut across departmental boundaries, such as aid and trade provision, science and simplifying government.
<P>

<a name="70724w10.html_para3">This will be a far-reaching look at what the Government spends people's money on. It will ensure that public spending promotes opportunity and employment, investment and fairness. Its conclusions will be the basis for spending plans for the future that reflect our priorities and meet the country's needs.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the total revenue yield in a full year of the imposition of a tax at the rate of 20 per cent. on the investment income, other than dividends received from United Kingdom resident companies, of pension funds and life assurance companies. [8751]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w11.html_spnew0"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Using calculations based on my right hon. Friend's assumption an estimate of the full year yield for 1997-98 from a tax at 20 per cent. on the investment income, other than dividends paid by UK companies, of the funds of occupational pension schemes and the pension funds invested by life insurance companies is about &#163;4&#189; billion. This estimate does not take account of any behavioural effects which might result from such a change. The investment income arising from the UK non-pensions business of life insurance companies is already subject to tax.

 <i>[holding answer 22 July 1997]:</i> The organisation of joint armaments co-operation, more usually known as the Organisme Conjointe de Cooperation en matiere d'armament--(OCCAR)--is in its formative stages. At present, no collaborative projects involving UK participation are managed by the OCCAR.
<P>

<a name="70724w13.html_para0">The prospective projects involving the UK currently identified for inclusion in the OCCAR framework--the counter battery radar programmes, COBRA; multi-role armoured vehicle, MRAV and the tri-national military satellite communications programme, TRIMILSAT--will be considered according to their individual circumstances and in relation to progress with the strategic defence review.

<P>

<a name="70724w17.html_para0">The table has been prepared on the basis of the current pay bands. The left-hand side shows the numbers of staff in the senior civil services in the pay band ranges set out in &#163;5,000 bands, and, the right-hand side, the numbers of general service and analogous grades below the SCS in the relevant pay bands. The figures are full-time rates of basic salary, excluding allowances.
<P>

<a name="70724w17.html_para1">The figures for the general service include a number of specialist grades which, although analogous, have a higher maximum point on the particular pay range. For some specialist grades, this pay lead may result in the maximum point being up to 10 per cent. higher than that for the analogous general service grade.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland whether a restricted circulation copy of the leaked internal Government document on marches was made available to the Anglo-Irish secretariat; if the proposed inquiry into the leaked document will be authorised to investigate Irish civil servants and Irish Ministers associated with the Anglo-Irish secretariat in Northern Ireland; and if she will make a statement.

 The leaked internal document dealing with marches was copied to the British side of the Anglo-Irish secretariat. In common with established practice regarding protectively marked British material, it was not made available to the Irish side, so no question of involving Irish Ministers or civil servants arises.

 The Government launched their new deal for lone parents on 21 July. This will provide help with moving into work, for initially up to 40,000 lone parents in England, Scotland and Wales. From October 1998, help will be offered to half a million lone parents whose youngest child is over five.
<P>

<a name="70724w19.html_para2">The Budget included &#163;200 million over the life of this Parliament to fund the new deal for lone parents and improvements in help with child care costs. We will not therefore be proceeding with parent-plus.

<P>

<a name="70724w19.html_para4">We shall be looking at service provision to ensure that an equitable service is provided for all. This may be best achieved through a flexible approach, involving partnerships with other service providers, perhaps using other facilities on a casual basis or by using officers to visit customers in their homes or elsewhere. This is part of the Government's approach to getting public service agencies to work more effectively together. Concentrating staff in this way can improve the accuracy of work and can also bring efficiency gains. We are, however, clear that our strategy will continue to require a network of offices in which staff can speak to an advisor, as well as locations where customers can get access to information through direct-access kiosks.

<a name="70724w20.html_spnew12"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government's preferred approach to future funding arrangements for higher education includes continuing access to free tuition for students from lower-income families, no parental contributions from lower-income families and repayment of future maintenance loans on a basis related to income after graduation. But, as the report of the National Committee of Inquiry into Higher Education makes clear, the main factor determining access to higher education is the level of educational attainment up to age 18. the policies which my right hon. Friend has set out in the schools White Paper are designed to increase educational attainment in school and thereby encourage wider access to higher education.

 We want as many parents as possible to be able to send their children to their preferred school. But we recognise that where one school is more popular than another some parents will be disappointed. The White Paper "Excellence in Schools" explains that schools will work in partnership with each other and with the local education authority to develop helpful and timely information for parents and common timetables for applications.

 We will consult widely on the special educational needs appeals process, as part of an extensive consultation on SEN, through a Green Paper to be published in September. As part of that, we shall be looking to improve arrangements for conciliation between parents and local education authorities, so that fewer appeals need to come to the tribunal. That should in due course reduce pressure on tribunal running costs.

 The budget for the tribunal is held by the DfEE, but the Department has no involvement in special educational needs tribunal hearings. For the 1995-96 financial year, the SEN tribunal president has estimated that the average cost to the tribunal of a hearing is about &#163;820 and the average cost of processing an appeal, including hearing costs, is about &#163;730. The discrepancy is due mainly to something approaching 50 per cent. of appeals being withdrawn before reaching a hearing. It is not possible to offer meaningful averages for the cost of processing appeals in the 1994-95 financial year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="70724w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bell: </B> 
 Under the Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978 parishes are required to maintain a burials register--including that of unmarked graves--for each Church of England burial ground in the parish. Such records as exist regarding the location of unmarked graves would be preserved even in the event of a disposal of the burial ground concerned. Where the Commissioners make a scheme under section 30 of the Pastoral Measure 1983 enabling the secular development of a surplus burial ground it is the responsibility thereafter of the new owner--initially usually the Diocesian Board of Finance--to ensure that the provisions of section 65 and schedule 6 to the Measure regarding the disposal or otherwise of human remains are complied with.
<P>

<a name="70724w22.html_para0">The Secretary of State for the Home Department is also involved in this procedure whereby the removal of any remains and their new point of burial have to be recorded by the owner in a certificate in a prescribed manner and deposited at the General Register Office. Where a burial ground is being disposed of with a redundant church similar provisions apply.
