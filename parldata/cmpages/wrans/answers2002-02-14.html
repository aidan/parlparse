11. <a name="20214w01.html_wqn0"><B> Colin Burgon: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what recent discussions she has had with Communication Workers Union regarding projected job losses in the postal service.  [33802]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 While Ministers have had discussions with the Communication Workers Union on a range of issues, the cost-saving proposals announced by Consignia are an operational issue for the company in consultation with the unions.

<P>
12. <a name="20214w01.html_wqn1"><B> Derek Twigg: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the chemicals industry in the north-west of England.  [33803]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The chemical sector forms one of the north-west region's most important clusters. It accounts for 22 per cent. of the UK chemical industry. It contains the highest concentration in the country of the faster growing speciality and fine chemicals companies, supplying new markets such as electronics, pharmaceuticals and consumer products.

<P>
13. <a name="20214w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Wilkinson: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the prospects for the aerospace component manufacturing industry in 2002.  [33804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 As the hon. Member will be aware, the severe downturn in air travel following 11 September has resulted in a reduction in orders for new aircraft and a lower demand for aircraft repair and maintenance. This is inevitably having an adverse effect on the aerospace component manufacturing industry, which is likely to persist throughout 2002. However, all possible steps are being taken to restore passenger confidence and there are signs that this is starting to return. The Government believe that the long-term prospects for the industry remain good, and that market growth will return to its former level.

<P>
14. <a name="20214w01.html_wqn3"><B> Bob Russell: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what action she is taking to eradicate sales malpractices by gas and electricity suppliers.  [33805]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Regulation of energy suppliers is for the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem). Ofgem has already, with our strong encouragement, put in place specific marketing and sales rules for suppliers that go beyond those in general consumer law, and will shortly 



<P>
<P><I>14 Feb 2002 : Column 518W</I><P>
consult on extending these rules. Energywatch, the statutory consumer body established under the Utilities Act 2000, recently launched its "Stop Now!" campaign to combat unscrupulous sales practices. I wrote to all suppliers in November making clear that, if they do not address the problem of dishonest sales, those of us concerned with energy supply will need to look again at how best to protect consumers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew4"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry met the Board of Advantage West Midlands to discuss region-wide issues such as manufacturing and the region's proposals to become a Manufacturing Beacon; clearly this will have an impact on Telford. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, and other DTI Ministers, also attend regular meetings of the RDA Chairs, including Advantage West Midlands, where a wide range of issues is discussed, including its broadband and technology cluster proposals.

19. <a name="20214w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Joyce: </B> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what actions she is taking to encourage inward investment from Japan and South Korea.  [33812]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 I visited South Korea and Japan from 7&#150;12 January and met existing and prospective investors in both individual and group meetings, including a meeting with senior representatives of the Japanese automotive industry in Tokyo.
<P>

<a name="20214w01.html_para0">The Invest UK teams in both South Korea and Japan organise a series of initiatives, including marketing programmes, company calls, seminars, company visits to the UK, and attendance at trade fairs, all aimed at encouraging companies to invest in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20214w01.html_para1">The attractions of the United Kingdom mean that this country remains the number one location for South Korean and Japanese foreign direct investment in the European Union. To maintain this position, in the face of difficult global economic conditions, Invest UK has intensified its efforts at attracting knowledge-driven, high value investments in the ICT, automotive, life sciences and financial services sectors.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on Government assistance for exports from the UK manufacturing industry.  [33814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew7"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 British manufacturers account for over 60 per cent. of total British exports.
<P>

<a name="20214w01.html_para2">This year we are spending some &#163;69 million through British Trade International to help British exporters access the information, skills and contacts they need to trade successfully overseas.
<P>

<a name="20214w01.html_para3">In addition, the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) helps British exporters to compete overseas. Last year it underwrote &#163;5.6 billion of new business.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what measures she is taking to improve productivity in manufacturing industry.  [33817]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Since 1997 we have established a stable macro-economic framework to ensure the future competitiveness and productivity of British manufacturing. We have built on this basis with policies to promote the spread of best practice, encourage innovation, raise skills levels and improve the transfer of ideas from the science base.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_wqn9"><B> Sir Teddy Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the state of manufacturing industry.  [33811]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Manufacturing production is weak across the industrialised countries, including in the UK. The Government's policies are designed to assist the manufacturing sector improve its competitiveness and future prospects.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what assessment she has made of the contribution social entrepreneurship can make to the UK economy.  [33816]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The past lack of a common definition of social enterprise means that there is currently no reliable data on the contribution it makes to the UK economy. DTl's Social Enterprise Unit, working with academics and others, is reviewing existing research and identifying how best to map and evaluate social enterprise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w01.html_spnew15"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 Each proposed wind turbine installation is subject to some environmental evaluation prior to its construction. For proposed wind farms involving more than a single turbine, whether onshore or offshore, a full environmental impact assessment by an independent consultant is generally required.
<P>

<a name="20214w01.html_para5">A number of studies, conducted both within the DTI's Sustainable Energy Programme and outside, have looked in detail at environmental effects of wind farms. These include studies on noise, birds, other wildlife, visual impact, electromagnetic interference, and the cumulative effects of wind turbines on a locality.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what her objectives will be at the forthcoming Barcelona summit with special reference to industrial competitiveness.  [33821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 At the Lisbon summit in March 2000, Heads of Government acknowledged that Europe needed major structural reform to succeed in the global economy and that companies needed flexible, strong and open markets to enable them to improve their competitive position and create new jobs. The summit set out two ambitious goals: to make the EU the most competitive 



<P>
<P><I>14 Feb 2002 : Column 521W</I><P>
economy in the world and to create full employment by 2010. The Barcelona summit marks the end of the second year of this 10-year programme.
<P>

<a name="20214w02.html_para0">The Government are a strong supporter of the Lisbon agenda and want the Barcelona summit to reaffirm the EU's commitment to economic reform. In doing this we need to take stock and evaluate progress against the conclusions agreed at Lisbon and set out a future programme of work to ensure that momentum is maintained.
<P>

<a name="20214w02.html_para1">The EU has made good progress in a number of areas&#151;for example, updating the regulation of telecommunications&#151;but progress has been less encouraging in others. We are still waiting for agreement on a Community Patent and updated public procurement rules. We will be looking to Barcelona to give a political push in those areas where negotiations have progressed less positively.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the future of the universal service obligation for mail delivery services.  [33801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 The Government consider the maintenance of a universal postal service in this country to be of the highest importance. That is why we enshrined the obligation in primary legislation in the Postal Services Act 2000 and gave the postal regulator (Postcomm) the primary duty to exercise its functions in a manner best calculated to ensure the provision of a universal postal service. It is therefore for Postcomm to determine how the universal service obligation is implemented in the interests of consumers. Currently Postcomm requires Consignia plc, in the licence, to provide a universal postal service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w02.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Barnes: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how many representations her Department has received since the Trading Schemes Act 1996 to amend the definition of single tier established in the Fair Trading Act 1973, so that more than a single master franchise of a trading scheme may be permitted in the UK; if proposals permitting a change to exempt certain multi-level schemes were considered in her Department when drawing up S.I., 1997, No. 1887; if she will place in the Library details of her considerations in opting to maintain the single tier exemption in 1997; and if she will make a statement.  [26153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w02.html_spnew6"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 January 2002]:</i> Current legislation on trading schemes does not prohibit more than one master franchise from operating in the UK. However, each master franchise would have to comply with the relevant provisions of the trading schemes legislation.
<P>

<a name="20214w02.html_para5">The legislation is intended to protect scheme participants or potential participants whose ability to take commercial risks is similar to that of consumers and not to restrict normal business format transactions. The 1997 regulations therefore exclude from controls single-tier schemes or schemes where participants are registered for VAT. Some exemption of certain multi-level schemes was considered but it was concluded that this carried the risk of creating loopholes in the controls.
<P>

<a name="20214w02.html_para6">A copy of the summary of responses to the consultation which preceded the 1997 regulations has been placed in the Libraries of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will establish an inquiry into the implications for UK corporate accounting practice of the collapse of Enron.  [30084]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w02.html_spnew7"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 No. There are major differences between the accounting requirements in the UK and the US, which make it unlikely that the principal accounting factors we understand to have been involved in the collapse of Enron would be replicated here. We are, however, following developments in the US. The UK Accounting Standards Board has been playing a leading role for some time in international discussions of accounting requirements in this area.

[32281]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w02.html_spnew9"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans she has to reduce the regulatory burden on small businesses resulting from the implementation of EU directives.  [33016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w02.html_spnew10"><B> Nigel Griffiths: </B> 
 To tackle European policy initiatives that unfairly burden British small firms, the Small Business Service has set up smallbusinesseurope which lobbies for small business interest while European directives are being framed. To avoid unnecessary and over-complex implementation of European directives in the UK, this Government have produced essential guidance for policy officials&#151;the Guide to Better European Regulations, and the Transposition Checklist. Transposition Notes help avoid 'gold-plating' by showing up any potential over-implementation, enabling it to be addressed. These notes have accompanied primary or secondary legislation that gives effect to European directives, easing scrutiny both by Parliament and business, since November 2001.

The Company Law Review drew attention to a growing body of evidence from the US suggesting that companies with a strong contingent of non-executives produce superior performance.

 Data on research and development (R&D) spending are not available on a monthly basis or for the exact geographies requested. The Office for National Statistics do, however, conduct an annual survey of R&D performed in business enterprise (BERD). Sub-regional data are available from this survey for 2000 but GDP is only available at a Government office region level (equivalent to RDA regions) for 1999 and at a sub-regional level for 1998. The table only covers own-funded BERD ie R&D performed in that region which was funded by the companies themselves (and not by Government or from abroad). Further details on the BERD survey can be found on www.statistics.gov.uk/ downloads/theme&#151;commerce/MA14&#150;2000.pdf.

 The Memorandum of Understanding between the DTI and the US Department of Energy (US DoE) came into force in November 2000. It aims to encourage collaboration in energy research and development. Some activities have already begun, eg on cleaner coal technologies. In the field of renewable energy, we await the response from the US DoE to a recent DTI proposal for a joint workshop on biomass to be held in UK later this year. This workshop would be supported by a series of site visits to show US experts what we are doing in the UK.

New S&T staff have already taken up duties in Berne, Boston, Moscow, New Delhi, Ottawa, San Francisco, Shanghai, Taipei, Tel Aviv and The Hague. A further 22 new or upgraded slots will be filled, as planned, by April 2003. This will reinforce the network in key technology centres and more than double its geographical coverage. The expansion and management of the network are being co-ordinated by the FCO's Science and Technology Unit, established in April 2001.

<a name="20214w06.html_para1">Since December 1999 with the publication of the Guidelines for UK Government websites, Government web managers have been advised on how to make websites accessible to people with disabilities or impairments. On 1 February 2001 the then e-Government Minister the Minister for Pensions, my right hon.

<P>
<a name="20214w06.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government have taken a number of steps already. As well as a questionnaire procedure for use in equal pay cases and other provisions in the Employment Bill, the Fair Pay Champions and the Castle Awards, created by my predecessor, are helping to spread good practice on equal pay. We are also taking forward recommendations from the Kingsmill report aimed at further reducing the pay gap. I have written to my Cabinet colleagues' union and will soon be writing to FTSE 100 companies, to gather examples of their good working practices, so that we can help spread these more widely.

 There are two formulae for elderly social services&#151;one for residential care and one for domiciliary care. The starting point for both formulae is the number of elderly people in each area. In the case of residential care it is the number of people in households; for domiciliary care it is the total resident population (which includes people in institutions as well as in households). In both formulae the number of people over 85 are given most weight, followed by those aged 75&#150;84, with those aged 65&#150;74 given least weight.
<P>

<a name="20214w07.html_para8">In addition to age, the formulae include deprivation and other indicators associated with the likelihood of being in need of care. These indicators are shown in the table:

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2002]:</i> Local authorities already have at their disposal a range of planning enforcement powers if they consider that an unacceptable breach of planning control has occurred. These powers include the ability to seek a planning injunction in the High Court or county court, to restrain any actual or expected breach of planning control. The exercise of enforcement powers is at the local authority's discretion. The powers apply irrespective of whether the land benefits from any special designation such as green belt.

<P>
<a name="20214w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The proposed directive on market access to port services would introduce a framework for competition in provision of services within ports, covering cargo handling, passenger services and technical-nautical services, including pilotage. The UK fully supports the broad principles of liberalisation and competition in the provision of port services, subject to safety and standards being safeguarded. However, we have a number of concerns about the proposals, and we consider that amendments will be required in order to take account of the diversity and complexity of the ports industry.
<P>

<a name="20214w08.html_para15">The proposed directive is now under discussion in the Transport Council Working Group. We understand that the commission is planning to issue modified proposals. We shall consult fully with the ports industry, users, trades unions and other interests on them.

Professional advice was sought in respect of the sale of the land and it was reported the woodland was in poor condition and contaminated. The contamination was alleged to be from the adjacent land that was a former refuse site.
<P>

<a name="20214w09.html_para5">Together with the recent concerns about the activities of the Uxbridge and District Rifle Club and the suggestion that the site is designated as ancient woodland the Highways Agency will undertake a full review of the case and take any action deemed necessary against the Uxbridge and District Rifle Club.

 Programme monitoring committees only operate in Objective 2 areas, so do not include representatives from areas only entitled to bid for Objective 3 funds. Objective 3 is a national programme and operates across England (excluding Objective 1 areas). It is managed by a national committee. Nine regional committees oversee the delivery of the regional Objective 3 programmes. They are: north west, north east, Yorkshire and the Humber, west midlands, east midlands, south west, east of England, south east and London.
<P>

<a name="20214w10.html_para0">In three regions, north west, west midlands and east of England, the partners have agreed that in the interests of coherence and integration both Objective 2 and 3 programmes should be managed by a single monitoring committee.

 Most Objective 3 funding is allocated to Government offices who work with partners to deliver the programme in line with regional priorities. Regional committees for Objective 3 oversee the delivery of the programmes.

 10 UK airlines have signed up to the Airline Passenger Service Commitment. They are Air 2000; Airtours International; bmi British Midland; Britannia Airways; British Airways; British European Airways; JMC Airlines; KLM(UK); Monarch Airlines; Virgin Atlantic Airways.

<P>

<a name="20214w10.html_para4">The launch of the Voluntary Commitments on Passenger Rights is good news for European air travellers. Air passengers have a right to expect the highest standards of customer care from the time at which they arrive at the airport to the point at which they reach their destinations. Responding to these expectations is a key component of a commercially successful aviation industry and the UK signatories have signalled that this is a matter that they treat very seriously.

 My right hon. Friend's answer to my hon.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 A company limited by guarantee (CLG) is a private company without shareholders. A CLG would be accountable to its members. We do not expect that there would be an option to buy back the company.

 The Health and Safety (Display Screen Equipment) Regulations 1992, effective January 1993, require employers to provide and pay for, upon request from an employee, an eye and eyesight test. There is a requirement for further tests at regular intervals; the optometrist doing the first test can recommend when the next one should be. In addition, employers must pay the cost of special spectacles required where normal ones cannot be used.

<a name="20214w12.html_para3">The increase between 1998&#150;99 and 1999&#150;2000 is mainly attributable to the commencement of the project to refurbish Admiralty Arch (completed in 2000&#150;01) and the Ripley and Kirkland buildings (due for completion in 2002&#150;03). The Ripley and Kirkland project is a major change project involving a complete refurbishment (including the installation of new mechanical, electrical and plumbing services and lifts). This will create modern office space. When the project is completed this will form 22 Whitehall; one of the Department's major buildings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 Approximately &#163;460,000 of timber is being used in the refurbishment of 22 Whitehall (the Ripley and Kirkland buildings). With the exception of around &#163;50,000 of timber which has been reclaimed (ie it is recycled) the remainder is all certified.
<P>

<a name="20214w12.html_para4"> The contract used with the main contractor for the refurbishment of 22 Whitehall places a requirement on the contractor to provide timber from certifiable sustainably managed sources upon which certificates are to be made available. Evidence provided by the main contractor indicates that all the timber supplied so far has been derived from sustainable and legal sources, ie the timber has been purchased under certified logging schemes.

 Secondments are part of the interchange programme, which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the civil service and other organisations. Before an interchange can occur all parties must be satisfied that no conflict of interest arises.

 I refer the hon. Member to the answer given below to my hon. Friend the Member for Dartford (Dr. Stoate).
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w13.html_wqn5"><B> Dr. Stoate: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister when the Government will publish the next edition of "Public Bodies" and the annual publication setting out the targets for increasing diversity in public appointments; and if he will make a statement.  [36683]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w13.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 I am pleased to report that the latest edition of "Public Bodies", "Public Bodies 2001", is published today. This publication provides detailed information on all public corporations, nationalised industries, health bodies and non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs), including tribunals and boards of visitors to penal establishments, in existence at 31 March 2001. Specifically, the report sets out for each body:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Its location and terms of reference;
<P>
<BR>
The name, gender and remuneration of the chair and deputy chair and the number of members of the board and their gender (where these positions exist);
<P>
<BR>
The number of staff employed;
<P>
<BR>
The audit arrangements and the financial year in which the body was last reviewed by Government; and
<P>
<BR>
The body's total expenditure and the amounts funded by Government or by other means.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="20214w13.html_para3">Public bodies play an important role in the processes of national government and the women and men who serve on them, and the staff of these bodies, make a very valuable and positive contribution to the continuous improvement of public services and also to better policy making.
<P>

<a name="20214w13.html_para4">The Government remain committed to minimising the number of NDPBs. As "Public Bodies 2001" shows that, at 31 March 2001, there were 1,025 public bodies, fewer than at any time since "Public Bodies" was first published in 1979.
<P>

<a name="20214w13.html_para5">In parallel with the continuing commitment to reduce the number of NDPBs, the Government also remain committed to ensuring that new NDPBs and other bodies are set up only where it can be demonstrated that this is the most cost-effective and appropriate means of carrying out the function concerned.
<P>

<a name="20214w13.html_para6">Finally, this Government also remain firmly committed to making appointments on merit to the boards of public bodies and to equality of opportunity with the aim of ensuring that the people who serve on public bodies are broadly representative of the diversity of the United Kingdom. To achieve this, the opportunity to play a part in public life by serving on a public body must be open 



<P>
<P><I>14 Feb 2002 : Column 566W</I><P>
to all, whether or not they are disabled and irrespective of their age, ethnicity or gender as well as their geographical or social background. Women and men should hold an equal share of public appointments and a greater proportion of appointments should be held by people from ethnic minority backgrounds and disabled people.
<P>

<a name="20214w13.html_para7">We have made some progress towards these goals. At 31 March 2001 women held 34 per cent. of appointments to the bodies detailed in "Public Bodies 2001" and 4.8 per cent. were held by people from ethnic minority backgrounds; in both cases this is a small increase on the position at 31 March 2000. Similar information on the proportion of appointments held by disabled people is not yet available but it will be given in the next edition of "Public Bodies". There has been some continuing progress but there is more to do. I am therefore also pleased to announce that we have today published "Public Bodies: Opening Up Public Appointments 2002&#150;2005", which sets out for each Department its plans for increasing the diversity of the boards of the public bodies for which it is responsible. These targets, and the activities aimed at ensuring that they are met and that our overall goals are achieved.
<P>

<a name="20214w13.html_para8">Copies of "Public Bodies 2001" and "Public Bodies: Opening up Appointments: 2002&#150;2005" have been placed in the Libraries of the House. Both publications will be accessible via the Cabinet Office's internet website.

<P>
<a name="20214w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence does not itself monitor homelessness among those who have left the services but we are able to keep track of the number of rough sleepers with an ex-service background through work with the Rough Sleepers Unit (RSU). The Social Exclusion Unit (SEU) report published in 1998 identified that between one quarter and one fifth of rough sleepers had been in the armed forces at some stage, predominantly some years before as national service men. The MOD has 



<P>
<P><I>14 Feb 2002 : Column 568W</I><P>
since been working in partnership with the RSU and the charitable sector to reduce some of the most acute cases of homelessness, those sleeping rough on the streets.
<P>

<a name="20214w14.html_para0">The Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions have confirmed that interim analysis of rough sleeping data collected in November 2001 shows that the percentage of rough sleepers with an armed forces background has decreased markedly since the 1998 SEU report. This is clearly good news and provides strong evidence of the success that can be achieved by Government working in partnership with the voluntary sector.
<P>

<a name="20214w14.html_para1">Improvements that have been delivered by this partnership include the establishment of the Single Person Accommodation Service for Ex Service (SPACES) project at Catterick Garrison in 1999 which has already provided a range of housing and other support services to over 550 vulnerable people leaving the services. This exceeds the first target of 400.
<P>

<a name="20214w14.html_para2">We recognise there is further work to be done in this area and, as part of the Veterans' Initiative we are looking at improvements to resettlement arrangements for the most vulnerable service leavers. This will include addressing the risk of homelessness.

In response to the subsequent fall in demand from service families, many properties which are surplus to longer term service requirements have been, or will be, disposed of, but most such disposals result in release of the property back to AHL and thus do not constitute sales by the Ministry of Defence to the private sector. Disposals of non-AHL residential properties by MOD over the period are as follows.

 It was a normal and well-established principle of occupational schemes, including those in public sector, that to qualify for a widow's or widower's pension, the widow or widower of the pension had to be married to him or her at the time he or she was engaged in the occupation covered by the scheme. The Armed Forces Pension Scheme (AFPS) was similar to other public service schemes in this aspect. At the time, it was seen as reasonable to limit pensions to those widows or widowers who had shared at least some of their husband's or wife's service life.
<P>

<a name="20214w15.html_para6">Post-retirement widow and widower pensions (PRWP) were introduced as a requirement of the Social Security Pensions Act 1975. Provision was made in the AFPS for the payment of pensions to widows or widowers of service pensioners who married (or remarried) after retirement, but this change benefited only the widows of those giving service on or after 6 April 1978, and the widowers of those giving service on or after 6 April 1989. Only service on or after those dates was taken into account when calculating the level of pension and there is no distinction between servicemen and other public sector employees in this respect.
<P>

<a name="20214w15.html_para7">The armed forces pension review has looked at PRWP but has no plans to extend the provision to those who left before the qualifying dates. The review, however, has recommended, under the new scheme, paying a pension to a child born after the pensioner's retirement. Under the current scheme only children born, or conceived, while the member was serving are covered.
<P>

<a name="20214w15.html_para8">In divorce settlements, pension sharing has been available in respect of divorce and nullity proceedings that begin on or after 1 December 2000. Under pension sharing, a percentage of the capitalised value of the pension rights which an AFPS member has accrued to date may be allocated to his or her former spouse to provide that former spouse with pension rights of her or his own. Pension sharing is not available to unmarried partners.

 The explosive ordnance disposal exercise at RAF Chilmark is continuing. Approximately half of this 52 hectare (317.5 acre) site should be certified as clear by autumn 2002.
<P>

<a name="20214w16.html_para1">A considerable section of the site has already been sold on the open market. Defence Estates is currently in discussion with the representatives of a trust, which has been constituted with a view to buying an area of the site which is of high conservation and wildlife value. It is hoped that this sale will be concluded during 2002.

 Fair Trade (FT) is a small but significant part of the international trading system that aims to build more equitable trading partnerships between north and south, by offering better prices and better trading terms to small and medium-sized producer groups in developing countries.

<a name="20214w16.html_para5">The growth in sales of FT labelled products in the UK over the past five years has been dramatic&#151;albeit from a low base. Moreover, whereas in the past, FT products were sold only through dedicated FT outlets, nowadays FT foods and beverages are to be found in an increasing number of UK supermarkets. Some retailers have even launched own label FT products and there is every indication of this trend continuing as more FT standards are agreed and consumer demand for FT increases.
<P>

<a name="20214w16.html_para6">DFID has provided financial support to the media campaigns of the Fair Trade Foundation designed specifically to raise both supermarket and consumer awareness of FT. In particular DFID funds the Fair Trade Foundation's annual Fair Trade Fortnight (4&#150;17 March 2002) which will draw shoppers' attention to the increasing range of FT products available in UK supermarkets.

DFID has not commissioned any separate research, nor commissioned any independent evaluation of the DRI's work in Ghana, although DRI's analysis has been largely verified by the World Bank and IMF during their HIPC related assessments of Ghana's debt sustainability.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w20.html_spnew3"><B> Ruth Kelly: </B> 
 The arrangements for granting paid leave for union duties are the subject of formal agreements between Departments and the recognised trade unions within each Department. The agreements vary to reflect the needs of each Department. As the day-to-day management of each agreement is in the hands of managers throughout the UK detailed figures of the type sought are not readily available in every Department and the cost of collecting them would be disproportionate.

<a name="20214w20.html_para1">Managers are aware of the need to guard against excessive or unnecessary absences and paid union activity is restricted to the minimum necessary to ensure effective industrial relations and minimise strife.

A concession announced in 1993 which does allow the release of information from the 1911 Census, is conditional upon the applicant requiring the information solely in order to establish a legal entitlement and would only be considered where the information could not be obtained from any other source.</FONT></UL>

<a name="20214w21.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Government have encouraged better planning and accountability in public library services through the introduction of annual library plans in 1998. This process was strengthened still further in April 2001 with the introduction of public library standards. From 2001, ALPs have been used as the main vehicle for assessing the quality of library services, as library authorities are required to use them to report on their current position against the standards and their plans for meeting them in the future. In addition, all local authority services, including libraries, are subject to best value, and best value reviews provide a further valuable insight into the provision and plans made by authorities for continuous improvement in their library provision. Before the introduction of the annual library plans, public library standards and best value, there was no on-going check of library authority plans and performance.

 Funding for public libraries generally is provided through the Environmental Protection and Cultural Services (EPCS) block and through council tax. In the latest Local Government Financial Settlement (for 2002&#150;03) the funds for the EPCS block were increased by 4.2 per cent., a real terms increase of 1.7 per cent.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport how many cases of work-related stress have been reported in his Department; how much compensation has been paid to employees; how many work days have been lost due to work-related stress, and at what cost; what procedures have been put in place to reduce work-related stress, and at what cost, in each of the last three years; and if he will make a statement.

 My Department's independent staff counselling service report that over the past year they have dealt in confidence with three work-related stress cases. Details for the previous two years are not available. No compensation has been paid out over the past three years. While levels of sick absence are closely monitored, we do not have records to identify which absences through stress are work-related; therefore the cost similarly cannot be identified. However, my Department is committed to meeting the targets for reducing the number of working days lost generally due to work related injuries and illness in line with the Government's Revitalising Health and Safety initiative. To this end my Department introduced a new stress management policy last year providing staff and managers with guidance on identifying and managing stress more effectively, and this month we are launching a dedicated Health and Well-Being intranet site for all staff. A full review of work-life balance polices has also been conducted recently. The costs involved in these initiatives are not available.

[35899]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w21.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The results of working hours surveys conducted in my Department, including the Royal Parks Agency, indicate that there are occasions where a small number of senior staff are working voluntarily in excess of 48 hours per week. However, no staff are doing so on a regular basis save for a group of horticultural staff in the royal parks who are on all hours worked contracts and have signed an "opt out" agreement. The actual hours worked by staff in different parts of the Department are monitored regularly against conditioned working hours to identify any developing trends and/or potential problem areas. Where these arise, divisional business plans and work demands may be adjusted, and individual staff offered time management training. My Department has also conducted a review of personnel policies with the aim of achieving a better work-life balance for all staff. This review took account of the results of the working hours surveys and of responses to work-life balance questions posed in last year's annual staff attitude survey.

 Sport England does not apply any minimum usage levels in considering whether to award lottery funding to sports projects. Each application is judged on the merits of the particular case, taking into account, among other things, value for money and the need for the facility in question whether it is in a rural or urban area.

The funding criteria can be found in HEFCE publication 01/52&#151;Higher Education Students Early Statistics Survey, and include, for example, that the course is open to any suitably qualified candidate and there is no duplication of HEFCE funding from any other public source.

This is in addition to the legal remedies that exist for dealing with harassment and violence. The Department has provided &#163;178 million in 2001&#150;02 to schools and local education authorities to help support measures to tackle poor pupil behaviour. This funding backs up the guidance in Circular 10/99 "Social Inclusion: Pupil Support".

It sends a strong positive signal to investors and businessman in Britain about market liberalisation and investment opportunities in Romania. The UK has strong interest in steps that help towards the reconstruction of the Romanian economy and towards its membership of the European Union. Privatisation of its steel industry through the sale of Sidex is an important element in its economic reform which will help to establish a level playing field between EU and Romanian steel producers and should lead to a reduction in levels of state subsidies which disadvantage UK steel producers. the privatisation did not threaten British jobs.

<a name="20214w27.html_para4">No central records are kept detailing the reason for late payment of each individual invoice. This information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.
<P>

<a name="20214w27.html_para5">This was the first year that LCD and CS have been in a position to report against all invoices paid rather than the practice in previous years of reporting against a sample of 1,200. A number of steps have been taken subsequently to improve payment performance. Following a successful pilot of the Government Procurement Card plans are in place to extend its use throughout the CS during 2002 and thereafter to other areas of LCD and its agencies. This will reduce the volume of individual payments and streamline the authorisation and payment process. The purchase order system is being used far more extensively and in new areas of the Department and this should also help to improve performance. There are signs that these changes have already had some impact as monitoring of this year's payments show that performance for LCD and CS has increased to over 96 per cent.
<P>

<a name="20214w27.html_para6">During 2000&#150;01 the PGO experienced major changes which increased greatly their invoice activity. They also introduced steps to ensure payment performance improved. Changes to the finance management team, the purchase ordering process and increased monitoring of payments have reduced the risk of payment delay. Monitoring of the earlier part of 2001&#150;02 showed that performance had increased to 71 per cent. The second half to date shows that 98 per cent. of invoices are paid within agreed credit terms.
<P>

<a name="20214w27.html_para7">The NICS has introduced a number of steps to improve performance. These include establishing a user group to encourage best practice in local offices and increase awareness for staff involved in processing payments. They have also redefined their end of year procedures. Although figures for this financial year (2001&#150;02) show that their performance has decreased slightly to 93.5 per cent. the measures introduced should start making an impact in the financial year 2002&#150;03.

<a name="20214w27.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Wills: </B> 
 In order to cater for incidents that may require the attention of a judge, including applications for urgent possession orders, out of normal office hours, on bank holidays and other holiday periods, the Court Service provides a system known as the Urgent Court Business Scheme. This scheme allows for an experienced member of court staff to be contacted during the night, weekends or public holidays. Every circuit has arrangements in place for handling urgent court business outside normal office hours. Urgent business consists of Injunctions, Children Act applications, and other urgent applications such as Possession order applications. Cover is provided between 4.00 pm and 8.30 pm each weekday, between 4.00 pm on Friday until 8.30 am on Monday for each weekend and from 4.00 pm on the last day preceding a public or privilege holiday that the court is open until 8.30 am on the day the court is next open. There will always be a judge available in each UCBO area to deal with urgent court business. In the vast majority of cases the judge will deal with matters over the telephone. Only in the most extreme case should the judge have to meet with the applicant's solicitor. Where this is unavoidable the venue will be arranged by the UCBO in consultation with the judge and the solicitor involved.

 We are keen to do all we can to protect the public, especially children, from sex offenders. Sex offenders whose offences were committed overseas and who act in a way that gives the police reason to believe they pose a risk to the public can be made subject to a sex offender order, which will require them to comply with the requirements of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 (the register) and can impose restrictions on their behaviour. They can also be the subject of a Multi-Agency Public Protection Panel which will form a plan to manage the risks they pose.
<P>

<a name="20214w28.html_para2">We were aware of this issue when we announced the review of Part I of the Sex Offenders Act 1997 and it was discussed with relevant agencies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) during the review.
<P>

<a name="20214w28.html_para3">That discussion is reflected in the consultation paper, which was published in July 2001. The review concluded there is no mechanism by which offenders convicted overseas could reliably be made aware of a duty to register with the police when coming to the United Kingdom. the review therefore proposes that where the police become aware of the arrival or presence in the United Kingdom of a sex offender convicted overseas of offences equivalent to those in the United Kingdom that trigger registration, they should be able to apply to the courts for an Order to Register as a Sex Offender. We are currently analysing responses to the review.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and I met most recently with representatives of the Prison Officers Association (POA) on Thursday 7 February 2002 to discuss the recommendations of the Prison Service Pay Review Body and the Government's response to it.




<P>
<P><I>14 Feb 2002 : Column 626W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20214w29.html_para5">The Home Secretary explained that, while the 6 per cent. recommended was not affordable in full from 1 January 2002 without severe implications for Prison Service regimes, he had none the less wanted to respond to the recommendations positively in a way that recognised the value of the staff in the remit group.
<P>

<a name="20214w29.html_para6">To this end, he had implemented the awards in full within the period covered by the recommendations. In staging the 6 per cent, he had front-loaded the first stage from 1 January 2002 to ensure an immediate pay rise commensurate with that awarded to other public sector groups for the year. In addition, prison officers would receive the further 2.5 per cent. in January 2003. Finally the locality payments for officers in London and south-east, the areas most hard pressed by recruitment and retention problems, would increase by the full 6 per cent. from 1 January 2002.

 A payment of &#163;150,000 from the Criminal Justice System Reserve for 2001&#150;02 has been approved as a contribution to the continuing costs of the C-Far "Life Change" programme and will be paid before the end of March. C-Far have also made an application for a further &#163;1.9 million from the Criminal Justice System Reserve in 2002&#150;03. A decision on this application has been deferred pending receipt of an interim evaluation report from C-Far and resolution of outstanding concerns regarding a full, independent assessment of the programme's effectiveness in reducing re-offending. The national probation service and the Prison Service jointly have set aside &#163;20,000 to assist with the cost of such an independent evaluation.

 A survey of mental ill health in the prison population of England and Wales, undertaken in 1997 by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), showed that some 10 per cent. of remanded men, 7 per cent. of sentenced men and 14 per cent. of all women prisoners had suffered from a functional psychosis in the past year. Applying these rates to the current population would indicate that, on any one day, there would be around 5,300 prisoners in custody who would have suffered from symptoms of a functional psychosis in the previous year.
<P>

<a name="20214w30.html_para0">The ONS survey also reported that only one in 10 prisoners or fewer showed no evidence of any of the five disorders considered in the survey (personality disorder, psychosis, neurosis, alcohol misuse, and drug

Pensioners claiming retirement pension by post are sent a MIG leaflet.

<P>
<P>

 No such cases have been reported in my Department. My Department recognises that it is obliged by law to provide a safe working environment for employees.

employees are working in excess of 48 hours per week; what steps he is taking to reduce this number; and if he will make a statement.  [35884]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Robin Cook: </B> 
 In my Department, the working time directive has implications chiefly for employees working directly in support of Ministers. Six private office staff have signed agreements enabling them to work in excess or 48 hours per week; this compares with 14 such staff a year ago. I have recently restructured my office so as to increase the level of clerical support, and this has reduced somewhat the average number of hours worked by private secretaries. Much long hours' working arises from the need to provide support for me in my responsibilities as Leader of the House. Any decision by the House to reform its own working arrangements would be likely to have a positive impact on the working hours of the staff concerned. The working arrangements in my office and in my Department generally are constantly under review. My Department is committed to keeping long hours working to an absolute minimum commensurate with operational needs, and to promoting a proper work/life balance for its employees.

The measures implemented to support the safety of staff and improved customer service as a result of the risk assessments include: closed circuit television; better management in each office to avoid difficult situations building up, for example floor managers to greet customers and guide them through their visit; where recommended by risk assessments, security guards with clear instructions as to when to intervene; in each pathfinder area screened facilities to deal with situations likely to give rise to particular risk; a clear zero tolerance policy under which determined action will be taken against anyone threatening or abusing Jobcentre Plus staff.

 As I explained in my reply to my hon. Member of 11 January 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 1045W, women from ethnic minorities can benefit from the range of new deals and other welfare to work initiatives that we have introduced. These initiatives, such as working families tax credit, the national minimum wage and the national child care strategy, help people overcome the barriers to employment and to make work pay. In April this year, we are also introducing a new service in five areas of the country to reach out to people from ethnic minorities who are at a disadvantage in the labour market. The outreach service will explore different ways jobless people from ethnic minority communities can be helped&#151;from attracting people in to mainstream services like new deal to improving links to employers or providing specialist training where appropriate. We are investing &#163;15 million in this new service.

 The Department does not make forecasts of the future level of employment. However, despite uncertainty about the prospects for the world economy, the UK labour market is still performing well. The number of people in work in London remains at a high level and has increased by 240,000 since 1997, and is up by 75,000 over the last year.
<P>

<a name="20214w33.html_para2">Though unemployment in the capital has increased over the year, this is because the number of people in London's labour force has increased by more than the rise of employment.

 We recognise the importance of the role of self-employment in the economy and helping unemployed people set up their own businesses is a key feature of our welfare to work initiatives. Eligible unemployed jobseekers can receive help entering self- employment through the new deals or through the Work-Based Learning for Adults (WBLA) programme. This help is available in all parts of the country, including Middlesbrough, South and Cleveland, East.

 On 1 February we received a letter from my right hon.

This is an aspect of devolution that is likely to be looked at by the independent foot and mouth disease inquiries.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what scientific evidence she has evaluated that the feeding habits of <i>(a)</i> grey seals, <i>(b)</i> common seals and <i>(c)</i> dolphins are likely to have a significant detrimental effect on the fish stocks in the waters around England and Wales;  [32598]

[32599]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w34.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 1985 diet data indicate that grey seals require about 5,500Kcals of energy per day, equivalent to about 7kg of cod or 4kg of sandeels (the difference being due to the oil content of the fish). Diet composition varies seasonally and by area, but is mostly sandeels, gadoids (predominantly cod) and flatfish. The same is true for common seals whose daily dietary requirement is less, at around 3,000 Kcals. However, most of the fish consumed are likely to have been juveniles and, given the high rates of natural mortality for these species, there is no guarantee that had they not been caught they would have survived to reach a size at which they would have been available to commercial fishermen.
<P>

<a name="20214w34.html_para9">Equivalent information is not available for dolphins.
<P>

<a name="20214w34.html_para10">The Natural Environment Research Council's Special Committee on Seals has advised that populations in England and Wales are still below the levels which preceded the outbreak of the phocine distemper virus in 1988 and that on that basis and the lack of clear scientific evidence seals are having a major impact on commercial fish stocks, there is no justification for a cull.

 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2002]:</i> The recent Policy Commission report on the future of farming and food recommended that a comprehensive animal health strategy be devised and implemented. In addition, the on-going inquiries into the foot and mouth epidemic may affect our approach to animal health. The Government will consider the recommendations of these inquiries to determine whether the existing strategy, as described in the CVO's annual reports, should be amended.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w35.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Monitoring of the site since May 2001 has demonstrated that degradation of carcases is under way. The great majority of the fluids from the degradation (the leachate) is abstracted and taken to a treatment facility for processing (Minworth water reclamation works). To reduce the risk of unacceptable migration of the small remaining amounts of leachate, a low permeability barrier has been constructed within the ground.
<P>

<a name="20214w35.html_para2">Intense monitoring of surface water, ground water, and ground gas is being carried out under the supervision of the Environment Agency. Migration through the ground of the remnant degradation by-products is proceeding at an environmentally acceptable rate. All results are currently within environmentally acceptable limits. The Department will continue to manage, monitor and carry out remedial measures on the site for as long as is necessary, all under the oversight of the Environment Agency.

<a name="20214w35.html_para6"><i>Guidelines for the Countryside Access Recovery Fund</i>
<P>

<a name="20214w35.html_para7">(1) Grants from the fund will be available to support approved projects developed by not-for-profit organisations concerned with promoting countryside access and/or understanding of the English countryside and will be subject to the criteria set out as follows:
<P>

<a name="20214w35.html_para8">(2) The package of support for an individual organisation or project will vary from case to case. The fund will be used for direct support to expenditure by not-for-profit organisations on: (i) improvements and renovations or provision of new buildings or other infrastructure to help secure, expand or enhance the activity of the organisation related to the promotion of access to or understanding of the countryside; (ii) advice and consultancy to help them adjust and plan their recovery; and (iii) activities to promote access to, and understanding of the countryside.
<P>

<a name="20214w35.html_para9">(3) Before direct support is provided to an individual not-for-profit organisation they must satisfy the Countryside Agency that: (i) the financial position of the organisation has been substantially adversely affected by the incidence of FMD and/or the measures taken to control it; (ii) the organisation has taken all reasonable action to mitigate the impact (including claiming rate relief and tax, VAT and NIC deferral where eligible), and where appropriate has drawn on other sources of support (including contributions from the private sector, appeals to members etc.); (iii) the organisation would be financially viable apart from the effect of FMD, and expects to return to its normal level of income by 31 December 2002.
<P>

<a name="20214w35.html_para10">(4) Grants will normally cover a maximum of 60 per cent. of the project cost. Applications for grants must be received by 30 April 2002 and the grant will be payable on proof of expenditure.
<P>

<a name="20214w35.html_para11">(5) The scheme will be administered by the Countryside Agency. Potential applicants should contact the Countryside Agency (01242 533237) for a preliminary discussion.
<P>

<a name="20214w35.html_para12">Fuller guidance for prospective applicants will be available from the Countryside Agency. If eligible applications exceed available resources, regard will be had to how far applications meet the criteria and how effectively they would promote the objectives of the fund.
<P>

<a name="20214w35.html_para13">Organisations will not have their costs of applying to the fund paid for by the Department, but the overhead costs of projects may be included.

 <i>[holding answer 8 February 2002]:</i> We have made a significant amount of money available to assist farmers to convert to organic production and will continue to do so. In April 1999 we introduced the Organic Farming Scheme offering greatly increased rates of aid compared to the previous scheme. Since then the area of land under organic management in England has risen from 0.6 per cent. to 1.7 per cent. of agricultural land. And we have budgeted expenditure of &#163;140 million over the lifetime of the England Rural Development Programme, which should triple the area under organic management by 2006; however, the Government do not have any plans to set a specific target for proportion of land to be farmed organically. The development of the UK organic sector will be carried forward in the context of an organic food and farming action plan once the recommendations of the Policy Commission on the future of Farming and Food have been taken into account.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2002]:</i> It is in the public interest for grant payments under the fishing vessel decommissioning scheme to be co-financed by EU funds, and we will therefore draw on the available EU finance. Under the Community requirements the EU contribution for vessels which under the scheme are Cornish must be set against the total allocation of EU funds for the Cornish Objective 1 fisheries programme for the 2000&#150;06 period. this arrangement was agreed by the Objective 1 programme monitoring committee for the decommissioning scheme.
<P>

<a name="20214w36.html_para2">This process does not reduce the availability of the &#163;5 million funds which we have made available for fisheries for the period 2001&#150;02 to 2003&#150;04 under the Cornish programme. Only &#163;1 million of this provision has so far been committed through projects approved by the Objective 1 Working Group. I welcome the work being undertaken by the fisheries task force to develop a strategy for future expenditure in Cornwall.

 We will not be able to assess accurately the impact of the diversion of resources to deal with the foot and mouth disease emergency on the spread of TB until the backlog of tests has been cleared. As clearance of the backlog and routine testing is being prioritised according to veterinary risk assessment, the early results are from those premises considered most likely to be affected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what steps she has taken to speed up the bovine tuberculosis testing programme since the lifting of foot and mouth disease control restrictions; and if she will calculate the number of personnel employed by her Department in executing the bovine TB testing programme.  [35535]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w37.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Following the foot and mouth emergency we are re-directing resources to the research and control strategy to tackle TB in cattle including the testing programme. To date over 5,800 working hours have been recorded on the testing programme in December 2001. Some 90 per cent. of this comprised work by administrative staff and the remainder by veterinary professionals.
<P>

<a name="20214w37.html_para0">As at 1 January 2002 the complement of permanent veterinary staff of the State Veterinary Service tasked with undertaking, among other matters, the bovine TB testing programme was 218 veterinary officers and 24 divisional veterinary managers. In addition to permanent veterinary staff we are also employing temporary veterinary inspectors. Currently there are 340 in post carrying out similar functions to veterinary officers including work on testing as part of the TB control strategy. Primarily local veterinary inspectors from private practice undertake the actual testing on farms. There are nearly 4,000 approved who will spend a varying proportion of their time carrying out testing on our behalf.

 The data in the list were collected as part of the Countryside Agency's regular Rural Services Survey and used to prepare the Rural White Paper headline indicator of community vibrancy. The list arose from the need to answer a parliamentary question from the hon. Member for South-East Cornwall (Mr. Breed) on 21 November 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 320W on rural parishes. No other use of the list is intended. Preparation of the list in the format requested is estimated to have cost two days of staff time.

 The former DETR asked the Countryside Agency to develop an indicator of community vibrancy for inclusion in the Rural White Paper with a view to measuring agreed change over time. It was decided to use measurable factors that could be collected as part of the Countryside Agency's Rural Services Survey but with the expectation that the indicator would develop over time. The information collected and used comprised of contested parish council elections, the presence of a village hall or similar local meeting place, the presence of a public house, and incidence of local traditions and events. Full details are set out in the Countryside Agency's State of the Countryside report 2001 where it was noted that there is a marked relationship between the indicator score and population size. The indicator was reported at the national level.

 <i>[holding answer 12 February 2002]:</i> Due to confidentiality I am not able to release the names of the individuals that have been seconded to the Department. Two members of staff have been seconded from the private sector, one from July to December 1999, the other from September 2001 to May 2002. Both were seconded from the BBC at approximately grade seven level and paid by the BBC.

<a name="20214w39.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 We have set up the Carbon Trust to promote business and public sector energy efficiency and the take-up of low carbon technology. We will be consulting on a CHP strategy shortly to promote this highly energy efficient technology. The climate change levy, and its associated climate change agreements, are also an important spur to business energy efficiency. But there remains a great unrealised potential for energy efficiency and the Department will be considering strategies to further enhance its role in the future.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, pursuant to her answer to the hon. Member for Wirral, South (Mr. Chapman) on 5 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, column 905W, whether she can update the House on the measures her Department has taken to trace the offspring of BSE cases.  [37486]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w39.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As a result of further checks, it has now become clear that two more offspring of BSE cases have been sold for human consumption, one in December and one in January. Some meat from the latter has been prevented from going into the food chain. These cases are being investigated. Measures are being taken to tighten up procedure and we are considering taking legal action.
<P>

<a name="20214w39.html_para0">Passports thought to have been held by officials outside animal health divisional offices were in fact returned to owners, enabling the animals to be sold despite the fact restriction notices were properly served on the owners, informing them the animals were not to be sold for human consumption. Consumer protection is provided by the over-30-month rule, the removal of specified risk material and the ban on the feeding of mammalian meat and bone meal to all farm livestock. These measures were applied in these cases.

<a name="20214w39.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government have been consistent in their view that a trade in meat is preferable to the long distance transport of animals for slaughter. It is a matter that will be considered when the European Commission produces its proposals to update and improve the current EU rules on animal welfare during transport. The Government have no powers to introduce a ban on this trade. Judgments by the European Court of Justice have made it quite clear that such a ban would be illegal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how she intends to implement Commission Decision 2000/68 on horse passports and to ensure that the new system meets the needs of the horse industry.  [37280]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w39.html_spnew5"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 We have carefully considered the responses to the consultation exercise carried out on the implementation of Commission Decision 2000/68. Taking account of these views and the need to comply with the terms of the Decision the Government have decided that by 31 December 2003 all horses and ponies must have passports. The Government also intend to introduce a unique identification number for all horses and ponies.
<P>

<a name="20214w39.html_para1">Owners and keepers of horses and ponies which are not currently registered will be required to register these animals with one of the appropriate approved equine organisations. The owners of these animals and the owners of registered horses and ponies which currently do not have passports, will be required to obtain passports from the approved organisations. We will require that owners of horses and ponies which currently have passports be issued with the new extended passport containing details of veterinary medicines administered.
<P>

<a name="20214w39.html_para2">Discussions are now taking place with industry organisations about detailed implementation arrangements.
<P>

<a name="20214w39.html_para3">The Government also consider that it is vital to establish a central database of basic information on horses which could be used for disease control and other purposes and will establish the necessary arrangements following discussion with the horse industry in order to achieve this end with a minimum of bureaucracy and at minimum costs.

 <i>[holding answer 19 November 2001]:</i> In order to be appointed to a consultant post in the national health service, a doctor has to have his or her name included on the specialist register. This register lists the names of those doctors who hold the United Kingdom Certificate of Completion of Specialist Training (CCST) or, for doctors trained overseas, enter the UK already possessing qualifications considered by the specialist training authority of the medical royal colleges (STA) to be equivalent to a CCST. There is no provision, in law, for doctors with specialist medical training, but no formal qualification, to enter the register. Similarly, there is no provision for doctors wishing to 'top-up' their specialist training to the required standard by undertaking further training in the UK then to enter the specialist register.
<P>

<a name="20214w40.html_para2">We wish to amend these provisions to provide a route to the specialist register through an 'equivalence of training' provision. A doctor would be assessed by the STA to evaluate whether the sum of his or her training and qualifications, wherever obtained, is equivalent to a CCST in his or her specialty in the UK. This will provide a direct, assessed route to the specialist register while ensuring that standards do not slip and that patient safety is not compromised.
<P>

<a name="20214w40.html_para3">Our aim, subject to consultation and parliamentary approval, is to have the amended legislation in place by summer 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w40.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 An overseas provider treating a national health service patient pursuant to a contract with an NHS commissioning body will clearly be potentially liable to the patient for any medical negligence. However, although the law is not fully developed in this area, English courts may decide that the NHS body commissioning that treatment was also potentially liable. Commissioners therefore need to seek appropriate indemnities against any claims from foreign providers.

 Statistics collected by St. George's Medical School show that there were 65 deaths in 1995; 79 in deaths in 1997; 70 deaths in 1998; and 73 deaths in 1999 in the United Kingdom associated with volatile substance abuse (VSA). Deaths in 1999 were less than half the number recorded at their peak in 1990. We take any deaths associated with VSA very seriously and are committed to continuing action to address this problem.
<P>

<a name="20214w41.html_para0">It is particularly important that young people should know about the dangers of abusing volatile substances. We are supporting a programme that will enable general practitioners and other health care professionals to assist teachers in communicating health messages about the dangers of drugs and other solvents. Other measures to address this issue include a campaign to inform retailers about the risks of volatile substance abuse, and their responsibilities under the law. The Department is also working with voluntary organisations to develop training packages for professionals working with young people at risk of abusing volatile substances.

Secondments and attachments are part of the interchange initiative, which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the civil service and other organisations. All sectors of the economy are involved: voluntary, education, health, public and private.

When it became clear that the staff at the Whittington had responded to these stories by writing to that newspaper, the Department's press office asked for a copy of their letter.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20214w42.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Blears </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 6 February 2002]:</i> Expenditure per weighted head cannot be reliably compared between different health authorities and primary care trusts. Somerset health authority had no primary care trusts in 2000&#150;01 and Dorset health authority had four primary care trusts.
<P>

<a name="20214w42.html_para5">In many health authorities there are factors which distort the expenditure per head. These include: the health authority acting in a lead capacity to commission health care or fund training on behalf of other health bodies; asset revaluations in national health service trusts being funded through health authorities; and some double counting of expenditure between health authorities and primary care trusts within the health authority area.
<P>

<a name="20214w42.html_para6">In the case of Dorset and Somerset health authorities, all the above factors occur which distort the expenditure per weighted head of population.
<P>

<a name="20214w42.html_para7">Allocations per weighted head of population provide a much more reliable measure to identify differences between funding of health authorities.
<P>

<a name="20214w42.html_para8">Health authorities and primary care trusts should account for their expenditure on a gross basis. This results in a considerable element of double counting in Dorset where the health authority acts as the main commissioner and is then reimbursed by the primary care trusts. The effect of this double counting cannot be identified exactly from the accounts.
