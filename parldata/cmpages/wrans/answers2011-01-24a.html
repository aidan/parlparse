 There are several reasons why the in-year reallocation of unused quota is not currently undertaken, eg quota holders may be retaining their quota to fish later in the year, or to use as swap currency to acquire different quota. The prospect of such reallocation can encourage a race to fish, which could mean that fish is targeted out of season, thus increasing effort and discards of other stocks. Such reallocation may also impact on prices due to a surplus of fish on the market. Furthermore, there is also a risk of 'ghost' fishing in order to secure ongoing access and prevent reallocation-something that is difficult to enforce against.</p>

I am committed to reform of the fisheries management arrangements, and a consultation is due to be launched in the spring, including a further look at the issue of quota uptake and distribution. In the meantime, discussions continue with producer organisations to consider what support they can offer the under-10 metre fleet in the short-term.</p>

 The Government's approach to broadband is to drive the rollout of superfast broadband to as much of the country as possible and to deliver at least a decent level of broadband access to virtually everybody as part of that commitment. That approach is underpinned by the work that BDUK conducted over summer 2010 examining the choice of cost effective solutions available to provide a minimum level of coverage to all premises without access to at least 2 MBps. Among the conclusions of that exercise was that a universal service commitment should not be seen as separate from the superfast broadband objective, but rather an integral part of pushing next generation networks deep into rural Britain. The £530 million allocated to support broadband rollout up to 2015 will help the UK achieve its aim of having the best superfast broadband network in Europe by 2015.</p>

We talk regularly to the US Government in Washington and Seoul on North Korea.

All parties in the region have a strong interest in this and we have made clear that we would consider any request to provide practical assistance.</p>

 The Academies Act 2010 provides minimal prescription in legislation in order to provide autonomy and freedom to schools who gain academy status. All academies are however required by their funding agreements to make provision for the teaching of religious education. It is an academy's funding agreement that has, since the inception of the programme, been used as a mechanism to uphold the core principles that an academy must agree to follow and there are no plans to change this.</p>

 Religious education RE is a statutory part of the basic curriculum of maintained schools in England, but not a part of the National Curriculum. This means that there are no statutory national programmes of study, attainment targets or assessment arrangements. However, the locally agreed syllabus, which is designed by Standing Advisory Councils on Religious Education SACRE and adopted by the local authority, is statutory, and that means that local authorities must provide such a syllabus and that maintained schools must follow it. Schools with a religious character can either follow the locally agreed syllabus, or use a syllabus which has been agreed by their governing body. It is the responsibility of the head teacher, governors and local authorities (LAs) to make the necessary provisions for RE in all maintained schools.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_69"><a name="110124w0002.htm_para3"><a name="11012419000519">Since its establishment, the SSSNB has not submitted any agreements to the Secretary of State who has now withdrawn the matters that had been referred to the SSSNB by the previous Secretary of State. Because of this, the process used to determine the pay and conditions of school support staff remains unchanged and these will continue to be determined at a local level. Employers are, of course, under an obligation to ensure that any pay and grading structure that they put in place complies fully with the requirements of equality legislation.</p>

 While some school sport partnerships have helped schools to raise participation rates in areas targeted by the previous Government, they have also locked schools into a rigid network while forcing them to report on progress which impedes schools' ability to promote sport. The Government are also concerned that, despite this heavy focus on targets, the proportion of pupils playing competitive sport regularly has remained disappointingly low. Only around two in every five pupils play competitive sport regularly within their own school, and only one in five plays regularly against other schools.</p>

A big society bank is currently being developed to help social enterprises, charities and voluntary organisations to access more resources.

For all other claimants, the key factor determining entry to the process is whether a quick, fair and sustainable decision can be taken on the case.</p>

However, if on a case by case basis, any claimants from these groups are identified as having a claim of particular complexity, the general consideration referred to previously regarding amenability to a quick, fair and sustainable decision will apply.</p>

 Ofgem is required by the Government to produce quarterly price reports that examine the relationship between wholesale energy costs and standard tariff energy bills for a typical customer. The latest report published in November 2010 showed large increases in supplier margins, due to recent increases in retail prices. We are disappointed on behalf of consumers by this development and welcome the announcement of Ofgem's review of the retail market. Ofgem will report on this review in March of this year.

 The UK has an open and competitive market for heating oil. In contrast to gas and electricity markets, the heating oil market is not regulated by Ofgem. This is because Ofgem was set up to regulate the natural monopolies for gas and electricity distribution.

 There are no exemptions to delivering high standards of privacy and dignity. The national health service is expected to eliminate mixed-sex accommodation, except where it is "in the overall best interests of the patient, or reflects patient choice". However, same sex requirements allow sufficient flexibility to provide scope for specialist facilities for children and young people, where patients may choose to share facilities on the basis of age and diagnosis, rather than gender. In this context, the choice has to be a genuine one-not influenced by background factors such as staff convenience, the poor state of buildings or lack of facilities. If the child would prefer to be nursed in proximity to members of the same sex, then this preference should where possible be accommodated.</p>

It is the mechanism through which the two health Departments address the principle that neither commissioners nor patients should be disadvantaged by differences in health commissioning or provision processes between the two countries.

It would then continue on the surface, using the existing North London line through Camden Road station and on to the existing HS1 connection. Detailed design for the hybrid Bill would confirm the extent of the alterations, but at this stage we do not expect that any land outside the existing railway boundary would be required.</p>

 The Department for Transport has used the National Transport Model (NTM) to estimate that in 2035 there will be 210 million passenger trips per weekday on average by surface modes (including road and rail, but excluding freight), in Great Britain. Of these, 4.2 million are expected to be over 50 miles long, and 1.5 million trips over 100 miles long.</p>

However, this is not comparable to the preceding NTM figures. This is because HS2 Ltd's model of 'long distance' travel is based on a subset of trips which differs from the national set used in the NTM, and its 'long distance' trips include some that are less than 50 miles long. This different dataset was chosen by HS2 Ltd to enable effective and efficient modelling of the likely impacts of HS2.</p>

 APD is an excise duty that is levied on aircraft operators, not individual passengers. It is the airline which is responsible for paying the tax to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC). Although they are not required to do so by law, generally airlines pass on the duty charge to their passengers by way of a separately identified charge in the ticket price, which may also include other elements such as passenger service charges, insurance surcharges or tax imposed by other governments. Since any additional charges applied at the discretion of the airline are outside the remit of HMRC, no estimates of their value are available.</p>

 The controlled foreign companies (CFC) rules have been subject to challenge in both the European and UK courts regarding their compatibility with EC law. In 2009 the Court of Appeal found in HMRC's favour in a case brought by Vodafone. This did not determine any liability, but it allowed HMRC to open discussion with Vodafone and other customers about how the rules actually applied in practice.</p>

 Given the interaction of tax credit measures with other benefits, it is the overall impact of measures that is important for a household. At the June Budget and the spending review, this Government have taken the unprecedented step of publishing detailed distributional analysis of the impacts of its decisions for the first time (see for instance charts B.4 and B.5 in Annex B of the 'Spending Review 2010' document).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_417"><a name="110124w0005.htm_para35"><a name="11012432000308">This analysis shows that, when Budget and spending review measures are taken together, it is clear that the top decile contributes the most to the fiscal consolidation, both in absolute terms and as a percentage of net income.</p>
