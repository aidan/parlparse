<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what representations he has received from and discussions he has had with financiers and industry on the plans for a new airport at Cliffe.  [118106]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Ministers have not held any discussions with financiers or industry about the financing of the Cliffe airport option. Chapter 15 of The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom (South East) consultation document discusses how any major new airport capacity, including Cliffe, could be funded and invites views.
<P>

<a name="30611w01.html_para0">Since publication of the consultation document in July last year, many thousands of responses to the consultation have been received from a wide range of interested parties, and we expect many more before the consultation ends on 30 June.
<P>

<a name="30611w01.html_para1">All responses will be considered and analysed carefully before final decisions are taken. These will be set out in an air transport White Paper, which we plan to publish towards the end of the year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_wqn1"><B> Hugh Bayley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what advice he gave to British Airways in May 2003 about the safety of flying to Kenya; when he expects the company to be able to resume its flights to Kenya; and if he will make a statement.  [118288]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 On 15 May 2003, the Department advised all UK airlines that the threat level to UK civil aviation interests in Kenya was such that all UK airline operations to and from the country must be suspended. The position is being kept under active review and there is close liaison with the Kenyan authorities. It is not yet possible to say when conditions will allow flights to resume.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what steps he is taking to ensure that all pensioners have equal access to free travel across the UK.  [117860]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My answer of 23 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 508&#150;09W, states that we have no plans to ensure that pensioners have equal access to free travel across the UK. In England it is for local authorities to decide whether to offer free travel in their area and a number have done that.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on his plans for spending on rail improvements, including the Rail Passenger Partnership, in 2003&#150;04 and beyond by the Strategic Rail Authority.  [118105]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Strategic Rail Authority's (SRA) revised Strategic Plan, published on 30 January 2003, contains a full analysis of the budgetary position, investment priorities for the short and medium-terms, as well as the SRA's long-term objectives for the rail network.
<P>

<a name="30611w01.html_para2">The SRA's Rail Passenger Partnership (RPP) programme has been temporarily suspended because of current budgetary constraints. The Authority does not intend to terminate the RPP scheme, but for the present the focus will be on seeing through existing commitments and approvals. For the duration of the 2003&#150;04 financial year, they will continue to allocate funds (&#163;20 million) already set aside for RPP grants.
<P>

<a name="30611w01.html_para3">Copies of the Strategic Plan are available from the House Library.

<a name="30611w01.html_sbhd4"><H3 align=center>Transport Investment</H3>


<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the level of Government investment on transport each year since 1997, and his proposals for future years under the 10-Year-Plan; what was planned to spend each year; and how much was spent in each year.  [118103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Capital spending by the Department for Transport (and its predecessors' spending on transport) for each year since 1998&#150;99 is set out in Table A3 of the Department's Annual Report for 2003 (Cm 5907). Comparable figures for earlier years are not available owing to the introduction of resource accounting and budgeting.
<P>

<a name="30611w01.html_para4">Table A3 also sets out capital spending plans for 2003&#150;04 to 2005&#150;06. Spending plans for later years under the 10-Year-Plan are set out in Table A1.1 of "Delivering Better Transport: Progress Report", published by the Department in December 2002.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_wqn5"><B> Matthew Taylor: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many unlicensed vehicles there have been on roads in Britain in 2002.  [117851]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The most recent survey of Vehicle Excise Duty evasion, covering 2002 and published in March 2003, estimated that some 1.75 million vehicles were unlicensed in Great Britain, against approximately 30 million licensed vehicles.

<P>

 The results of the Spending Review announced in July 2002 provided funds to departments as set out in "Opportunity and Security for All: Investing in an Enterprising, Fairer Britain" (Cm 5570). It is a matter for relevant departments how they allocate these funds to advocacy services for those in deprived areas.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer pursuant to his Answer of 22 May 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 882W, on the Capital Modernisation Fund, what payments were made to the contractor; and what outputs were received from the contractor in the period before the contract was terminated.  [118270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_spnew9"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The contractor made a presentation of their findings in February 2002 when it was agreed that the project was not viable at that time. &#163;5,000 + VAT was paid being the agreed proportion of the expenses the contractor had incurred.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Tynan: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer when facilities leased or let for parking a vehicle became subject to differential VAT treatment according to whether they are leased or let alongside other property; what the justification for the differential was; what plans he has to review this differential; what discussions he has had with EU counterparts to review this differential; and 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jun 2003 : Column 857W</I><P>
when he next intends to discuss with EU counterparts an extension of the scope of VAT exemption to remove this differential.  [118242]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w01.html_spnew10"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 EC VAT legislation dictates that the leasing and letting of residential property by private landlords is exempt from VAT. However, the letting of parking facilities is specifically excluded from this exemption and is consequently taxed at the standard rate of VAT. In 1989, the European Court of Justice examined the VAT treatment of parking facilities supplied together with residential property by the same landlord to the same tenant. They ruled that this was a single supply of services, and that the whole supply should be exempt from VAT. All member states were therefore required to comply with this ruling and exempt the supply of parking facilities in these specific circumstances. Under the long-standing formal agreements which govern the EC VAT regime, no member state is permitted unilaterally to extend this exemption to the separate supply of parking facilities.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 CAT standards are designed to identify a range of straightforward savings and mortgage products that are simple, clear and fair so that savers and borrowers should feel confident about choosing them. But the promotion of products is ordinarily a matter for individual firms.
<P>

<a name="30611w02.html_para0">Nevertheless, the Government and the FSA make appropriate references to CAT standards whenever they can. For example, the FSA explain CAT standards in their ISA and mortgage literature, and show whether an ISA or mortgage meets the standard in the relevant comparative tables to be found on its website.

with hereditary or latent genetic predispositions toward certain conditions are not unfairly discriminated against by insurance companies and other financial service providers.  [118165]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government is committed to working with the industry, patient groups and other stakeholders to formulate and agree a long term policy on the use of genetic information by insurance companies. The Association of British Insurers' Genetic Testing Code of Practice provides that insurance applicants must not be asked to undergo a genetic test in order to obtain insurance. Under a five year moratorium introduced in October 2001, a person can apply for a total of up to &#163;500,000 of life insurance and &#163;300,000 of certain types of health insurance without having to tell the insurer the results of any predictive tests already taken. If insurance above these amounts is required, insurers may only take into account the results of genetic tests which the Government's Genetics and Insurance Committee has decided are reliable and relevant for that type of insurance. The Committee provides independent scrutiny of compliance with the ABI Code of Practice and the moratorium and can consider unresolved complaints from insurance applicants about the way an insurance company has dealt with their application under the moratorium.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w02.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 In common with other sectors of the economy, the UK shipping industry is subject to a range of taxes and duties and benefits from a range of allowances and reliefs, consistent with the Government's desire to maintain a fair and broad-based tax system raising sufficient revenue for investment in our public services while maintaining the international competitiveness of UK businesses. The shipping industry also benefits from special tax reliefs and regimes, which reflect the particular needs and circumstances of the industry.
<P>

<a name="30611w02.html_para8">The Government takes into account the overall tax burden on different sectors when setting tax rates and reviewing tax policies, and holds regular discussions where appropriate with representatives from such sectors, including the shipping industry, to take their views into account when considering policy changes.

The format of the Biennial Meeting (New York, 7&#150;11 July) which will focus on small arms, does not allow for states to make substantive proposals. The aim of the meeting is to gather support for a regionally based process to share understanding on national implementation of export controls of small arms, with the aim of reporting back findings at the 2005 Biennial Meeting. But it will be a useful opportunity to take this work forward with partners within the framework of the UN. The UK is planning a side meeting on 8 July 2003 to discuss working in partnership and ways of exchanging information. Our objective is to strengthen consensus on the need for regulation of small arms transfers. Continuing this work within the framework of the UN is particularly important, and the UK is committed to the process.

 Progress towards a sustainable peace and poverty reduction has been made with the successful conclusion in April of the Inter-Congolese Dialogue and the entering into force of the Global and Inclusive Agreement that sets out the framework for the establishment of a Transitional National Government (TNG). The establishment of the TNG will be a major step forward in the resolution of the wider Great Lakes conflict, creating the basis for reconstruction, economic development and poverty reduction in the DRC. The Congolese parties must now implement fully the commitments they have undertaken and establish without further delay the transitional institutions. The UK is an active member of the international committee supporting this process and we plan to increase our development assistance to the DRC once the TNG is in place.
<P>

<a name="30611w04.html_para4">On the situation in Ituri in the north-east, the fighting must stop and support to armed groups must be discontinued. The French government has agreed to the request from the UN Secretary General to lead an Interim Emergency Multinational Force (IEMF) to stabilise the situation. Given the importance of contributing to this force and of supporting the UN and the DRC peace process, the UK will be participating in the IEMF. This force will come under the direction of the European Union under the European Security and Defence Pact.

<a name="30611w04.html_para5">In 2002&#150;03 DFID provided nearly &#163;11 million in humanitarian assistance to the DRC. Out of this &#163;1 million went through the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs for emergency humanitarian interventions in the DRC including Ituri. We are in regular contact with a number of international NGOs working in Ituri, and we stand ready to respond to their requests for further assistance to address urgent humanitarian needs in the region. A DFID humanitarian adviser has just visited Ituri to assess these urgent needs and we will be making a response to these requests shortly.

 At the G8 summit in Evian the Africa Personal Representatives produced an Implementation Report on the G8 Africa Action Plan. The G8 and African heads of government accepted the report during a two-hour discussion on Africa at the Evian Summit. The European Union and all G8 countries (with the exception of Russia) also produced individual progress reports on their contribution towards implementation of the G8 Africa Action Plan. The G8 will report on progress in achieving the G8 Africa Action Plan again in June 2005, under the UK Presidency.

 DFID has just substantially completed its equal pay audit of staff below the senior civil service, in line with the Government's commitment to review pay systems by April 2003 in response to the Equal Opportunities Commission Task Force "Just Pay" report. So far no significant pay disadvantages have been found but some further analysis is required. Once this further analysis is complete&#151;we hope by August 2003&#151;a copy of the audit will be placed in the Library. No pay audits have been undertaken for DFID's three NDPBs as they have no employees and their members only receive expenses.

 Micro-CHP is potentially a useful technology for delivering domestic energy efficiency and carbon savings. However, the technology is not yet commercially available in the UK. The Government are working closely with the industry to overcome a number of regulatory and technical barriers to bringing the technology to market. An important step towards this will be a major independent and technology-impartial field trial sponsored by the Carbon Trust, through its Low Carbon Innovation Programme (LCIP) in partnership with the Energy Saving Trust. This will commence later this year. I understand the trial is expected to feature a range of technologies and end use applications across the residential and commercial sectors, in order to provide an objective assessment of the benefits that micro CHP can offer.

 The preliminary results of the recent trial of separator grids to reduce cetacean bycatch in the offshore bass fishery demonstrated that a viable means of minimising dolphin bycatch in this fishery can be attained very soon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 22 May 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 893W, on laying hens, whether all Defra-funded research into enriched cages conforms to the EU minimum height of 45cm.  [117664]<P>

<P>
<a name="30611w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 One of the objectives of this research is to evaluate the effect of cage height on bird behaviour, welfare and performance in commercially available furnished cages. The research looks at the effects of cage height on birds kept in furnished cages&#151;with heights set at 38cm and 45cm. This research will help in informing our position on the welfare benefits of furnished or enriched cages.

 I am not aware of representations as such, although this issue was raised by the hon. Member for Meirionnydd Nant Conwy (Mr. Llwyd) in an adjournment debate on underground storage tanks on 7 January 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 54&#150;61WH.
<P>

<a name="30611w08.html_para6">In England and Wales there is a duty under Section 73 of the Public Health Act 1973 for site occupiers to prevent danger, as far as is reasonably necessary, from tanks which have been used to store petroleum spirit. This legislation is enforced by the local Petroleum Licensing Authority (PLA). Where the site occupier cannot be contacted or is unknown, and there is a serious concern for public safety, the PLA can use powers under Section 290 (6) of the Public Health Act 1936 to execute the works at the local authority's expense. The local authority can then seek to recover these costs either through the civil courts or by registering a charge under the Land Registration Act 1988.

 There are 32 nitrate sensitive areas in England where voluntary, compensated agricultural measures were introduced, under the Nitrate Sensitive Areas Scheme, to reduce nitrate concentrations in sources of public drinking water. These were designated in 1994 and 1995. No new areas have been designated since then and the Scheme will close on 30 September 2003.
<P>

<a name="30611w09.html_para6">The EU Nitrates Directive requires all known areas of land draining into nitrate-polluted waters to be designated as nitrate vulnerable zones. In 1996, the Government designated 66 nitrate vulnerable zones covering eight per cent. of England's land area, and in October 2002, designated nitrate vulnerable zones covering an additional 47 per cent. of England's land area. This brings total coverage of England to around 55 per cent. Further details on the location of the nitrate vulnerable zones can be obtained from the Defra NVZ web pages (www.defra.gov.uk/environment/water/quality/nitrate).

 The Department's own figures show that there has been an increase of &#163;10.5 billion in school funding since 1997. This equates to an increase in funding per pupil of &#163;920 in cash terms over the period, and has enabled schools to increase the number of teachers that they employ by 20,000 and the number of support staff by 80,000. Coupled with improvements to school buildings and the rolling out of initiatives such as specialist schools these additional resources have been

correlated with a substantial improvement in pupil achievement. In particular, since 1997 there has been a 5 percentage point increase in the proportion of secondary pupils achieving five or more A*-C GCSEs. Primary school pupils have also benefited with 10 and 14 percentage point improvements in the proportion achieving the expected level in English and Maths at KS2.
<P>

<a name="30611w10.html_para1">Reviews of school management are primarily the responsibility of local education authorities, although an independent view of the competence of management and leadership in each school is an integral part of every Ofsted inspection. The annual report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspector (February 2003) indicates that leadership and management of secondary head teachers and key staff continue to improve, and are now good or better in over eight out 10 schools. We continue to press hard to identify areas where improvement is still needed, using targeted policies and funding to do so.
<P>

<a name="30611w10.html_para2">Building on the new Ofsted framework for inspection, groups of schools in receipt of Leadership Incentive Grant funding have, for example, been required to undertake rigorous self and peer review to identify strengths and weaknesses in key areas contributing to leadership and attainment. These Leadership Collaborates have used this knowledge to agree shared priorities for action in their Collaborative Plans. Where there are weaknesses, funding through the Grant can be used to restructure leadership teams and provide additional support for actions designed to raise attainment and strengthen teaching and learning across the Collaborative. We will be monitoring the impact on pupil attainment over the lifetime of the Grant.

In the Budget 2003 Red Book the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a more comprehensive review of financial support for 16 to 19-year-olds, including the financial incentives for young people, their parents and carers, and the interaction between this support and the case for any new minimum wage for 16 and 17-year-olds.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 I announced the publication of the Government's Open Source Software (OSS) Policy in July last year. It sets out a level playing field for procuring OSS and proprietary solutions based on value for money considerations.
<P>

<a name="30611w12.html_para2">We are raising confidence in and awareness of the use of OSS solutions in Government in a number of ways. Firstly, the publication in September 2002 of the Office of Government Commerce's Guidance on implementing OSS has made advice on procuring OSS solutions available to the public sector procurement community. Secondly, the establishment of the UK Public Sector OSS Special Interest Group (OSS SIG) has helped to share best practice on OSS implementations and build competence in procurement.
<P>

<a name="30611w12.html_para3">Recent research reports supported by Government have also served to increase awareness of OSS solutions: the OGC commissioned case-study based report by QinetiQ provided a documented methodology for approaching OSS case studies in a consistent manner; and the DTI supported report for OpenForum Europe, "Market Perception Analysis of Open Source Software", revealed how business and Government's perceptions of OSS positively changed between 2002 and 2003.
<P>

<a name="30611w12.html_para4">The Office of the e-Envoy and Office of Government Commerce will continue to appropriately support Departments to ensure that OSS solutions are procured where they demonstrate best value for money.

 The latest assessment was made in June 2002 by the UK Advisory Group on Nanotechnology Applications led by Dr. John Taylor, Director-General of the Research Councils, and is contained in his report to my noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Science and Innovation titled "New Dimensions for Manufacturing&#151;A UK Strategy for Nanotechnology'". The report concluded that it is too soon to produce reliable figures for the global market for nanotechnology. It is simply too early to say where markets and applications will come, and when. So it is important to treat all numbers with caution. However, existing forecasts do hint at the growth that we can expect. Various separate predictions when taken together point to the expectation of a rapid take off in the latter part of the decade.

 I am pleased to inform the hon. Member that the Government has today commissioned the Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering to undertake an important new study in this area.
<P>

<a name="30611w12.html_para8">Nanotechnologies could provide immense benefits for all of us. But Government also recognises that there are public concerns. The debate risks confusion. We need to understand first what we mean by nanotechnologies, and then to establish whether there are aspects which should concern us. And if so, we need to look at how well these activities are regulated or whether further regulation is required. The study we are commissioning is intended to help answer these questions. Our approach underlines the Government's desire to acknowledge uncertainties openly and to engage with the public and stakeholders, and reflects our response to recommendations by the Better Regulation Task Force in its report 'Scientific Research: Innovation with Controls', published in January this year. The Task Force's report and the Government response can be found on the BRTF website at http://www.brtf.gov.uk/taskforce/pastreports.htm
<P>

<a name="30611w12.html_para9">The Royal Society and the Royal Academy of Engineering will solicit widely for input among stakeholders&#151;including the academic community, relevant industry, policy makers, regulatory bodies, NGOs, other special interest groups and the general public. The work will begin with an open call to the various stakeholders to register their interests and key concerns. Formal evidence sessions will then be held with the key stakeholders to explore their views in more detail.
<P>

<a name="30611w12.html_para10">The study will be overseen by a working group chaired by Ann Dowling, Professor of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Cambridge. Membership of the working group has yet to be finalised but will include those with an understanding of ethical, social and regulatory issues, as well as scientists and engineers. The working group will reflect the range of disciplines and views associated with nanotechnology.
<P>

<a name="30611w12.html_para11">A number of aspects have been built into the study in order to engage the general public; independent and representative focus groups will be convened, a questionnaire survey undertaken and an online discussion forum established to ensure that any general concerns are addressed. The final report of the study will of course be in the public domain and freely available on the Royal Society website.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w13.html_spnew7"><B> Alan Johnson: </B> 
 Outsourcing is one element of globalisation that also includes rising world trade, and greater flows of foreign direct investment (FDI). The key challenge for the UK is to seize the benefits of globalisation, allowing us to attract more FDI, and sell our goods and services into expanding global markets. The UK has the highest stock of FDI as a percentage of GDP in the G7, demonstrating our success in adapting to the opportunities provided by globalisation.
<P>

<a name="30611w13.html_para5">The Office for National Statistics does not produce estimates of job losses arising from outsourcing. The Government do recognise that job losses, from wherever they arise, are regrettable. However, the role of Government is to ensure that the labour market is flexible enough to generate new opportunities, and that workers have the skills to take advantage of them. Employment is close to a record level, and is nearly 1.5 million higher than in April 1997. Moreover, new jobs continue to be created. Around two million people either move into employment or change jobs each quarter.

 Individuals, including agency workers, dismissed by their employers for reason of redundancy, will be entitled to the statutory redundancy payment if they are employees working under contracts of employment and have worked continuously for the same employer for at least two years since the age of 18. Whether or not an individual is an employee is a mixed question of fact and law, which, in the event of a dispute, can be decided by a court on the basis of the facts of the case. We are, therefore, unable to make an exact assessment of the extent to which agency workers can claim statutory redundancy pay.

 The production and distribution of facsimile copies of the Lindisfarne Gospels is a matter for the British Library and the publisher. It is not therefore an issue about which my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has had discussions. However, we understand that the publisher has made 980 copies available for sale. This will help to recoup the substantial investment in the development of the facsimile and, to the extent that copies are purchased by other libraries, will help to make them available more widely.

<P>
<a name="30611w15.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Preliminary estimates suggest that the negative net impact need not exceed 4 per cent. (or about &#163;54m a year) for the remainder of Camelot's licence period (i.e. until 2009). These estimates are subject to the work to be done by Camelot on the design, structure, and marketing of new games, which the National Lottery Commission will need to consider before licensing them.

<P>
<a name="30611w15.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The distribution of Lottery Sports funds to the English regions is a matter for Sport England. The Government has guaranteed the percentage shares of Lottery proceeds net of any income generated by the new hypothecated Olympic Lottery games going to the sports, arts, heritage and charities good causes will not fall below their current level of 16 at least until 2009. The National Lottery Commission's prudent assessment is that the Olympic Lottery games could generate &#163;750 million in the period 2005&#150;2012. However it does not discount the possibility of the initiatives out-performing this estimate. Up to a further &#163;340 million will be sought from theestablished Lottery Sports Fund distributors for Olympic costs.
<P>

<a name="30611w15.html_para0">Preliminary estimates provided by Camelot, as assessed by the National Lottery Commission, suggest that any negative impact on income on the existing good causes from the new Olympic Lottery games would be small&#151;4 per cent. for the remainder of the Camelot licence period, until 2009. That equates to &#163;54 million out of their current forecast annual income of &#163;1.5 billion. The precise impact on existing good causes will depend on the way in which Olympic Games are developed. Camelot will carry out extensive market research to establish how to reduce or even eliminate

this negative effect. In fact, any Olympic Games could so invigorate the Lottery that other good causes benefit. Any outstanding balance could be met by changing the percentage shares of Lottery income passing to the existing Good Causes after 2009.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will list the estimated <i>(a)</i> number of sales, <i>(b)</i> total revenue, <i>(c)</i> total raised for a London Olympic Games, <i>(d)</i> total paid in prizes, <i>(e)</i> total raised for the Exchequer and <i>(f)</i> total in administration costs of the new lottery games for a London Olympic Games.  [118005]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w15.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Our estimates are that the proposed Olympic Lottery should yield 750 million towards the costs of staging the Olympic games in London, subject to Parliamentary approval of legislation for the introduction of a hypothecated income stream. These amounts together with sales numbers and prize payments will depend on further work to be done by Camelot on the design and structure of the games, which will be necessary before the National Lottery Commission can license them; and on the nature of the Lottery operation following the end of the current licence in 2009. However, the money spent by players on Lottery tickets is currently approximately shared out among the following stakeholders as follows: prize winners 50 per cent.; for the good causes 28 per cent.; to the Exchequer 12 per cent. (Lottery duty); in commission on sales to retailers 5 per cent.; in operating costs 4.5 per cent.; and in profit to Camelot 0.5 per cent. These proportions will not necessarily remain unchanged throughout the relevant period, but if they did so then total sales of &#163;2,680 million would imply Lottery duty of &#163;330 million retail and operating costs of &#163;254 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make a statement on the contingency plans for the financing of a London Olympic Games if <i>(a)</i> Lottery and <i>(b)</i> private sector funds are insufficient to cover the total projected cost.  [118006]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 The agreed public funding package of &#163;2.375 billion in place for a London 2012 Olympics already includes a significant contingency element of more than &#163;1.2 billion over the public subsidy

 The London Government Act 1963 provides that premises in the Greater London Area on which any public dancing, music or public entertainment of a like kind or a boxing or wrestling entertainment takes place, requires a public entertainment licence. An open space in Greater London may be "premises" and a performance of music or dancing there may require a public entertainment licence.
<P>

<a name="30611w15.html_para3">The Local Government (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1982, regulates public dancing, music or other public entertainment of a like kind in England and Wales outside Greater London. A licence is not required for entertainment that takes place wholly or mainly in the open air unless a local authority has passed a resolution that paragraphs 3 and 4 of Schedule 1 to the Act shall have effect. Paragraphs 3 and 4 require public musical entertainment to be licensed if it takes place wholly or mainly in the open air and at a place on private land. The requirement for a licence does not apply to a garden fete, bazaar, sale of work, sporting or athletic event, exhibition, display or other function or event of a similar character or a religious meeting or service, merely because music is incidental to it. No licence is required under these provisions for entertainment held in a pleasure fair.
<P>

<a name="30611w15.html_para4">If alcohol is to be supplied at an event, the provisions of the Licensing Act 1964 or the Licensing (Occasional Permissions) Act 1983 will apply, requiring authorisation for the activity.

 Under the Licensing Bill, the provision of regulated entertainment is a licensable activity. Schedule 1 provides that a performance of live music is a description of entertainment under the Bill, and this covers both amplified and un-amplified music. Accordingly, subject to the conditions and exemptions in the Bill, live musical performances in pubs would require the authorisation of a premises licence, a club premises certificate or a temporary event notice.

<i>[holding answer 3 June 2003]</i>: In 1999, the House of Commons Defence Select Committee (HCDC) examined security of supply of propellants as part of its inquiry into the proposed closure of Royal Ordnance Defence (ROD) Bishopton for commercial reasons. The Committee accepted that there were no strategic or defence reasons for the retention of ROD Bishopton. The subsequent review by the National Audit Office of the analysis underpinning the evidence presented by the Ministry of Defence of the HCDC concluded that this remained sound. Security of supply is taken into account when competing all requirements for ammunition including the propellant component; this is an integral part of the vetting process before tenders are progressed.

This strategy commenced in March 2001 and is a 3-year, &#163;2.5 million programme funded by the MOD, DFID and FCO through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool. Assistance under this strategy is targeted at helping the Indonesian security services become more professional, accountable, transparent and democratic. Projects undertaken so far include human rights training for the Indonesian military through the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); support to establish a democratic framework for policing; and support to help Indonesia move towards a system for civilian authorisation of Rules of Engagement along UK lines.

 The 1991 Harare Declaration identified as a priority for the Commonwealth "equality for women so that they may exercise their full and equal rights". And at the Edinburgh Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in 1997 the Heads of Government set a target of no less than 30 per cent. of women in decision making in the political, public and private sectors by 2005.

in 2000, The Gambia was the only country which so far exceeded the 30 per cent. target of women in Cabinet, while South Africa was the only country with more than 30 per cent. of women in Parliament. In local government positions, Seychelles, Uganda, India and Canada exceeded this target. A questionnaire exercise is to be repeated for the next Women's Affairs Ministerial in 2004. The Commonwealth Secretariat continues to devote a major part of its budget to building capacity and providing practical assistance to women, which includes increasing their political participation and decision making. Its gender section works with governments, parliamentarians and civil society to achieve the Commonwealth target.

 Our embassy in Khartoum regularly raises cases concerning juveniles and other human rights cases, with the Government of Sudan. Most recently this has included the case of juveniles sentenced to death in Darfur and the sentence of lashings given to a 14-year-old girl convicted of adultery. As part of a recent DFID review of the Justice sector in the North of Sudan, experts on law enforcement, good governance and human rights and shariah raised many issues with the Government of Sudan including the application of shariah and criminal law to juveniles. This review will help to inform HMG's development policy in Sudan and ensure that human rights is a key element of that policy.

The table shows the number of family visitor applications received, determined and refused at our visa issuing posts world wide for the period January to March 2003. The figures for April and May are currently being collated and are not yet available. Those family visitor applications which have been 'determined' are those which have been resolved, either refused or granted entry clearance.

<a name="30611w20.html_para1">My hon. Friend may find apparent discrepancies in the figures&#151;for example in February 16,972 applications were received but 18,207 applications were resolved. This can be caused by a variety of reasons. Applications can be carried forward from one year to another before being resolved. Applications may be withdrawn during processing (but still count as an application received). Posts are also required to count all applications received (a mother and three children on one passport may count as four applications but only one entry clearance may be issued).

 Poverty and social exclusion are complex and multi-dimensional issues, affecting many aspects of people's lives. The fourth annual "Opportunity for all" report (Cm 5598), published in September 2002, sets out the Government's strategy for tackling poverty and social exclusion and presents information on the range of indicators used to measure progress against this strategy.
<P>

<a name="30611w20.html_para2">The indicators used to monitor progress for children and young people cover a variety of domains. Whether statistics of child poverty include the children of asylum seekers depends on the source of the statistics. Statistics relating to income, housing, post-16 education and (parents') employment will include the children of asylum seekers if they are living in private households and have responded to the relevant survey. Similarly, statistics on smoking during pregnancy and among children aged 11 to 15 include all those who responded to the relevant surveys. Those relating to compulsory education include all children who attend a mainstream school with over ten pupils. Those relating to Sure Start areas, births, deaths and injuries relate to all children. Figures relating to local authority care and the Child Protection Register will cover all children affected.
<P>

<a name="30611w20.html_para3">In summary, the indicators for children and young people monitored in "Opportunity for all" do include the children of asylum seekers where possible. However the ability to specify results for these children is limited by a number of factors: asylum seekers are not normally identified separately in such surveys; their characteristics may mean that they are less likely to be sampled or to respond to surveys; and they will in most statistical instruments represent too small a population to provide robust estimates.

For public appointments which are not paid employment, help from Jobcentre Plus would not be appropriate.

 The National Insurance Integrity Programme was superseded in mid-2000 by Personal Account Security, now known as the National Insurance Number (NINO) Allocation Project. The NINO Allocation Project has responsibility for taking forward the Departmental for Work and Pensions National Insurance Work Programme.
<P>

<a name="30611w20.html_para9">The overall stock of NINOs is 71.5 million; 49 million of these accounts are active. The NINO Allocation Project has identified a total of 14 million accounts as deceased records. Of the remaining 8.5 million records, analysis has taken place and we have concluded that 6.7 million of these records are not being used because either they are deceased records or the customers have gone abroad. The remaining cases have all been dormant for over 3 years and we are currently looking at ways to police these accounts in future.

 The Social Exclusion Unit examined the issue of access to financial services in deprived areas in Policy Action Team 14 (led by Her Majesty's Treasury), within the framework of the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal. Much of the current work across Government on areas such as credit unions, basic bank accounts and universal banking services results from this work.
<P>

<a name="30611w22.html_para7">Within the National Strategy for Neighbourhood Renewal, a &#163;15 million Deprived Urban Post Office Fund was established (Commitment 15), managed by the Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, that operates to help keep post offices open in England's most deprived urban areas. Post offices are often the only accessible financial service in the most deprived communities and they are used disproportionately by the more disadvantaged members of society, including those on low incomes and by the elderly.
<P>

<a name="30611w22.html_para8">The Post Office network now also offers access to basic bank accounts through the Universal Banking Services (Commitment 13), which are being promoted by the Department of Trade and Industry, the Department of Work and Pensions and the Post Office. These services will give an important boost to financial inclusion as they will help to give the estimated 3.5 million adults in the UK currently without bank accounts access to them.

 The Department of Health does not recommend a minimum distance and travel time for children attending an accident and emergency unit. This will be subject to clinical judgement and local circumstances. Children need access to the closest unit which offers appropriate initial assessment and treatment. Where there is need for paediatric intensive care or other specialist intervention following the child's resuscitation and stabilisation, then onward transfer to a unit specialising in this form of care, and offering the best achievable outcome for the child, will be arranged.

 The majority of people with dementia are cared for at home, which can be a very demanding and exhausting task for their carers. Their carers are entitled to an assessment to determine their needs as carers and eligibility for support. The carers grant, worth &#163;100 million this year, provides money for local councils to provide short breaks and services for carers to enable them to continue in their caring role. Carers are also entitled to cash payments for carers' services to enable them to purchase the type of support they require and promote a better quality of life.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w23.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 the Home Office can only license the use of animals for scientific purposes where there is no non-animal alternative, and then only when both the number of animals and their suffering is minimised. This reflects the principles of the 3Rs&#151;replacement, reduction and refinement.
<P>

<a name="30611w23.html_para6">As a regulator the Home Office has no control over the number of project licence applications which it receives. While therefore we must seek to minimise the number of animals used in particular programmes of work, the Home Office cannot influence the overall amount of animal research and testing which takes place&#151;that is determined by many other factors, including the economic climate and global trends in scientific endeavour.
<P>

<a name="30611w23.html_para7">Although scientific activity has increased dramatically since the 1986 Act was introduced, technical progress with development and adoption of 3Rs strategies has resulted in an overall reduction in the number of animals used each year over the same period. There are, however, current developments&#151;such as advances in the use that can be made of genetically modified animals, and the proposed European chemical testing strategy&#151;which may in coming years reverse that trend and lead to more rather than fewer animals being used.
<P>

<a name="30611w23.html_para8">The Government fully supports and encourages development and promotion of the 3Rs in a number of ways, and additional impetus has been given to its efforts to that end by the related recommendations recently put forward by the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures. One of those recommendations&#151;that there should be a centre for the 3Rs&#151;is now being considered by the Inter-Departmental Group on the 3Rs, which is also reviewing the effectiveness of the Inter-Departmental Datasharing Concordat.
<P>

<a name="30611w23.html_para9">This is not however an area where quick gains can be expected. In the longer term we must rely for any further significant reduction in animal use largely on the scientific community's own continuing efforts to develop, validate and adopt non-animal alternative methods.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w23.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 In their Report published last year, the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures recognised the progress that had been made since the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 came into force, in fostering a culture of care in establishments designated under that legislation.
<P>

<a name="30611w23.html_para10">The culture of care as regards animals used in scientific procedures in the United Kingdom is indeed probably better than anywhere else in the world, and we remain committed to maintaining and improving that position.
<P>

<a name="30611w23.html_para11">The animals must be housed and cared for in accordance with codes of practice published and laid before Parliament under the 1986 Act.

<P>

<a name="30611w23.html_para12">A number of other measures have, we believe, contributed to a culture of care.

Expansion of the Inspectorate is also beginning to make a difference in this area, as it enables more resources to be devoted to the proactive dissemination and promotion of best care and husbandry practice. Moreover, we continue to encourage communication and networking among licence holders so that best practice can be shared, and we continue to press for the highest standards to be incorporated in European legislation.

<a name="30611w25.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The West Midlands police inform me that the involvement of the Police Complaints Authority (PCA), the appointment of the metropolitan police service (MPS) to conclude the investigation and consideration of the matter by the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) are all factors which have contributed to the time taken in the investigation. Once the CPS determined that no criminal proceedings should be instigated, further delays have arisen through the need to consider whether DCS Baker should face misconduct proceedings and the processes of disclosure of relevant information and subsequent interviews that this required. Further written representations submitted by DCS Baker in May are currently under consideration by the PCA before they make their recommendations on whether DCS Baker should face misconduct proceedings.
<P>

<a name="30611w25.html_para0">The West Midlands police advise me that a detailed account of the costs of the investigation is not available. However, they advise that a conservative estimate of the cost of the investigation so far would be in the region of &#163;150,000.

A West Midlands police representative also attended a meeting between the MPS and the CPS in January 2003 when it was determined that there would be no criminal proceedings against DCS Baker.

<P>
<a name="30611w25.html_spnew7"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The UK Passport Service (UKPS) has initiated a programme of testing its systems and procedures through the introduction of dummy fraudulent applications. This is a diagnostic tool used by the UKPS to check the effectiveness of its fraud prevention and detection arrangements. It would be prejudicial to the UKPS's business interests to publish detailed information on the results of this testing.
<P>

<a name="30611w25.html_para7">The UKPS is actively using the results to develop its procedures and systems. This includes a large scale pilot of arrangements to access commercial databases to support the identity validation process which will commence this autumn.

 Fraud identification and awareness is part of the training provided by the UK Passport Service (UKPS) for staff involved in the examination of applications for United Kingdom passports.

 It is very difficult to establish the precise level of identity fraud and this is reflected in the findings of a Cabinet Office study on identity fraud which was published last year.
<P>

<a name="30611w25.html_para10">As part of its Fraud Action Plan the UK Passport Service (UKPS) has undertaken an exercise involving some 10,000 passport applications to establish an indication of the levels of fraudulent application being received. This exercise was run during a peak period in the summer of last year and further exercises need to be run to take account of seasonal variations but if the results of this first exercise are extrapolated they indicate that the level of fraud may run at around 0.18 per cent. of applications received. With around 5 million passports being issued each year this would equate to 9,000 fraudulent applications per year.
<P>

<a name="30611w25.html_para11">This exercise represents a snapshot of the possible level of fraud at a particular time of year. It is to be repeated on a routine basis at different times of the year.

 A detailed examination of service provision for people with dementia was carried out by a multidisciplinary team led by the Department with representatives from Boards, Trusts, the University of Ulster and the Alzheimer's Society in 1994. Its aim was to examine policy on dementia in Northern Ireland and to provide Boards and Trusts with guidance, which would contribute to a more co-ordinated and better targeted approach to meeting the needs of people with dementia and their carers. The Department accepted the Report of the Dementia Policy Scrutiny published in 1995 and adopted its 33 recommendations as the basis for policy in this area.

The Labour Force Survey is a sample survey and as such estimates are subject to sampling variability. For example, the estimate of net annual change in total employment has an associated sampling "error" of &#177;27,000 which indicates that 95 per cent. of the time the true population figure of net change in employment is expected to lie within the range 64,000 &#177;27,000. A similar principle underlies each of the estimates of net change in the table and this should be taken into account when interpreting the results.<P>

 The Climate Change Programme, published by the then Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions in November 2000, was laid before the Northern Ireland Assembly. The energy efficiency targets it contains were included in the Northern Ireland Executive's Programme for Government and also adopted by the Northern Ireland Office for the areas within its control. These targets are being pursued by: <i>(a)</i> programmes of training in energy awareness for key staff; <i>(b)</i> regular investment in projects to improve the energy efficiency of, and reduce emissions from, buildings occupied by Departments; and <i>(c)</i> regular monitoring of buildings' energy performance.

<P>
<a name="30611w29.html_wqn1"><B> David Burnside: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what action is being taken by the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development to stop the importation of fish from any area with lower fish health status than Northern Ireland.  [115269]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The movement of live fish, eggs and gametes within the European Union is governed by Council Directive EC 91/67 (as amended). This Directive provides for the establishment of Approved Zones for the List II Diseases Viral Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (VHS) and Infectious Haematopoietic Necrosis (IHN) and prohibits the import of fish into Approved Zones from non Approved Zones i.e. areas of a lower health status. Northern Ireland has Approved Zone status for both VHS and IHN and therefore can only import fish from other VHS and IHN Approved Zones. Due to the additional guarantees obtained 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jun 2003 : Column 963W</I><P>
by Northern Ireland in relation to the disease Gyrodactylosis Salaris (GS), imports of live salmonids into Northern Ireland must also be certified as coming from an area regarded as free from GS. Great Britain also has Approved Zone status for VHS and IHN and is regarded as an area free from GS and therefore fish can move freely between GB and Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="30611w29.html_para1">However the Directive does not provide the Department with the legislative authority to prevent imports of fish into Northern Ireland from areas in which the List III Disease Infectious Pancreatic Necrosis (IPN) is present providing they are certified as coming from an Approved Zone for the List II Diseases VHS and IHN and from an area regarded as free from GS. It is therefore the Department's policy to advise fish farmers of the risks of importing fish from these areas and to carry out rigorous testing of any such imports to determine whether the IPN virus is present. Should the presence of the IPN virus be detected it is the Department's policy to use its powers under the Diseases of Fish Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 to take the necessary measures to prevent, control and eradicate the virus.

<P>
<a name="30611w29.html_wqn2"><B> David Burnside: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what the origin of the fish confirmed as having infectious pancreatic necrosis in the latest outbreak in Northern Ireland is.  [115270]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w29.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 The latest incident of the infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) virus occurred in a marine fish farm off the coast of County Antrim. The infected fish have been bred from broodstock selected from salmon stocks on the farm and reared in the farm's hatchery. However tests carried out on samples of fish taken from the hatchery have indicated that the virus is not present in the hatchery and this evidence suggests that the fish have become infected following transfer to the marine environment. The IPN virus is endemic in the marine environment around the coast of Scotland and scientific evidence therefore suggests that any vector such as wild fish, species cohabiting with farmed fish, plankton, crustaceans, birds or mammals could be the source of infection.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w29.html_wqn3"><B> David Burnside: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what steps the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development is taking to prevent further outbreaks of infectious pancreatic necrosis within the wild trout and salmon populations in Northern Ireland.  [115271]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Pearson: </B> 
 Scientific evidence suggests that removal of the source of infection in farm fish means that the infection does not persist in wild populations. The Department of Agriculture and Rural Development has used its powers under the Diseases of Fish Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 to make Infected Waters Orders declaring the fish farms infected with the infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) virus to be infected areas and providing the Department with the power to take such measures to prevent, control and eradicate the virus.
<P>

<a name="30611w29.html_para2">In respect of the fish farm located in inland waters the Department has used its powers to direct the occupier to depopulate, clean down and disinfect the farm. The Department also directed that the farm remain fallow 



<P>
<P><I>11 Jun 2003 : Column 964W</I><P>
for a period of six weeks prior to restocking following which further sampling will be undertaken as a precautionary measure.
<P>

<a name="30611w29.html_para3">In respect of the fish farm located in the marine environment the Department has used its powers to prohibit all movements of fish to and from the farm except under the authority of a licence issued by the Department. The Department has also introduced a number of precautionary measures at the infected area for the purpose of controlling the spread of the virus and is undertaking regular inspections of the area to ensure that these measures are being implemented.
<P>

<a name="30611w29.html_para4">Although the Department has no powers to prevent imports of live fish from areas in which IPN virus is present providing the import is in accordance with EC Directive 91/67 (as amended) concerning the animal health conditions governing the placing on the market of aquaculture animals and products, the Department advises fish farmers of the risks of importing live fish from such areas and carries out rigorous testing on any such imports to determine whether the IPN virus is present. Should the presence of the IPN virus be detected it is the Department's policy to use its powers under the Diseases of Fish Act (Northern Ireland) 1967 to take the necessary measures to prevent, control and eradicate the virus.

 Within the Northern Ireland Office, no formal assessment has been made of the impact of the Part-time Workers Directive on staff. But managers are committed to the concept of good work-life balance.
<P>

<a name="30611w31.html_para2">A total of 186 staff currently job share or work part-time.
<P>

<a name="30611w31.html_para3">Part-time working is only one of several ways in which the Northern Ireland Office offer staff flexibility in their working patterns.
<P>

<a name="30611w31.html_para4">Prior to the introduction of the Part-time Workers (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) regulations (Northern Ireland) 2001, which were effective from the 21 October 2001, the 11 Departments within the Northern Ireland Administration had already introduced measures to ensure that part-time staff were treated no less favourably than their full time counterparts.
<P>

<a name="30611w31.html_para5">On foot of the Directive, these measures were examined to ensure that they were fully compliant. Since the Directive, in itself, had no impact on the policies in place, an assessment would not be meaningful.
<P>

<a name="30611w31.html_para6">The departments within the Northern Ireland Administration continually strive to be a "Good Employer" and are committed to the concept of good work-life balance for its staff in serving Ministers and the public to the highest standards.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what safeguards there are to ensure the highest standards of care are practised in private care homes for the elderly.  [115954]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w31.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 Under the terms of the Registered Homes (Northern Ireland) Order 1992, homes in the private and voluntary sectors which seek to provide care for older people must register with the Registration and Inspection Unit of their local Health and Social Services Board. To be successful in registration, the person in charge of the home and manager, if different, must be fit persons, the premises used, staffing or equipment must be suited to the purpose and the home must be run in such a way that it provides the services or facilities that are reasonably required. Further, in the case of a nursing home, the person in charge must either be a medical practitioner or a qualified nurse and the staff skills-mix and deployment must ensure that appropriate staff are available on duty. Conditions may be applied to registration so as to safeguard the quality of the service to be provided and a home may only provide the service for which it is registered. A home must make application to the Registration and Inspection Unit if it wishes to vary the service that it provides. In addition, homes must maintain specified records and these along with the care they provide is subject to inspection by the Board's Registration and Inspection Unit.Under the Registered Homes Regulations (N.I.) 1993, there is a minimum requirement for homes to be inspected at least twice yearly and generally one of these inspections is unannounced. During the inspections the premises and care are measured against standards set by the Registration and Inspection Unit relating to the quality of care, management and the environment of the home together with the life experiences of the residents. Standards are drawn from the Department's Social Services Inspectorate guidance contained in documents such as "Standards for Residential Homes for Elderly People", "Inspecting for Quality" and "Homes are for

Living In". There is a requirement under the Registered Homes Regulations for homes to make adequate arrangements to ensure that appropriate activity programmes are in place to meet the needs of residents.
<P>

<a name="30611w31.html_para10">Any shortfalls which are identified during inspections are brought to the attention of home managers at the time of the inspection and also through official inspection reports together with recommendations on how the shortfalls might be addressed. Where necessary, additional visits are arranged to make sure that recommendations are addressed or that any complaint received has been addressed.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what means are used to standardise services at private care homes for the elderly.  [115955]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30611w31.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The Registration and Inspection Units of each Health and Social Services Board are responsible for evaluating and monitoring the quality of care provided and the quality of life experienced in statutory, private and voluntary sector residential settings. The Units are responsible for ensuring that a consistent approach is taken to the inspection of statutory, private and voluntary sector provision and they are required to carry out a minimum of two inspections each year, one announced and one generally unannounced, of each residential care home and nursing home in the Board area. The inspection reports, the comparative analysis of trends in care home provision and Annual Reports by the Registration and Inspection Units all contribute to establishing and monitoring of standards of care in residential settings.
<P>

<a name="30611w31.html_para11">The Health and Personal Social Services (Quality, Improvement and Regulation) (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 will create a new independent HPSS Regulation and Improvement Authority which will operate on a regional basis and, among other things, take over the functions of the current Registration and Inspection Units. The Order also allows for the introduction of minimum care standards and the development of clinical and social care governance, the latter underpinned by a statutory duty of quality. The Order, combined with a strengthening of the regulation of the workforce should offer powerful safeguards for the quality and consistency of services to be provided.

 I announced in my statement of 26 March 2003 that the Review of Public Administration would not be going out to consultation during the lead-up to elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly. In the light both of the subsequent postponement of these elections and the continuing interest in and support for the Review, I am currently considering options for its future conduct and will make an announcement in the near future.

<a name="30611w32.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 I understand that the then Chief Constable wrote to Sir John Stevens on 13 May 1999 confirming, inter alia, that he would have unlimited access to all intelligence and information available to the RUC and all files held by them.
<P>

<a name="30611w32.html_para1">The Chief Constable copied the above-mentioned letter to the Assistant Chief Constable with responsibility for Special Branch. As a result, a senior officer was appointed within that Department to liaise with the Stevens Team.

<P>
<a name="30611w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 It would be premature for me to comment on the specific arrangements that the Department for Social Development might enter into with the developer associated with the site, Multi Development Corporation, in respect of its proposal for Victoria Square since the Department has yet to come to a decision on whether or not to proceed with the vesting of lands within the site. However, if vesting proceeds the Department will carefully consider the financial aspects of any development agreement including appropriate overage (ie super profits) provision to safeguard the public interest.

The Northern Ireland Devolved Administration was established on 2 December 1999. At that date new Departments were created and there was a transfer of
