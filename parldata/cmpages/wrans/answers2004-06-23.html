<a name="40623w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Irish-registered Vehicles</h3>





<p><a name="40623w01.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Robathan: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport pursuant to his answer to question 178952, whether it is a requirement in the UK that Irish-registered vehicles display up-to-date Irish road tax; and whether there have been prosecutions in the UK for not displaying Irish road tax on an Irish-registered vehicle.  [179995]</p>








<p><a name="40623w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Vehicles that are circulating temporarily between European Union member states must comply with the registration and licensing requirements of the home country. Enforcement of offences is undertaken by the police. Figures for prosecutions against foreign-registered vehicles are not available.

<a name="40623w01.html_sbhd1"><h3 align=center>Ports Police</h3>





<p><a name="40623w01.html_wqn1"><b> Mr. Paice: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many staff from ports police forces were employed at UK seaports and airports in each of the last five years.  [177176]</p>








<p><a name="40623w01.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 We do not have a breakdown available for each of the last five years as the port authorities are not required to supply employment figures to the Department. However, information collected specifically for our review of ports police shows that, in 2003, the seven port police forces in England and Wales employed a total of 198 sworn in officers (exclusive of civilian support staff). No ports police were employed at airports.

<a name="40623w01.html_sbhd2"><h3 align=center>Road Works (Safety)</h3>





<p><a name="40623w01.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what plans his Department has to ensure the safety of <i>(a)</i> workers and <i>(b)</i> drivers in areas of extensive road works in the Midlands this year.  [179825]</p>








<p><a name="40623w01.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Jamieson  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 22 June 2004]:</i> The Highways Agency has established the Safer Temporary Traffic Management Operations Initiative to improve safety for both road workers and road users and to raise safety standards in the industry. This initiative involves the Health and Safety Executive, the Scottish Executive, Northern Ireland Roads Service and industry representatives, and is producing improved safety guidance for road workers and is ensuring that consistent best practice is employed.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40623w01.html_para0">
The initiative is developing and testing new and innovative technology, equipment and procedures that could offer safety benefits for both road workers and road users. The Highways Agency is working with contractors and HSE to produce training videos for road workers and their employers.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>23 Jun 2004 : Column 1406W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="40623w01.html_para1">
Safety of workers and drivers is given high priority when any road works are undertaken. The Highways Agency is promoting a &quot;Safer Driving Through Road Works&quot; campaign aimed at increasing driver awareness of the need to drive safely through road works. The campaign has secured a significant amount of television airtime and more than 100,000 car window stickers reinforcing the message have been distributed. The Agency&#039;s information leaflets include six key messages for driving safely through road works.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40623w01.html_para2">
The message was further reinforced in a recent &quot;Traffic Information Leaflet&quot; about roadworks in the Midlands, which has been widely distributed, and through a video shown at various shows including the Motor Show.
</p>






<a name="40623w01.html_sbhd3"><h3 align=center>Safety Barriers (Motorways)</h3>





<p><a name="40623w01.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Stringer: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport how many miles of safety barriers on the motorway system have been <i>(a)</i> replaced and <i>(b)</i> renovated in each of the last five years.  [179662]</p>








<p><a name="40623w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Details of the lengths of safety barriers that have been replaced or renewed over the last five years are not available. The total length of safety barriers on England&#039;s motorway network is over 3,600 miles. Based on a sample maintenance area, it is estimated that about 50 miles are currently replaced due to accident damage or renewed through scheduled maintenance programmes each year.

<p><a name="40623w01.html_wqn4"><b> Harry Cohen: </b> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what the UK&#039;s involvement is in the currency exchange programme; who is contracted for it; how much they <i>(a)</i> have been paid to date and <i>(b)</i> are contracted to receive; and if he will make a statement.  [179800]</p>








<p><a name="40623w01.html_spnew4"><b> Ruth Kelly: </b> 
 Officials from HM Treasury and the Bank of England provided technical expertise to assist with the planning and delivery of the currency exchange programme in Iraq. UK firms were also involved in the printing of the new banknotes and delivery of the programme, the total cost of which was US Dollars 160 million. Detailed information on payments to individual firms has not been released in order to protect contractual confidentiality.

 Monthly figures on fuel duty receipts are published in the &quot;Customs and Exercise Hydrocarbon Oils Bulletin&quot;, a copy of which is available on the UK trade information website (www.uktradeinfo.com). Road fuel duties are charged at a fixed amount per litre and higher road fuel prices generally reduce revenues from fuel duties as they result in lower fuel consumption. The impact of higher oil prices on overall tax revenues and the public finances is complex, and will depend on their wider impact on the economy in general, including the effect on factors such as profitability and retail prices.

<p class="tabletext">As National Statistician I have been asked to reply to your recent question on the conclusion of Professors Oswald and Blanchflower on the stance of the Office of National Statistics on allowing access for researchers to check the Government&#039;s calculations relating to the Area Cost Adjustment. (177066),</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Professors Oswald and Blanchflower conclude that a decision has been made by ONS not to release micro-data from the New Earnings Survey (NES) and the Labour Force Survey (LFS) in order to prevent researchers from checking the government&#039;s calculations of the Regional Funding Adjustment. No such decision has been made. On the contrary, ONS policy is to support statistical research in the academic community by supplying micro-data in as much detail as possible, within any legal constraints and with respect to the duty of confidence owed to survey respondents.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Access to confidential NES micro-data is covered by legislation, including the Statistics of Trade Act (1947), and there is no provision to allow access for the research that Professors Oswald and Blanchflower would like to perform. Non-disclosive, fully anonymised NES micro-data is not covered by legislation can be provided to researchers on request. However, the measures taken to prevent disclosure include the removal of small area geographical indicators, which may make the data unsuitable for Professors Oswald and Blanchflower&#039;s purposes.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">ONS offers secondments to researchers working on behalf of ONS for purposes consistent with the aims of National Statistics and of benefit to ONS. As secondees to ONS, these researchers may use the ONS Business Data Linking research facility which holds identifiable, disclosive, disaggregated NES datasets. Professors Oswald and Blanchflower may wish to explore this option further and should contact Prabhat Vaze at ONS (telephone 020 7533 5905) for further information.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The Labour Force Survey is voluntary, and not governed by legislation. However, information collected in the survey is confidential and subject to the common law duty of confidentiality and the Data Protection Act (1998). The obligation of confidentiality is reinforced by a pledge given to survey respondents, which states that no identifiable information they provide will be passed to any government department or member of the public.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Non-disclosive, fully anonymised LFS micro-datasets are available at the UK Data Archive and are available to the academic research community. However, as for the NES, small area geographical indicators have been removed to prevent disclosure, which may make the data unsuitable for Professors Oswald and Blanchflower&#039;s purposes. The Business Data Linking research facility does not presently hold any LFS microdata.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Supporting research is one of the aims of National Statistics, but data access arrangements are bound by the National Statistics Code of Practice and Protocols and by legal and professional constraints that may limit access to confidential data. Compliance with these statutory and common law duties does not constitute a decision to prevent researchers&#039; access to data. It is critically important that these obligations are met, in order to maintain public confidence in the integrity of official statistics and the 



<br>&nbsp;<br></ul><i>23 Jun 2004 : Column 1411W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
<ul>security of the confidential data on which they are based. Failure to do so would undermine participation in future data collections, reducing the reliability and value of official statistics for all users.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In comparison to National Statistics Institutes in other countries, ONS goes to great lengths to enable the use of its microdata for research purposes. We recognise that access to microdata by reputable researchers (within the legal and professional constraints discussed above) adds much to the value and trust of official statistics. It is therefore disappointing that my office&#039;s application of these constraints has been subject to criticism.</p>

We are developing an integrated performance management framework for the crime reduction and misuse of drugs agendas which will allow us to agree with each Government Office in the regions (GO) and the Welsh Assembly clear targets for the performance of partnerships in their area, and hold them to account for local delivery.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what work her Department is undertaking to ensure that industry increases the energy efficiency of <i>(a)</i> televisions and <i>(b)</i> television set-top boxes when in stand-by mode. [179172]</p>









<p><a name="40623w06.html_spnew6"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 The Department&#039;s Market Transformation Programme, working closely with the DTI and in consultation with industry and other experts, has established a substantial evidence base on the energy consumption of appliances and equipment in use, including standby mode, and on the potential for improvement.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40623w06.html_para5">
For TVs and set-top boxes, we have sought undertakings by manufacturers to reduce both &quot;on&quot; and &quot;stand-by&quot; power consumption. Following an EU industry commitment, we expect that the majority of new televisions sold in the UK will soon consume around 1 Watt of power in stand-by mode rather than the 3&#150;8 Watts consumed by older models. Furthermore, our commitment to more sustainable procurement requires any Government Department which purchases televisions to specify a stand-by power requirement of no more that 1 Watt.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40623w06.html_para6">
My Department has strongly supported the development of the EU voluntary Code of Conduct for set top boxes, which we estimate will already secure energy savings of about 3 Terawatt hours per annum by 2010. We are working via the EU and channels such as the IEA to further raise the profile of this policy issue. We are also working with the Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes and the Energy Saving Trust to explore the scope to use the Efficiency Recommended logo to encourage consumers to choose boxes which use the least energy. And, with DTI, we have agreed on minimum and best practice standards as part of the Government&#039;s policy on the switch over to digital TV services.

The estimate for 2004 is that the number of boxes in use will rise to nearly 12.5 million, with electricity consumption approaching 1.5 Terawatt hours. (The estimates cover the separate boxes which are used to receive digital TV signals via cable, satellite and Freeview transmissions. They do not include the energy consumed by decoders which are built into televisions and recording equipment.)

<p><a name="40623w07.html_spnew1"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 There are several types of external costs that are usually associated with energy activities, including impacts on noise, health, buildings, crops, ecosystems and global warming. The most important externalities of energy activity in the UK are attached to emissions to air, including emissions of CO2 and of local pollutants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40623w07.html_para0">
The DTI UK Energy Model is the most comprehensive source of forecasts of CO2 emissions from energy use. The UK National Atmospheric Emissions Inventory (NAEI), which is funded by Defra and Devolved Administrations, annually compiles estimates of emissions to the atmosphere from UK sources such as cars, trucks, power stations and industrial plants. Estimates of emissions of pollutants to air are a fundamental input to the air quality modelling work that the Department carries out to assess ambient concentrations of important air pollutants and to estimate their health and other impacts.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40623w07.html_para1">
Valuation of non-market impacts is a challenging but important element of appraisal, and should be attempted wherever feasible. However valuation techniques are constantly being refined and considerable uncertainty typically characterises monetary estimates of the marginal damage costs associated to emissions of various pollutants.
</p>


<p>
<a name="40623w07.html_para2">
A Government Economic Service working paper &#039;Estimating the Social Cost of Carbon Emissions&#039; suggested a range of illustrative estimate for the global damage cost of carbon emissions. These figures are currently being reviewed by an interdepartmental group on the social cost of carbon which is expected to report by the end of the year.

The Department of Health&#039;s Committee on the Medical Effects of Air Pollutants (COMEAP) advises on how to quantify the health impacts associated with changes in local pollutant emissions, including PM10,

NOx, SO2 and ozone. Currently there is no UK agreed monetary value that can be used for the reduction in risk of deaths brought forward by air pollution due to a lack of empirical evidence in the field. However, Defra has recently published a study which attempts to generate a theoretical range of monetary values for health benefits and is considering the feasibility of recommending a range of values to monetise the health impacts associated with air pollution for use in policy appraisal.

Notes:<br>

1. The financial data are taken from LEAs&#039; Section 52 Outturn Statements submitted to the DfES from 1999&#150;2000 onwards and the ODPM&#039;s RO1 statement previously. 2002&#150;03 data is subject to change by the LEA. Expenditure was not distinguished between pre-primary and primary sectors until the inception of the Section 52 outturn statement in 1999&#150;2000.<br>

2. 1999&#150;2000 figures reflect the return of GM schools to local authority maintenance. Brent LEA had 11 GM schools out of 13. The GM schools were not included in the 1998&#150;99 data but were in 1999&#150;00. If 1997&#150;98 and 1998&#150;99 figures are adjusted to include funding and pupils, the figures become 3,019 for 1997&#150;98 and 3,171 for 1998&#150;99.<br>

3. The outturn 2002&#150;03 tables captured the data in a fundamentally different way to the previous years. Categories were aligned with the Consistent Financial Reporting framework and the spending by LEAs was no longer split by school sector. Consequently the unit costs per pupil in 2002&#150;03 are not strictly comparable with earlier years as they include an apportionment of LEA expenditure based on pupil numbers. Figures are rounded to the nearest &#163;10.<br>

4. Net current expenditure (NCE) includes expenditure within schools and also that incurred centrally by the LEA.<br>

5. The NCE per pupil figures for pre-primary & primary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in the pre-primary sector and maintained primary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained nursery and primary schools sector.<br>

6. The NCE per pupil figures for secondary relate the net current expenditure (after recharges) in maintained secondary schools to the total number of financial year pupils who are educated in the maintained secondary schools sector.<br>

7. Pupil data are drawn from the Annual Schools Census adjusted to be on a financial year basis.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make grants to sports clubs and associations conditional on their use and purchase only of equipment which has not been manufactured using child labour.  [179773]</p>








<p><a name="40623w08.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Caborn: </b> 
 The Government are strongly committed to helping eliminate child labour throughout the world and fully support the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in this area. Although sports governing bodies do not have the resources to enable them to research how equipment funded by grants has been manufactured, the Government do urge all UK importing industries to be scrupulous in their choice of suppliers and ensure that they uphold the ILO core labour standards, including those on child labour. The UK has ratified all of the related ILO core Conventions and has provided &#163;15 million to the ILO&#039;s International Programme for the Elimination of Child Labour.

 The Government are committed to ensuring that all people in the United Kingdom have access to diverse media and brought forward the Communications Act 2003 to deliver that policy. For example, the Act requires the new communications regulator, Ofcom, to secure the availability throughout the United Kingdom of a wide range of electronic communications services and a wide range of television and radio services. Ofcom must also have regard to the desirability of encouraging the availability and use of high speed data transfer services throughout the United Kingdom. These responsibilities are supported by other provisions of the Act and by the Government&#039;s own policies for extending the availability of digital television services.

 The UK is currently a net exporter of oil and oil products, and, largely due to geography, imports relatively little oil from OPEC countries. However, the UK is expected to become a net importer of oil by 2010 and the Government therefore recognise the need to take a longer term strategic international approach to energy

security. This approach is outlined in the 2003 Energy White Paper, &quot;Our Energy Future&#151;creating a low carbon economy&quot;, available at http://www.dti.gov.uk/energy/whitepaper/index.shtml. The aim is not to reduce dependence on OPEC per se, but rather to promote more diverse sources of supply, fuel types and trading routes and to put in place policies that will help ease the economy away from power supplied primarily through fossil fuels as well as bringing about reductions in carbon dioxide emissions.

<p><a name="40623w16.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Timms: </b> 
 The main form of support for all renewable technologies is the Renewables Obligation (RO) which provides a stable and long-term market for renewable electricity. Electricity generation from both wave and tidal technologies is eligible for the RO.

<a name="40623w16.html_para2">
However, these technologies are further from market and still at the developmental stage. Therefore the principal form of support has been through the DTI&#039;s Research and Development Programme, which since 1997, has committed around &#163;15 million towards the development of these technologies.
