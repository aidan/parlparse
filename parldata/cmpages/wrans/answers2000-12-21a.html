 There is no such entity as a standing European Rapid Reaction Force.

UK participation in any particular operation, and the nature of our contribution (including any potential use of the Territorial Army), would be matters for decision by the UK Government in the light of circumstances at the time.

The payment is calculated in the form of interest on the arrears of monies owed using the Average Retail Shares and Deposits rate supplied by the building Society Commission. The Department may additionally make a consolatory payment if the official error has had a direct adverse effect on the life of the customer.

<P>
<a name="01221w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bayley </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 12 December 2000]:</i> The Social Security system in this country aims to provide financial support through benefits to individuals according to various sets of circumstances and needs, as defined through legislation and approved by Parliament. Some of the provision through benefits is targeted to very broad groupings by age, such as Child Benefit or Retirement Pension. Other benefits are defined and targeted more specifically to recognise particular personal circumstances. For instance, disability benefits help disabled people according to their needs. Depending on the extent of their disabilities, many disabled people face extra costs over and above the normal cost of living, and disability benefits provide help towards these extra costs, with the level of help reflecting a person's needs for either personal care or mobility. Other benefits reflect the provision of financial support to those on low or no income, such as Income Support. The benefit system aims to treat people fairly in a way that recognises diversity of circumstance and needs, and seeks to balance that with a focus on its key client groups (children, those of working age and pensioners).
<P>

<a name="01221w06.html_para5">The services that the Department provides are linked to the benefit provision and include locally based offices, centralised offices, telephone-based provision and internet opportunities. The Department uses many methods of communication including television, helplines, face-to- face contact and written information available in a range of languages and type sizes, from various outlets. Access to information is designed to be open to all irrespective of individual circumstances. In respect of the services that this Department provides, we also aim to ensure that all our policies, programmes and services are taken forward in line with the joint-departmental guidelines "Policy Appraisal for Equal Treatment" issued in 1998.
<P>

<a name="01221w06.html_para6">This Department as part of the Home Civil Service aims to be an employer which makes the most of what people can bring to their work, and values diversity. The Department is an Investor in People. It is committed to 



<P>
<P><I>21 Dec 2000 : Column: 262W</I><P>
fairness and equality of opportunity for all in employment and advancement on the basis of suitability. The Department's equal opportunities statement requires that no eligible external or internal job applicant should receive less favourable treatment on the grounds of age, disability, gender, marital status, sexual orientation, race, colour, nationality, ethnic or national origins, religion or religious affiliation or because they work part-time. The Department offers, for example, family friendly employment policies, an open promotion system based on merit, specific schemes to encourage ethnic minority staff to develop their skills and careers.

 The Department for International Development follows guidance produced by the World Health Organisation (WHO) on the provision and use of manual vacuum aspiration (MVA). MVA provides a safe option for the treatment of incomplete abortion, either natural or induced. In settings where sterilisation is not possible, single use disposable equipment is used to minimise risk of infection. MVA increases women's access to post abortion care and reduces the risk of complications during treatment. Failure to properly treat incomplete abortion can have fatal consequences. WHO considers MVA an essential element of care at the first referral level of all health care services.

 In addition to being a qualified teacher, all teachers working with classes of pupils who are hearing impaired must undertake a specialist mandatory qualification. In June, following a review of mandatory qualifications undertaken at the request of my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State, the Teacher Training Agency issued a new course specification for providers intending to mount courses from September 2001. The criteria laid down for mandatory qualifications in teaching hearing impaired children require a minimum competence in signing equivalent to the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People (CACDP) Stage 1 qualification.

 As a result of the Spending Review, investment in Sure Start has more than doubled, and by 2003-04 Sure Start will reach one third of all children under four living in poverty. The main criteria used in selecting districts for Sure Start are levels of disadvantage and poverty, though we also ensure a good mix of rural, urban, semi-urban and coastal areas and a good spread across the country. On the measures of deprivation we have used, Gedling has lower levels of poverty and disadvantage than the areas so far invited to develop a Sure Start programme. As the programme develops, we shall examine ways in which Sure Start can reach disadvantaged young children living in areas with small pockets of deprivation, and in rural areas. We shall be evaluating Sure Start carefully, and disseminating the lessons we learn widely, so that Sure Start will benefit all young children.

 <i>[pursuant to her reply, 15 December 2000, c. 280W]:</i> Sure Start is an innovative cross- departmental and pioneering programme, which fulfils the Government's undertaking to improve support for families and children before and from birth. Sure Start aims to transform the life chances of younger children through better access to family support, advice on child development, child care, health services and early education. It is focused on areas of disadvantage and open to all families in Sure Start local programme catchment areas. The fourth wave of Sure Start will be announced early in 2001, and will bring the total number of Sure Start programmes to 250 or more, meeting the target set in the first Sure Start Public Service Agreement. The 250 programmes will be spread across the country and contain a mix of rural, urban, semi-urban, and coastal areas.

<a name="01221w08.html_para1">The Lincolnshire pilot involves a number of strands of activity that take account of the rural nature of the county. For example, the project strand that is looking at the involvement of young people and parents has highlighted the need to bring the service to the client through good help-line services. There is also a particular rural dimension to the issue of raising aspirations in communities where most people earn their living from unskilled agricultural work. In the South Holland district, the prospective Connexions Partnership is involved in the rural action zone. One theme of this is a "rural academy" which aims to provide enhanced educational opportunities by linking the resources of a number of existing schools. Another is to provide laptop computers on free loan through local libraries to encourage the use of internet based resources and services.

The Consultation on School Governing Bodies, launched on 18 November, also aims to lighten the executive burdens carried by governing bodies through transferring some--particularly staff- related responsibilities to heads. If those changes are agreed, we believe that it would be possible to have smaller governing bodies on which all the existing stakeholders would continue to be represented.

 Following publication of the "Making Changes" policy statement on 11 April 2000, much work has been done to take forward its proposals. I have today placed in the Libraries of the House a summary and analysis of the responses received to "Making Changes". As proposed in "Making Changes", and informed by the response to consultation, the Lord Chancellor will create a new body which is to be called the Public Guardianship Office. It will discharge the Court of Protection's decisions on behalf of mentally incapacitated people, a role at present undertaken by the Public Trust Office. The new body is being explored as a candidate for agency status. It will be set demanding targets to provide a high quality service to its clients.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w09.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department if she will make a statement concerning the performance of Central London County Court in processing work.  [143595]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w09.html_spnew1"><B> Jane Kennedy: </B> 
 The Court Service uses two key performance indicators to measure the performance of the county courts. The first indicator measures the general quality of service provided, including time taken replying to correspondence, answering telephone calls, the key facilities available, the rate of success of recovering money on county court warrants and the proportion of Courts' Charter Standards met. The national target for this standard is 83 per cent. For the year 1999-2000, the Central London County Court achieved 74.5 per cent. For the period April to November 2000, the court has achieved 70.1 per cent.
<P>

<a name="01221w09.html_para0">The second key performance indicator measures the percentage of administrative process dealt with within five working days, for example, issuing a county court claim. The national target for this standard is 92 per cent. For the year 1999-2000, the court achieved 83.9 per cent. For the period April to November 2000, the court is achieving 70.3 per cent.
<P>

<a name="01221w09.html_para1">The Court has experienced difficulties in meeting its targets as the result both of a loss of experienced staff and a growth in workload. These issues are being addressed as a matter of urgency and there is already some sign of improvement.

<a name="01221w09.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Department does not directly fund the Imperial Cancer Research Fund (ICRF) but it does provide indirect support for ICRF research in several ways. For example, the Department funds the National Health Service costs of ICRF-funded research that takes place in the NHS, and many ICRF-funded researchers hold departmental/NHS research grants. In addition, the Department and ICRF, plus others, jointly fund substantial research projects such as the United Kingdom Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening.
<P>

<a name="01221w09.html_para2">The Department will be investing an additional &#163;20 million a year by 2003 in the NHS Cancer Research Network, the Co-ordinating Centre for which involves ICRF. There are two groups one of which is led by Professor Peter Selby, Head of ICRF Cancer Medicine Research Unit at the University of Leeds. The second includes Professor Adrian Harris, Head of the ICRF Medical Oncology Unit at the University of Oxford.

 We are concerned that hysterectomies are not performed unnecessarily. As with all major interventions, the decision to undergo hysterectomy must be for the woman concerned in the light of the best available medical advice.
<P>

<a name="01221w09.html_para3">We work closely with the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG), which issued guidance in 1999 to all its Fellows and Members on the management of menorrhagia, the presenting problem for about half of all women who undergo hysterectomies. Earlier this year, the RCOG reminded its Fellows and Members of the need for informed consent for surgery. We expect the RCOG's guidelines to be followed by all health authorities and National Health Service trusts. These guidelines are increasingly being used in clinical audit and clinical governance programmes.

 <i>[holding answer 15 December 2000]:</i> National Statistics are collected and published on an annual basis on the numbers of residential and nursing care homes and the places or registered beds as at 31 March. Aggregated counts of residential care homes and places within these homes by primary client type and sector of provider are collected from local authorities. Aggregated counts of the number of private nursing homes, hospitals and clinics and the registered beds by type of home, primary client type and broad category of use are collected from health authorities. Both sets of collections identify homes that are registered to provide both residential and nursing care (i.e. dual registered homes). Some information is also collected from individual residential and nursing homes on the facilities available, number of occupied places and nursing staff. Collection of this information is linked to the main pre-announced annual inspection.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w11.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> Delivery of measles, mumps and rubella as three separate vaccines has never been recommended in the United Kingdom. Single antigen measles and mumps vaccines are not licensed in the UK. The importation of unlicensed single antigen measles and mumps vaccines is restricted by the Medicines Control Agency under the Medicines Act 1986. There is no evidence that the use of single vaccines benefits children and evidence that their use may put children at significant disadvantage. The evidence shows that MMR remains the safest way for parents to protect their children and the Department cannot support the use of separate vaccines and has no plans to make separate vaccines available.

 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> The number of children identified as having autism is increasing. Although the full explanation for this is not clear, it is at least in part due to improvement in diagnosis by the clinical professions, including child mental health specialists and community paediatricians.

<P>

<a name="01221w11.html_para0">We recognise the importance of health, social services and education agencies collaborating to facilitate early identification and effective intervention. For example, these agencies are working jointly to improve the provision of high quality care and treatment for children by building up locally-based child and adolescent mental health services.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w11.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> Establishing the cause of autism will help in preventing, identifying and treating this distressing condition. The Medical Research Council (which is largely funded by Government) has recently invested &#163;344,000 in one of the largest studies of the causes of autism ever attempted. The researchers will study whether autistic children have a history of other conditions or medical problems such as problems during birth and whether viral infections in the womb or soon after birth appear to play a role in producing autism. They will look at a representative sample of health records drawn from over 2 million people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Both the Department and the Medical Research Council (MRC) take ethnic minority issues very seriously. The MRC, which receives its funding via the Department of Trade and Industry, is entirely independent in its day-to-day research funding decisions. These take account of both health needs and scientific vision and opportunity including advice from the Department on our priorities. However, the Department does not as a matter of course seek to influence the design of particular MRC-funded research projects. As part of its strategy for research into inequalities in health, the MRC encourages all applicants to consider the feasibility of collecting information on ethnic origin, socio-economic status, gender, etc. in exploring the factors influencing health.

<P>
<P><I>21 Dec 2000 : Column: 288W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01221w13.html_para2">Targets to recycle 25 per cent. of household waste have been in place since the early 1990s. The Government announced their intention to review the national waste strategy in January 1998 and published consultation documents in June 1998 and June 1999. Local authorities were, therefore, given notice of the intention to make a step change in waste management practices.
<P>

<a name="01221w13.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. St. Aubyn: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how the proximity principle in waste management will be applied to incinerators that depend for their safe and profitable operation on <i>(a)</i> economies of scale and <i>(b)</i> a constant feed of large volumes of waste taken from a large catchment area.  [143395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 December 2000]:</i> It is for Local Authorities to determine how the proximity principle, that waste should generally be disposed of as near to its place of origin as possible, can best be applied in their area. "Waste Strategy 2000", published in May, emphasises that energy from waste facilities should be appropriately sized and that care must be taken to ensure that contracts are sensitively designed to avoid 'crowding out' recycling.
<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w13.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Jenkin: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions how many incinerators he estimates will need to be installed to meet the Government's waste targets; and if he will make a statement.  [144096]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w13.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 It is for local authorities to decide what mix of waste management facilities is appropriate for their area. The number of incinerators built will depend on how successful we are in tackling waste growth and in increasing recycling and composting.
<P>

<a name="01221w13.html_para3">"Waste Strategy 2000" makes clear the Government's commitment to substantial increases in recycling and composting, and announces statutory targets for the recycling of household waste--doubling it in three years and nearly tripling it in five. Where a local authority does decide that an incinerator is needed, the authority should ensure that the plant is appropriately sized and that contracts are carefully designed so as not to compete with recycling. Incinerators should also incorporate Combined Heat and Power technology--where heat is used to produce electricity and to provide hot water to local homes and businesses--wherever practical.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the changes which he is proposing to make, in responses to the Phillips report on BSE, into the operation of the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment, with special reference to the recommendations that <i>(a)</i> the secretariat is totally independent of his Department and should consist of administrators and not scientists, <i>(b)</i> the committee addresses risk assessment and not risk management, <i>(c)</i> the committee does not give policy advice and <i>(d)</i> the secretariat does not provide draft advice for the Committee.

<a name="01221w14.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Phillips Inquiry report raises a wide range of issues, of which nearly a quarter concern the management, operation and role of scientific advisory committees, such as the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE).
<P>

<a name="01221w14.html_para0">The Phillips report does not recommend that the secretariats of Advisory Committees should be composed of administrators and not scientists. In fact the report flags the importance of Government Departments retaining 'in house' scientific expertise to enable then to understand and review the advice given by their committees.
<P>

<a name="01221w14.html_para1">The Government are considering the implications of this extensive, and complex report, including issues raised at (b)-(d) and will publish a response in due course. If any changes are proposed in the operation of ACRE, they will be announced subsequently.

<a name="01221w14.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The sourcing of products by supermarkets is not normally a material planning consideration. There may, however, be circumstances where it could be demonstrated that the impact of a new supermarket would result in a significant reduction in local purchasing, which in turn would result in material harm to the local economy. For example, in a market town where local food shops currently source their stock locally, a significant reduction in local purchasing as a result of a new supermarket opening and local food stores reducing their purchasing or going out of business could have an adverse effect on the local economy. In such circumstances this might be a material consideration and, if so, would be taken into account in making the decision.

<a name="01221w14.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Rural Transport Partnership (RTP) scheme was launched in the autumn of 1998 to address social exclusion by bringing about long-term transport improvements in rural areas. Grants of up to 75 per cent. of the eligible partnership and project costs are available up to a current maximum of &#163;250,000.
<P>

<a name="01221w14.html_para6">A partnership is formed between relevant bodies in a particular area (e.g. local authorities, voluntary sector, health and employment bodies) to take a strategic view of the transport needs and provision of that area. Typically partnerships begin with the appointment of a partnership officer, who then conducts a transport needs analysis to produce an action plan of proposed projects for funding to address the needs identified. Once the partnership officer is appointed, a period of typically six months is needed to prepare the action plan for agreement with the Agency. Action plan projects require specific Agency approval and are listed in the table.
<P>

<a name="01221w14.html_para7">In addition each RTP can also draw down a delegated fund of &#163;10,000 per year in each of the partnership years, for small scale, stand alone transport projects.
<P>

<a name="01221w14.html_para8">Although there are 71 RTPs set up to date, the table only covers 34, because the remaining 37 have been set up recently and are still developing their action plans.
<P>

<a name="01221w14.html_para9">There are also two national RTPs not covered in the table. They are the Community Transport Association's RTP, which has received &#163;39,313 and the Association of Community Rail Partnerships (Acorp) RTP. Acorp has received &#163;27,810 to date. Both of these are national development projects to support community transport and rail activity. Rather than initiating their own schemes, these partnerships support projects promoted by others.

 Health and safety legislation already compels local authorities to carry out an assessment of the risks to the health and safety of persons not in their employment who may be affected by the manner in which they carry out their undertaking. This would include assessing the risks in children's playgrounds and such assessments should consider whether the surface complies with published standards on impact absorbing surfaces. Guidance on these standards is available to all local authorities.

 <i>[holding answer 18 December 2000]:</i> The Health and Safety Commission has received a number of representations on this issue in response to its Discussion Document "Gas safety review: Options for change" and an associated shorter document "Key issues for consumers". These are summarised in the Commission's report on the outcome of the Review: "Proposals for Change", a copy of which has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01221w18.html_para0">Non-gas work includes plumbing and electrical work not directly connected to gas safety, carried out by installers in conjunction with gas work on a combustion appliance. Only a minority of respondents to the Discussion Document expressed support for the extension of the CORGI registration scheme to cover such work. The great majority (53 out of 77, or over two-thirds) were not in favour of extending the scheme in this way. The same question raised in the associated consumer document elicited a similar balance of responses.
<P>

<a name="01221w18.html_para1">The 'non-gas' activities of installers are already subject to the general requirements of the Health and Safety at Work, etc. Act 1974 and associated regulations. The Commission has accepted the view that the increased prescriptive burden that an extension of the CORGI registration scheme would represent would be difficult to justify in safety terms. However, the Commission will ensure that the general health and safety requirements are duly emphasised in its Approved Code of Practice on "Standards of training in safe gas installation", which it plans to update in the light of the Review findings.

<P>

<a name="01221w18.html_para2">My preliminary view is that the report's recommendations include useful measures for making further improvements to the safety regime for the installation and use of gas.

These are summarised in the Commission's report on the outcome of the Review, "Proposals for Change". A copy has been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01221w18.html_para3">In response to a question on possible controls over do-it-yourself installation, the option of requiring retailers to record sales of gas equipment was supported by 26 respondents to the main Discussion Document, with 34 against; that of subsequent inspection by a central body was supported by 20, with 33 against. The parallel question in the associated shorter discussion document aimed at consumers elicited 36 in favour and 26 against such control. The main reservations expressed were over the possible compliance burden, bureaucracy and doubtful effectiveness of this approach.
<P>

<a name="01221w18.html_para4">A similar question was asked in relation to further action directed towards non-registered installers. Responses here were equally divided, with 14 in favour and the same number against. Several supporting this option did so in view of its potential deterrent effect on non-registered installers. Those against had concerns about the cost, bureaucracy and doubtful effectiveness of this approach.
<P>

<a name="01221w18.html_para5">The case for such action will be re-examined when additional data from improved accident reporting arrangements, to be introduced as part of the implementation of the Review findings, are available.

<P>
<a name="01221w18.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 20 December 2000]:</i> Meteorological information for Antarctica is provided to the UK Government by the British Antarctic Survey (BAS). The Antarctic Peninsula region has experienced a significant rise in temperature of more than 2oC in the last 50 years and in the frequency of precipitation events resulting in a reduction in both ice shelves and perennial snow cover. Other areas, such as the South Pole, show significant cooling, but changes in ice cover over the remainder of Antarctica are not known. There is no significant trend in sea ice area over the last 27 years of high quality records. A report on the stability of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, commissioned by my Department, shows that expert opinion is divided on the likelihood and cause of any collapse of this ice sheet, although the majority consider it to be unlikely. Such a collapse has been considered to be a possible consequence of global warming. The report concluded that there is a very low risk of collapse in the next three centuries, however, this issue remains a key matter for research at BAS.

 Yes, subject to the following considerations.
<P>

<a name="01221w18.html_para6">The incineration of waste is classified as a waste disposal operation under the amended Framework Directive on waste. This means that any person operating an incinerator is required to hold a permit--as defined in paragraph 1 of Schedule 4 to the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994 (as amended). A waste management licence, issued under Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, is a permit for these purposes and would usually be required where the incinerator is designed to burn waste at a rate of 50 kgs per hour or less. An exemption from licensing may apply where the conditions set out in regulation 17 and paragraph 29 of Schedule 3 to the 1994 Regulations are fulfilled.
<P>

<a name="01221w18.html_para7">An authorisation under Part I of the 1990 Act is required for incinerators designed to burn waste at more than 50 kgs per hour.

 The Homes Bill establishes the requirement for a person marketing a residential property to compile a seller's pack, and enables the Secretary of State to prescribe by statutory instrument the contents of the seller's pack.
<P>

<a name="01221w19.html_para0">The pilot study carried out in Bristol earlier this year tested some of the potential components of a seller's pack. This pack included an energy efficiency assessment incorporating an energy rating using the Standard Assessment Procedure (SAP), the Government's recommended system for energy rating of homes. It also included generic advice on measures to improve energy efficiency. The inclusion of such information was well received by home buyers, although some concerns were expressed about the format of this information and the accompanying advice. We are looking into these points further.
<P>

<a name="01221w19.html_para1">It is currently intended that Regulations prescribe the inclusion of an energy report in the seller's pack, and that this will include generic advice on measures to improve energy efficiency, and an indication of the cost and pay back period of each of those improvements.
<P>

<a name="01221w19.html_para2">As regards new homes, all new dwellings must comply with Part L of the Building Regulations, Conservation of Fuel and Power. We are currently reviewing Part L. In addition, through the Energy Efficiency Best Practice programme, we encourage housebuilders to build and promote highly energy efficient dwellings which would deliver a Standard Assessment Procedure energy rating of 80 or more on the 1-100 scale (the SAP 80+ initiative). Under an amendment of the Building Regulations taking effect from 1 January 2001, builders will have to post up notices of SAP ratings in new homes.

 I have concluded that it would not be fair and equitable to maintain the current Westerly Preference at night. It would be irrational to maintain in operation a noise mitigation measure that no longer serves the purpose for which it was originally intended. Indeed, it now has the perverse effect at night of adding to the sum of the disturbance that may be caused.
<P>

<a name="01221w19.html_para4">It makes no sense for the Westerly Preference to be operated at times when there are few or no take-offs, because it does not serve as a noise mitigating measure, and it is incompatible with the Government's aim to minimise the impact of the airport on the local environment.
<P>

<a name="01221w19.html_para5">I have considered carefully the arguments put forward for introducing and easterly preference at night, because I recognise this would provide the greatest benefit to the greatest number of people, but it would not provide a fair and equitable outcome.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The purpose of the working holidaymaker scheme is not to meet skills shortages, or enable teachers to secure employment in the United Kingdom, but as a concession to the normal arrangements working holidaymakers who are qualified teachers are allowed to undertake supply teaching during their stay. In keeping with the ethos of the scheme, any teaching work should be incidental to a holiday and they should not be working for the whole of their time here.
<P>

<a name="01221w19.html_para9">For those non-European Economic Area (EEA) nationals who wish to engage in full-time teaching employment in the United Kingdom there are already provisions under the work permit scheme, and provisions in the Immigration Rules enabling approved exchange schemes for teachers and language assistants.




<P>
<P><I>21 Dec 2000 : Column: 315W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01221w19.html_para10">I have nonetheless considered representations about the particular staffing difficulties and disruption faced by schools when supply teachers in their employ leave during the course of a school term because their leave to enter or remain as working holidaymakers has expired. In the interests of schools and their pupils, and in the light of the unique considerations which apply to the completion of school terms, I have agreed to amend the policy instructions in respect of working holidaymakers. This change will enable a short extension of leave to remain in the United Kingdom to a working holidaymaker who is already employed as a supply teacher, and whom the school wishes to retain, to enable them to complete the school term during which their leave to remain as a working holidaymaker has expired. Such leave will be granted on an exceptional basis outside the Immigration Rules in order to benefit those whose leave will expire during the course of a term but will not permit extensions to cover a whole term or more. Schools wishing to employ working holidaymakers as supply teachers will be expected to take account of the date upon which such a teacher's leave to enter or remain is due to expire when planning the coverage of vacant posts over the school year.

[144127]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The courts have imposed 122 football banning orders under the measures contained in the 2000 Act. While there are no grounds for complacency there has been no significant disorder involving English football supporters overseas since the Act came into force. The early indications are that the new measures are helping to deter disorder and encouraging the vast majority of travelling supporters to rid English football of its hooligan reputation. A copy of the interim report of the Working Group on Football Disorder has today been placed in the Library. It outlines the group's provisional findings and the work upon which it has embarked. The group has been tasked to produce by April of next year a collective and cohesive plan for improving the image of English football, the behaviour of its followers and the role of football at all levels in promoting social inclusion. Measures aimed at tackling the racist and xenophobic attitudes that so often prompt football violence and disorder will feature in the plan.

 The Home Office is working to build a safe, just and tolerant society in which the rights and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced, and the protection and security of the public are maintained. Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office annual reports. A copy of the most recent report, "Home Office Annual Report 1999-2000", is available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="01221w20.html_para4">The impact of Home Office policies and actions is not normally examined by constituency and the statistics which the Department collects cannot be matched in the way requested.

<P>
<a name="01221w21.html_wqn0"><B> Tony Wright: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will list the local, sub-regional and regional partnerships, boards of zones and other cross-sectoral bodies supported by his Department; and the funding streams with which they are associated.  [142186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The information requested is not held centrally. In delivering its Aims, the Home Office works in partnership with a wide range of organisations, both formally and informally. At local level, the Home Office is working with the Regional Co-ordination Unit to ensure effective delivery of Home Office services, including through local partnerships.
<P>

<a name="01221w21.html_para0">Some examples of partnerships and cross-sectoral bodies include the 376 crime and disorder partnerships in England and Wales, youth offending teams (YOTs), the Youth Justice Board for England and Wales (YJB), vehicle crime reduction action team (VCRAT), drug action teams, black and minority ethnic twinning volunteering partnerships and prison healthcare delivery.
<P>

<a name="01221w21.html_para1">Crime and disorder partnerships are led by the police and local authorities, but also involve others such as health, education, private and voluntary sectors. They are required to formulate and implement a crime and disorder strategy for their area and are able to bid for funding for particular crime reduction projects from the crime reduction programme.
<P>

<a name="01221w21.html_para2">Youth offending teams are a local partnership between police, probation officers, social workers, health and education staff. They are responsible for delivering community based intervention programmes to make young offenders face up to their crimes and change their attitudes and behaviour and to promote youth inclusion. YOTs are resourced through contributions from the agencies involved.
<P>

<a name="01221w21.html_para3">The Youth Justice Board for England and Wales is a cross-sectoral, non-departmental public body. It was established in September 1998 with the Juvenile Offenders Unit as the Home Office Sponsor Unit. The YJB receives funding from the Home Office through monthly grant-in-aid payments.
<P>

<a name="01221w21.html_para4">Another example of a cross-sectoral partnership is the VCRAT. This comprises of senior representatives from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Retail Motor Industry Federation, the Association of British Insurers, the Automobile Association, the Association of Chief Police Officers (including Scotland), Police Superintendents Association, Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions, Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency, Home Office and the Scottish Executive. VCRAT is working to reduce vehicle crime by 30 per cent. over five years (1 April 1999-30 March 2004) and advising on progress with implementation in the light of recorded vehicle crime figures as they are published. VCRAT itself does not have access to funds, but funding is available from the Crime Reduction Programme to support its work.

<a name="01221w21.html_para5">Drug Action Teams (DATs) are locally organised teams with representatives from police, probation, local authority services and health. They are responsible locally for delivery of the Government's drugs strategy. Each of the local agencies in the DAT are funded individually. Additionally, DATs receive funding through the Drugs Prevention Advisory Service, to assist in the co-ordination of their work.
<P>

<a name="01221w21.html_para6">Black and Minority Ethnic Twinning Volunteering Partnerships aim to raise national awareness of good volunteering practice in black and minority ethnic communities; to improve opportunities for black and minority ethnic volunteers and increase their involvement in mainstream voluntary organisations; and to provide access to funding. &#163;800,000 from the Home Office Community Support Grant has been provided to fund the initiative over the period 1999-2002.
<P>

<a name="01221w21.html_para7">The Prison Service, working with the National Health Service (NHS), supports a partnership to reform and deliver more appropriate health services to prisoners. This involves prison governors and health authorities identifying the health needs of prisoners and developing local joint prison health plans. The process is led from the centre by two joint Prison Service/NHS units--a policy unit and a task force--located within the Department of Health.

<a name="01221w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Association is represented on the steering group overseeing the follow up to the report into the murder of Stephen Lawrence, which is chaired by my right hon. Friend the Home Secretary, which last met on 21 November 2000. The Secretary of State last met representatives of the Association on 19 October 1998 for a bilateral. I last met the Chair and Deputy Chair on 18 July 2000. My right hon. Friend, strongly supports the Association in its work of developing support networks for minority ethnic police officers.

[142717]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w21.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The Home Office uses advertising in various media to inform the public about how they are affected by Departmental legislation, and also to encourage good practice in such areas as fire safety, crime reduction and voter registration. More recently a substantial police recruitment campaign has been launched.

 The Criminal Records Bureau is being established under Part V of the Police Act 1997, which does not lay down a legal requirement for all volunteers to be subject to checks through the Bureau. Checks will be carried out on individuals on application. The fees to be charged for such checks have not yet been settled, but they will be as low as possible. Before making regulations setting the fees, we shall carry out a regulatory impact assessment to consider the implications for voluntary organisations and other users of the bureau's service. The outcome will be made public.

 Section 8 of the Firearms Act provides that a person carrying on the business of a registered firearms dealer or a servant of any such person may, without holding a certificate, have in his possession, or purchase or acquire, a firearm or ammunition in the ordinary course of that business. The police have no authority to issue 'written permission' for a person to act as a dealer's servant: this is a matter of fact.
<P>

<a name="01221w22.html_para0">We understand that last month North Wales police issued a firearm certificate permitting a new employee of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation (BASC) to possess firearms and ammunition held by the dealership as a temporary measure while BASC's approval as a target shooting club was being renewed. This is a purely administrative matter, and BASC, North Wales police and the Home Office are not aware of any problems arising from this.

 The Government are committed to further enhancing rural development measures: the "second pillar" of the CAP.

We estimate that, by 2005-06, spending on rural development will have risen to 15 per cent. of total CAP expenditure in the UK. At Community level, we will continue to press for a greater share of EU funding from the second pillar.

Lord Phillips' findings go to the heart of what is good governance, including properly informed policy-making; joined-up Government; best use of advisory committees and expert advice; timely decision-taking; a consistent and proportionate approach to risk management and precaution--especially when dealing with uncertainty; and effective implementation of policy decisions. The report's conclusions also emphasise the need for openness and better communication with the public about scientific knowledge and risk to inform consumer choice.
<P>

<a name="01221w22.html_para7">The interim response will focus on actions already taken on these key themes, as well as addressing how we will deal with the 160 plus detailed lessons that the report identifies. It will form the basis of consultations and discussions, enabling all those interested to contribute to the final response that the Government will make later next year.

 Many representations have been received voicing concerns about distance readable cattle eartags. It is, of course, an EU requirement for all cattle born after 1 January 1998 to be identified with at least one distance readable eartag.

Producers will also have been heartened by the ending of the export ban on live pigs from Norfolk and Suffolk at midnight last night. I am sure the House will want to join with me in paying tribute to Jim Scudamore, the chief veterinary officer, his staff and the state veterinary service and their administrative colleagues for their sterling efforts in controlling the disease, for representing the

 To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what recent advice he has received from the Environment Agency about the contribution that dredging can make to the alleviation of local flood risk; and if he will make a statement.  [142360]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w23.html_spnew13"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 While for many rivers dredging is an important part of the maintenance regime, there can be a limit to the amount of dredging that may sensibly be performed. On some rivers, for example, too much dredging could cause the river banks or walls to collapse; larger watercourses often do not need dredging as they tend to be self cleaning; while deepening a tidal river will not create any additional capacity in the river as the level will be governed by the tide.
<P>

<a name="01221w23.html_para2">On some rivers with a very large catchment, such as the Severn, the volume of water is such that any increase in channel capacity would have to be extremely large to have even a noticeable effect on flood levels. This would go far beyond simple dredging and would create a channel which would be unsustainable during normal flows. The Environment Agency consider that they cannot justify carrying out dredging work for flood defence purposes on such rivers because benefits are so limited.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, pursuant to his answer of 15 December 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 300W, what unpublished agreements there are with <i>(a)</i> other countries, <i>(b)</i> the EU and <i>(c)</i> NATO concerning arrangements for the European Rapid Reaction Force.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w27.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 The objective of the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy is that EU nations, co-operating together, should be able rapidly to deploy troops for crisis management operations, where NATO as a whole is not engaged. This will not involve the establishment of a standing rapid reaction force, let alone a European Army. The decisions listed in my previous answer constitute the framework for this initiative. The EU and NATO will need to reach an overall agreement, covering

<P><I>21 Dec 2000 : Column: 341W</I><P>
arrangements for consultation, NATO support for EU-led operations, security issues and capabilities. An interim agreement on security measures was reached between the EU Council Secretariat and NATO in July 2000, to allow for the exchange of classified information.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w27.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 There was no need for an opt-out to be negotiated. The United Kingdom has sovereign rights over its North Sea reserves under international law, and the EC Treaty does not confer competence on the Community to claim ownership of or control over them. Article 100(1) TEC cannot be used to displace the framework of rights existing under international law.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w27.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 In an enlarged EU it is not reasonable for one member state to hold up all the others wishing to proceed with enhanced co-operation, provided that the rigorous conditions for enhanced co-operation have been met. These provide that enhanced co-operation is open to all and that the single market is protected; and will help ensure that there is no development of an inner core.




<P>
<P><I>21 Dec 2000 : Column: 342W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="01221w27.html_para1">In addition the appeal clause we secured allows a member state to seek discussion by the European Council of a proposal for enhanced co-operation before any decision is taken.

<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w27.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 Incentive measures, such as the exchange of best practice or information between member states, are exactly what we are encouraging the Commission to pursue. Extending QMV to these will facilitate co-operative action on non-discrimination. This is an agenda that the Government are keen to pursue. But, at our insistence, the Treaty makes explicit that QMV cannot be used for any harmonisation of national legislation or regulation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs under the provisional Clause A agreed at the Nice Council, dealing with the general principles of enhanced co-operation, for what reason it was decided <i>(a)</i> to insert a new condition relating to co-operation and the process of integration and <i>(b)</i> to delete the condition relating to the interests of states not participating in the relevant measures.  [143786]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="01221w27.html_spnew12"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 Clause A of the provisions on enhanced co-operation is intended to reinforce the point that enhanced co-operation should serve the interests and objectives of the Union as a whole, rather than a small group of member states.
<P>

<a name="01221w27.html_para2">The reference to enhanced co-operation not affecting the interests of non-participating members states was felt potentially to be a cause of legal uncertainty, because it could give rise to spurious legal challenges to enhanced co-operation by non-participating member states. This would not be in the UK's interest.

 QMV under tiret (k) of Article 137 is limited to co-operation between the member states. Harmonisation of their laws and regulations is explicitly excluded. It makes sense to exchange information with our partners and encourage the development of modern and sustainable social protection systems. This was one of the goals we agreed at Lisbon. QMV will make it easier to bring it about.
