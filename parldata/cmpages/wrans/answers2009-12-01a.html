Permission to connect surface water drains to the public sewer (if needed) would only be given once the drainage systems have been approved by the local authority as meeting National Standards for SUDS. The Bill also states that sustainable drainage systems serving more than one property would be adopted and maintained by the local authority SUDS Approving Body. These proposals should ensure that SUDS are routinely used in developments in the future.</p>

 The Law Officers Departments account for one of the smallest budgets in Whitehall. In line with the Government's OEP implementation plan, they have provided benchmarking data to HM Treasury across the range of OEP indicators.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_392"><a name="91201w0003.htm_para2"><a name="09120158000123">The Law Officers Departments' contribution to the Operational Efficiency Programme (OEP) is being delivered as part of their wider effort to deliver value for money, including their contribution to the Government's target to deliver £35 billion in savings during the current comprehensive spending review period.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_393"><a name="91201w0003.htm_para3"><a name="09120158000124">Under these arrangements a number of projects are planned or are already under way. In April it was announced that we would merge the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and the Revenue and Customs Prosecutions Office (RCPO) to drive out economies of scale, minimise duplication and create a more flexible and resilient organisation which was better able to handle specialist and complex cases. RCPO and CPS will by July 2010 have merged into one prosecuting body delivering significant savings.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_394"><a name="91201w0003.htm_para4"><a name="09120158000125">The Law Officers Departments are also reviewing their estates as part of the overall efficiency effort, with a view to rationalising accommodation as leases expire. The first major phase of the rationalisation will be to give up RCPO's existing accommodation in New Kings Beam House when the lease on that property expires in December 2011. Work thereafter will enable the whole Law Officers Departments estate to be used more flexibly and cost-effectively in the future.</p>

 Prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm in both the male and female prison estate are identified, cared for and monitored using the Assessment, Care in Custody and Teamwork (ACCT) process. This is a prisoner-centred, flexible and accountable care-planning system based on a multi-disciplinary approach. ACCT was introduced across the prison estate in partnership with the Department of Health during 2005-07.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_441"><a name="91201w0006.htm_para13"><a name="09120161000715">Every death in prison is a tragedy, and affects families, staff and other prisoners deeply. Ministers, the Ministry of Justice and NOMS are committed to learning from each death and to reducing the number of such incidents. Good care and support from staff save many lives, but such instances go largely unreported. Prisons successfully keep safe in any given month approximately 1,500 prisoners assessed to be at particular risk of suicide or self-harm. Deaths in prisons are among the most scrutinised of all incidents and each case is subject to a police investigation and an independent investigation by the Prisons Probation Ombudsman. Robust systems are in place for monitoring deaths and learning from them.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_442"><a name="91201w0006.htm_para14"><a name="09120161000716">NOMS does not compile quarterly statistics on incidents of self-harm in prisons. However, there was a provisional total of 24,686 incidents of self-harm recorded on NOMS Incident Reporting System in 2008, of which 12,938 incidents were in the female estate. In the community self-harm is often covert but in prison it is much harder to hide.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_443"><a name="91201w0006.htm_para15"><a name="09120161000717">NOMS has a broad, integrated and evidence-based prisoner suicide prevention and self-harm management strategy that seeks to reduce the distress of all those in prison. This encompasses proactively identifying prisoners at risk of suicide and self-harm through the ACCT procedures described above. ACCT has helped prisons manage self-harm. Approximately 33,000 ACCT plans were opened in 2008. More than one plan can be opened for any prisoner. There are no easy answers to managing self-harming behaviour but NOMS remains committed to finding ways to manage it.</p>

The higher rate does not attach itself to a requirement for help from another person, and although the lower rate component requires guidance or supervision from another person when out of doors, unlike with care component there is no minimum threshold for the time or effort required to guide or supervise a child. We are therefore not providing for a blanket exemption from work-related activity or, in due course, availability for work. However, a decision-maker must, under the Welfare Reform Act 2009, take into account health and disability issues when considering whether there is good cause for failure to comply with a direction to undertake work-related activity or, in due course, for turning down a job; and the issue should have been taken into account before this, in agreeing an action plan or, in due course, a jobseeker's agreement that takes into account the wellbeing of the child.</p>

 There has not yet been a detailed assessment of the impact of the removal of some obstacles in the West Bank on levels of trading and economic activity, because the changes occurred too recently to have gathered comprehensive data. However, there is clear anecdotal evidence that the new permissive regime which allows Israeli Arabs to enter and shop in Palestinian areas (Area A in the West Bank) is boosting trade and service industries in these areas. There is also anecdotal evidence to suggest that Palestinians now have access to most places in the West Bank, although delays continue to be economically costly. There continue to be problems and delays for Palestinian businesses in the West Bank that wish to import or export goods; but there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that the volume of exports from the West Bank may have increased as a result of the extended commercial opening hours of the Allenby crossing.</p>

For those rare occasions where whistleblowing is the appropriate course of action, we have provided unprecedented protection for individuals and we emphasise in the NHS constitution the right not to be unfairly dismissed for 'whistleblowing' or reporting wrongdoing.

 There are two main sources of crime statistics produced by the Home Office, the British Crime Survey (BCS) and police recorded crime.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_604"><a name="91201w0022.htm_para3"><a name="0912027000383">The BCS is a victimisation survey in which respondents are asked about their experiences of crime in the last 12 months. Within this survey, respondents are asked about their experience of the use of weapons in violent incidents. Due to the relatively low number of people who experience a violent incident with a weapon, it is not possible to provide data at the police force area level.</p>

These data include offences where a knife or sharp instrument has been used to stab or cut, or in a threat. Included within the definition of 'Sharp instruments' are stabbing implements, bottles and glass (when broken prior to the offence) and syringes. These data are shown in Table A. The offences covered by this collection which fall within the violence against the person category are attempted murder, threats to kill, GBH and ABH.</p>

<i> [holding answer 26 November 2009]:</i> The HERMES database used for the recording of missing persons data is an operational database used for policing purposes. The data are normally only used for management information and are not subject to the detailed checks that apply to National Statistics publications. The data are therefore provisional and may be subject to change.</p>

Although limited data has been collected as some police forces have implemented the code, it is unlikely that any meaningful and complete national picture of missing persons will be available until 2010, when all police forces will become compliant with the code. Meanwhile the available figures can be regarded as indicative only.</p>

Note that these figures relate to incidents of missing rather than individuals; the same person can go missing several times. 3,774 (80 per cent.) of these cases have subsequently been marked as 'closed' on the database (i.e. the missing person has returned or been located). However, research suggests<sup>(1)</sup> that 99 per cent. of missing persons are located within one year of going missing. Not all cancellations are received by the bureau. As force compliance with the code increases of the percentage of closed cases on HERMES will increase.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV-for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220<br>

The availability of places within individual settings will depend on their occupancy levels and other factors.
