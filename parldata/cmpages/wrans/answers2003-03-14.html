To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport if she will make it her policy that adoption of a code of practice on ethical trading on the lines of that developed for the 2002 Manchester Commonwealth Games should be a necessary pre-condition for Government endorsements of any bid to stage a major sporting event; and if she will make a statement.

 Cluster bombs are one of a range of weapons systems available to the RAF, and are a legal weapon that fulfils a legitimate military role that cannot be performed by other means. Where the RAF has used cluster bombs, it has done so in a manner that is fully consistent with our obligations under international law.

"military aspects of strategic advance planning"
for crisis management operations. This covers high-level consideration of options to support political/military decision-making, including particularly planning activities up to the point when the EU approves a military option. As part of the assured access to NATO planning capabilities agreed last year, the EU may call on NATO planning support for these activities.

<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30314w01.html_para5">More detailed operational planning is not in the terms of reference of the EU Military staff. It was agreed at Nice that NATO's planning bodies will carry out operational planning for EU-led operations with recourse to NATO assets and capabilities.

<a name="30314w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Currently there are no geographical limits set for crisis management operations which the European Union might conduct as part of the European Security and Defence Policy, although in practice distance would be one of a large number of factors which would determine whether or not an operation could be undertaken.

 The use by United States Visiting Forces of United Kingdom bases is a matter for joint decision by HM Government and the US Government at the appropriate time.

 The future of the Defence Export Services Organisation (DESO) was considered as part of the Strategic Defence Review in 1998.

 The European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) seeks to enable the European Union to deal with the full range of conflict prevention and crisis management missions defined in the Treaty, the "Petersberg Tasks". These missions (humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peacemaking) already give ESDP considerable scope to assist in the fight against international terrorism. Further work was commissioned, building on the Declaration of the Seville European Council concerning the contribution of the European Union's Common Foreign and Security Policy, including ESDP, in the fight against terrorism. This includes strengthening arrangements for sharing intelligence, and developing common threat evaluations. We are also supporting, in the framework of the Convention on the Future of Europe and elsewhere, proposals to allow a member state to call on the resources, including military, of other EU members, for civil protection tasks, following a terrorist attack.

 The ex-HMS Pagham was formally gifted by the Ministry of Defence to the Stranraer Sea Cadet Unit on 1 May 1999 having been on loan to the unit since 1978. This decision was made in light of an assessment of the likely receipts from the sale of the vessel on the open market and other relevant factors, including the expenditure incurred by the Stranraer unit on maintaining and improving the vessel during the loan period. Other forms of disposal were not considered to be cost effective. The MOD no longer has any responsibility for the vessel.

 The Local Government Finance Settlement 2003&#150;04 provides all authorities in Devon with an above inflation increase in formula grant. Three authorities in fact receive increases above 10 per cent. Where the Government have provided additional funds to those announced in SR2002 for specific new burdens, such as an extra &#163;21.53 million for the End of Life Vehicles Directive, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has adjusted the 2002&#150;03 baseline to enable a like for like comparison.

Once a council has accepted responsibility for a service user, that council should provide and fund the appropriate services whether that service be provided within that council's boundary or outside. There is therefore no requirement to transfer funds between social services departments when one council chooses to place an individual in the area of another council.

<P>
<a name="30314w04.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer of 10 March 2003]:</i> Human rights are at the heart of foreign policy and as such are integrated into policy-making at all levels. The FCO is therefore continually considering the human rights issues in all countries alongside other political, economic and security issues. However the human rights situations in the countries raised are as follows:
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para9"><i>Uzbekistan</i>:
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para10">We remain deeply concerned by reports of human right abuses in Uzbekistan. We recognise that the Uzbek Government has made small concessions in addressing the situation, including co-operating with the UN Special Rapporteur for Torture. However, Uzbekistan needs to do much more. We would like to see reform of the criminal justice system, as well as wider recognition of independent human rights groups, religious groups and political parties. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, my hon Friend the Member for North Warwickshire (Mr. O'Brien), raised human rights concerns with the Uzbek Ambassador in London on 10 February. We shall continue to press for tangible improvements in Uzbekistan's human rights record. We are also thinking together with the EU how best to handle the human rights situation in Uzbekistan at the next session of the Commission on Human Rights starting in March.
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para11"><i>Turkmenistan:</i>
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para12">We are greatly concerned at the recent developments in Turkmenistan following the reported assassination attempt on President Niyazov last November. We encouraged the EU to make a statement calling on the Turkmen authorities to comply with Turkmenistan's human rights obligations under international law. The EU is also considering how best to handle the human rights situation at the next session of the Commission on Human Rights.
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para13">Through the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) we have sought to establish a fact-finding mission to Turkmenistan to investigate all matters relating to the conduct of the investigations, including detentions, arrests and allegations of torture, as well as the trials, convictions and sentencing procedures. Turkmenistan has however refused to admit any mission of this kind. The OSCE has asked the Turkmen authorities to reconsider. We will continue to monitor the situation closely.
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para14"><i>Kyrgyzstan:</i>
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para15">We recognise efforts made by the Kyrgyz Government to improve its human rights situation and to bring about political reform. Positive developments include a presidential decree on 8 January 2003 extending a moratorium on the use of the death penalty. We are however still concerned by cases of harassment of independent media and unofficial Muslim groups. We shall continue to help Kyrgyzstan make improvements, in line with its international obligations and commitments.




<P>
<P><I>14 Mar 2003 : Column 445W</I><P>

<i>Algeria:</i>
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para16">We regularly raise our concerns about human rights violations in Algeria with the Algerian Government. We continue to urge the Algerian Government to fully comply with all its obligations under international human rights law, including the investigation of human rights violations, and to allow visits by the UN special rapporteurs on the question of torture and on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions. The UK with EU partners has also raised its concerns about a number of cases of human rights abuses with the Algerian authorities. The Algerian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has offered information on some of these cases, but both we and our EU partners will continue to press for full answers.
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para17"><i>Jordan:</i>
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para18">We welcome the decision by the Jordanian Government to hold general elections in June 2003 (elections were previously postponed from autumn 2002). This decision represents the opportunity for people to exercise their democratic right to vote. We will encourage the Government to hold a free and fair electoral process. We have some concerns about the human rights situation in Jordan including the treatment of religious minorities, honour killings, and freedom of expression. Toujan al-Faisal was a former member of the Jordanian Parliament who was arrested in 2002 in connection with her public criticism of the Government's policies. We welcomed her release following a Royal Pardon in July 2002. We will continue to raise each human rights case as appropriate with the Jordanian Government or in conjunction with EU Partners.
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para19"><i>Qatar:</i>
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para20">Qatar has a good human rights record for a conservative Islamic society with an autocratic system of government. The social and political system is comparatively tolerant and increasingly open. The Amir has the right basic instincts towards human rights issues but recognises that change which could damage the fabric of his tribal people must be handled carefully and will take time. The Amir is encouraging women to play an active part in all walks of life; he has introduced his first steps towards democratic reform; the press exercises some self censorship; freedom of worship is tolerated provided it is discreet; there are plans to build Qatar's first churches; work continues on codifying sharia and civil law but Qataris are still to some extent associated in the Western mind with their Wahabi cousins in Saudi Arabia. Death sentences have been carried out but are extremely rare. There are, however general issues regarding the treatment of third country nationals and minors working in Qatar.
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para21"><i>Pakistan:</i>
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para22">The UK Government welcomed President Musharraf's speech of 12 January 2002 in which he condemned all forms of sectarianism and religious hatred and made the case for a moderate and tolerant Islam. We hope the new government will look carefully at human rights violations in Pakistan. The UK and EU are particularly concerned by sectarian and terrorist violence that has resulted in the deaths of a number of Christians across Pakistan, most recently the vicious attack on 25 December 2002.
<P>

<a name="30314w04.html_para23">We have concerns about the abuse of the blasphemy laws and are seriously concerned about the imposition of the death penalty for blasphemy. The UK 



<P>
<P><I>14 Mar 2003 : Column 446W</I><P>
government opposes the death penalty in all circumstances. Women's rights issues remain a concern. We hope the new government will keep to the pledge of the out-going government to review the Hudood ordinances on Islamic punishments. We are particularly concerned by so-called "honour" crimes against women, forced marriages, domestic violence, kidnap and rate. We believe much can be done to promote women's rights within the existing Islamic legal framework.

two weapons. We also believe that North Korea could flight test a missile with the potential to reach Europe within weeks of a decision to do so. Once such a missile was flight-tested, it would take several years to deploy the missile operationally.
<P>

<a name="30314w05.html_para3">Assessment of threat is based on both capability and intent. We currently have no evidence of North Korean intent to target the UK.

 The Government's Five-a-day programme, a NHS Plan commitment, aims to increase access to, and availability and consumption of, fruit and vegetables particularly in low-income groups. Following successful piloting by the Department of Health, the New Opportunities Fund is providing &#163;10 million over the next two years to support 66 local community initiatives led by primary care trusts (PCTs) based in the most deprived areas of England. Evaluation of the initial Department of Health Five-a-day community pilots showed that those who ate less than five a day at baseline increased their intakes by one portion over the course of the study.

<a name="30314w05.html_para8">The Five-a-day communications programme will provide clear and consistent messages about Five-a-day, including the benefits of eating at least five portions of a variety of fruit and vegetables each day and portion sizes. Work is also in progress with different organisations from across industry, including retailers, producers and caterers, as well as across government and with other agencies, to improve people's access to fruit and vegetables.

<i>Notes</i>:<P>

1. In the case of residential rehabilitation, places are often purchased at a residential centre that may be outside the drug misusers area of residence. In practice some local authority social services departments agree to fund long distance placements with the agreement of the drug misuser so he/she can be removed from the area where they are involved in drug using. This means that in theory drug misusers resident in Leeds may be receiving treatment in rehabilitation centres elsewhere in England.<P>

2. Following NHS reorganisation in 2002, Leeds health authority became part of West<P>

Yorkshire Strategic health authority.<P>

3. Data from the Leeds Drug Action Team shows investment and attendance as 201 additional structured day programmes and 19 placements in residential rehabilitation.<P>

<P>
<a name="30314w07.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 The National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse (NTA) is aware that there is well-developed research evidence into the use of opioid substitution therapy&#151; particularly into the effectiveness of oral methadone maintenance treatment. An important part of the NTA role is to support high quality evidence based practice. It is recognised that some findings from the evidence base are not fully implemented and the NTA has built a variety of mechanisms to support the implementation of key research findings into to practice, including briefings, training, commissioning guidance and increasingly performance management systems. The NTA is also working with the Department of Health to develop dissemination of the findings of its current drug treatment research programme. The NTA has recently published a briefing on the advice of its expert group on prescribing, which includes a brief review of the evidence base for opioid treatment.

The evidenced-based Five-a-day handbook will support staff in primary care trusts and other organisations to establish community-wide initiatives to increase fruit and vegetable consumption, and the Health Development Agency is providing a report setting out the evidence base for the prevention and treatment of overweight people and obesity, and the maintenance of weight loss.

 Approval has recently been given by the Department of Health to the establishment of a national health service based "CHOICE" pilot scheme. In Greater Manchester, this is to be based around the Greater Manchester Surgical Centre at Trafford General Hospital. When fully up and running in October 2003, the pilot proposes that any patient registered with a general practitioner in Greater Manchester who has been waiting over six months in the specialties of general surgery, ear, nose and throat and orthopaedics for set of procedures will be eligible to choose an alternative treatment centre.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30314w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 General practitioners should not remove patients from their lists in these circumstances. The General Medical Council has issued guidance&#151;"Duties of a Doctor&#151; Good Medical Practice", which makes it clear that patients should not be removed because of the financial impact of their care or treatment on the practice.
<P>

<a name="30314w10.html_para2">The Department fully supports that advice. The proposed new general medical services contract which was announced on 21 February is intended not only to provide for a consistently high quality service to patients but also to avoid perverse incentives such as any which might encourage removal of patients from practice lists other than for good reason.

 Of the 20 principal recommendations contained in "People Like US&#151;The Report of the Review of the Safeguards for Children Living Away from Home (Utting, 1997)", 11 were for the Government to address. Of these 11, two were rejected, recommendations six and nine, eight have been implemented in full, recommendations one, five, seven, 11, 13, 16, 18, and 19, and one, recommendation 20, was partially implemented. Recommendation 20 relates to the implementation of the remaining recommendations contained in the 1989 Pigot report. These were considered by the interdepartmental report "Speaking

 The Audit Commission report "Waiting List Accuracy" was published on Wednesday 5 March.

Only one of these trusts is in the north-west, South Manchester University Hospitals National Health Service Trust.

 All candidates who apply to work for the Immigration and Nationality Directorate (IND) must meet the required eligibility criteria which is set out on each recruitment campaign. For administrative and executive grades candidates must be a British or Commonwealth citizen or a national of a state within the EU with no time limit on their stay in the UK. They should also have normally lived in the UK continuously for the previous three years. For Immigration Service grades candidates must be a UK national with five years residence in the UK.
<P>

<a name="30314w12.html_para2">When a candidate applies for a recruitment campaign their application form is checked to ensure they fulfil the relevant nationality criteria. If they are successful in reaching the interview stage they are then required to produce either a birth certificate or UK, EU or Commonwealth passport. These documents are photocopied and any passport other than a UK or EU document is checked to ensure that the holder has Indefinite Leave to Remain (ILR) in the UK. This means that anyone who is declared successful at interview does not have any restrictions attached to their stay in this country and is allowed to work here.

 The primary role of the fund is to provide drugs and commodities for the prevention and treatment of AIDS, TB and Malaria. DFID have pledged $200 million over five years to the fund, $80 million of which has been disbursed. In addition DFID have committed over &#163;1.5 billion since 1997 to support the development of health systems in poorer countries. Strengthening such systems is vital if drugs are to be safely and sustainably supplied to the poor. Wherever possible the Global Fund should be providing support behind strategies that help deliver sustainable improvements in health care. The fund has strong founding principles in this regard, but performance to date in this regard has been mixed. Our future support for the Global Fund will depend on its effectiveness. It is one of several possible instruments designed to improve basic health care in poor countries.

Total UK expenditure for each country, including the estimates for 2002&#150;03, is as follows. As the hon. Gentleman will know, long-term expenditure in DRC is confined to humanitarian and conflict resolution interventions. Development is impossible without the establishment of peace and legitimate government. We

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department (1) what steps are taken by her Department to help parents with abducted children to gain access to their children held abroad;  [102239]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment she has made of her Department's compliance with the recommendations established in Article 21 of the Hague Convention when advising parents who have had their children abducted to make an application for access; how those applications are handled; and what support is provided by her Department to ensure that the applications are successful.

 Article 21 of the 1980 Hague Child Abduction Convention allows applications via the designated Central Authorities for arrangements to secure effective exercise of rights of access. The primary remedy, however, is the return of the child, and applications under Article 21 will generally be deferred until the return application is concluded. I am satisfied that the Child Abduction Unit discharges its functions on behalf of the Lord Chancellor as Central Authority for England, Wales and Northern Ireland in compliance with the requirements of the 1980 Hague Convention. The Child Abduction Unit ensures that all parents who have not obtained the child's return under the return

The Unit will transmit any application made, whether for return of the child or for access rights, to its counterpart in the other country, monitor the case, liaise with all interested parties and assist as necessary. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office will also provide appropriate consular assistance. The decision on any application is a matter for the court to which the application is addressed.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department what progress has been made in attaining performance targets for the collection of outstanding fines imposed by magistrates courts.  [99871]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30314w14.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 Magistrates Courts Committees (MCCs) have responsibility for the collection of a range of debts imposed through the courts, including not only fines but also fees, compensation, confiscation orders, legal aid contributions and some maintenance orders.
<P>

<a name="30314w14.html_para0">The table sets out the latest figures for the payment rate for individual MCCs. Fine enforcement performance is too low and the variations are too wide and unacceptable ranging from over 80 per cent. to under 40 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30314w14.html_para1">MCCs set their own targets for improvement when they bid for a share of &#163;9 million extra investment (netting off) for the financial year 2002&#150;03. The aggregate of the local targets was an increase in fines collected of 7 per cent. The Government set out a target national performance level of 68 per cent. in the payment rate by end of March 2003.
<P>

<a name="30314w14.html_para2">The payment rate currently includes confiscation orders as well as fines, so individual areas can see their figures distorted by high confiscation orders imposed in one quarter and collected at a later date.
<P>

<a name="30314w14.html_para3">Some MCCs have demonstrated significant improvements in performance: Avon and Somerset (from 54 per cent. to 73 per cent.), Gloucestershire (from 42 per cent. to 73 per cent.) and South Wales (from 39 per cent. to 50 per cent.). Others have seen performance fall, such as GLMCA, which has deteriorated from 46 per cent. to 38 per cent.
<P>

<a name="30314w14.html_para4">The total amount of money collected in the 12 months to December 2002 has increased by &#163;2.3 million (or 1 per cent.) compared to previous year. However the total new amount owed has increased by 6.9 per cent. The current rolling year payment rate is 56 per cent. compared to 59 per cent. a year ago. Excluding the Greater London Magistrates' Courts' Authority the payment rate is 62 per cent.

<a name="30314w16.html_para2">Like other applications for Sector Skills Council (SSC) status, the application will be subject to approval by the Sector Skills Development Agency, but this initiative has my full support.

<a name="30314w16.html_para3">Assuming Cogent Plus is formally approved as an SSC it will take forward implementation of the recommendations set out in the report on nuclear skills published by the Department last year. These related in particular to the promotion of science and engineering to young people, the provision of support to teachers, the development of national occupational standards, the wider adoption of modern apprenticeship schemes within the nuclear sector and the building of alliances with universities with a view to the development of customised courses and academic centres of excellence capable of servicing the future needs and requirements of the nuclear sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what steps his Department has taken to <i>(a)</i> recognise British Sign Language and <i>(b)</i> improve access to public services for British Sign Language users; and if he will make a statement. [102900]<P>

<a name="30314w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 We have held discussions with various interested organisations, the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) requires service providers to consider making reasonable adjustments to the way they provide their services so they are accessible to disabled people. The provision of a BSL interpreter could be considered a reasonable adjustment. The DRC's Code of Practice (Rights, Goods, Facilities, Services and Premises) includes examples of situations where providing a BSL interpreter might be a reasonable adjustment.
<P>

<a name="30314w17.html_para7">The Government have funded projects with the Council for the Advancement of Communication with Deaf People and the Royal National Institute for Deaf People to increase the number of BSL interpreters and to improve the infrastructure for interpreter training and assessment.

<a name="30314w17.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Webb: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the implications of recent developments in paediatric medicine requiring intensive nursing support by parents for the start date of disability living allowance payments for children being discharged from hospital; and if he will make a statement.  [101345]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30314w17.html_spnew8"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 Developments in paediatric medicine do not alter the rules for the start date of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) for children being discharged from hospital. For all rates and components of DLA, the qualifying rules must have been satisfied for a period of at least three months before DLA can be paid. Where that qualifying period has been completed, the payment of DLA claimed and awarded while children are in hospital starts when they are discharged to their home address. Payments of DLA are reinstated on discharge for children who were receiving the allowance before they went into hospital for more than 12 weeks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions pursuant to his answers of 19 December 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 999&#150;1000W, on fairground safety, when the National Fairground Inspection Team was established; what its terms of reference are; how many members it has; to whom it reports; and what recommendations it has made since its establishment.  [100770]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30314w18.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The National Fairground Inspection Team was established in April 2002.
<P>

<a name="30314w18.html_para0">The terms of reference and purpose of the National Fairground Inspection Team are to provide the operational contribution to the Health and Safety Executive's (HSE's) strategy and workplan for fairground safety. This involves inspection, investigation and other initiatives to address significant risks. It also secures compliance with health and safety law and improves safety management in the industry. The team provides a focus for fairground inspection and ensures continuity of expertise.
<P>

<a name="30314w18.html_para1">The team is made up of local inspectors from HSE's Field Operations Directorate (FOD) located at HSE offices throughout the country. There are currently 37 inspectors and 12 principal inspectors who are nominated members of the National Fairground Inspection Team. Inspectors are not dedicated full time to the team but carry out their fairgrounds work in a planned way as part of their normal range of work. In addition, the Team may call on specialised disciplines (e.g. mechanical, structural, electrical, medical etc.) within HSE, and use the services of specialist contractors should the need arise.
<P>

<a name="30314w18.html_para2">The team is directed and coordinated by HSE's Food and Entertainment Sector and reports through the HSE Director Scotland to the Director of Field Operations.
<P>

<a name="30314w18.html_para3">The National Fairground Inspection Team does not make direct recommendations but provides operational intelligence to inform the HSE strategy and how it can best be taken forward.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (1) how much has been levied in fines by the Health and Safety Executive against <i>(a)</i> companies, <i>(b)</i> local authorities and <i>(c)</i> individuals with regard to incidences of pollution broken down by the type of pollution incidence, (i) in total, (ii) in each region and (iii) per fine in each year since 1995;  [99258]
<P>
<UL>(2) what assessment has been made or is planned of the effectiveness of fines levied by the Health and Safety Executive on polluters in preventing <i>(a)</i> further incidences of pollution by the polluters and <i>(b)</i> incidences of pollution from others who have not previously polluted; what changes are planned; and if he will make a statement.  [99259]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30314w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown: </B> 
 The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) does not levy fines. When appropriate, HSE brings, or in Scotland recommends, prosecutions so that the courts may consider imposing fines following any conviction.
<P>

<a name="30314w18.html_para6">Responsibility for regulating environmental pollution does not reside with HSE. The Health and Safety Commission (HSC) and HSE have limited statutory responsibility in respect of the environment. Where they do have environmental involvement, HSE's activity is defined by the scope of the Health and Safety at Work etc. Act 1974. These matters include legislation involving control of major accident hazards, licensing and decommissioning of nuclear reactors, carriage of dangerous goods, notification of new substances, biocidal products, non-agricultural pesticides and Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs).
<P>

<a name="30314w18.html_para7">HSE does have an enforcement role in these areas, and the boundaries between its role and those of the Environment Agency (EA) and Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), are set out in Memoranda of Understanding.

 All employers have a duty under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974 to protect the health, safety and welfare of their employees, and this duty includes any risks arising from passive smoking.
<P>

<a name="30314w18.html_para8">More specifically, the Workplace (Health Safety and Welfare) Regulations 1992 require employers to protect non-smokers from discomfort caused by tobacco smoke in rest rooms and rest areas. This means that employers must either provide separate rest rooms/areas for smokers and non smokers or prohibit smoking in rest rooms/areas.
<P>

<a name="30314w18.html_para9">Free guidance published by HSE provides advice to employers on introducing effective smoking policies in the workplace. The guidance advises that employers must ensure that there are arrangements to protect non-smokers from discomfort caused by tobacco smoke in rest rooms or rest areas.
