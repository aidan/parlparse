 The Ministry of Justice has consulted twice about improving the accountability and openness of family courts. Central to this openness has been recognition of the need for better provision of information about the work of the family courts. There are clear benefits to the public having access to a record of the decisions courts have made, which reflects the public interest in the due administration of justice.</p>

The courts in the pilot areas will for the first time routinely produce for county court and High Court cases, a written record of the court's decision, i.e. a hard copy of a judgment. Family Proceedings Courts will continue to provide the written reasons, which they are already required to do. The judgments or written reasons will be: (1) issued to the parties, (2) retained on the court file for the child to access on reaching adulthood, should they choose to do so; and (3) made anonymous and published online for the public to view.</p>

 Some progress is being made in improving the number of women judges in England and Wales.

At District Judge level and below, women account for 25.6 per cent. of the judiciary. In the senior judiciary, the recent appointment of five female High Court judges will bring the total number of female judges in the High Court and above to 20, the highest ever number, out of a total of 164 in the senior judiciary (High Court, Court of Appeal, Heads of Division and Law Lords).</p>

 The Government are working with a range of partners to get more people more active and encourage participation among young people in a range of physical activities including Olympic Sports. Following the publication of Sport England's new strategy, Sport England is working with 46 sports to develop funding submissions for the period 2009-13, which will set out ways in which those sports can contribute to a world-class community sports system in the UK. The 46 sports include all the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Sports, and as part of the funding submissions sports will be asked to set out proposals for the talent development pathways.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_47"><a name="81017w0004.htm_para3"><a name="08101750001194">Those sports able to demonstrate an ability to deliver against the talent development outcome will be commissioned to do so. Sport England officers have been guiding sports through the commissioning process, offering them significant technical input into the production of their funding submissions. This is to ensure that all sports fully understand the process and articulate as clearly as possible the potential of their sport to deliver against Sport England's strategic outcomes.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_48"><a name="81017w0004.htm_para4"><a name="08101750001195">Sport England has also recently made awards totalling &#163;4.5 million to support the Playground to Podium programme. This programme will provide a framework for people with a disability to benefit from high quality physical education in schools and high quality coaching and performance environments in the community. This will lead on to the Paralympic World Class Programmes for those athletes who have the ability and the desire.</p>

These arrangements replaced the use of First Class Mail. In the last year of the Royal Mail arrangements losses accounted for around 0.06 per cent of passports posted. Since the introduction of Secure Delivery, the rate is around 0.011 per cent. a reduction of over 80 per cent.</p>

 Passports are delivered by Secure Mail Services (SMS) courier. The Identity and Passport Service (IPS) has provided SMS with instructions as to whether a signature is required or not, dependent upon known losses for the postcode, and the premises being delivered to. This flexible approach means that the integrity of the delivery process, and the passport, is maintained while minimising the need for customers to be at home to receive their passport. Around 3 per cent. of courier deliveries require a signature on delivery.</p>

1 All figures are consistent with Budget 2008, as well as expenditure information published on the internet at<br>
www.dwp.gov.uk/asd/asd4/expenditure.asp.<br>
2 Figures are rounded to the nearest million pounds. Totals may not sum due to rounding.<br>
3 Responsibility for War Pensions passed to the Veterans Agency in 2002-03. Therefore this benefit is not included in the tables. Independent Living Fund (ILF) figures are also not included in the table as this benefit comes under Departmental Expenditure Limits (DEL) from 2008-09 onwards.<br>
4. The state pension figure in the table includes the child element of the pensioner benefit.<br>
5. Age related payments include one off payments made to pensioners over 65 years of age in 2004-05 and to people over 65 years and 70 years of age in 2005-06.<br>
6. The projections of benefit expenditure from 2015-16 to 2030-31 take account of the reforms in the Pensions Act 2007. These are illustrative projections, in that they are designed to show the overall fiscal sustainability of benefit policy, as it stands at 2010-11 (the end of the current planning period), along with any future changes to benefits that have already been decided upon, under a particular set of reasonable assumptions. Legislation provides that earnings uprating of BSP will begin in the next Parliament. These projections assume it commences in 2012. In addition, the projections are part of a series showing a broad path of expenditure up to 2050-51. The projections shown are for the United Kingdom, unlike other forecasts up to and including 2010-11 which only cover Great Britain : for TV Licence payments all figures cover the UK.<br>

 FireBuy was established as the national procurement body for the English Fire and Rescue Service in March 2006. A large number of fire and rescue authorities are now using the contracts and framework arrangements set up by FireBuy. These include smoke alarms, hand-held radios, and a range of specialist fire vehicles and appliances. Other national contract arrangements, for items such as clothing, personal protective equipment and breathing apparatus, are now becoming available and are also likely to be widely used by fire and rescue authorities, as well as a range of other public sector bodies.</p>

<i> [holding answer 8 October 2008]:</i> The Government will not set allocations for individual organisations participating in the carbon reduction commitment. Instead the Government will set a cap for the total number of allowances available for all participants. Organisations will be required to surrender sufficient allowances to cover their annual emissions and may purchase these through an annual sale or auction, or on the secondary market. Organisations will therefore decide on the basis of their emissions reduction strategy how many allowances they need to buy. There will be a three year introductory phase where participants will be able to purchase unrestricted quantities of allowances at a set price. After the introductory phase a cap will be set on the number of allowances available and the market will determine the price of allowances. The sale or auction revenues will be recycled to organisations according to their position in the carbon reduction commitment league table.</p>

 It is not possible to provide an accurate breakdown for each of the last three years as the majority of Government spending is provided as part of wider funding to schools for the provision of technology. This has been supported by comprehensive guidance to all schools on the importance of internet safety.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_135"><a name="81017w0021.htm_para5"><a name="08101750005950">Specific initiatives to raise public awareness of internet safety include developing a dedicated training module for UK Online Centres and an investment of &#163;1 million in the Know It All range of CDs for parents to promote internet safety in the home. The Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP) have spent &#163;454,000 from 2006-08 on its ThinkUKnow internet safety education programme.</p>

We recognise that there may be additional costs associated with delivering some of Dr. Byron&#146;s recommendations, and we will consider how these can be funded as they are identified.</p>

 The Government have been in close contact with UN, EU, North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), G7, and Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) partners, and the parties to the conflict, in the search for a peaceful resolution to the dispute between Russia and Georgia.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_182"><a name="81017w0025.htm_para0"><a name="08101750006520">On 12 August, the Government supported EU/OSCE efforts which successfully brokered a six-point ceasefire plan between the parties to the conflict. This plan provided the basis for the agreement between Presidents Sarkozy and Medvedev on 8 September of a supplementary set of commitments, and set the context for the decision by EU Foreign Ministers on 15 September to deploy an EU monitoring mission to Georgia by 1 October. The mission deployed by the agreed deadline and is on the ground. The UK has made a significant contribution of 21 personnel and four armoured cars, in addition to earlier immediate humanitarian aid of &#163;2 million.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_183"><a name="81017w0025.htm_para1"><a name="08101750006521">The Sarkozy/Medvedev agreement, along with the original six-point plan, constitutes a serious set of commitments to the international community, and lays the basis for a lasting and peaceful resolution of the dispute between Russia and Georgia. Under that agreement, talks on security and stability in South Ossetia and Abkhazia will begin in Geneva on 15 October, under EU chairmanship, with UN and OSCE participation. We are pressing the parties to the conflict to abide by their commitments.</p>

 Over the years, the UK, EU and its other allies have warned the Georgian government that any attempt to take over the two separatist regions (Abkhazia and South Ossetia) by force would be counterproductive.</p>

 My right hon. Friend Foreign Secretary has had a number of meetings with international leaders concerning the outbreak of conflict in South Ossetia since hostilities began.
