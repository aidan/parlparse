In order to be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, a project must be for one of the “permissible purposes” listed in section 5(3) of the Act. These include: the prevention (whether by the testing of any product or otherwise) or the diagnosis or treatment of disease, ill-health or abnormality, or their effects, in man, animals or plants; the assessment, detection, regulation or modification of physiological conditions in man, animals or plants; and the advancement of knowledge in biological or behavioural sciences. All research using beagles would have had to satisfy one or more of these requirements.</p>

 This Government are committed to reducing regulatory burdens. Between 1 March 2011 and 31 May 2011 the Government Equalities Office repealed the three separate public sector equality duties on race, disability and gender and supporting regulations imposing specific duties for each, with different timescales and reporting requirements. On 5 April 2011 the Government brought into force the new single Equality Duty contained in the Equality Act 2010. This brought together the previous equality duties and extended to cover age, gender reassignment in full, religion or belief and sexual orientation.</p>

 The effect of removing eligibility of organ repairs, bells, clocks and pews from the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme will be to return it to its original scope before it was widened to include these items in 2006. We estimate that the overall effect on money claimed under the scheme will be to reduce it closer to the available budget of £12 million. We have not made an individual estimate of the specific impact on organ repairs, but it is worth noting that they took place continuously and successfully before being included in the scheme in 2006, so we do not expect a serious permanent reduction.</p>

 The Government have made clear that it is for individual local authorities to decide on the collection and recycling policies which are most suitable for their customers and fitting for their local circumstances. However, DEFRA supports the London Waste and Recycling Board (LWARB), including its work with the London Community Resource Network, its recently established subsidiary London Reuse Limited, and London boroughs to look at developing shared collection, storage and distribution facilities that can be accessed by reuse projects across London. LWARB is also assessing the feasibility of developing a London-wide web portal that provides access to reuse and recycling options for both consumers and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).</p>

 We maintain diplomatic relations with the Libyan Government. The Libyan People's Bureau (LPB) in London remains open and has been headed by a Charge d'Affaires following the expulsion of the Libyan ambassador on 30 April. We have used these links to make clear to the regime that it must comply in full with UN Security Council resolutions 1970 and 1973, desist from further violence and withdraw military forces to barracks. We have made it clear to the regime that Qadhafi must go. We also use our contacts with the LPB to address issues concerning Libyan citizens resident in the UK. Apart from this we have kept our contacts with the LPB to the very minimum.</p>

 The UK has taken the lead in international efforts to impose and implement financial sanctions on the Qadhafi regime. We and our EU partners have implemented the sanctions elements of UN Security Council Resolutions 1970 and 1973 through EU Regulations 204, 233, 272, 288, 296 and 360, which have steadily extended and updated the range of regime-linked individuals and entities subject to asset freezes. On 11 March 2011 the UN also established a Sanctions Committee to monitor the implementation of UN Security Council Resolutions 1970, chaired by Portugal. We are offering guidance and support to the Sanctions Committee. The targeted sanctions imposed under these UN Resolutions have squeezed the regime financially, making it harder for Colonel Qadhafi and his associates to fuel the war further.</p>

 The Government recognise the importance of carer’s allowance in providing an independent source of income and recognition of the important role that carers play in society. We acknowledge carers’ concerns on the level of carer’s allowance, and over the last few months have had a number of representations on this from Members of Parliament and from groups representing carers, including Carers UK.</p>

               <a name="11062019000029"> The rate of carer’s allowance is increased every April in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The Government keep the level of carer’s allowance under review, but carers in lower income households can receive additional help through the income- related benefits, such as income support, housing benefit and council tax benefit. These benefits include a carer premium of £31.00 a week. Carers will also be supported through the universal credit from 2013.</p>

 As set out in the Coalition Document, the Government are committed to eradicating child poverty in the UK by 2020. We published our strategy for doing so in April. It sets out a new approach to tackling poverty and securing social justice aimed at transforming lives and tackling the causes of poverty. At its heart are the principles of work, fairness, responsibility and support for the most vulnerable. It draws together our radical programme of reform of welfare and education, increasing children's life chances, with a greater concentration on early intervention and on whole-family and whole-life measures. Our strategy establishes a UK-wide framework for tackling child poverty and builds on strategies developed by the devolved Administrations, including that published by the Scottish Government in March this year.</p>

<sup>(3)</sup> The Deprived Areas Fund was broadly similar to a range of earlier programmes, specifically Working Neighbourhood Pilots, External and Internal Action teams and Ethnic Minority Outreach. Spend figures prior to 2007-08 relate to these earlier programmes.
<sup>(4)</sup> The large peak in ADF spend in 2009-10 arose as part of the package of measures to help address the economic downturn. This included allowing newly unemployed customers, access to support under ADF from day one of their jobseekers' allowance (JSA) claim. This easement gave advisers the flexibility to tailor the help and support they offered to suit customer needs and deal with any small challenges that may have otherwise prevented a customer from obtaining a specific job more, quickly. Prior to this ADF was only available to people who had been in continuous receipt of JSA for 26 weeks or more, unless they were participating in one of the New Deal schemes. In 2010 stricter cost controls were put in place to reduce the spend along with a number of changes in scope, for example, ADF was no longer used to fund training for an individual which would otherwise be available through other employment programmes.
<sup>(5)</sup> Customer Services Director's Flexible Fund was only operational from 2009-10.
<sup>(6)</sup> These allowances and expenses were only payable from 2006/07 onwards.

 There is currently a presumption against closure of rural primary schools. This was introduced in 1998 and reinforced in the 2006 Education and Inspections Act. Although this presumption exists, the presumption does not mean that no rural school will ever close, but it does ensure that the case for closure is strong and that the proposals are clearly in the best interests of educational provision in the area. We recognise the importance of preserving access to a local school for rural communities and therefore plan for the presumption against the closure of rural schools to continue.</p>

 The Department is proposing to introduce a requirement for UKAS accreditation to standard EN 45011 for all Building Regulations competent person self-certification schemes, including those authorised for the installation of solid fuel combustion appliances. Accreditation to this standard will improve the consistency of the quality assurance systems of the schemes, particularly in respect of the assessment of the technical competence and monitoring of activities of their members. This will also help to improve compliance with the Building Regulations to the benefit of the customers of the members.</p>

 Local authorities already have powers under the Housing Act 2004 to take action against the owners of properties which are not properly maintained. If, having made an assessment under the Housing Health and Safety Rating System, a property is found to contain serious (category 1) hazards, the local authority has a duty to take the most appropriate action. This could range from trying to deal with the problems informally at first to prohibiting the use of the whole or part of the dwelling depending on the severity of the hazard. Failure to comply with a statutory notice could lead to a fine of up to £5,000.</p>

               <a name="11062023000429"> The method makes use of the internationally applied concept of attributable fractions. In the case of alcohol-related admissions, an attributable fraction represents the estimated percentage of admissions that can be attributed to alcohol consumption. The NWPHO estimated fractions for the 47 conditions for which there was sufficient epidemiological evidence that the risk of morbidity is affected by alcohol consumption. In some cases, such as alcoholic liver disease, the conditions are wholly attributable to alcohol, in which case the attributable fraction is 1, or 100%. In the case of partially attributable conditions, the fractions often vary by age and sex. The list includes chronic conditions such as some cancers, acute conditions such as ethanol poisoning, and external causes such as road accidents.</p>

This meant that primary care trusts (PCTs) could decide locally when to start implementing the programme.

We estimate that during 2010-11 approximately 1.4 million checks were offered and about 820,000 were delivered.</p>

This has enabled us to work closely with SHAs to ensure that PCTs' plans for implementing the programme are aimed at reaching 18% of their eligible cohort and that the data they return are of better quality. This will enable the data on the number of NHS Health Checks carried out to be published on a quarterly basis from Quarter 1 of 2011-12 onwards.</p>

                     <sup>(1 )</sup>Period life expectancy at age 65 is an estimate of the average number of years a 65 year old would survive if he or she experienced the area's age-specific mortality rates for that time period throughout the rest of his or her life. The figure reflects mortality among those living in the area in each time period, rather than mortality among those born in each area. It is not therefore the number of years a 65 year old living in the area in each time period could actually expect to live, both because the death rates of the area are likely to change in the future and because many of those currently living in the area will live elsewhere for at least some part of their lives.

<i>Note:</i>
Coefficients of Variation have been calculated for the latest period as an indication of the quality of the estimates. See Guide to Quality below.
<i>Guide to Quality:</i>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV—for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220
<i>Key:</i>
* 0 ≤ CV&lt;5%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered precise
** 5 ≤ CV &lt;10%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered reasonably precise
*** 10 ≤ CV &lt;20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered acceptable
**** CV ≥ 20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes
CV = Coefficient of Variation

<i>Note:</i>
Coefficients of Variation have been calculated for the latest period as an indication of the quality of the estimates. See Guide to Quality below.
<i>Guide to Quality:</i>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV—for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220
<i>Key:</i>
* 0 ≤ CV&lt;5%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered precise
** 5 ≤ CV &lt;10%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered reasonably precise
*** 10 ≤ CV &lt;20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered acceptable
**** CV ≥ 20%—Statistical Robustness: Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes
CV = Coefficient of Variation

               <i>[holding answer 20 December 2010]:</i> Fractional reserve banking is a term to describe how the modern banking system operates. Fractional reserve banking means that only a fraction of banks deposits are backed by actual cash on hand and available for withdrawal. A non-fractional reserve banking system would operate on the basis that where a deposit was lodged in a bank, the bank would safeguard this deposit, usually by placing in a vault. It would do nothing with the money and would charge a fee for the service.</p>

               <a name="11062026000254"> Banking capital requirement guidelines are set by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision. In November 2010, G20 Leaders endorsed the “Basel III” reform package proposed by the Committee. The package will more than triple the amount of high quality capital banks will be required to hold, helping them to survive losses and continue to lend. Ending the fractional reserve banking system has not been considered as a viable policy option for the UK economy; no assessment of the likely effects on industry has been made.</p>

 The Monetary Policy Committee of the Bank of England is operationally independent in setting monetary policy to meet the inflation target, including bank rate and the level of asset purchases under quantitative easing (QE). The MPC takes all relevant factors, including the cost of borrowing for businesses and consumers, into account in its assessment of the balance of risks to inflation in the medium term. The Bank's May 2009 Inflation Report explains how asset purchases work to stimulate nominal spending along various channels.  <br/>

 The Ministry of Justice announced in the Green Paper, ‘Breaking the Cycle’, published in December 2010, that it will test a local approach to payment by results. The aim is to encourage local statutory partners to reduce crime and reoffending, and enable them to reinvest any savings that their success realises for the justice system in further activity to prevent reoffending in their communities. The pilots will be fully evaluated.</p>

The evaluation will monitor reoffending and crime rates, as well as a wider range of criminal justice system data trends, in each local area. It will use a mix of qualitative and quantitative data.</p>

 In December the Government set out proposals for the reform of sentencing in the Green Paper, “Breaking the Cycle: Effective Punishment, Rehabilitation and Sentencing of Offenders”. This was followed by a 12 week consultation period which closed on 4 March 2011, and I am pleased to say that we received over 1,200 responses. We are considering these responses, and will set out our more detailed plans in the Government's response to the consultation, which will be published shortly.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> From 1 June 2000 the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 came into force nationally and removed the use of cautions for persons under 18 and replaced them with reprimands and warnings.
<sup>(2 )</sup>The cautions statistics relate to persons for whom these offences were the principal offences for which they were dealt with. When an offender has been cautioned for two or more offences at the same time the principal offence is the more serious offence.
<sup>(3)</sup> Every effort is made to ensure that the figures presented are accurate and complete. However, it is important to note that these data have been extracted from large administrative data systems generated by police forces. As a consequence, care should be taken to ensure data collection processes and their inevitable limitations are taken into account when those data are used.
<sup>(4)</sup> Standardisation of offence groups—‘concealment of birth’, will be included in the offence group ‘other indictable offences’, moving from ‘violence against the person’; changing the classification of an offence committed by approximately five defendants each year.
<sup>(5)</sup> Standardisation of offence groups—‘bigamy’, will be included in the offence group ‘other indictable offences’, moving from ‘sexual offences’, changing the classification of an offence committed by approximately 20 defendants each year.

Since 2009 information on cases received is collected on central systems, but cannot be readily extracted and collated at the present time due to the way the data are held. The available statistics on magistrates court workloads relates to the number of criminal proceedings completed. Figures for all magistrates courts in England and Wales from 2008 to 2010 are also presented in the table. Statistics are not available prior to April 2007 on a comparable basis due to changes in the data collection method. Information regarding the number of cases awaiting trial is also not available since it is not collected centrally and could be obtained from court files only at disproportionate cost.</p>

<sup>(2)</sup> Sent for trial cases under s51 CDA 1998 were introduced nationally on 15 January 2001 before this figures are from the pilot programme, resulting in an increase in the number of trials received in the Crown court in 2001.
<sup>(3)</sup> Crown court statistics before 2000 were obtained from CREST via our historical database.
<sup>(4)</sup> Criminal proceedings completed in the magistrates courts includes indictable only cases, triable either-way cases, summary motoring, summary non-motoring, youth proceeding and breaches. These figures are based on the number of completed proceedings.
<sup>(5 )</sup>Magistrates courts changed their data collection systems from legacy systems to Libra during this time. Statistics are not available prior to April 2007 on a comparable basis due to changes in the data collection method, so figures for 2007 are not provided.
<sup>(6)</sup> The figures for 2010 are provisional; revised statistics will be published in ‘Judicial and Court Statistics’ on 30 June 2011.

 Of the Crown court cases listed for trial in 2010, around 39% ended on the trial date before the jury was sworn (no further trial time required) due to a defendant entering a late guilty plea or pleading guilty  to an alternative charge which was accepted by the prosecution. Information on the proportion of Crown court cases listed for trial that resulted in a guilty plea being entered after the announcement of a trial date can be obtained only at a disproportionate cost as the announcement date is not held centrally.</p>

                     <sup>(1)</sup> From the June 2008 survey, the youth data is collected from the four-week sample via a web-based method of collecting TIS data called the One Performance Truth (OPT) (the pre-existing method of youth data collection has been available up until March 2009). Using this method has brought a number of improvements, including validation of the data ‘live’ as it is entered, collection of data at court level rather than clerkship level (as previously done).
<sup>(2)</sup> A youth defendant is classified as being aged 10 to 17 on the date when an offence was alleged to have been committed.
<sup>(3)</sup> From 1995 to 1998 data were collected based on the number of defendants appearing in either adult or youth courts. From 1999 onwards defendant details were collected specifically, therefore allowing the identification of youth cases listed in adult courts as well as those appearing in a youth court. As this may partly explain the increase in the proportion of those pleading guilty at the first hearing, caution should be applied when interpreting the figures shown in the table and comparing them with subsequent years' results.
<sup>(4)</sup> From 1995 to 1998, the results are based on completed criminal proceedings in one sample week in February, June and October. From 1999 onwards, information on youth defendants in all criminal completed proceedings was collected in a four week period.
<sup>(5)</sup> From the February 2000 survey, there is now one survey in each quarter. The results are now based on March, June, September and December surveys.

 Young adults sentenced to detention in a young offender institution (DYOI) are detained in young offender institutions (YOIs) as required by section 98 of the Powers of the Criminal Courts (Sentencing) Act 2000. These are normally self-contained but in some instances are situated within an adult prison with which they share the majority of their facilities. Whatever the location, young adults detained in YOIs have separate sleeping accommodation and are always managed in accordance with the YOI rules.

Despite this, creditors often have to resort to court action because of a lack of debtor engagement for dealing with disputes including money, debt and other issues. Cases fall into the court system often for the wrong reasons, sometimes because people are unaware of alternatives or have not used the advice services that are available to help resolve disputes. To assist with resolving cases that have reached court without the need for further costs, county courts display notices giving the contact details of free advice providers.</p>

 The grading structure in the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) differs from the rest of the Ministry of Justice (MOJ). The definition of grade C is different in each case. Senior Manager C in NOMS refers to a more senior responsibility level than a Band C in MOJ. The equivalent of a Senior Manager C within MOJ is Band A. It is this level for which information is supplied in the answer.</p>

 For the purpose of this answer, an adult prisoner is taken to be a prisoner held in an “adult” establishment, i.e. any prison that is not a young offender institution (which hold prisoners up to age 21). The overall average resource cost per prisoner held in an adult establishment in England and Wales for 2009-10 is £39,000. The average resource cost per place is £43,000. This is the latest period for which figures are available. Figures rounded to the nearest thousand.</p>

 The decision to place a sexual offender in approved premises is taken by the Probation Trust which has statutory responsibility for supervising the offender, in consultation with the other local agencies involved in MAPPA and the manager of the relevant approved premises. The primary consideration is whether the risk of harm posed by the offender to others would be most effectively managed by the enhanced supervision provided in an approved premises. The decision to admit an offender to a particular approved premises is based upon an assessment of the risk of serious harm posed by the offender to the public, victims, and other residents or staff.</p>

1. The figures for financial years 2001-02 to 2007-08 are the net operating costs recorded in the annual consolidated accounts of local probation boards. These accounts are available from the House Library.
 2. The figures for 2008-09 and 2009-10 are taken from the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) Agency annual accounts and supporting data.
 3. Following standard accounting practice, local boards. and trusts. pension contributions are not fully reflected in the figures.
 4. Expenditure on probation met centrally by the National Probation Directorate (as was) and the National Offender Management Service is not included in local areas’ expenditure.
 5. Comparisons over time are difficult due to changes in accounting methodology.

 The Government have decided to abolish the Youth Justice Board (YJB) and deliver its main functions from a newly created youth justice division within the Ministry of Justice. These functions include the oversight of youth offending teams, disseminating effective practice, commissioning a distinct secure estate and placing young people in custody. The YJB is responsible for offenders aged under 18 so its abolition will not impact on provision for young adult offenders.</p>

 The Department has an established working relationship with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and I am delighted that this Government is implementing the recommendations from Lord Young's recent review of HSE in the UK. As these questions suggest, there are a number of ideas in circulation about how the UK's HSE regime could be still further improved in ways that reduce the costs and burdens to business. I will be very interested to see the impact of proposals developed by the Ministry of Justice to tackle the “litigation culture”, in the wake of Lord Justice Jackson's consideration of the “no win, no fee” conditional fee arrangements (November 2010). In addition, there is a current independent review commissioned by the Minister for Employment my right hon. Friend the Member for Epsom and Ewell (Chris Grayling) of HSE legislation which is being undertaken by Professor Ragnar Löfstedt, Director of the Centre for Risk Management at King's College, London. I also look forward to hearing the views of business and other stakeholders when the Red Tape Challenge turns its attention to HSE at the end of June.</p>

               <i>[holding answer 17 June 2011]:</i> Eliminating non-tariff barriers (NTBs) to trade and, as far as possible, preventing the establishment of new NTBs, is a key UK objective in Free Trade Agreement (FTA) negotiations. We agreed annexes to address NTBs in the EU-South Korea FTA, and we are pressing hard for NTBs to be tackled in other FTAs, including the EU-lndia FTA where addressing NTBs in the automobile sector is a particular priority.</p>

               <i>]:</i>The benefits to the EU from tackling non-tariff barriers (NTBs) in free trade agreements (FTAs) can be substantial but in all trade deals there will be some adjustment costs. For the EU-South Korea, the elimination of NTBs in the final agreement was the major factor behind the anticipated gains increasing from €19 billion (in earlier estimates) to €33 billion. Negotiations on the EU-India FTA are ongoing, and negotiations with Japan are yet to be launched. In both, the reduction of NTBs will be a key UK objective.</p>

 To date, engagement by the Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) with Ofgem on the visual impact of overhead power lines has been at official level as part of Ofgem's next transmission price control review (RIIO-T1). This has involved bilateral discussions, correspondence and participation at stakeholder events such as the Price Control Review Forum and RIIO Working Groups. Where new and replacement pylons are required, DECC is keen to support the development of the most visually acceptable overhead solutions. The Royal Institute of British Architects is therefore running a competition on behalf of DECC and National Grid that calls for designs for a new generation of pylon. A key element to the competition will be a public consultation exercise in September which will provide members of the public with a chance to comment on the best designs.

 There is a wide body of research into the lifecycle performance of technologies supported by both feed-in tariffs and the renewable heat incentive. For example, two UK specific studies estimate average carbon footprints of 88 gCO2eq/kWh for domestic solar photovoltaics and 68gCO2eq/kWh for 600W micro-wind<sup>(1)</sup>. Carbon footprints for such systems have been falling due to efficiency improvements in their production. For comparison, another UK study estimates a carbon footprint of 488 gCO2eq/kWh for electricity from a combined cycle gas turbine<sup>(2)</sup>.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change what his Department's most recent estimate is of the number of <i>(a)</i> schools, <i>(b)</i> hospitals, <i>(c)</i> other public buildings and <i>(d)</i> community buildings that will be fitted with solar photovoltaic installations with a generating capacity between 50 and 100 kilowatts under the feed-in tariff scheme in the year after 1 August 2011.

 The design of tariffs under the feed-in tariffs (FITs) scheme, as completed by the last Government, is based on the technology and generation capacity of the installation and not on generator type. Therefore, we do not currently have the information requested either for existing installations or future installations.</p>

               <a name="1106214000272"> As confirmed in the recent Government response to the fast-track review of the FITs scheme, the intention is that from 1 August 2011 a new tariff of 19.0p/kWh will apply to solar photovoltaic installations of between 50 and 150 kW. We consider that this will deliver a 5% internal rate of return for well located installations, which could include those on community buildings.</p>
