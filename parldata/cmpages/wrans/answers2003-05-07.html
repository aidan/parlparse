<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w01.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Coffee growers have been hit by low prices and deteriorating quality, the result of global over-supply and structural imbalances in the industry. The Government will support efforts to find solutions at the G8 summit and in follow-up work after the summit, notably for poor countries in Africa.
<P>

<a name="30507w01.html_para4">There are a number of possibilities. The UK is already contributing to a sustainable coffee market by helping growers to diversify through its development programme; trying to expand the trade opportunities of commodity-dependent countries, cut tariffs and reduce the negative impact of the CAP. We are promoting foreign investment and good regulatory frameworks, increasing the aid budget to 0.40 per cent. of national income by 2005&#150;06 and advocating more debt relief to

 When any business seeks protection from its creditors by appointing an administrator, the Inland Revenue is bound by insolvency law just like any other creditors.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w01.html_spnew8"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Iraq's isolation from the international community, combined with the impact of two wars and 12 years of sanctions, means that reliable data on the Iraqi economy are extremely scarce. The World bank has not maintained active operations in Iraq (the last loan approved was in 1973) and regular reports by the international financial institutions on the economy, such as IMF Annual Article IV reports, have not been compiled for some years.
<P>

<a name="30507w01.html_para5">In accordance with its guidelines for working with countries in conflict, the World Bank closely monitors developments in Iraq and maintains contacts with the United Nations and international donors to exchange information and build a knowledge base on the evolving socio-economic and humanitarian conditions on the ground.

 All imports from Iraq remain prohibited without an import licence while United Nations sanctions remain in force. Prior to sanctions being imposed in 1990, imports from Iraq were eligible for reduced rates of customs duty under the Generalised System of Preferences.

 If the Treasury receives complaints about the sale of stakeholder pensions, it refers complainants to the firm concerned. Where it is evident that the complainant has already complained to the firm concerned, and is dissatisfied with the handling of his complaint, the complainant is generally referred to the Financial Ombudsman Service.
<P>

<a name="30507w02.html_para1">The Financial Ombudsman Service tells me that, between 1 April 2002 and 31 March 2003, they received 115 complaints about stakeholder pensions.
<P>

<a name="30507w02.html_para2">These complaints principally concerned administrative difficulties at the time of the initial purchase, in collecting premiums, in promptly transferring money into plans, and in providing information at the point of sale.

 Claim forms for working and child tax credits were sent to all individuals and couples who were receiving disabled person's tax credit. Awards are already being paid to all those who made their claims by 31 January 2003, except in a very few cases where further information is needed to make a decision on the claim. In these cases, the Inland Revenue should already have been in touch with claimants to ask for further information.

 There are a number of 'passported benefits' that may attach to the new tax credits, and the tax credits award notice and accompanying notes alert people to the fact they may qualify as a result of their award. In addition, a new Inland Revenue leaflet providing information and giving contact points for details on some of the more common benefits was published on the Inland Revenue website on 2 May 2003 . It will soon also be available in paper format.

 We have already implemented recommendations from the Performance and Innovation Unit Report, "Winning The Generation Game". The Department has already implemented policies to allow staff to stay on up to age 65, and we have delivered the Green Paper on Pensions.

<a name="30507w04.html_para0">We are currently developing our policy on age alongside new legislation from the EC Article 13 Employment and Race Directives. The legislation to outlaw unfair discrimination at work on the grounds of age is required to be in place by December 2006.

We are currently working with the Employers Forum on Age to progress age diversity policies by using their policy review toolkit 'One Step Ahead'. The toolkit sets out the framework to enable employers to undertake a comprehensive age equality review and to deliver age "neutrality" across the business. The toolkit will shortly be issued across the DWP HR community.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what assessment he has made of the impact of the Part-time Workers Directive on staff in his Department.  [109264]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w04.html_spnew2"><B> Maria Eagle: </B> 
 The Part-time Workers Directive has not had a significant impact on staff in DWP. Existing policies already provided a range of working patterns for all our staff, both male and female. Full-time staff can work in non-traditional ways (e.g. compressed hours, informal home-working), and part-time staff can work part year, for example during school terms but not during school holidays.
<P>

<a name="30507w04.html_para7">We also recognise that some part-time staff do not have children; they have simply made other life choices. Staff may take the opportunity to match their working arrangements with their personal lives and responsibilities as carers, to study, undertake voluntary work, or pursue other interests. More than 25 per cent. (see Table A) of DWP staff work part-time (source: DWP baseline map for year ending 30 September 2002) against a little over 15 per cent. in the Civil Service as a whole (Civil Service statistics October 2002).
<P>

<a name="30507w04.html_para8">A recent survey of DWP staff indicated that 67 per cent. (see Table B) of staff were in agreement that "the organisation allowed people to adopt a work pattern to accommodate a work life balance" 22 per cent. did not have an opinion either way and only 11 per cent. felt that their work pattern conflicted with their home life (source: staff survey 2002).
<P>

<a name="30507w04.html_para9">DWP ensures that part-time staff are not treated less favourably in their contractual terms and conditions than comparable full time staff; the 'pro rata principle' applies wherever appropriate.

 Agricultural market support measures under the CAP are estimated to have increased the cost of food for a notional family of four by about &#163;5 to &#163;6 per week.

There are no estimates of the impact of market price support

on the income distribution of UK farmers. However, the OECD's provisional estimates for 2001 show that market price support in the EU accounted for nearly 60 per cent. of total support to agriculture and represented 24 per cent. of the value of production at the farm gate. OECD estimates for individual commodities show that market price support represented 3 per cent. of the value of production of cereals, 37 per cent. for milk, 44 per cent. for sugar and 84 per cent. for beef and veal.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w07.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Action to address the issue of dolphin and porpoise by-catch needs to be taken internationally, as fishing vessels from many countries are involved. We have been pressing for such action within the EU and have commissioned a programme of research and development to reinforce our arguments. Urgent action is needed in the pair trawl fishery for bass off south west England, which involves a substantial number of vessels from other member states. Our research programme identified a by-catch problem in this fishery and is now trialling a possible gear solution. This looks promising, and I am determined to achieve a solution by this or other means. The second urgent need is to deploy EU observers to identify and assess other problem fisheries. I have followed up action in the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers, by writing to Commissioner Fischler and the French Fisheries Minister in support of effective measures. In addition, with the devolved administrations, I have issued a consultation document outlining a UK by-catch response strategy, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="30507w07.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We highlighted the need for urgent action on the issue of cetacean by-catch at the January meeting of the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers. I have also pursued this issue with Commissioner Fischler on a number of occasions, both in writing and in personal contacts.
<P>

<a name="30507w07.html_para7">I have recently written to the Commission to press for urgent action to widen observer coverage off the south-west coast where a number of other member states' vessels fish. I was pleased that the Commission included a commitment to take action in this area in papers produced as part of the recent reform of the Common Fisheries Policy. Commissioner Fischler has sent an encouraging reply sharing the UK's concern and agreeing a need to act at Community level, but I will follow up our recent approaches and continue to press for concrete proposals for positive action.
<P>

<a name="30507w07.html_para8">I have also recently written to Herv&#233; Gaymard, the French Fisheries Minister, stressing the need for effective action, and requesting his support for measures to widen observer coverage with a view to the reduction of cetacean by-catch. Action by France is particularly important as French pair trawlers play a substantial part in the offshore bass fishery; estimates are that some 30 to 40 French pairs are involved in this fishery.
<P>

<a name="30507w07.html_para9">Defra has committed some &#163;140,000 for trialling the use of exclusion devices developed by the Sea Mammal Research Unit (SMRU) to reduce the by-catch of cetaceans in the offshore bass fishery. If SMRU's trials do not identify the use of the separator grids as a viable solution, we will look at other measures. I do not rule out any approach at this stage including arguing for restrictions on fishing, the gear that can be used or seasonal closures.
<P>

<a name="30507w07.html_para10">In the meantime, I, along with the Devolved Administrations, have issued a consultation document outlining a UK by-catch response strategy. This sets out the extent of our knowledge of by-catch in UK waters and makes proposals for action to address the by-catch problem. The document has been placed in the Library of the House.

 No formal assessment has been made of the bio-security risks of fallen wild animals in the countryside.

[110876]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Common Agricultural Policy Horizontal Regulation (Reg.1259/99) enables member states to redirect up to 20 per cent. of CAP direct subsidy payments for the purpose of co-financing new expenditure on the so-called 'accompanying measures'&#151;essentially, in England, the agri-environment schemes and farm woodlands.
<P>

<a name="30507w08.html_para1">The Government's policy of modulating production-based subsidy payments into rural development was first introduced in the UK in 2001 at a relatively low, flat rate of 2.5 per cent. following full consultation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w08.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Sewerage undertakers have powers to control and reduce discharges of fat and oil into sewers. If they consider the discharge constitutes trade effluent, their consent is required in accordance with the provisions of the Water Industry Act 1991. The consent may set conditions and require the elimination or diminution of any specified constituent of the trade effluent before it enters the sewer. Such a discharge without the undertaker's agreement is a criminal offence.
<P>

<a name="30507w08.html_para2">If the sewerage undertaker does not classify the discharge as trade effluent, it is still an offence under section 111 of the 1991 Act, for a person to empty into a public sewer, or any drain or sewer connecting with a public sewer, any matter which is likely to injure the sewer or drain, to interfere with the free flow of its contents or to affect prejudicially the treatment and disposal of its contents. Any person who is found guilty of an offence is liable to a fine or imprisonment. I consider these statutory controls to be sufficient. We would expect sewerage undertakers to take action where a problem arose and to encourage appropriate preventative measures to stop problems arising from fat and oil entering the sewers.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w08.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 There are currently no national data available on the extent of fly-tipping, as statistics on fly tipped waste are not collected centrally. We are hoping to remedy this situation by means of a clause that has been included in the Anti-Social Behaviour Bill currently before Parliament. If successful, the provision will require the Environment Agency and local authorities to submit annual data returns to the Secretary of State on the categories and quantities of fly tipped waste with which they deal.
<P>

<a name="30507w08.html_para13">The Environment Agency has been operating a national incident recording system for the last two years. On the basis of its knowledge, it has estimated that there are approximately 50,000 fly-tipping incidents each year costing approximately &#163;100 million.

 The test techniques referred to in the answer given on 18 March 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 644W, on food safety, do not relate to the detection of salmonella in foodstuffs.

 Defra is committed to creating an environment which enables all members of staff to achieve a better work life balance. Part-time working is one of several ways in which the Department offers its staff flexibility in their working patterns. Figures for staff in post in the core Department <sup>1</sup>  show that 11 per cent. of staff have adopted a part-time working pattern. Defra agencies and non-departmental public bodies are encouraged to take a similar approach.
<P>

<a name="30507w09.html_para5">In 2002, the Department conducted a staff survey, one element of which was to compare the views of part-time workers with those of full-time staff on various aspects of working for Defra. The results of the survey will be discussed with the part-time staff network with a view to taking action where necessary. There will be follow up activity to enable us to monitor progress and identify any new issues.

 Government has redirected, and match funded, a proportion of production linked subsidy payments into rural development measures since 2001. In the current negotiations on CAP reform we are pressing for both a shift in support from production-linked subsidies to environmental and rural development measures and a significant increase in the UK's share of current EU funding for rural development programmes. We are committed to increasing expenditure on the England Rural Development Programme. The detailed arrangements for delivering this commitment will depend on the outcome of the ongoing negotiations on the reform of the CAP.

 Five rapid tests for the post-mortem detection of BSE have been evaluated by the EU Commission and are considered appropriate for use as screening tests for cattle. The most recent of these, one from Switzerland and one from the USA, were published by the Commission at the end of 2002.

<P>
<a name="30507w10.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 6 May 2003]:</i> The original CAP reform proposals introduced the concept of a decoupled single income payment, designed to bring markets into better balance and take away incentives for over-production. Energy crops would be eligible for a 'carbon credit' aid of &#163;45 per hectare, capped at 1.5 million hectares across the EU. Compulsory set-aside would have been retained, but the existing derogation to allow non-food, including energy crops, to be grown on it would be removed. We consider that the combination of decoupling together with a further cereals price cut removes the need for land to be taken out of production and placed in set-aside.
<P>

<a name="30507w10.html_para0">The European Commission have indicated that they may be prepared to make some changes to their original proposal on set-aside, including allowing continued access for non-food crops. Our view is that if set-aside is to continue, it must be applied in a flexible way which maximises its potential benefits.

 Since 1998, collection of data about the incidence of TB in badgers has been collected only from the randomised badger culling trial (the "Krebs" trial) and from the road traffic accident survey taking place in seven counties (Cornwall, Devon, Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire, Shropshire and Dorset). Data from both will be analysed by the Independent Scientific Group on Cattle TB (ISG).
<P>

<a name="30507w10.html_para4">It is a fundamental principle of scientific trials that data must not be released prematurely since that could compromise the subsequent integrity of the trials. The ISG expressed concern in its second report that no data should be released from the field trial and related research which could discourage farmers' willingness to participate in the trial, or encourage either illegal killing of badgers or interference with trial operations. For this reason, they recommended that a narrow band of data (including the prevalence of TB in badgers caught in the trial) should not be disclosed. The ISG has asserted and reinforced the need for total confidentiality of these data until such time as they can be safely released with a considered analysis.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what research her Department has undertaken to combat varroa mites.  [110867]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government have funded a number of research projects to combat the varroa mite since it was first discovered in the UK. Currently, Defra 



<P>
<P><I>7 May 2003 : Column 718W</I><P>
is funding a 3-year project that extends an earlier MAFF-funded investigation by Horticulture Research International (HRI) on the use of entomopathogenic fungi as a biological control of varroa. HRI is undertaking this project in collaboration with IACR Rothamsted. It is due to terminate in 2005 and is expected to cost some &#163;323,000.

<P>
<a name="30507w10.html_wqn7"><B> Ms Atherton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what action she has taken to deal with the threat from varroa mites; and if she will make a statement;  [110868]
<P>
<UL>(2) what action she and her European Union counterparts have taken to deal with varroa mites.  [111004]<P></UL>

<P>
<a name="30507w10.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Varroa has been the most significant threat to UK beekeeping since it was first detected in Devon in 1992. Defra funds a programme of bee health measures to assist the beekeeping sector, the cost of which was around &#163;1.3 million in 2002&#150;03. Under these measures, the National Bee Unit (NBU), part of the Central Science Laboratory, provides a free diagnostic and inspection service to beekeepers in England as well as training and technical advice to help them become more self-reliant through improved bee husbandry. In addition, the NBU has been carrying out routine screening throughout England and Wales for varroa mites that are resistant to authorised treatments, having first detected them in August 2001. To date, resistance remains isolated to certain areas of Devon and Cornwall. However, the NBU's advice to beekeepers is to remain alert to the threat of further spread and to report any suspected cases to them.
<P>

<a name="30507w10.html_para9">At EU level, Council Regulation (EC) No. 1221&#150;97 provides for member states to assist the beekeeping sector to improve the production and marketing of honey by alleviating the burden placed on it by varroa. The EU reimburses up to 50 per cent. of Member States' expenditure on certain beekeeping measures. In the past year, the UK has received &#163;324,000 under these measures for approved actions taken to combat varroa. The main thrust of most member states' programmes is, like the UK, to support the control of varroa through technical advice, the provision of diagnostic services and R&D.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what facilities are available for controlling woodpigeons.  [111085]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The control of certain birds, including woodpigeons, is permitted under a series of general licences issued by my Department. This system, first introduced in 1992, offers a practical and easily understood method of control of certain bird species and ensures that birds are killed or taken by certain methods only, with the minimum of distress to the birds.
<P>

<a name="30507w11.html_para0">Control of birds under the general licences has generally worked well, however a recent High Court judgment has illustrated that there may be areas where review of the general licences would be useful. Officials will consult stakeholders shortly and revise the licences where changes are considered necessary.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made in meeting targets for the proportion of people with disabilities in senior posts in the Department.  [110533]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w11.html_spnew1"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Currently, approximately 1 per cent. of the senior civil service in the Ministry of Defence have declared themselves disabled. Statistics on disability are collected through voluntary self-declaration.
<P>

<a name="30507w11.html_para2">As part of our wider personnel strategy, our personnel policies and practices are equality proofed to ensure that there are no barriers for disabled staff who aspire to the senior civil service, and we would encourage them to apply. In addition, the Ministry of Defence provides funding to enable disabled staff who have the potential to reach the senior civil service to participate in the civil service disability bursary scheme. Funding provides for two years of high quality management training together with mentoring opportunities.
<P>

<a name="30507w11.html_para3">A number of senior posts are filled through open competition as fixed term appointments. Advertisements for these vacancies would normally carry the caption: "The Ministry of Defence is an equal opportunities employer" and stress the point that applications from people with disabilities are particularly welcome. The advertisements also carry the two-ticks "positive about disability" symbol and the Department is committed to offering all candidates who declare a disability a guaranteed interview where they meet the minimum qualifying criteria. We are currently trialling the use of specialist recruitment consultants to help to publicise open competitions to disabled potential applicants.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w11.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Umm Qasr is one of several routes by which aid has entered and will continue to enter Iraq (including by land from Jordan and Kuwait). We do not record the amount of aid entering Iraq by non-United Kingdom Government Agencies so we cannot calculate the respective shares of the total. Once Umm Qasr is open to shipping we expect the proportion of aid entering Iraq by sea to rise significantly, since the rail links from the port to the rest of the country make it a particularly efficient way of handling bulk supplies of aid.

<a name="30507w11.html_para6">Until there is agreement on security normalisation in Northern Ireland, it would be premature to come to any conclusions on the final composition of the Northern Ireland garrison. Current planning is only addressing the implications of security normalisation for the Home Service battalions. The role of the Home Service element is Military Aid to the Civil Power; as the security environment improves we expect the need for this role will decline.

<a name="30507w12.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Kumar: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what steps he is taking to ensure that the procurement process for the replacement schemes for PAX and RPAX do not penalise regulars and reservists deployed within the 30 day 'exclusion period' applied by many insurers at times of conflict.  [111651]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w12.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Exclusion periods enable underwriters to protect themselves from excessive risks by closing schemes to new applicants. Most insurance contracts contain arrangements for exclusion periods, which may often be applied retrospectively by up to 30 days, as is the case with the current PAX and RPAX policies.
<P>

<a name="30507w12.html_para0">These arrangements protect the scheme against those seeking short-term cover at the last minute and helps keep premiums affordable for prudent long-term members. Consequently it is planned that the replacement PAX and RPAX contract, which will come into effect on 1 July 2003, will continue to contain such arrangements.
<P>

<a name="30507w12.html_para1">We encourage service personnel to recognise the long-term nature of life insurance throughout their service and not just at times of more active duty&#151;when they may seek cover too late, just as schemes are withdrawn.

<P>
<a name="30507w12.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 Good quality play opportunities can have a significant impact on children and young people, their families and the wider community. The wider benefits of effective play provision can include a reduction in crime&#151;it can ensure children and young people are enjoying themselves and are therefore engaged in activities which do not lead them to antisocial behaviour.
<P>

<a name="30507w12.html_para2">No formal assessment of the role of adventure playgrounds has been carried out by my Department, but we in partnership with DfES are conducting a review of Children's Play which will report in the summer.

 The Department has not held discussions with English Heritage on arrangements for tendering or the expertise of people and organisations carrying out such work. Planning permission for major development works is granted by the relevant local authority. It is for local authority archaeological officers to approve plans to carry out archaeological work associated with major developments to the appropriate standards, including approval of a specification which would include the competence and experience of those undertaking the work.

 I understand that Sport England has been involved in discussions with all the interested parties in an attempt to ensure that the centre continues in operation. An action plan was agreed by all the parties which set out a series of steps to be completed.

 The Government have already exceeded their target of establishing 12 creative partnerships between schools and creative organisations, by 2004. The National Foundation for Education Research (NFER) is conducting a major evaluation of the creative partnerships programme and will publish its findings in spring 2005. The Government's target to increase the number of people in communities experiencing the arts will be evaluated through Arts Council attendance surveys, due to be completed by March 2004. Findings from these surveys will be compared with baseline data from a pilot survey, carried out in 2001.

 DCMS certifies qualifying films as British under the terms of the Films Act 1985. Those certificates may be used in support of a claim for tax relief on the films to which they relate. Claims for

<a name="30507w12.html_para4">Film production benefits from a number of tax reliefs that accelerate the deduction of expenditure on British qualifying films. The estimated tax cost of relief provided under Section 48 of the Finance (No.2) Act 1997 is &#163;440 million for the period 1997&#150;98 to 2001&#150;02. The tax cost of the other reliefs is estimated to be an additional &#163;70 million a year.

 The current UN sanction requires State Parties to the UN to impose import controls on objects from Iraq, including antiquities. We welcome UNESCO's announcement that they will be proposing to the UN a continuing selective embargo on the movement of Iraqi cultural property so that there should be no diminution of control over the import of Iraqi cultural property. This is clearly an option, and we are very supportive of this aim.

<a name="30507w12.html_para5">Last year the UK acceded to the 1970 UNESCO Convention on the Means of Prohibiting and Preventing the Illicit Import, Export and Transfer of Ownership of Cultural Property. Irrespective of whether UN sanctions are lifted, since these objects have been stolen from Iraqi museums, the UK now has an obligation to prevent their import and assist the legitimate authorities in Iraq to secure their return.

 The current UN sanction requires state parties to the UN to impose import controls on objects from Iraq, including antiquities. The current ban on the import of antiquities from Iraq means that such antiquities can be seized if there is an attempt to import them illegally. However, there is a concern that when UN sanctions are lifted there should be no diminution of control over the import of Iraqi cultural property. UNESCO have announced that they will be proposing to the UN a continuing selective embargo on the movement of Iraqi cultural property.

 The humanitarian situation in Afghanistan has improved compared to the situation last year, and is no longer an emergency.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what the estimated cost is in 2003&#150;04 to her Department, agencies and the non-departmental public bodies for which she is responsible of the increase in the national minimum wage from &#163;4.20 per hour to &#163;4.50 per hour.  [110434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w14.html_spnew9"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 I estimate that there will be no financial impact. The Department's minimum wage under our current pay agreement is &#163;5.25 per hour based on a 37-hour week. We have no reason to believe that DFID's contractor costs will rise due to the increase in the minimum wage.

<P>
<a name="30507w14.html_spnew10"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Last year, out of a total bilateral expenditure of &#163;15 million, about &#163;8 million was used for relief related activity. In addition we contributed &#163;7 million to UNRWA's emergency appeal for 2002. We expect to spend a similar amount this year.
<P>

<a name="30507w14.html_para5">Infrastructure damage to DFID funded projects has been limited. Where this has occurred we have discussed with our project partners the necessary steps, including additional funding, to ensure projects still meet their objectives.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what role humanitarian mine action will play in supporting the peace process in Sri Lanka; and if she will make a statement.  [111069]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w14.html_spnew11"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Humanitarian Mine Action is critical for the Sri Lankan peace process. The civil war has displaced nearly one million people in the North and East of the Island. Helping these people and their families return to their former homes, and restart their livelihoods, will build confidence in the peace process and will help foster an environment in which peace can be sustained. However, many of these families are

unable to benefit from the peace process. They are living in camps, prevented from returning home because of mines.
<P>

<a name="30507w14.html_para6">DFID is a major supporter of mine action in Sri Lanka. We have provided over &#163;1 million through the United Nations for demining and public awareness. Further support will be provided within a &#163;6 million contribution recently approved to support UNICEF's Children Affected By Armed Conflict programme. In addition Britain also contributes to the support for mine action which the European Union finances through international and local NGOs in Sri Lanka.

 We are in regular contact with the Thai Government concerning the full range of Burma related issues. However we have not made any formal request to the Thai authorities concerning possible Thai mediation on questions concerning Burmese ethnic minority groups and the military regime. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to suggest that the Burmese military regime is yet prepared to enter into substantive discussions/negotiations with Burmese political parties. The primary channel for encouraging national reconciliation in Burma is the United Nations Secretary General's Special Envoy to Burma, Tan Sri Razali Ismail. We continue to give Tan Sri Razali Ismail our full support and co-operation.

 An initial review is already underway to learn the lessons from this programme.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The right hon. Gentlemen misunderstands the point made in my ministerial statement of 28 April 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 2WS. The events of 11 September 2001 raised the importance of back up and disaster recovery in programmes such as Focus. It was one of the factors leading to increased costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w15.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 We are unable to afford a programme which would meet the original goals of the Focus programme. However, the FCO has prioritised its ICT budgets for this financial year to ensure we have the money required to deliver a new FCO intranet.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w15.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 We cannot afford to fill the gap left by the cancellation of the Focus programme in the current spending round. We will instead squeeze further efficiencies out of existing systems, and introduce a new intranet. The exact cost of the new intranet will depend on the outcome of a scoping exercise which is currently underway. It will certainly be below &#163;1 million.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 The net cost of cancelling the contract with Fujitsu was &#163;7 million. This takes into account the amount paid to Fujitsu, internal FCO costs, and the value of assets obtained.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs how much money allocated to the Focus programme was irretrievable; whether penalties were imposed by Fujitsu as a result of the cancellation of the contract; and why it took as long as it did to cancel the programme once it became clear that it was no longer required.  [111230]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w15.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 At the point of cancellation the FCO had spent &#163;9.5 million on the Focus programme, including internal costs, supplier costs, hardware and software. Of this we will retain assets of &#163;2.5 million.

<a name="30507w15.html_para1">We were able to reach a mutually acceptable settlement with Fujitsu.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what proposals he has to ensure child victims of trafficking are protected from and do not return to or are not kidnapped by their trafficker or abuser; what specialist safe accommodation and supervision is available in such circumstances; and if he will make a statement.  [110785]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w16.html_spnew9"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Child victims of trafficking are referred to social services to receive assistance and support based on their particular needs. They may arrive in this country as unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, or accompanied by an adult. In the latter case, if anyone who comes into contact with the child is concerned that the child is the victim of abuse or neglect, they should refer the child to the relevant local authority's social services department. Unaccompanied minors seeking asylum will also be referred to social services. Social services have a duty under the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those children's needs or, where appropriate, by arranging for the provision of services from other agencies. This care will be determined by a needs assessment according to the Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families. Child victims of trafficking are likely to be in need of welfare services and&#151;in many cases&#151;protection under the Children Act 1989.
<P>

<a name="30507w16.html_para17">Where there is a risk to the life of a child or a likelihood of serious harm, an agency with statutory child protection powers, for example the police or councils with social services responsibilities, should act quickly to secure the immediate initial safety of the child. In some cases, it may 



<P>
<P><I>7 May 2003 : Column 745W</I><P>
be necessary to ensure that the child remains in, or is removed to, a safe place. Under s.20 of the Children Act 1989, a local authority may provide accommodation for any child within their area if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote the child's welfare. This may involve placing the child in a foster placement or it may place the child in a children's home.
<P>

<a name="30507w16.html_para18">There are only very limited circumstances in which it is an option to hold a young person in secure accommodation. The Children Act 1989 permits that children may only be held in secure conditions if they satisfy certain specific grounds such as a likelihood of absconding together with a likelihood that injury would be caused to the young person themselves or others. This requires the approval of the courts.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w16.html_spnew10"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The immigration arrangements for child victims of trafficking will depend on the individual circumstances of the case. Unaccompanied asylum seeking children who apply for asylum are referred to the Refugee Council's Panel of Advisers, a non-statutory body which acts as adviser to the child in his or her dealings with the Home Office and other agencies for the duration of the asylum claim. No unaccompanied child will be removed from the United Kingdom unless we are satisfied that adequate reception and care arrangements are in place in the country to which he or she is to be removed.
<P>

<a name="30507w16.html_para19">We expect that the provision of assistance and support to child victims of trafficking will be secured by local statutory services in response to identified needs. Child victims of trafficking are likely to be in need of welfare services and&#150;in many cases&#151;protection under the Children Act 1989. Social Services have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of these children following an assessment of their circumstances.

<P>
<a name="30507w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBOs) were introduced from 1 April 1999. Information held centrally up to 31 May 2000 is for the number of ASBOs issued within England and Wales by police force area only.
<P>

<a name="30507w18.html_para6">From 1 June 2000 official statistics on the number of ASBOs issued within England and Wales are based on quarterly returns from Magistrates' Courts Committees (MCCs). From copies of the orders we have been able to identify local authority areas involved. The number of notifications received by the Home Office of ASBOs issued in the West Yorkshire MCC, from 1 April 1999 to 30 November 2002 (latest available) is 25. From 1 June 2000 to 30 November 2002 no notifications have been received of ASBOs issued within the Wakefield metropolitan district council area (in which the Hemsworth constituency is situated).
<P>

<a name="30507w18.html_para7">We are aware that the numbers of ASBOs made nationally have been consistently under reported in returns made by magistrates' courts and are considering how reporting can be improved.

<P>

<a name="30507w18.html_para9">No applications have yet been received to establish a local child curfew scheme under section 14 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. Some local authorities and police forces have considered the possibility but concluded that other measures should be taken to tackle relevant local problems.

: To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police officers additional to the complement on 1st May 1997 were appointed to the Hemsworth constabulary in each year since 1997.  [109905]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w18.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Hemsworth is part of the Wakefield Division of West Yorkshire Police force. Deployment of resources between divisions and other units of West Yorkshire Police is an operational matter for the Chief Constable (Mr. Colin Cramphorn).
<P>

<a name="30507w18.html_para11">Information has not been collected centrally on a regular basis about the number of officers deployed to particular Divisions or to areas within those divisions. However, I refer my hon. Friend to the reply of 2 December 2002 by my right hon. Friend, the Member for Southampton Itchen (John Denham) to the hon. Member for North Southwark and Bermondsey (Mr. Simon Hughes), <i>Official Report</i>, column 589W, setting out police strength for each Basic Command Unit for each force in England and Wales as at 31 March 2002.
<P>

<a name="30507w18.html_para12">In total West Yorkshire Police had 5,209 police officers and 2,234 civilian support staff on 31 March 1997. The number of police officers fell to 4,815 at 31 March 2001, since then it has been rising, reaching 4,999 at 30 September 2002. At 31 March 1997 West Yorkshire Police had 2,234 civilian support staff. By 31 March 2002, the latest available figures, this had risen to 2,364.
<P>

<a name="30507w18.html_para13">Police officer strength nationally fell after March 1997, before rising to the record number of 131,548 at 30 September 2002. The fall in West Yorkshire was much more marked than that which occurred nationally, despite the force having done a little better than the national average in terms of resources. This will have been a reflection of local decisions by West Yorkshire's chief officers and its police authority about the mix between precept increases, balances of officer and civilian numbers and other expenditure.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what action the Government propose to take following the recommendations of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs in 1995 that cigarette lighter refills be limited in size to about 25ml; and if he will make a statement.  [111187]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30507w19.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Department of Trade and Industry pursued the Advisory Council's recommendation with the industry. Some manufacturers voluntarily introduced a 25ml gas lighter refill, but progress towards an industry-wide agreement to reduce the refills to a maximum size of 25ml was hampered by anti-competitive considerations and practical difficulties.
<P>

<a name="30507w19.html_para0">In view of the difficulties encountered in trying to implement the recommendation, the Government decided to tackle the problem by an alternative means. It accordingly introduced the Cigarette Lighter Refill (Safety) Regulations 1999, which prohibits the sale or supply of lighter refills containing butane gas to anyone under 18 years.

During the financial year 2002&#150;03, the Department paid a grant of &#163;302,000 to the Rape Crisis Federation (RCF), an umbrella body for a network of some 40 local rape crisis centres in England and Wales. This grant enabled the Federation to provide a range of support services to its member groups, but was not intended to provide direct services to rape victims.
<P>

<a name="30507w20.html_para9">The Department's main programme for providing support services to victims of crime, including victims of rape and sexual assault, is through its grant in aid to the organisation Victim Support. Total Home Office funding to Victim Support during 2002&#150;03 was &#163;29.3 million. It is not possible to put a precise figure on how much of this funding was spent on services to victims of rape and sexual assault.

 A waiting time target of a maximum one month from diagnosis to first treatment was introduced for all cases of breast cancer in 2001. In the last quarter&#151;October to December 2002&#151;96.5 per cent. of women received their first treatment within a month of diagnosis with breast cancer. Separate data on waiting times for radiotherapy are not collected centrally. In order to tackle radiotherapy waiting times, we are making unprecedented investment in new radiotherapy facilities, streamlining care processes through the cancer services collaborative and working to best utilise the current workforce and to increase the number of staff in post and in training.

<a name="30507w21.html_para2">In NICE we have a means of bringing order to what has, until now, often been an unfair way for patients to access treatment and care. NICE guidelines will provide recommendations for good practice based on the best available evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness. The guidelines emerging from NICE will reflect the three stages of infertility services, which are primary care, where couples first contact their general practitioner, secondary care for more advanced exploration and treatments, and tertiary centres that provide the high tech treatments such as in-vitro fertilisation.
<P>

<a name="30507w21.html_para3">Overall, however, we are seeking to achieve integrated guidance so that when couples have to be referred on to a further stage in the investigation and treatment of their infertility they can be offered a seamless service.

<a name="30507w21.html_para6">In 2001, the last year for which figures are available, there were 207 deaths where methadone was mentioned on the death certificate. It should be noted that where more than one drug is mentioned on the death certificate, it is not always possible to tell which of them was primarily responsible for the death.
<P>

<a name="30507w21.html_para7">Comprehensive reviews of the effectiveness of methadone have been provided by several authors (Hall et al., 1998, Farrell et al., 1994, Bertschy 1995, Marsch, 1998). Most of those studies demonstrating the effectiveness of methadone are of on-going maintenance treatment but the evidence generally becomes weaker as the duration of treatment shortens, with little systematic evidence to support short-term detoxification. Specific studies include Fontain & Ansseau, 1995, Glass, 1993 and Gossop, M. et al., 2001. High quality medical and psychosocial services, a clear orientation towards social rehabilitation, treatment longevity and slow detoxification of well-stabilised patients have all been identified as giving the best outcomes, including reducing overdose deaths.
