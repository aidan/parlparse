 The impact assessment (IA) for the Fluorinated Greenhouse Gases Regulations 2009 published in February, considered the impacts of the action taken to regulate hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) through the EC F Gas Regulation and 10 associated Commission Regulations. The principal objective of these measures is to contain, prevent and thereby reduce emissions of HFCs. The IA considered both the "direct" savings relating to reductions in HFC emissions and also the "indirect" savings resulting from reduced energy consumption. A copy of the IA is available on the DEFRA website at:</p>

 The Government's view is that the use of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with high global warming potential is not sustainable in the long term. The Government's 'Buy Sustainable: Quick Wins' procurement standards state that HFCs should only be used where other safe, technically feasible, cost-effective and more environmentally acceptable alternatives do not exist.   <br>

 The point at which scrap metal is recycled and ceases to be waste has been set by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in cases C-444/00 (Mayer Parry) and C-457/02 (Niselli). The practical effect of these judgments is that scrap metal does not cease to be waste until it is reprocessed into products such as ingots, sheets or coils of steel. It is not legally feasible for DEFRA to adopt criteria which purport to set the end-of-waste point for scrap metal at a point earlier than that set by the ECJ. However, the European Commission has announced its intention to bring forward EU-wide end-of-waste criteria for ferrous, aluminium and copper scrap metal using the powers available to the Commission under article 6 of the revised Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC). UK officials have participated in the working groups established by the Commission to develop the technical aspects of proposals for ferrous and aluminium scrap.</p>

 There are a number of mechanisms within the river basin management plans relating to diffuse pollution from agricultural sources, and non-agricultural sources. Non-agricultural sources can include run-off from transport, on-street activities such as car washing, industrial estates, forestry and leisure industries and discharges from contaminated land and disused mines. Examples of the mechanisms include the England Catchment Sensitive Farming Delivery Initiative which provides advice to reduce diffuse water pollution from agriculture and the pesticides statutory code of practice.</p>

Additionally, local authorities are required to consult Sport England where planning applications affect land used as a playing field in the preceding five years. In April this year these protections were strengthened further by reducing the size of land in question from 0.4 hectares to 0.2 hectares.</p>

 The Department for Children, Schools and Families has made one set of regulations by way of statutory instrument in this Parliament to meet obligations arising from EU law, namely the Electronic Commerce Directive (Adoption and Children Act 2002) Regulations 2005. The key policy areas within the Department's remit (education in schools, children's social care and substantive family law) fall outside Community competence.</p>

 A total of £41.2 million over a three-year period has been made available to all local authorities as part of the Every Child a Talker programme. This includes up to £50,000 per year for each local authority (and slightly more for areas where it is more expensive to recruit and retain staff) to employ an early language consultant.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_470"><a name="91214w0013.htm_para0"><a name="09121430000428">The rest of the funding-the majority-is for staff in early years settings to access training and professional development. There is no local authority spending data yet available for the period covering ECaT since its launch in September 2008.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_471"><a name="91214w0013.htm_para1"><a name="09121430000429">None of the £41.2 million was allocated to National Strategies. Their role in supporting LAs to implement the ECaT programme is part of their ongoing contract with the Department.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_472"><a name="91214w0013.htm_para2"><a name="09121430000430">We do not have details of the number of children who have received support through ECaT as the programme is aimed at improving practitioners' understanding of early language development so that they can focus on raising the speaking and listening skills of children in settings where there is the greatest need. Over 3,500 practitioners will receive training and support through the programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_473"><a name="91214w0013.htm_para3"><a name="09121430000431">The programme has been widely welcomed by participating local authorities, who have recruited early language consultants and are working with targeted settings. Because of the age of the children expected to benefit from the programme, we do not expect to see a significant impact on Early Years Foundation Stage Profile results until 2010. However, it is encouraging to see significant improvements in the 2009 results of many of the local authorities involved in the first wave of the programme.</p>

 The following shows the number of out of school clubs in England, and each local authority area in the north-west Government office region in each of the last five years for which data were collected.

 The Gaining Ground strategy is locally driven. Local authorities were asked to identify schools in their area that might benefit from the Support available. Schools were considered for the programme if their attainment was above 30 per cent. A*-C GCSEs including English and maths and their progression between key stage 2 (age 11) and key stage 4 (age 16) was below average with little improvement over at least three years. Local authorities also considered other criteria such as whether the school placed an equal emphasis on progression and attainment.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 December 2009]:</i> We would prefer not to detain families with children and would rather that they left the UK voluntarily where the Courts have upheld a decision of the UK Border Agency that they must leave the country. However, where they fail to leave after having been given every opportunity and incentive to do so, the Agency has no other option but to detain them to enforce their departure. We believe that it is in the children's best interests to remain with their parents and they are therefore detained as a family group just a few days before their flight. However, detention is sometimes prolonged because of last minute applications to the Court as an attempt to frustrate their removal.</p>

<i> Notes:</i><br>
EASR - European Age-Standardised Rate.<br>
Includes activity in English National Health Service Hospitals and English NHS commissioned activity in the independent sector.<br>
Alcohol-specific condition<br>
Alcohol-specific conditions are those defined as wholly attributed to alcohol, based on the methodology developed by the North West Public Health Observatory. They are:<br>
Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (142.6)<br>
Alcoholic gastritis (K29.2)<br>
Alcoholic liver disease (K70)<br>
Alcoholic myopathy (G72.1)<br>
Alcoholic polyneuropathy (G62.1)<br>
Alcohol-induced pseudo-Cushing's syndrome (E24.4)<br>
Chronic pancreatitis (alcohol induced) (K86.0)<br>
Degeneration of nervous system due to alcohol (G31.2)<br>
Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (F10)<br>
Accidental poisoning by and exposure to alcohol (X45)<br>
Ethanol poisoning (T51.0)<br>
Methanol poisoning (T51.1)<br>
Toxic effect of alcohol, unspecified (T51.9)<br>
Number of episodes in which the patient had an alcohol-specific primary or secondary diagnosis These figures represent the number of episodes where an alcohol-specific diagnosis was recorded in any of the 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) primary and secondary diagnosis fields in a Hospital Episode Statistics (HES) record. Each episode is only counted once in each count, even if an alcohol-specific diagnosis is recorded in more than one diagnosis field of the record.<br>
<i> Ungrossed data</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode is the first period of inpatient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. Finished admission episodes are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. It should be noted that admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Primary diagnosis</i><br>
The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 20 (14 from 2002-03 to 2006-07 and seven prior to 2002-03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was admitted to hospital.<br>
<i> Secondary diagnosis</i><br>
As well as the primary diagnosis, there are up to 19 (13 from 2002-03 to 2007-08 and six prior to 2002-03) secondary diagnosis fields in HES that show other diagnoses relevant to the episode of care.<br>
<i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and primary care trusts (PCTs) in England. Data is also received from a number of independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. The quality and coverage of the data have improved over time. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Some of the increase in figures for later years (particularly 2006-07 onwards) may be due to the improvement in the coverage of independent sector activity.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in outpatient settings and may no longer be accounted for in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> Assignment of Episodes to Years</i><br>
Years are assigned by the end of the first period of care in a patient's hospital stay.<br>

 From the outset, the development of the autism strategy for adults has been underpinned by the two principles of co-production and inclusivity.

 Of all the family nurses currently employed in Family Nurse Partnership (FNP) sites, 54 per cent. had been in a health visiting post immediately prior to becoming a family nurse and 67 per cent. were currently registered health visitors.</p>

This will conclude by 2011 and will include an assessment of costs. A report of findings from the second year was published on the Department for Children, Schools and Families research website in September this year, and this suggested that the cost of FNP per client for those completing the programme is around £4,500 over two and a half years.</p>

It has been shown in the United States to have strong and consistent short and long-term benefits for children and parents. Early learning in England suggests that the FNP can be delivered well by our skilled family nurses, the programme is highly valued by clients, that fathers engage with it well, and that early impacts look promising.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_587"><a name="91214w0026.htm_para11"><a name="09121436000419">We will be testing FNP in 50 sites across England by January 2010 and over 3,000 clients have enrolled on FNP to date. The Child Health Strategy, published in February 2009, said the Government wished to expand to 70 pilot sites by April 2011. This would allow capacity to deliver FNP to at least 7,000 families. The Child Health Strategy also said that if the research findings are positive we would like to see FNP offered to the most vulnerable first time young mothers across England over the next decade.</p>

2. The NHS Information Centre are aware of the drop in numbers for 2006. It is possible that Eastbourne Downs PCT failed to include around 30 health visitors in its census return for 2006.

1.<i>  Finished admission episodes</i><br>
A finished admission episode (FAE) is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider. FAEs are counted against the year in which the admission episode finishes. Admissions do not represent the number of inpatients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
2. <i> Cause code</i><br>
A supplementary code that indicates the nature of any external cause of injury, poisoning or other adverse effects. Only the first external cause code which is coded within the episode is counted in hospital episode statistics (HES). The codes used to define knife wound are:<br>
W26-Contact with knife, sword or dagger<br>
X99-Assault by sharp object<br>
This code identifies assault by ANY sharp object and therefore includes but is not limited to assault with a knife.<br>
3. <i> Hospital Provider</i><br>
A provider code is a unique code that identifies an organisation acting as a health care provider (e.g. NHS trust or primary care trust (PCT)). Hospital providers can also include Treatment Centres (TC). Normally, if data are tabulated by health care provider, the figure for an NHS trust gives the activity of all the sites as one aggregated figure. Some NHS trusts have not registered their TC as a separate site, and it is therefore not possible to identify their activity separately.<br>
The parliamentary question asks for information on the following hospitals<br>
the Royal Sussex Hospital, Brighton;<br>
the Eastbourne District General Hospital, Eastbourne; and<br>
the Princess Royal Hospital.<br>
Data for the individual hospital sites are not available. However:<br>
The Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton and the Princess Royal Hospital, Haywards Heath form part of the Brighton and Sussex University Hospitals NHS Trust for which we have provided data.<br>
The Eastbourne District General Hospital, Eastbourne is part of East Sussex Hospitals NHS Trust for which we have provided data.<br>
Due to organisational changes (both splits and mergers) data prior to 2002-03 are not comparable with that for later years at a trust level. For this reason we have not provided these figures as no meaningful time series is available.<br>
4. <i> Assessing growth through time</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards. Changes to the figures over time need to be interpreted in the context of improvements in data quality and coverage (particularly in earlier years), improvements in coverage of independent sector activity (particularly from 2006-07) and changes in NHS practice. For example, apparent reductions in activity may be due to a number of procedures which may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and so no longer include in admitted patient HES data.<br>
5. <i> Data quality</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by more than 300 NHS trusts and PCTs in England and from some independent sector organisations for activity commissioned by the English NHS. The NHS Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>

1. The Information Centre for health and social care published the national QOF for England, which gives the number of people recorded on practice disease registers with a diagnosis of depression. The depression register only includes patients 18 years or over.<br>
2. QOF is the national Quality and Outcomes Framework, introduced as part of the new general medical services contract on 1 April 2004.<br>
3. Participation by practices in the QOF is voluntary, though participation rates are very high, with most personal medical services practices also taking part.<br>
4. Patients will only contribute to the figures in QOF if they are registered with a general practice participating in QOF.<br>
5. Most indicators in QOF have rules which allow for patients to be excluded (e.g. patient refuses treatment) and so the denominator for a given indicator may be less than the number of patients on the register for that disease.<br>
6. The published QOF information was derived from QMAS; a national system developed by NHS Connecting for Health.<br>
7. QMAS uses data from general practices to calculate individual practices' QOF achievement. QMAS is a national IT system developed by NHS Connecting for Health to support the QOF.<br>
8. The QMAS system captures the number of patients on the various disease registers for each practice. The number of patients on the clinical registers can be used to calculate measures of disease prevalence, expressing the number of patients on each register as a percentage of the number of patients on practices' lists.<br>

 The consultation document on New Horizons, published in July this year, outlined the features of high-quality mental health care, which support the recovery of everyone who experiences mental ill health, including timely access to high-quality services. "New Horizons: A shared vision for mental health" published on 7 December 2009, a copy of which has already been placed in the Library, stresses the need to improve access to mental health services for socially excluded groups. It includes commitments to work with the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence on developing further quality standards in mental health, and to exploring options that would help increase personalisation and choice for mental health service users.</p>

 Service users have been involved in developing Payment by Results (PbR) for mental health at an early stage. A study by the University of Huddersfield, "Exploring the Impact of a Clinical Decision Support Tool from the Perspective of Service Users &amp; Carers" (available at http://eprints.hud.ac.uk/5092), used focus groups to identify what service users thought of an early iteration of the mental health currency work. The study highlighted service users desire to be involved in the care planning process that is linked to mental health PbR. We therefore expect, as mental health PbR is implemented, that service users will be very involved in the identification and agreement of local care packages and pathways to meet their own needs as part of care planning. User representatives will also be consulted on key aspects of the further development of the approach to PbR for mental health.</p>

 The number of individuals estimated to be self-funders or those with unmet need is taken from the Personal Social Services Research Unit's micro-simulation model for older people. An extra 25 per cent. was added to both the volume and the estimated cost from their model to bring it closer into line with alternative estimates of the numbers of severely disabled older people purchasing private home care.

 The supply-side failures referred to in paragraph 5.25 are the under-provision of insurance coverage and higher prices for those who do take out insurance. Insurance companies wishing to offer insurance for personal care will make an assessment of likelihood that people will require such services and offer a product at a price based on the average probability of need.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_634"><a name="91214w0031.htm_para1"><a name="09121436000941">As a result, insurance companies are aware that an average priced policy will adversely select high risk customers and so do not offer it. They may offer products at a higher price to reflect the higher risk of customers they do attract. In an extreme case, this could result in complete market collapse as the remaining customers respond to higher prices by deciding not to purchase insurance. In response, insurance companies raise prices further and eventually there are no purchasers left.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_636"><a name="91214w0031.htm_para3"><a name="09121436000943">Insurance companies may respond to the problem by attempting to gather information about customers to set individually tailored prices to their products. Gathering information is costly and insurance companies pass this on through higher premiums. This can be compounded if the pool of customers taking insurance becomes smaller as insurance companies have to spread their fixed costs over a small number of people, further raising the price that customers have to pay.</p>

 The costs associated with increasing numbers of assessments have been included in the administrative component of Table 2 in the impact assessment. In the absence of firm data on this, we have assumed that the average cost of an assessment is £200 and that 135,000 extra individuals will be assessed per year, giving an overall cost estimate of £27 million per year, as shown in Table 2 of the impact assessment. This has been included in the estimate overall annual costs of £670 million per year in 2011-12 prices.</p>

 Paragraph 5.25 of the impact assessment discusses the lack of a private insurance market for personal care services and the reasons why this may be the case.

Therefore, the figures above show the actual time between when the claim was made and the completed work capability assessment taking place, and not the true time that Jobcentre Plus and Atos have to work on cases which may be shorter.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_673"><a name="91214w0034.htm_para2"><a name="09121438000335">A more accurate reflection of the amount of cases that pass through the process would be determined by taking into account factors, such as, the time taken to return paperwork, whether their condition can be assessed on paper based evidence alone, whether further medical evidence is required or requested and whether a customer actually attends their initial appointment or it has to be re-scheduled. This information is not currently available but we will continue to undertake analysis of performance as the employment and support allowance regime beds in.</p>

1. The number of beneficiaries in receipt is rounded to the nearest 10.<br>
 2. Beneficiaries-pension credit is claimed on a household basis and therefore the number of people that pension credit helps (the beneficiaries) is the number of claimants in addition to the number of partners for whom they are also claiming.<br>

 The disability premium applies only to working age benefits, but disabled pensioners can have an additional amount for severe disability taken into account in their claim for pension credit or housing benefit.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_683"><a name="91214w0035.htm_para4"><a name="09121438000632">Premiums are additional amounts which are taken into account in the means test for pension credit and housing benefit, but are not paid directly as a discrete amount. They do not necessarily increase benefit entitlement by the full value of the premium, and the impact will depend on the pensioner's income and other circumstances.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_684"><a name="91214w0035.htm_para5"><a name="09121438000633">However, it is possible to estimate how much pension credit expenditure is due to the severe disability premium by looking at how much less would be spent if the premium was removed, all other things being equal, and these estimates are provided in the following table.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_685"><a name="91214w0035.htm_para6"><a name="09121438000634">Housing benefit is more complex, as entitlement is usually dependent on the amount and type of pension credit that is in payment. In particular, the use of the premium in a pension credit award can lead to a larger housing benefit entitlement, without the premium being used in the housing benefit assessment. National Statistics on housing benefit do not currently provide the necessary information needed in order to produce an estimate of the expenditure involved.</p>

A total of 225 people attended the reconvened events. When carrying out general population research it is usual for research companies to make incentive payments as a means to ensure that the research includes not only active individuals who like to engage in these discussions but also to encourage less engaged individuals to take part. Incentive payments are especially important in the case of events of this nature, as participants will often be expected to travel long distances to attend and will also be expected to reconvene as part of the next stages in the deliberative events process.</p>

 A prisoner who makes threats to anyone may be charged under the prison or young offender institution rules with using threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour. The charge will be dealt with at an adjudication hearing by a prison governor, or in more serious cases by an independent adjudicator (district judge). If the charge is proved the governor may impose any of the punishments set out in the rules, ranging from a caution, forfeiture of privileges, stoppage of earning, or cellular confinement. An independent adjudicator may impose any of these punishments, plus up to 42 additional days in custody.</p>

 No such discussions took place. The Department of Health ended the bilateral agreement with the Channel Islands (including Jersey and Guernsey) and gave notice on the agreement with the Isle of Man, as it considers that they are out of place considering the wide availability of travel insurance, and there is little robust data to justify the business case and value for money for the national health service.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what the maximum cash allowance awarded to <i> (a)</i> military and <i> (b</i>) civilian staff in Afghanistan will be for 2010. [300675]</p>

 Significant differences in the terms and conditions of employment for military personnel and their civilian colleagues within the MOD make direct comparisons between the two very difficult. Moreover, it is difficult to predict allowances for the whole of 2010, since they are not subject to an annual increase but rather the result of periodic review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_759"><a name="91214w0041.htm_para0"><a name="0912153000297">The maximum monthly allowance for a MOD civilian in Afghanistan is £7,750. The quoted figure is before tax and is based on the most senior individual working in Helmand Province, undertaking a working week in excess of 82 hours. Allowances paid to civil servants reflect the significant additional hours worked above and beyond their contracted working week and the unique conditions experienced in theatre. They vary considerably and are dependent on an individual's grade, location and working week. Should the conditions in theatre remain as they are currently, then the quoted figure will remain unchanged in 2010.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_760"><a name="91214w0041.htm_para1"><a name="0912153000298">It is harder to be precise about the level of military allowances. Service pay and conditions are completely different to those of their civilian counterparts and the precise sum of the whole package that military personnel receive, including the tax-free operational allowances, will depend on their rank, personal circumstances and experience.

Of these, there are four multilateral treaties which stand out in terms of their importance: the North Atlantic treaty 1949; the treaty on the European Union as amended by the Lisbon Treaty 2007; the treaty of economic, social and cultural collaboration and collective self-defence 1948 as amended by the Paris Agreements of 23 October 1954 on the Western European Union; and the Charter of the United Nations 1945. Before the UK were to provide military forces overseas by virtue of relevant provisions in any of these treaties, it would be necessary for a separate decision to be taken by the Government to commit UK armed forces for deployment abroad.</p>

 The MOD is currently in the process of modifying the criteria against which it collates management information on the medical fitness of Service personnel. Whereas previously we have measured the medical "fitness for task" of Service personnel, we are now moving to a process of measuring the numbers who are medically "fully deployable", "limited deployable" and "non-deployable".

We are also buying Warthog vehicles to replace the Viking on operations in Afghanistan, and, as announced by the Prime Minister on 1 September their delivery is being brought forward. The first Coyote and Husky vehicles have been delivered to training, and the first vehicles will deploy to Afghanistan before the end of the year.</p>

 The ordnance makes clear that large scale and non-selective methods of capturing, pursuing or killing wild birds are prohibited. The exception is where such activity is carried out strictly in accordance with a licence issued in that regard by the chief officer for reasons of public health and safety or conservation. The Secretary of State for Defence has therefore not issued any guidance to the Sovereign Base areas administration in relation to the interpretation of the Game and Wild Birds Ordinance 2008.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV-for example, for an average of 200 with a CV of 5% we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.

All ABMs are encouraged to undertake external accredited learning, such as Diplomas from the Institute of Leadership and Management.

 The use of sprinklers and other fire suppression technologies in dwellings was considered in the review that lead to the 2006 revision of Approved Document B. This document provides guidance on compliance with Part B (Fire safety) of the Building Regulations. The extensive review that preceded the development of this new guidance considered a four year research project looking at the issue from both an effectiveness and cost/benefit perspective.</p>

However, the review, which included public consultation, concluded that it would not be cost-effective to provide sprinklers in all new homes but that it would be reasonable to provide them in blocks of flats over 30 metres in height where the risks were shown to be greater. A provision to this effect was, therefore, included in the revised Approved Document.</p>

<i> [holding answer 7 December 2009]:</i> I understand that the hon. Gentleman is concerned about a specific situation in which he says access to 118 directory inquiries services is restricted by BT through their "Home Hub" broadband product.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_988"><a name="91214w0071.htm_para9"><a name="09121533001327">BT's Home Hub is a wireless internet router which facilitates a range of services including broadband and a Voice Over Internet Protocol (VoIP) telephone capability. BT provides access to their own directory enquiries service (118 500) through the VoIP service and restricts access to other directory inquiries services. This restriction is limited to the Home Hub VoIP service as customers can access other 118 numbers through their normal BT phone, or by prefixing the number with five when using their VoIP phone to access their PTSN line. Users are also free to access 118 services through the internet.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_989"><a name="91214w0071.htm_para10"><a name="09121533001328">A recent Significant Market Power (SMP) review by Ofcom found that "call origination for Voice over Broadband (VoB) calls is not the same market as wholesale call origination on a narrowband network" and as such, BT are within their rights to restrict access to other directory inquiries services.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_990"><a name="91214w0071.htm_para11"><a name="09121533001329">Ofcom have recognised that as VoIP/VoB services develop and increase in significance they may need to re-examine their judgment and possibly include VoIP/VoB calls in BT's end to end connectivity obligation. In the mean time, the Department and Ofcom are keen to encourage commercial negotiation between BT and the affected service providers to find a resolution to this ongoing dispute.</p>

 Regional Transition Loan Funds were established by the Regional Development Agencies as a time limited measure while national instruments such as the Enterprise Finance Guarantee Scheme were put in place. In the SEEDA region the Transition Fund provides loans of up to £150,000 for SMEs that are facing liquidity issues arising from the adverse financial credit squeeze. The Transition Fund is financed by SEEDA and managed by Finance South East. One business in Eastbourne has applied for funding under this scheme since it was established. This application was turned down as it did not meet the eligibility criteria. For comparison, in the SEEDA region over the same period, 141 businesses enquired about these loans, 27 businesses were offered funding and 20 have so far received funding, of which two are based in East Sussex. In those circumstances where companies did not meet the criteria a range of advice through the Business Link network has been made available, such as business health checks. Over 95,000 businesses have benefited from this service to date across England, including 17,851 in the South East.</p>

They will be working together, taking a strategic approach to ensure industry is in a position to capitalise on business opportunities arising from the transition to a low-carbon economy.</p>

The 2007 estimates were £404 million total cost, of which digital infringement £224 million. While digital infringement will include other forms of infringement than peer-to-peer, it is likely that it will account for a large proportion of the estimated figure.

Borrowers' accounts must be set up with repayment schedules and put into notional arrears in order that the SLC can inform borrowers that unless they take steps to provide income details and commence repayment where appropriate, legal action will be taken against them. This is an essential step in the overseas collection process.</p>
