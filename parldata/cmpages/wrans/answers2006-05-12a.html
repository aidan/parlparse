<a name="stpa_0">Association of Chief Police Officers National Community Tension Team (NCTT) regularly produces a Community Impact Assessment which contains an assessment on the state of community relations, this includes anti-Semitism. This material is not shared with the public, as it contains operational policing information. The NCTT liaises with the Community Security Trust (CST) at the national level on behalf of the police service. Forces with significant Jewish communities liaise closely at the local level. The Home Office&#039;s assessment of community relations also draws upon advice from Government Offices who in turn are informed by a wide range of community sources.

<i>[holding answer 24 April 2006]:</i> Statistics on the location of asylum seekers in the UK are linked to the available information on the support that the asylum seeker receives. The number of asylum seekers supported by the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) are published on a quarterly and annual basis, broken down by Local Authority. The next publication covering the first quarter of 2006 will be published on the 23rd May 2006, and will be available on the Home Office Research Development and Statistics website at http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/immigration1.html. Data on asylum seekers supported by NASS broken down by parliamentary constituency are also available from the Library of the House. Separate arrangements exist for unaccompanied asylum seeking children who are supported by local authorities; the local authority receives funding from the Home Office for this purpose. As at the end of March 2006 NASS was reimbursing Kingston upon Hull for

<p><a name="st_3"><a name="60512w01.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b>

<p><a name="st_4"><a name="60512w01.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Asylum seekers receive NHS treatment free of charge while their claim is being considered. If they are to be dispersed, asylum claimants are advised on access to GP services in their dispersal area. If an asylum claim, including any appeal, is unsuccessful routine access to free NHS treatment will cease, although a course of treatment which has already started can be continued free of charge until the patient leaves the country. Immediately necessary treatment would not be withheld, regardless of whether the patient was chargeable or able to pay. In appropriate cases we will advise claimants of the existence of the Medical Foundation for the Care of Victims of Torture who are able to provide care, treatment and counselling.

 The Government are committed to putting victims at the heart of the criminal justice system. In &quot;Rebuilding Lives: supporting victims of crime&quot; we set out our plans to improve support to victims of crime, by refocusing the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme to provide more financial help to those most seriously injured and immediate, practical help to other victims through delivering Victim Care Units.

<p><a name="st_7"><a name="60512w01.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. McNulty: </b> 
 Although it is impossible to determine accurately how many people are in the UK illegally, the Home Office published a report which included an estimate of the size of the illegal migrant population in the UK in 2001. A copy of the RDS On-line report 29/05 Sizing the unauthorised (illegal) migrant population in the United Kingdom in 2001 can be found at: http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/notes/june&#095;summaries.html&#035;rdsolr2905. The method used relies on data from the Census undertaken every 10 years, so it is not possible to produce an estimate for other years. Nor is it possible, using this methodology, to estimate the number living in Northern Ireland. No estimate has been made of the number of people who have been working illegally in Northern Ireland.

Comparison with the estimates that were made three and a half years ago is difficult because the changes introduced through the 2003 Criminal Justice Act are not the only ones to affect deployment of probation resources. We are monitoring the courts&#039; use of the new sentences in the 2003 Act and, thus far, the sentences are being imposed broadly in line with the planning assumptions that informed the explanatory notes.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has not held any direct discussions with the Brazilians on the use of ethanol.

Part of the discussion focused on the study scoping a possible Brazil: UK: Africa Partnership on Bioethanol that is currently being undertaken by E4tech for the Office of Science and Innovation. This project arises from a visit made to Brazil by the UK Government&#039;s Chief Scientific Advisor, Sir David King, as part of the preparations for the UK G8 Summit in Gleneagles in July 2005. The final report on the study will be available for discussion at the Brazil:UK Science Days at the Royal Society on 22 and 23 May. The aim of the project is to try and address two difficult global problems, climate change and African development, through a tri-partite partnership. Work is currently focused around achieving a win on climate change and African development through development of production capacity from sugar cane.

The Government does not wish to rule out any option at this stage, and has therefore decided to extend the existing power relating to transfer of securities under section 207 of the Companies Act 1989 so that it could be used to require, as well as to permit, the paper free holding and transfer of company shares. In doing so, we wish to ensure that the new arrangements for paperless holding and transfer of securities do not deprive individual shareholders of existing rights which may be important to them.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the basis was for the calculation of the estimated &#163;40 million savings from the re-organisation of the Learning and Skills Council; whether the calculation was made <i>(a)</i> before and <i>(b)</i> after a decision had been reached on staff numbers and structures; and how much of the estimated saving was savings on (i) staff costs and (ii) administrative costs.

<p><a name="st_64"><a name="60512w08.html_spnew1"><b> Bill Rammell  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11 May 2006]:</i> On 16 September 2005 Mark Haysom, the Learning and Skills Council&#039;s chief executive, announced proposals for a new structure for the organisation with the aim of making it more effective at identifying and responding to local learning and skills needs, and to achieve a less bureaucratic and more strategic relationship with partners and providers. It means that the LSC will spend less time on transactional processes and more time developing relationships with key partners and stakeholders. This requires fewer staff with a different set of skills. The calculation of savings of up to &#163;40 million, which could be released for the benefit of learners, was based on these priorities and a structure that will require some 1,100 fewer posts. The savings include staffing, property and related costs. Due to the complexities involved in the restructuring the level of savings may change.

 The Department&#039;s radiation protection research programme supports a number of studies investigating the possible health effects of electromagnetic fields (EMF). A study by Dr. Draper and colleagues on childhood leukaemia and distance from power lines, funded under this programme and published in the British Medical Journal last year, has added to a large existing body of work in this area (BMJ, volume 330, 4 June 2005).
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w11.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_59">The Health Protection Agency&#039;s radiation protection division (HPA-RPD) keeps the world-wide research findings on EMF continually under review. In 2004, on the basis of a comprehensive review of the existing body of research to date, the HPA-RPD, previously the National Radiological Protection Board, recommended the adoption of new EMF exposure guidelines in this country. In addition, in view of the scientific uncertainties, the HPA recommended the Government &#039;&#039;consider the need for further precautionary measures&quot; in relation to power frequency electromagnetic fields. They have also noted that the majority of elevated magnetic fields are due to variations in the electricity supply and distribution system, the presence of substations and equipment in the home rather than proximity to power lines.

2005, HPA-RPD was the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) and as such it undertook a comprehensive review of the scientific evidence relating to possible adverse health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMFs) in 2004. This review is available on HPA&#039;s website at:

</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w11.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_62">The preparation of this review was carried out at the request of the Department and has particularly examined the issues of uncertainty in the science and aspects of precaution. In developing this review, NRPB took advice from individual United Kingdom and international scientific experts, and from published comprehensive reviews by expert groups. It sought advice from an ad hoc expert group on weak electric field effects in the body and gave careful consideration to the views expressed in response to a consultation document on its proposed guidelines issued in May 2003.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w11.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_63">Having considered the totality of the scientific evidence in the light of uncertainty and the need for a cautious approach, NRPB recommended that restrictions on exposure to EMFs in the UK should be based on the guidelines issued by the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection in 1998.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what percentage of general practitioners&#039; premises were above minimum standards on the last date for which figures are available in <i>(a)</i> England and <i>(b)</i> each primary care trust.  [61150]</p>




<p><a name="st_78"><a name="60512w11.html_spnew2"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Primary care trusts and predecessor organisations have responsibility for managing delivery of services provided by general practitioners (GPs); including the adequacy of their practice premises from which to provide services.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w11.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_64">Since 1997, there has been a 60 per cent. increase in investment in GP premises. Part of this was through the NHS Plan targets to refurbish or replace 3,000 GP premises and create 500 primary care centres housing services appropriate to meet the local need by December 2004. These targets were achieved through the replacement or refurbishment of 2,848 GP premises and 510 primary care centres. We expect to see an additional 125 of these primary care centres built by the end of this year and 2008 the total will stand at 750.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w11.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_65">In addition, there are many examples of new premises provided under the NHS Local Finance Investment Trust initiative (NHS LIFT) that fully satisfy minimum standards. The LIFT programme has contributed to this progress and has proven to be a tremendous success. Already some &#163;812 million in private sector and &#163;210 million in public sector funding has been injected into GP premises and community facilities across the country. There are 42 NHS LIFT schemes established with another eight in procurement.

This has, to date, delivered 68 new buildings open to patients with, on average, a building a week opening during 2006. In addition, we are injecting a further &#163;1 billion national health service capital this year specifically for new buildings and equipment. This money will further improve convenient access to health and social care.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w11.html_para8">
<a name="stpa_66">A subjective assessment by PCTs of the proportion of premises meeting the minimum standards as at 31 March 2005 has been placed in the Library. This 2005 snapshot by PCTs shows that collectively they have judged some GP premises across the country as being below minimum standards. This needs to be set in context. Judgments for some of those standards are subjective which by their very nature may lead to some PCTs reporting higher levels of premises that do not meet minimum standards than other PCTs with similar premises. Being below minimum standards does not mean the buildings are in a dangerous state of repair. Rather, that the premises may not have for example, adequate access to and within premises and WC facilities for disabled patients and staff. Failure to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act requirements is a common reason for PCTs judging buildings as not meeting minimum requirements.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w11.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_67">This is not because of a lack of intent by GPs&#039; practices and their PCTs to provide these facilities but because for example, the building is too small to incorporate them; with a general lack of suitable, alternative locations to develop. These are historic problems for inner city PCTs that predate this Government and arose from difficulty of investing in smaller buildings.

 Approximately 150 primary care trusts are involved in the health trainer project with wide variations in the ways health trainers are trained for the role. However, most training starts with an initial classroom-based period of between 14 and 35 days, over several weeks, followed by supported learning and skill development in the workplace. This may then be followed by further classroom-based training to allow reflection upon what has worked and provide ongoing training tailored to the individual and local environment.

Guide to quality:<br>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality.<br>

The true value is likely to lie within &#177; twice the CV e.g. for an average of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent., we would expect the population average to be within the range 180 to 220.<br>

Key:<br>

CV}5 per cent.<br>

* CV &gt;5 per cent. and }10 per cent.<br>

** CV &gt; 10 per cent. and }20 per cent.<br>

The median replaces the mean as the headline statistic. The weighted mean is the sum of the weighted values divided by the sum of the weights. The median is the value below which 50 per cent. of employees fall. It is preferred over the mean for earnings data as it is influenced less by extreme values and because of the skewed distribution of earnings data.<br>

 My hon. Friend the then Minister of State for Trade, Investment and Foreign Affairs (Ian Pearson) raised the Government&#039;s concerns about the use of organs from executed prisoners with the Chinese Government on 7 April. The Chinese Government have acknowledged the practice of organ harvesting from executed prisoners. Despite Chinese Government assurances that prisoners agree to the donations voluntarily and that, in some cases, their families are paid, we are concerned about the use of these prisoners&#039; organs. The Government welcomes the announcement by the Chinese Ministry of Health of a new regulation to come into effect on 1 July, to ban the sale of organs and introduce medical standards for organ transplants. We have received no evidence to substantiate recent media reports of large scale organ harvesting in China. The Chinese Government have denied such allegations.

<p><a name="st_192"><a name="60512w22.html_spnew9"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Department recently published a new leaflet aimed at all pregnant women as part of the THINK! campaign seatbelt strategy to engage with audiences that are more difficult to reach with a particular message through mainstream media channels.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w22.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_150">The aim of the leaflet is to educate mothers-to-be on the importance of wearing a seatbelt correctly to protect themselves and their unborn baby and to promote messages on child car seats. The leaflet will be distributed to 4000 doctors&#039; surgeries across the UK and will be displayed prominently on countertops and tables in waiting areas. The leaflet is available on-line at www.thinkroadsafety.gov.uk/campaigns/seatbelts/pregnant.htm
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w22.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_151">Pregnant women are required in law to use seat belts. A doctor may exempt any person from seatbelt wearing if there is a medical reason for such an exemption.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w22.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_152">The Department has not undertaken its own studies as there is research elsewhere that adequately demonstrates the risks to mothers and unborn children in a car crash.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what amendments have been made to the Road Traffic Act 1988; for what purpose; and when.  [70067]</p>




<p><a name="st_193"><a name="60512w23.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Road Traffic Act 1988 has been amended on many occasions by subsequent primary and secondary legislation. A breakdown of all these amendments, their purpose and when they came into effect, could be provided only at disproportionate cost. However, several organisations publish consolidated versions of the Act, which also document the amendments. One of these, Butterworths, is available online to Members of this House.

 The Department provides guidance on the values that should be used in undertaking cost benefit analysis of all routine transport projects. It also provides guidance on how the values should be assumed to increase through time.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w23.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_153">The published values differ according to whether the transport user benefiting from the time savings is travelling in the course of work or in their leisure time. To reflect the empirical evidence, values for leisure time differ according to whether or not the travel time savings is for a commuting trip. The values for work differ by transport mode. The reason for this is that the work values are based on the cost savings to the employer and this average saving differs between modes.
</p>


<p>
<a name="60512w23.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_154">The average value placed on time saved in work time in the cost benefit analysis of routine transport schemes is equal to &#163;26.73 an hour in 2002 prices and values. The value placed on commuting time savings is equal to &#163;5.04 an hour (in 2002 prices and values) and the value placed on time saved in the course of all other leisure trips is &#163;4.46 an hour (in 2002 prices and values).
