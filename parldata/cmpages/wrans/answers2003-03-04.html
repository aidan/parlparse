<a name="30304w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 I last discussed progress on European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) with my German counterpart on 5 November 2002 in Berlin.
<P>

<a name="30304w01.html_para0">ESDP was also discussed extensively at the last General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on 18 and 19 November 2002 at which Defence Ministers from all member states were present.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence whether Alenia Marconi System used the F680 procedure to receive preliminary Government advice on the likely prospects for approval on their export licence application to export an air traffic control system to Sudan; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Details of F680 applications from companies are normally commercially confidential and exempt from disclosure under Exemptions 13 and 14 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. Any F680 application received in respect of Sudan would be rigorously assessed on a case by case basis against the consolidated EU and national arms export licensing criteria and the EU arms embargo.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence when he received the recommendations of the Sub-Committee of the Honours and Decorations Committee, on the issue of a medal for UK servicemen who were in Egypt between 1951 and 1954; whether he will accept the recommendations of this sub-committee; and if he will make a statement.  [100249]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w01.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 I have not received the recommendations of the sub-committee. They passed their recommendations directly to the HD Committee for its consideration. The Ministry of Defence awaits the publication of the result of their deliberations and will accept their decision.

<P>
<a name="30304w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 An announcement on the Prime Contractor for the Assessment Phase (AP) of the Future Integrated Soldier Technology (FIST) programme will be made shortly. Contract award will take place soon thereafter. The contract will last for a little under three years, and will be followed by a Demonstration and Manufacture Phase which will be the subject of separate contractual arrangements. The FIST programme will bring the benefits of technology improvements to the infantry soldier by providing an integrated suite of equipment which will enhance mission effectiveness in dismounted close combat. This will be defined more closely during the AP. An In-Service Date will not be set until the main investment decision, but current estimates are around the end of this decade.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence in what circumstances unmarried service personnel deployed to the Gulf receive longer separated service allowance.  [100624]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w01.html_spnew4"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Longer separated service allowance (LSSA) compensates for longer separated service regardless of marital status. From 1 March 2003, following changes recommended by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB), it is paid to all eligible personnel who have completed 12 months' initial qualifying service. LSSA is paid on a daily basis for separation of 10 days or more, at three rates (basic, middle and higher) dependent upon periods of accumulated separation. Bonuses are available for those who experience very high levels of accumulated separation.
<P>

<a name="30304w01.html_para1">Regularly reviewed by the AFPRB, their 2003 report reduced the initial qualifying period from 18 months' service to 12 to target the allowance at junior personnel to ensure that they do not commence a second operational tour without compensation for separation.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w01.html_wqn5"><B> Hugh Robertson: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which categories of service personnel are eligible for longer separated service allowance; and under what circumstances it is awarded.  [100625]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w01.html_spnew5"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 Regardless of marital status, all regular service personnel can receive longer separated service allowance (LSSA) provided that they meet the qualifying criteria. Reservists who have been called out on permanent service or who undertake full-time reserve service are eligible for the allowance; members of non-regular permanent staff of the TA and reservists who are undertaking part-time reserve service can also qualify for LSSA.
<P>

<a name="30304w01.html_para2">LSSA compensates personnel for the effects of longer separated service regardless of marital category or rank. Following recommendations by the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRB), the initial qualifying period was reduced from 18 months' service to 12 months from 1 March 2003. The allowance is paid at three daily rates to eligible personnel who spend 10 days or more on temporary duty away from their permanent duty station. The basic rate is paid once 12 months' service has been completed. After 300 accrued days of

1. The Policy Simulation Model is only available for each financial year and estimates can be interpreted as relating to the mid-year point. It is therefore, not possible to provide estimates for the points in time requested. Estimates for 2003&#150;04 include the effects of the Pension Credit.<P>

2. Pensioners are defined to be households where the benefit recipient or their partner is aged 60 or over. The over 75 group includes cases where either the benefit recipient or their partner is 75 or over.<P>

3. The estimates are rounded to the nearest 10,000 and totals may not sum due to rounding.<P>

4. Although it is possible to infer estimates of take-up by comparing these figures with forecast caseloads, it should be noted that these figures may not be consistent with those published in the take-up statistics, which are estimated on a different basis.<P>

Estimates have been produced using the DWP Policy Simulation Model, which is based on the 2000&#150;01 Family Resources Survey with prices and benefits uprated to the year in question.<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w02.html_wqn0"><B> Ms Buck: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what estimate he has made of total housing benefit expenditure on private accommodation used for housing families in temporary accommodation in 2001&#150;02.  [91691]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w02.html_spnew0"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The March 2002 report, "More than a roof" and the Government's response to it set out a challenging new approach to tackling homelessness. Specific measures include changes to Housing Benefit (HB) rules worth around &#163;10 million to boost incentives for private sector leasing by local authorities.
<P>

<a name="30304w02.html_para0">HB expenditure for temporary accommodation is recorded where the accommodation is arranged by or through the Council. However, expenditure is not identified separately where a homeless person finds his/her board and lodging accommodation or where the council has no licensed or short-term lease accommodation available. Therefore it is not possible to reliably estimate total HB expenditure on private accommodation used for housing families in temporary accommodation in 2001&#150;02.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w02.html_wqn1"><B> Geraldine Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what the Government's plans are to introduce a standard local housing allowance to replace housing benefit; when the plan's changes will be introduced throughout the UK; and in which areas the reforms are being piloted.  [97318]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w02.html_spnew1"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 The Standard Local Housing Allowances (SLHA) will provide a better, quicker service based on simpler, clearer rules. It will allow people to know in advance what housing benefit support they will receive, promote choice and personal responsibility, and bridge the gap between benefit and work by allowing tenants to budget for their own rent. 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2003 : Column 889W</I><P>
Details of our proposals are in the prospectus,"Building Choice and Responsibility: a radical agenda for Housing Benefit", a copy of which is in the Library.
<P>

<a name="30304w02.html_para1">We will be piloting the SLHA in 10 pathfinder local authorities (Blackpool, Brighton and Hove, Conwy, Coventry, Edinburgh, Leeds, Lewisham, Middlesbrough, North East Lincolnshire and Teignbridge). All 10 local authorities have accepted our invitation to participate in the pilot, based on our commitment to meet all reasonable costs. The scheme will be based on local reference rents and these local authorities were selected to reflect a wide range of housing market conditions, including areas with high value rented properties.
<P>

<a name="30304w02.html_para2">Extension of SLHA throughout the rest of the country will depend on the results of our evaluation of the pilot scheme.

<P>
<a name="30304w02.html_spnew2"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 If someone cannot get out to collect their state pension which is paid into an account then they can give authority for someone they trust to do this. The precise arrangements will depend on the type of account they have. If the customer could not make alternative arrangements to draw their state pension, the Department currently has arrangements in place to ensure vulnerable customers do not suffer hardship.

 The Department for Work and Pensions supports certain students with work placements via a combination of local and centrally-run arrangements. Figures for the former are not available centrally. For the latter, the Department supported 14 students on work placements in 2002, with the aim of attracting high-calibre undergraduates who are interested in a career in the Civil Service. The Department plans to continue to offer paid work placements to undergraduates during their breaks. Payment of university fees is not therefore an issue.

It is not possible to provide projected figures for England or Wales as there is only one year's data to work with. Although costs of disposal will increase as a result of the depollution and dismantling requirements of the end-of-life vehicles directive, the impact on the number of abandoned vehicles is difficult to predict&#151;much will depend upon future values of scrap metal and the effectiveness of the various initiatives which are being taken to tackle the abandoned vehicle problem.<P>

 Waste collection authorities are required under section 3(1) of the Refuse Disposal (Amenity) Act 1978 to remove a vehicle which is abandoned in their area on any land in the open air or on any other land forming part of a highway. Section 4 of the 1978 Act enables waste disposal authorities to dispose of vehicles in their custody which have been removed because they were abandoned. Such vehicles are normally disposed of through either dismantlers or scrap yards.
<P>

<a name="30304w02.html_para9">The dismantling and recycling of End of Life Vehicles (ELVs) must be carried out in compliance with the conditions of a waste management licence or under a registered exemption from licensing and in a manner which does not pollute the environment and harm human health.
<P>

<a name="30304w02.html_para10">The End-of-Life Vehicles Directive requires that all ELVs, including those abandoned vehicles which are ELVs, are depolluted and dismantled to specified environmental standards by appropriately-permitted facilities. The permits will replace registered exemptions (unless a site is only carrying out recovery operations on de-polluted vehicles). Draft regulations to transpose this aspect of the Directive will be published shortly for consultation with a view to their coming into effect later this year. The Directive also requires that 85 per cent. by weight of ELVs are recovered and recycled by 1 January

2006, and 95 per cent. by 1 January 2015. The Government is currently considering its preferred approach to achieving these targets.
<P>

<a name="30304w02.html_para11">We estimate that disposal costs for abandoned vehicles under the 1978 Act arrangements are between &#163;30 and &#163;50 per vehicle. Under the ELV Directive additional costs for the takeback and treatment of ELVs are estimated to be &#163;50 depending on the age, condition and type of the vehicle and the price of scrap metal at the time. The increase is largely due to the costs of depolluting the ELVs to the standard required by the Directive.

<a name="30304w03.html_para0">Bush meat is generally taken to refer to meat from wild animals hunted for food. Controls on its import arise from both the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) and from controls imposed to protect animal health.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 The Environment Agency does not have the legal capacity to impose fines, which are a matter for the courts. The role of the Environment Agency is to present cases where they consider environmental damage to have been inflicted, and to maximise the chance of conviction by ensuring that all relevant information is made available to the court.
<P>

<a name="30304w03.html_para3">No assessment has yet been made of the preventive effect of fines levied against environmental offenders. The Department shares the Agency's view that the level of fines being imposed for pollution offences is generally too low. We are now working together and with others, especially the Magistrates Association, to ensure that magistrates are trained and have an increased awareness of the implications of polluting activity and consequently impose more realistic fines. To this end, the Association recently circulated relevant training material to all its 28,000 members. The Government are also exploring the possibility of developing general guidelines on sentencing for environmental offences.
<P>

<a name="30304w03.html_para4">The Agency does not hold statistical information on fines that predates the computerisation of their system in 1999. However, they produced the tables which address the question for convictions from 1999, copies of which have been placed in the Library of the House.

<a name="30304w04.html_para0">The level of tyre fly-tipping is not separately identified. However, the Environment Agency responded to over 1,300 incidents involving tyres in 2002. The actual total is likely to be substantially higher since many incidents are reported directly to local authorities and do not feature in Environment Agency statistics.
<P>

<a name="30304w04.html_para1">Government, through the Department of Trade and Industry, are shortly to issue a follow-up paper to its 2002 consultation on a possible statutory producer responsibility mechanism for used tyres. This follow-up paper invites views on the introduction of statutory reporting requirements through both the new tyre supply and used tyre disposal chains with the aim of improving the information base, promoting responsible tyre recovery and disposal practices while at the same time making it increasingly difficult for those fly-tipping tyres. The paper will also seek views on the introduction of a single point for the reporting of tyre fly-tipping incidents.

 The available information is shown in the tables below. The latest available data for municipal waste are from the 2000/01 Municipal Waste Management Survey, by Defra and the National Assembly for Wales. In 2000&#150;01 some 89 per cent of all municipal waste was domestic (household) waste. The latest available data for commercial and industrial waste are taken from the Environment Agency's National Waste Production Survey for 1999. Projections are not available.

UNSCR 1464 also authorised French and ECOWAS troops to ensure 'the protection of civilians immediately threatened with physical violence within their zones of operation, using the means available to them'.

 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office has three environment funds to which members of the public and organisations can apply.

The Environment Project Fund had an allocation of &#163;1,750,000 in that year, and made 49 awards to organisations/members of the public totalling &#163;295,000. The Environment Fund for Overseas Territories had an allocation of &#163;500,000 and made 15 awards to organisations/members of the public. These funds are administered by officials in London and at overseas posts, and separate information about the administration costs specifically for these funds is not held centrally.

Representations were received from trade bodies, insurance providers and insurance intermediaries as well as from travel agents and consumer organisations. A draft regulatory impact assessment (RIA), setting out the proposals in the consultation document, was published as annex E to the consultation document. The Government will be revising the draft RIA in the light of wider consultation responses.

<a name="30304w09.html_para4">At the outset of their fifth general review of parliamentary constituencies in February 2000, it was the intention of the Boundary Commission for England to conclude the review by the end of December 2005. That target date remains although it is possible it may change in the future. The Parliamentary Constituencies Act 1986 requires the Secretary of State to lay the report with a draft of an Order in Council giving effect to the recommendations, with or without modifications, as soon as possible after the report is received.

 Jurors are not paid for jury service but can claim financial loss allowances to cover loss of earnings or benefits, or increased expenses, incurred as a result of jury service. The maximum daily allowance of &#163;52.63 increases to &#163;105.28 where service exceeds 10 days. This increase acknowledges that jurors might incur additional expenses when they are required to serve for a longer period.

<a name="30304w09.html_spnew14"><B> Ms Rosie Winterton: </B> 
 The changing pattern of the PRO's expenditure in this period is mainly explained by the progressive introduction of new services, which collectively make a significant contribution to the e-government agenda.
<P>

<a name="30304w09.html_para7">The PRO website usage has grown from 738,977 in 1998&#150;99 to a projected figure of 70 million in 2002&#150;03 and is now regularly one of the top five government websites consulted by online users in the United Kingdom. The website includes a detailed electronic catalogue of the PRO's records and many digital record images of strong interest to educational users at all levels and to family historians.
<P>

<a name="30304w09.html_para8">It is also offering detailed guidance and increased support to other Government Departments, as they make plans to meet the target of introducing Electronic Records Management (ERM) by 2004. The PRO is itself on course to implement ERM in full in the business year 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="30304w09.html_para9">In the area of digital preservation, it is currently making arrangements for long-term archiving by setting up a secure repository at Kew, which can store selected electronic records transferred from other Government Departments. In this way a crucial part of the nation's memory will be made available to present and future generations. In the forthcoming year the PRO will secure new storage for its offsite records, thereby ensuring that all of its accessioned material is kept in conditions which comply with the relevant British Standard.

<P>

<a name="30304w11.html_para2">The Competition Commission, in its report on the supply of banking services to SMEs, made an adverse public interest finding in relation to the charging of excessive prices and therefore the making of excessive profits by the largest four clearing groups operating in England and Wales. These were HSBC, Barclays, Lloyds TSB and RBSG. The Fair Trading Act 1973 does not empower the Secretary of State to impose remedies on a company in the absence of an adverse finding. The Director General of Fair Trading was therefore required to seek undertakings in relation to interest on current accounts in surplus, or provision of free money transmission services, from these four banks only in respect of their operations in England and Wales. The conclusions of the Commission's reasoning is reported at paragraphs 2.418 to 2.431 and 2.490 to 2.495 of its report.

 The Department of the Environment's Planning Service and Belfast City Airport have a planning agreement, signed in January 1997, under Article 40 of the Planning (Northern Ireland) Order 1991. This agreement includes controls on operating hours to restrict scheduled flights to between 06.30 hours and 21.30 hours. The agreement makes provision for delayed flights to arrive between 21.30 hours and 23.59 hours.

<a name="30304w11.html_para3">To date, no formal approach has been made to Planning Service seeking provision to be made for later flights. Upon receipt of an application to amend the present planning agreement governing the operation of Belfast City Airport, the Department of the Environment would examine the application on its merits. In particular, this would involve considering whether a new planning agreement was required and the most appropriate method of dealing with the application, including the possibility of holding a Public Inquiry.

<P>
<a name="30304w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Browne: </B> 
 The Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP), chaired by Sir William Stewart, published a report on the subject of mobile phone technology in May 2000. The Group examined the health implications of this technology and carried out an assessment of existing research. It concluded that the balance of evidence indicated that there was no general risk to the health of people living near to base stations on the basis that exposures were expected to be small fractions of the guidelines.
<P>

<a name="30304w12.html_para3">Recognising, however, that there were gaps in knowledge, the Expert Group recommended further research and as a result a joint government/industry research project, to which my Department is contributing &#163;30,000 over three years, was announced in 2001. The Mobile Telecommunications and Health Research (MTHR) Programme invites research applications both in relation to masts and to mobile phone handsets. Research on the group of projects funded under the first call is now well under way. The names of the projects selected from the second call are expected to be announced in due course and an advert for a third call appeared in appropriate publications in week commencing 16 December.

 Further to my answers to Question ref. 82681, <i>Official Report</i>, 25 November 2002, column 24W, and Question ref. 82682, <i>Official Report,</i> 28 January 2003, column 770W, I can confirm that the plans for the retention of services on the Whitehead to Larne railway are set out in the "Regional Transportation Strategy for Northern Ireland 2002&#150;12" (RTS). The intention is to retain services on this line, subject to successful results from the introduction of new trains and improved infrastructure on the "core" network in the early stages of implementing the RTS. Hence, in the short to medium term services will be retained on the Whitehead to Larne railway line, subject to normal safety procedures. However, no major improvements will be carried out until the assessments referred to above are concluded.

 Better partnership between bus operators and local authorities, with co-ordinated investment in infrastructure and new vehicles, is a proven way of growing bus patronage, and is particularly effective where it can relieve congestion. Other local authority policies, for example on parking restraint and park-and-ride schemes, can also encourage greater use of buses. That is why we have established the Bus Forum between the bus operators and local authorities to develop the best framework for this partnership.

<a name="30304w14.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 My Department has taken a number of proactive measures since 1997 with a view to reducing pollution in UK waters. Among these measures, the following are particularly worthy of note:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>in 1997 we were the first country to introduce a statutory requirement on ports to prepare a port waste management plan to address the waste disposal needs of all types of ships calling.
<P>
<BR>
in 1997, we introduced legislation which enables magistrates to impose a fine of up to &#163;250,000 on either the master or ship owner for an oil pollution offence. This is the highest fine for any offence in a magistrates court.
<P>
<BR>
we have played a leading role in launching the 1997 Quality Shipping Campaign, which tackles the problem of substandard shipping and marine pollution by addressing the role of owners and flag states in fulfilling their responsibilities under relevant international conventions.
<P>
<BR>
in 1999 we introduced the role of Secretary of State's Representative for Maritime Salvage and Intervention (commonly know as SOSREP), who has the power to oversee, control and, if necessary, intervene in salvage operations within UK waters involving vessels or fixed platforms where there is a significant risk of pollution. The SOSREP role has proved very successful, as well as being an international first for the UK.
<P>
<BR>
in 1999 we increased the number of government-funded Emergency Towing Vessels (ETVs) around the UK coast to four (located in the Dover Strait, the Minch, the South West approaches and in the Fair Isle), and in October 2001 we extended their period of operation so that all four operate all year round.
<P>
<BR>
in 2000, we published the revised National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations, setting out how the relevant agencies and authorities in the UK will respond to such pollution incidents.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30304w14.html_para2">As regards further measures, the Government are now in the final stages of the identification of Marine Environmental High Risk Areas (MEHRAs), which will further assist in the protection of our seas and coasts. We are working on a consultation document which will announce the locations of the MEHRAs and seek comments on a range of issues associated with MEHRAs. We expect to issue the document for public consultation shortly.
<P>

<a name="30304w14.html_para3">My Department's Maritime and Coastguard Agency annually commissions a report to compile statistics and other information on the different types of marine pollution in the waters around the British Isles. Since 1965 this work has been completed by the Advisory Committee on Protection of the Sea (ACOPS), and in 2000 the ACOPS Report was revised and now provides data on the number of incidents, the type of incident by pollutant, the source of the pollutant and the geographical distribution of the reported incidents. The key figures from the ACOPS Reports since 1997 on chemical, oil, diesel spillages in UK waters are as follows.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport (1) what measures he is taking to address the shortcomings in the provision of safety information by NATS to general aviation; and what assessment his Department has made of the risk posed by flying without access to safety information;  [100260]
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w14.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government's statutory aviation safety adviser, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), has assured me that there are no shortcomings in the provision of Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) information. The new version of the NOTAM handling system launched last August by National Air Traffic Services Ltd. (NATS) did have teething problems, but the CAA is satisfied that aviation safety has not been compromised and it has been possible to obtain the required data during this period.
<P>

<a name="30304w14.html_para5">My officials have been in regular contact since last September with the CAA and NATS to discuss the resolution of the outstanding difficulties with the NOTAM system. Many of these difficulties have been resolved by the system improvements made since its introduction last August and which have concentrated on making it more user friendly. Furthermore, a number of meetings have taken place between CAA and NATS officials and representatives of the user community to address these concerns.
<P>

<a name="30304w14.html_para6">NATS is scheduled to introduce a further revision of the NOTAM system in April 2003 designed to overcome the outstanding difficulties the General Aviation community is having with it. Officials from my Department and the CAA are monitoring the progress of this work and will continue to scrutinise the performance of the system after the changes have been made.

 All train operators have an obligation to avoid excessive overcrowding on the services they provide, and they must agree a plan with the Strategic Rail Authority detailing how they will match capacity to demand. The authority have recently announced a number of timetable revisions agreed with Virgin Cross Country to be made from May and September which are aimed at improving performance and relieving congestion. In the longer-term the authority's "Capacity Utilisation Policy" will determine the most efficient use of the network.

 The role of the Crown Prosecution Service is to review and prosecute cases of domestic violence in accordance with the Code for Crown Prosecutors and CPS policy. The revised policy, launched in November 2001, focuses on victims' priorities of safety, support and information and promotes the immediate and long-term safety of the victim and any children, while holding abusers accountable for their actions. This is achieved by promoting close working relationships between the Crown Prosecution Service, the police and the voluntary sector, to ensure that decisions are properly informed and victims are properly supported. The revised policy also emphasises the need to construct cases, wherever possible, on the basis of evidence other than that of the victim. To underpin CPS policy, each CPS area has a domestic violence coordinator.

Staffing levels at the Serious Fraud Office have steadily increased over the last four years. This has been necessary in order to accept a higher caseload and to compensate, in part for the reduction in the number of police officers made available to the SFO. The SFO continues to be an important tool in the fight against white-collar crime and its dedicated and professional staff play a fundamental role in the fight against fraud.<P>

 Neither DFID nor the UN agencies WHO or FAO have made an estimate of these figures. Malnutrition increases the propensity to catch other illnesses but is very hard to isolate as the direct cause of death in Afghanistan, where there is food insecurity but no famine.

<a name="30304w15.html_para3">The WFP estimates that in 2003 approximately 4.3 million people in rural settled areas will not be able to meet basic food needs.

<P>

<a name="30304w15.html_para4">UN agencies are co-ordinating a response that provides food aid to the most vulnerable sections of society, including returning refugees and people in isolated, rural areas.

 HIV/AIDS is having a catastrophic impact on sub-Saharan Africa undermining and even reversing gains made in economic and social development over the last two decades. Current estimates suggest that HIV/AIDS has reduced the growth of Africa's per capita income by 0.7 percentage points a year.
<P>

<a name="30304w16.html_para1">In South Africa, DFID is co-funding research into the economic impact of HIV/AIDS (with USAID and AUSAID), looking at the effects on labour supply, agriculture, on the education and health sectors, and at the household level. Research is also being done on developing methodologies for the analysis of the impact of HIV/AIDS on economic sectors, which will have broader application across Africa. In Kenya and Malawi, DFID are shortly about to undertake similar impact assessments.
<P>

<a name="30304w16.html_para2">Elsewhere in Africa, economic impact assessments are being undertaken by a number of agencies, the findings of which are enabling DFID to develop their cross-sector strategy to combat HIV/AIDS and support country governments in mainstreaming HIV/AIDS responses.

<P>

<a name="30304w16.html_para4"><i>(b)</i> In Malawi, HIV/AIDS is estimated to depress economic growth by 1.5 to 2 per cent. annually. Human capital is being continually drained with 8 to 10 per cent. of teachers lost every year to AIDS, faster than can be trained.
<P>

<a name="30304w16.html_para5"><i>(c)</i> HIV/AIDS is impacting negatively on South Africa's international competitiveness, with domestic and foreign investment being deterred because of the high HIV prevalence rates.
<P>

<a name="30304w16.html_para6"><i>(d)</i> The World bank estimated that in Tanzania, GDP will be 15 to 20 per cent. smaller than in a non-AIDS scenario in 2010 because of the impact of disease on physical, human, and social capital accumulation.
<P>

<a name="30304w16.html_para7"><i>(e)</i> Ethiopia is a predominantly agricultural based economy, and HIV/AIDS is impacting heavily on rural populations. Families with an infected family member spend 14 hours a week working their land compared with the average of 34 hours, bringing agricultural productivity down considerably.

education is critical to ensure that "Education for All" is achieved and that school children in Africa are properly equipped with the skills and knowledge with which to protect themselves from the epidemic. This includes working directly with Ministries of Education to ensure that school curricula address HIV and AIDS in a manner that is gender-sensitive and relevant to students.

To ask the Secretary of State for International Development, what contingency plans have been made to assist the civilians of Iraq in <i>(a)</i> water supplies, <i>(b)</i> food and <i>(c)</i> medical treatment after military conflict.  [100082]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w16.html_spnew3"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Operational humanitarian organisations have made a range of contingency plans to assist civilians with water food and medical treatment in the event of conflict in Iraq. My Department is in close contact with several such organisations, including Un agencies, the Red Cross/Crescent and NGOs. We also discuss regularly with the armed forces the importance of minimising the extent of civilian suffering, and the limited humanitarian assistance the military could provide during any period before UN agencies/NGOs were operational.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w16.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The continuation of the oil-for-food programme would be a very high priority in the event of any conflict in Iraq. Measures necessary to ensure this are being actively discussed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w16.html_spnew5"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Following any possible conflict in Iraq, I would expect as elsewhere that the International Committee of the Red Cross, and those UN agencies and NGOs experienced in tracing and family reunification, would take the lead in helping affected families. My Department regularly funds such organisations.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w16.html_spnew6"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 UN agencies and others have made a range of estimates of possible displaced people, which vary widely. The number of people who might leave their houses or try to cross borders would depend on what they are moving from. An essential part of our work has been to try to refine the military options to minimise the humanitarian risk which would lead to large scale movements of people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w16.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 Kosovo's health indicators are amongst the worst in Europe, following years of neglect to health services, the exclusion of the majority Albanian population from formal healthcare under the Milosevic regime, and serious damage to facilities during the 1999 conflict.
<P>

<a name="30304w16.html_para17">Since 1999, the international community has invested Euro92 million in the reconstruction of Kosovo's health care facilities. The UN administration has established a basic framework for the delivery of health services. This responsibility has now been transferred to Ministry of Health of the elected Provisional Institutions of Self Government.
<P>

<a name="30304w16.html_para18">My department has invested heavily in the improvement of Kosovo's health services, providing extensive emergency assistance during the immediate post-conflict phase, and a subsequent Euro11 million as technical assistance and infrastructure development. We now plan to launch a Euro1.6 million programme to boost the capacity of the Ministry of Health to meet these challenges. In addition, we have contributed approximately Euro7.8 million through the European Commission's health programmes since 1999.




<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2003 : Column 946W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30304w16.html_para19">Education services were similarly disrupted during the Milosevic years and the eventual conflict. There is some evidence that access to education has improved markedly since the conflict ended, with the total number of children attending school rising by 42 per cent. since 1998, and the total number of university students rising by 19 per cent. My department does not provide direct support for education services in Kosovo, as this sector is already well provided for by other donors, including the World Bank and the Canadian and German governments.

: Food aid is provided by a range of donors in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Comprehensive figures are not available. The largest provider, UNRWA, disbursed food to the value of US$21 million in 2002, and plans further support of US$32million in the first six months of 2003. The World Food Programme, the International Committee of the Red Cross and a range of NGOs provide complimentary support to the non-refugee population. Food aid is however only one of a range of instruments used to meet the urgent needs of the Palestinian people. Other instruments, such as budget support and employment generation, have contributed significantly in easing the growing humanitarian situation and have the added benefit of stimulating the local economy.

<P>
<a name="30304w17.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The most likely major impact, in the event of a war in Iraq, would be a complete closure by Israel of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, severely restricting travel between and within the Occupied Territories. The international community has made it clear that Israel must allow humanitarian operations to continue without impediment, including the safe passage of humanitarian staff and supplies. Lessons learned from the 1991 Gulf War and from the intense military activity of Israel's 'Operation Defensive Shield' in 2002 will help international and local organisations cope more effectively should this happen.

 We are working, in close cooperation with our international and Palestinian partners, to support a range of initiatives to help ease the humanitarian situation in the West Bank and Gaza. We have supported the World Bank's employment generation project and a wide range of healthcare and education programmes. Our contributions to the World Bank's Emergency Services Support Programme help the Palestinian Ministries of Health and Education to continue to deliver services despite the economic and social decline. And our support for UNRWA delivers vital health and education services to the Palestinian refugee population.

 Over the last two years there have been significant disruptions of the delivery schedule of food aid by the World Food Programme (WFP), and other providers such as UNRWA, due to Israeli military actions and movement restrictions. Food consignments have been held in Israeli ports for considerable periods, and in November 2002 the Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) destroyed a WFP warehouse in Gaza. 540 tonnes of food supplies were destroyed. High level representation by the international community has led to Israel's agreement to reimburse WFP's losses as a 'humanitarian gesture'.

<a name="30304w18.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The foot and mouth disease outbreak in Zimbabwe is another problem directly attributable to the lack of law and order and mismanagement of a poorly conceived land reform programme. Fences around wildlife reserves have been destroyed, and domestic cattle allowed to mingle with wild buffalo that carry the disease.
<P>

<a name="30304w18.html_para2">The problem cannot be fully solved until the fences are restored and the movement of indigenous cattle regulated effectively. In the meantime, the FAO have imported 340,000 doses of vaccine, which are being used in the worst affected areas. This contribution was funded by the Dutch Government. Although more vaccine will be needed, my Department has prioritised support for the humanitarian crisis affecting 7.2 million Zimbabweans, and work to prevent and mitigate the impact of HIV/AIDS.

<a name="30304w19.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Miliband  </B> 
<i>[holding answer 3 March 2003]:</i> Before October 1998, there was nothing to prevent a local authority selling a school playing field if it wanted to. Section 77 of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998 was introduced in October 1998 to protect school playing fields from indiscriminate disposal. Section 77 requires local authorities and schools to obtain the 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2003 : Column 955W</I><P>
written consent of the Secretary of State before disposing, or changing the use, of school playing fields and applies to all maintained schools, irrespective of pupils' ages. In addition, the Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 prescribe minimum areas of team game playing fields for those schools with pupils who have attained the age of eight years. Although the regulations do not require team game playing fields to be provided for pupils under eight years, section 77 protects all areas of playing fields which have been provided, whether in response to regulatory requirements or otherwise.
<P>

<a name="30304w19.html_para2">Applications to dispose, or change the use, of school playing fields are assessed against the following criteria:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(a) schools' needs: that playing field provision and curriculum requirements at the school making the disposal&#151;irrespective of the age of those pupils that attend the school, and at the statutory needs of other schools in the local area, will be met;

(b) community needs: that community use of a school's playing fields is taken into account, with alternative facilities made available if necessary; and

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Bill seeks to repeal the provisions of the School Standards and Framework Act 1998, which enable schools with a specialism, not just those designated under the Specialist Schools Programme, to give priority to up to 10 per cent. of pupils who can demonstrate an aptitude in one or more of the prescribed subjects.
<P>

<a name="30304w19.html_para7">We do not believe it is necessary nor desirable to remove the flexibility which enables the admission authorities for schools with a specialism, where they wish to do so, to give limited priority to pupils with a particular aptitude for the relevant specialism. Allowing limited use of aptitude in this way makes it possible for pupils who, for example, show a capacity to be trained or developed in sport or the visual arts to get a place where they would not have been able to do so under the school's other admissions criteria.

 The Government believe that animal based research still has an important part to play in research relating to the biomedical sciences. Neurological diseases and disorders remain major sources of human morbidity and mortality. Their impact is felt by individuals, their families, and society in general. Notwithstanding progress that has been made with understanding the causes and identifying possible treatments, there remains an urgent need to find better methods of preventing and treating conditions such as stroke, Parkinson's disease, and mental health problems. This requires the identification and use of the best current scientific technologies, not simply a reliance on animal research.
<P>

<a name="30304w20.html_para0">To meet section 5(4) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, any application to use protected animals in research must be subjected to a detailed cost/benefit assessment by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate.

The reliability and relevance of all animal models requested are key considerations in the cost/benefit assessment and the Secretary of State looks to a number of sources, including Home Office inspectors and the Animal Procedures Committee, to provide advice not only relating to programmes of work, but also relating to technical developments that enable animal models to be reduced, refined and replaced.

 In order to support the Criminal Records Bureau (CRB) continuous improvement programme, the United Kingdom Passport Service (UKPS) has seconded staff without any significant impact on the delivery of the passports.
<P>

<a name="30304w21.html_para0">The secondment programme began in June 2002 with the majority taking place during the period of lower seasonal demand for passports. UKPS normally seeks work for its staff elsewhere in the Home Office and other Government Departments at this time as a "wider markets" initiative. Currently, 35 UKPS staff remain attached to either CRB or are offering support to police forces.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much the inquiry headed by Patrick Carter into the Criminal Records Bureau will cost; and who will be responsible for the costs.  [99388]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w21.html_spnew6"><B> Hilary Benn: </B> 
 The estimated cost of the review is &#163;585,000. This includes the cost of various consultancies in support of the review. The Home Office will be responsible for this cost.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department which local authorities in England and Wales have a written and publicly available policy on domestic violence; when each local authority's domestic violence policy was published; and if he will make a statement.  [94124]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 Central Government keep records of local authority policies only where there is a statutory requirement to have one. It is therefore not possible to give the Information requested since there is no statutory requirement to have a domestic violence policy, though all are encouraged to do so.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department pursuant to his answer of 5 February 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 328W, in what circumstances drug treatment and testing orders are revoked; what is deemed as failure to comply by a participant; and if he will undertake a review of DTTOs.  [99284]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Drug Treatment and Testing orders (DTTO) can be revoked for any of the following reasons: failure to comply; a conviction for a further offence; for other reasons, including ill-health or death or where the offender has demonstrated good progress on the order.
<P>

<a name="30304w21.html_para3">Failure to comply refers to failure to adhere to the requirements of the order as set out under legislation and determined by the court. The two main requirements are to attend for treatment and to attend for testing as specified for a set period. The offender must also attend periodic court reviews and is expected to comply with instructions issued to him by his responsible officer.
<P>

<a name="30304w21.html_para4">The results of the first year of a two year re-conviction study and also a DTTO thematic inspection report will be published later this year. The Government intend that the DTTO will become part of the generic community sentence as proposed by the Criminal Justice Bill currently before Parliament.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The best available evidence on the links between criminal offending and drug use comes form the New English and Welsh Arrestee Drug Abuse (NEW-ADAM) research programme. This involves interviewing and drug testing those arrested by the 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2003 : Column 963W</I><P>
police at 16 sites throughout England and Wales. Analysis of the data from the first eight sites in the programme, collected during 1999&#150;2000, shows that of those arrestees that provided a urine sample, 65 per cent. tested positive for one or more illegal drugs. Furthermore, 55 per cent. of arrestees who reported using one of more drugs in the last 12 months and committing one or more acquisitive crimes, acknowledged a link between their drug use and their offending behaviour. This proportion rose to 78 per cent. for arrestees who said they had used heroin and cocaine/crack.
<P>

<a name="30304w21.html_para5">Drug Treatment and Testing Orders (DTTO) enable courts to require offenders to undergo treatment and other programmes, designed to tackle their drug misuse and offending. Before making such an Order, a court has to be satisfied that:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>the offender is dependent upon, or has shown/demonstrated a propensity to misuse, drugs and that their offending is linked to drug misuse;
<P>
<BR>
is motivated and amenable to treatment;

has given consent; and
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w21.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 For a clause or schedule to be debated during the Committee Stage a member of the Committee must either table an amendment to it or speak to the motion that it should stand part of the Bill. In the case of a large number of clauses in the Extradition Bill, no member of the committee chose to do so.
<P>

<a name="30304w21.html_para7">The number of Committee sessions for the Bill was agreed through the usual channels. The figure of nine was first suggested by the official Opposition.
<P>

<a name="30304w21.html_para8">At its first meeting the Committee sessions for the Bill was agreed the terms of a programme motion which imposed a number of cut-off points by which discussion of a particular part of the Bill had to be completed.
<P>

<a name="30304w21.html_para9">On only one occasion did the knife fall before the Committee had completed its discussion of the relevant part. This was in respect of Part 1 of the Bill which covers clauses 1&#150;67. The knife fell when the Committee was discussing clause 63.
<P>

<a name="30304w21.html_para10">Amendments to clauses 63, 64 and 65 had already been discussed at previous Committee sittings. At the point when the knife fell, the Chair was obliged to put the question for each of the remaining Part 1 clauses that it should stand part of the Bill. It was open to any member of the Committee to oppose it. No member of the Committee chose to do so in respect of clauses 66 and 67.

<P>

<a name="30304w21.html_para11">When it became clear that there was a possibility that the knife might fall before the Committee had completed its deliberations on Part 1, the Government made several offers to change the timetable. All of these offers were rejected by the official Opposition.

<P>
<a name="30304w22.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Burstow: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the maximum fine is that can be levied on a hit-and-run driver without insurance.  [98723]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Under section 170 of the Road Traffic Act 1988 a driver is required to stop after an accident and provide his name and address. If for any reason the driver does not give his name and address, he is required to report the accident. Should the driver fail to do either of the above, the maximum fine available is &#163;5,000 (level 5 on the standard scale). This is also the maximum fine for driving without insurance under section 143 of the Road Traffic Act 1988. Therefore, a driver convicted of both of these offences could be subjected to a maximum fine of &#163;1,000.
<P>

<a name="30304w22.html_para0">If a driver fails to stop or report following a serious road traffic incident in respect of which there is evidence to support more serious charges, he may be prosecuted for those offences in addition to failing to stop or report.

To ask the Secretary of State for he Home Department how many <i>(a)</i> hit-and-run accidents, <i>(b)</i> hit-and-run accidents whose driver did not have insurance and <i>(c)</i> hit-and-run drivers taken to court and (i) fined, (ii) imprisoned and (iii) acquitted there were in each of the last five years; and what percentage of these fines remain unpaid.

 Department for Transport figures are given in the following table for the number of hit-and-run accidents in England and Wales for the years 1997&#150;2001.
<P>

<a name="30304w22.html_para1">It is not possible, in the statistics collected centrally, to distinguish offences relating to a "hit-and-run" accident from offences resulting from other kinds of accidents. Motorists charged following a "hit-and-run" will e charged with an offence appropriate to the circumstances. This may often be failing to stop after an accident or failing to report an accident, but more serious charges may be preferred in some cases depending on the circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30304w22.html_para2">Table B shows available data on motoring offences within England and Wales, as defined in section 170 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, for failing to stop after an accident or failing to report an accident within 24 hours. The figures shown are the numbers of offences, rather than the numbers of offenders.
<P>

<a name="30304w22.html_para3">Data on the number of cases where drivers were convicted for insurance offences, (under section 143 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, using motor vehicle uninsured against third party risks), as well as the offences of failing to stop after an accident or failing to report an accident within 24 hours are given in table C.

There are no published data on decision times for individual types of settlement applications. Our aim is to decide all straightforward applications within three weeks. At present some straightforward applications decided in initial consideration are taking about 10 weeks because of the exceptionally high intake of new 



applications received in the latter part of 2002. At present some applications that cannot be dealt with on initial consideration can take around 12 months to decide. Measures are being taken to reduce turnaround times.<P>

The information on staff dealing with marriage applications is not available in the form requested as individual staff members do not take decisions solely on marriage applications.<P>

 Prisoners may receive different types of assessment for drug treatment, depending on need and availability. All prisoners receive a health care assessment on reception into custody which will trigger a further assessment for detoxification if required. All prisoners referred to counselling, assessment, referral, advice and throughcare (CARATs) receive an initial assessment of need.
<P>

<a name="30304w22.html_para6">Prior to acceptance on a rehabilitation programme, all prisoners will receive a detailed assessment. Figures showing the number of CARAT assessments are given in the following table. No figures are available centrally for the number of detoxification and rehabilitation assessments undertaken. Figures for the number of actual treatments, a proxy measure of assessments, are included in the table.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2003]</i>: The number of offenders being supervised by multi-agency public protection panels in each area of England and Wales is not currently available and there is no central database of these offenders. However, each area's multi-agency public protection arrangements (the MAPPA) annual report (to be published this summer) will include this information. Also, a computer-based Violent and Sex offenders Register (ViSoR) is being developed with plans for its introduction next year.

<P>

 Prison caterers are required to offer a balanced and varied diet which meets the nutritional needs of prisoners. Healthy options are indicated on all menus. Advice for caterers is contained in Prison Service Order 5000, together with mandatory requirements. The advice is consistent with recommendations made by the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food Policy and covers nutritional and energy intake.

<a name="30304w23.html_para2">A nutritional research analysis of prison food was carried out in late 1998 by Professor John Edwards of Bournemouth University. The report concluded that 'the diet consumed in all surveyed prisons was extremely good and in general fell within the recommendations'. Individual clinical needs of prisoners are assessed by medical officers. Any necessary supplements would be given on the authority of the medical officer.

 Figures for prisoners in England and Wales testing positive under the random mandatory drug testing programme are not disaggregated by sentence length. Figures for heroin are included under the heading of opiates. Laboratory analysis is not able to distinguish between use of crack cocaine and cocaine. The respective percentages of positive tests for opiates and cocaine in 2001&#150;02 are 4.6 per cent. and 0.2 per cent.

 There has been and continues to be a large amount of research relevant to the broad hypothesis that current exposures to chemicals may alter the functions of the endocrine system in such a way as to harm human health, and many expert reviews have been published. The most recent comprehensive review is in the International Programme on Chemical Safety (IPCS), Global assessment of the state-of-the-science of endocrine disrupters, published in August 2002 by the World Health Organization (WHO/PCS/EDC/02.2). A copy will be deposited in the Library. The report is also available at http://www.who.int/pcs/emerg site/edc/global edc TOC.htm

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what clinical trials there have been on heroin treatment using <i>(a)</i> methadone, <i>(b)</i> buprenorphine, <i>(c)</i> naltraxone, <i>(d)</i> psychotherapy and <i>(e)</i> residential rehabilitation.  [98153]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30304w25.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Blears: </B> 
 Comprehensive reviews of the effectiveness of methadone have been provided by several authors (Hall et al., 1998, Farrell et al., 1994, Bertschy 1995, Marsch, 1998). Most of those studies demonstrating the effectiveness of methadone are of on-going maintenance treatment but the evidence generally becomes weaker as the duration of treatment shortens, with little systematic evidence to support short-term detoxification. Specific studies include Fontain & Ansseau, 1995, Glass, 1993 and Gossop, M. et al., 2001. High quality medical and psychosocial services, a clear orientation towards social rehabilitation, treatment longevity and slow detoxification of well-stabilised patients have all been identified as giving the best outcomes (Cacciola et al 1998, Bertschy 1995). Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) show a relationship between higher doses (&gt;50 mg) and reduced illicit drug use with better treatment retention rates (Ward et al 1992, Ling et al 1996, Fontaine & Ansseau 1995 and D'Aunno & Vaughan 1992).
<P>

<a name="30304w25.html_para8">Buprenorphine has more recently been established as a potential effective alternative substitution treatment for some patients by a number of studies such as those concentrating on effective doses including Johnson et al., 1995, Ling et al., 1998 and Strain et al., 1994. Specific differences from methadone have been highlighted in other studies including Walsh et al., 1994, Reynaud et al., 1998, Bickel & Amass, 1995, Reisinger, 1997 and Barnett P. G. et al., 2001) and trials in Europe have been reviewed by Chapleo et al., 1997. Also see Uehlinger, C. et al. 1998 and Fischer, G. et al. 1999 for published studies.
<P>

<a name="30304w25.html_para9">The Cochrane review of buprenorphine maintenance for opioid dependence in August 2002 concluded 'Buprenorphine is an effective intervention for use in the maintenance treatment of heroin dependence, but it is not more effective than methadone at adequate dosages.'
<P>

<a name="30304w25.html_para10">The effectiveness of naltrexone for relapse prevention has been demonstrated in controlled studies by Shufman et al., 1994 and Gerra et al., 1995. Probation-linked supervised naltrexone has been used as an alternative to custody in opiate-misusing offenders and studied by Brahen & Brewer, 1993. A recent systematic review of the efficacy of naltrexone maintenance treatment in opioid dependence by Kirt Mayer et al. 2002 noted limit support for naltrexone in its findings and this treatment is generally seen as appropriate for a minority of patients.
<P>

<a name="30304w25.html_para11">The Cochrane review of naltrexone maintenance for opioid dependence in January 2002 concluded 'The available trials do not allow a final evaluation of naltrexone maintenance treatment yet. A trend in 



<P>
<P><I>4 Mar 2003 : Column 982W</I><P>
favour of treatment with naltrexone was observed for certain target groups (particularly people who are highly motivated), as has been previously described in the literature.'
<P>

<a name="30304w25.html_para12">There is a very limited experimental research base comparing specific psychotherapies. McLellan et al., 1994 reviewed the evidence and concluded that 'successful outcomes are related to marked and consistent differences between counsellors,' and 'a study of whether the addition of counselling improved the efficacy of methadone maintenance programmes found that the addition of basic counselling on a weekly basis resulted in major and significant improvements'.
<P>

<a name="30304w25.html_para13">International literature (Gerstein D. R. et al., 1990, Kooyman M., 1993 and Hubbard, R., 1994) demonstrates improvements from residential rehabilitation with programmes offering additional services having improved outcomes. The National Treatment Outcome Research Study (Gossop et al. 2001) has confirmed benefits in the UK for those attending residential rehabilitation and found that time in residential treatment is predictive of superior outcomes.

 A wide range of services which are tailored to suit individual needs are required to support people with motor neurone disease (MND). National health service services provided include physiotherapy, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and augmentative communication, mobility aids and district nursing support. In the later stages of the disease, the following interventions may also be required: enteral feeding (for severe dysphagia), domiciliary or hospice care and ventilatory support, including mechanical ventilation and tracheostomy.
<P>

<a name="30304w28.html_para0">The National Institute of Clinical Excellence (NICE) has reviewed the evidence of the clinical and cost effectiveness of Riluzole for MND. NICE has advised that Riluzole (marketed as Rilutek) should be made available in the NHS as one component of the management of those people with the amyotrophic lateral sclerosis form of MND.

 The national service framework (NSF) for long-term conditions will focus on neurological conditions, including motor neurone disease and brain and spinal injuries. It will also tackle some of the common issues, which are relevant to a wider range of people with long-term conditions generally and help to drive up the quality of treatment and care.

One of the groups is looking at areas where standards might be set along the patient pathway for people with progressive conditions, including motor neurone disease. People with clinical expertise and experience in dealing with motor neurone disease and from the Motor Neurone Disease Association are represented on this group. They will ensure that the needs of people with motor neurone disease are considered during development of the NSF.

 The independent Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE) was set up in 1985 to advise Government on such matters.

This study will include data on over 33,000 cases of childhood cancer and will address the question of whether there is a real association between British nuclear installations and the incidence of those cancer cases. This will be the subject of a major COMARE report, which it hopes to complete this year. The Department of Health and the Department for Environment Food and Rural Affairs has also asked COMARE to review the latest data on the risks from internal radiation emitters and advise on any further research that may be required. To help them to do this they have set up the Committee Examining Radiation Risks from Internal Emitters (CERRIE). This group is also hoping to report in 2003. Furthermore, Government have asked the small area statistics unit to draw up a protocol for a study of the incidence of adult cancers in the areas around British nuclear installations.
