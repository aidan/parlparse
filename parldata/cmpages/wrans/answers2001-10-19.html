 Lists of central Government bodies are published regularly by the Cabinet Office. The "List of Ministerial Responsibilities" details Departments and next steps agencies and has been published at regular intervals since 1975. The specific statistics are not held in the form requested. "Public Bodies" lists non-departmental public bodies, NHS bodies, nationalised industries and certain public corporations and has been published annually since 1982. Copies of these publications are available from the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<a name="11019w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Government remain committed to providing a revitalised rail network in the UK, and the west coast main line upgrade is an integral part of that commitment. Work on the west coast main line project will continue and we will be discussing with the Railway Administrator the best way of ensuring that the project is taken forward.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions if he will list the number, value and location of properties newly leased in each of the last five years by his Department, including and distinguishing between the Department itself, its next step agencies and its non-departmental public bodies, differentiating between purchases made as a result of the creation of new bodies and those purchases made by established bodies.  [7821]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 Since 1 April 1996, the Department and its Agencies have entered into leases on 225 properties. One hundred and eighty-nine of these added new properties to the DTLR portfolio and 36 were lease renewals. The total annual rental value of these leases is &#163;12,151,310&#151;new property accounts for &#163;11,974,186 and renewed leases account for &#163;177,124.
<P>

<a name="11019w02.html_para2">All of these leases were taken by existing organisations, with the exception of the Rent Service. This became an Executive Agency on 1 October 1999 and all 59 of its existing properties transferred to DTLR in 1999, with newly assigned leases.
<P>

<a name="11019w02.html_para3">We do not hold information on leases for DTLR non-departmental public bodies.
<P>

<a name="11019w02.html_para4">I am placing a list of all leases acquired by DTLR in this period, together with breakdowns by agency and region, in the Libraries of the House.

<P>
<a name="11019w02.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 None. Comprehensive planning policy guidance is provided in Planning Policy Guidance note 10, 'Planning and Waste Management', which was issued in September 1999. It already provides advice about how the land use planning system should contribute to achieving sustainable waste management, through the careful siting of new waste management facilities including, where appropriate, incinerators.

 Stage 2 of the Government's study into air travel and health was completed in June and a copy of the consultants' report has been placed on the Department's website.

 The rough sleepers unit is charged with delivering the Prime Minister's target to reduce the numbers of rough sleepers across England to as near zero as possible but by at least two thirds by 2002.
<P>

<a name="11019w02.html_para5">The RSU is staffed by civil servants from across Whitehall, as well as outside experts from local government, the voluntary and private sector. There are currently 32 staff employed by the unit.
<P>

<a name="11019w02.html_para6">The unit published its second progress report in the summer which shows the significant impact the "Coming in from the Cold" strategy has made. The number of people sleeping rough in England has fallen by 62 per cent. over the last three years. It is estimated that there are 703 people sleeping rough in England in 2001 compared with 1,850 in 1998.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w02.html_spnew8"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 My Department's Public Service Agreement target on rough sleeping is to reduce the number of people sleeping rough by two thirds by April 2002, compared with June 1998, and to keep the number

<P>

<a name="11019w02.html_para8">The recently established bed-and-breakfast unit's main objective is to reduce the use of bed-and-breakfast accommodation for homeless families with children. Once the unit has reviewed the current situation and is clear on base-lines, it will set clear and measurable targets.
<P>

<a name="11019w02.html_para9">My Department has given a commitment to prepare a national homelessness strategy, which will set out action to tackle homelessness by central and local government as well as other key stakeholders in the housing and voluntary sectors. As part of consultation on this strategy, which ended on 19 October 2001, views were invited on possible homelessness targets in addition to those on rough sleeping and bed-and-breakfast accommodation. My Department is now evaluating the responses.

<P>
<a name="11019w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 In the current financial year, &#163;1.67 million has been allocated for research into methods for improving transport security. A similar sum will be made available for the next financial year.

 Draft guidance that my Department has developed through consultation with all the major stakeholders, including sheltered housing providers, is due to be issued on 31 October.
<P>

<a name="11019w03.html_para1">The Government are committed to supporting the independence of older people, both in their own homes, and in sheltered accommodation, if this is their choice. Local authorities are responsible for assessing housing and support needs in their local areas. Best value reviews of services to older people, and service level reviews of sheltered housing which receive "supporting people" grant, will together help local authorities ensure that sheltered housing provides high quality accommodation and support where it is needed most.

 The "supporting people" programme, which starts in April 2003, will provide a new framework for planning and financing support services, including those provided in sheltered housing. Local authorities will administer the new programme, working in partnership with other agencies, service providers and those using or needing services. As part of this work, authorities will be expected to review existing services regularly and consider whether any changes should be made. Whether or not a particular sheltered housing scheme is provided on the basis that all the residents living there receive the same services will be entirely a matter for local decision.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what proposals he has to introduce attachment of earnings orders from the Child Support Agency to serving and other personnel employed by his Department.  [8913]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w04.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 Under child support legislation, the Child Support Agency is able to request that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) implement deductions from the pay of both service and civilian personnel to meet child support maintenance payments. In the case of service personnel these are known as Deductions of Earnings Requests. These are effectively the same as Attachment of Earnings Orders which the Child Support Agency uses to obtain payment from 'non-resident parents' within the population at large, including MOD civil servants.
<P>

<a name="11019w04.html_para7">From the introduction of the legislation in 1993 it has been the MOD's policy to comply with all such requests, other than in exceptional circumstances. The MOD maintains a Memorandum of Understanding with the Child Support Agency which details the administrative procedures to be followed by both Departments when contacting service personnel. A copy is held in the Library of the House.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what additional measures she proposes to promote the construction of <i>(a)</i> wave, <i>(b)</i> solar, <i>(c)</i> hydro electric, <i>(d)</i> wind and <i>(e)</i> other renewable energy sources.  [6756]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w05.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department is taking a wide range of measures to promote the construction and development of renewable energy sources. The new Renewables Obligation and associated Renewables Obligation Scotland will oblige all licensed electricity suppliers in Great Britain to supply a specified and growing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources. The obligation will create a long-term market for renewables which will be worth over &#163;1 billion per year by 2010.
<P>

<a name="11019w05.html_para0">The obligation will be the main mechanism through which we meet our renewables targets, and will be underpinned by direct Government funding worth over &#163;260 million between 2001 and 2004. This will support a number of measures including my Department's &#163;55.5 million R&D programme, and an extensive capital grants programme. An announcement will be made shortly on the detailed allocation of the &#163;100 million for renewables announced by the Prime Minister in March this year.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(a)</i> Wave: it was recently announced that my Department is providing further support to bring our funding for Wavegen's latest wave energy project to almost &#163;1.67 million. This funding will assist with the further development of their new offshore wave energy concept and the construction and testing at sea of a prototype. This substantial funding confirms the Government's commitment to their new wave energy programme.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(b)</i> Solar: in February this year in the Enterprise, Skills and Innovation White Paper, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry announced a major PV demonstration programme. The Department is giving &#163;10 million to the first phase of this programme. The focus of this programme will be on social housing as well as public buildings. Meanwhile we have had two rounds of our Domestic PV Field Trial with a budget of &#163;4 million.</FONT></UL>

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(c)</i> Hydro Electric power generation has played an important part in our overall renewables policy and will continue to do so. My recent announcement that refurbished hydro between 10 and 20 MW will qualify for the obligation is expected to lead to refurbishment of 30 hydroelectric stations and to company investment of over &#163;250 million. This source of electricity will also benefit from the fact that all newly built hydroelectric stations, regardless of size, will receive support from the obligation.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>(d)</i> Offshore wind will benefit from a programme of capital grants worth at least &#163;49 million.

We have also recently consulted on the offshore consents process, and plan to bring forward a new "one-stop-shop" approach which should make it easier for project developers to get their projects up and running.</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will make a statement on the pricing structure for broadband used by BT and the cable companies.  [8103]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w05.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 British Telecom and the cable companies set broadband prices on a commercial basis. As I have already made clear, they need to be driving these prices down, and demand up, so that more consumers have the opportunity to benefit from fast, always-on, access to the internet. Equally, prices must be set at fair levels. The Director General of Telecommunications has powers under the Competition Act 1998 to act where any company has entered into an anti-competitive agreement or is abusing a dominant position. He also has powers to take action if any licensed operator is not acting in accordance with the terms of its licence.
<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w05.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Allen: </B>

<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Ministers and officials meet BT regularly to discuss BT's role in introducing broadband services across the UK. 60 per cent. of UK households are now connected to a BT ADSL enabled exchange. This represents a significant investment by BT in broadband Britain. I have recently challenged BT to do more to exploit this investment more aggressively so that the benefits of broadband are spread to as wide a market as possible.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what comparable figures for broadband connection she has collated for the United Kingdom's G9 partners.  [8102]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w05.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 As set out in 'UK Online: the broadband future', published in February 2001, international comparisons on broadband are patchy; however, in this strategy document the Office of the E-Envoy committed to undertaking a rolling programme of research.
<P>

<a name="11019w05.html_para1">In addition, the Office of Telecommunications (Oftel) published in January 2001 its report on international benchmarking of DSL and cable modem services. This compared the market for these technologies in the UK with that of France, Germany and the US. The study highlights that reliable and consistent data for all the G8 countries are difficult to obtain. However, Oftel will continue this programme of international benchmarking of broadband prices and roll-out.
<P>

<a name="11019w05.html_para2">I am aware that a forthcoming OECD study of the development of broadband access will compare, among other things, the levels of connection in OECD members, which include the G7 countries.

<a name="11019w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Availability of broadband services via cable, ADSL or wireless technology stands at around 66 per cent. of consumers and small businesses. The Government, in partnership with industry, are taking a number of measures in order to make the broadband market more extensive and competitive, building on the recent progress in advancing access across the country. However, the broadband market is at an early stage, and any forecasts are liable to be speculative.

<P>
<a name="11019w06.html_spnew0"><B> Miss Melanie Johnson: </B> 
 The Mori research showed that long-term and sustainable action to improve public perceptions is needed and messages are more likely to be understood by the public if they can see the direct impact on them. The work the Department had already commenced, based on these approaches, is therefore continuing. Introducing school children to intellectual property concepts, improving the information available to creators and users of intellectual property and campaigning to highlight the consumer as well as business detriment where counterfeiting and piracy occurs are all key areas.

<P>
<a name="11019w06.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government believe that it is important that directors are seen to be accountable to shareholders. Dialogue between directors and shareholders on remuneration issues is more likely to be effective if underpinned by a framework that ensures that shareholders can vote on directors' remuneration. Equally, it is clear that despite the actions of many well intentioned institutional investors, many quoted companies have failed to respond adequately to the best practice recommendations on accountability to shareholders and performance linkage. The Government will therefore introduce secondary legislation to require quoted companies to put forward a resolution to shareholders on the directors' remuneration report every year. This will complement the Government's earlier announcement that it will legislate to strengthen the disclosure requirements in this area, particularly with regard to the linkage between pay and performance.

 Twenty national health service trusts in England have been fitting digital hearing aids for NHS patients since October 2000, as part of the Department's "modernising NHS hearing aid services" project. The project also includes increased investment in information technology, equipment and modernised patient processes. The Institute of Hearing Research is evaluating the project and its findings will help determine how changes in hearing aid services might be extended to all NHS audiology departments.

<a name="11019w06.html_para0">In the meantime all NHS trusts with the staff, training, equipment and experience necessary to fit digital hearing aids, are able to apply for access to the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency (PASA) contract for digital hearing aids.

 Patrick Carter's review of the Picketts Lock project commissioned by Sport England looked at a number of alternative venues for staging the world athletics championships in 2005, including Crystal Palace.

 Patrick Carter's review of the Picketts Lock project commissioned by Sport England looked at a number of alternative venues for staging the world athletics championships in 2005. Following receipt of Patrick Carter's report, DCMS and Sport England officials initiated discussions with representatives of Manchester city council and Sheffield city council. The other alternative venues considered by Patrick Carter either offered no certainty of being delivered on time or no significantly lesser risk or cost than Picketts Lock.
<P>

<a name="11019w06.html_para6">The Government are grateful to Manchester and Sheffield city councils for their assistance in this process. It was clear that both cities would be suitable for staging the championships. However the costs of delaying the reconfiguration of the City of Manchester Stadium into football mode and the costs of compensation to Manchester city council and Manchester City football club would have exceeded the costs of improving the existing Don Valley Stadium in Sheffield.

<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w07.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The size of Taliban and the Northern Alliance controlled areas has fluctuated in the last four years, making direct comparisons from year to year difficult. United Nations International Drug Control Programme (UNDCP) surveys indicate that Taliban controlled areas of Afghanistan produced 2,592 tonnes of opium in 1998, 4,510 tonnes in 1993, 3,139 tonnes in 2000 and 21 tonnes in 2001. Northern Alliance controlled areas produced 108 tonnes of opium in 1998, 140 tonnes in 1999, 131 tonnes in 2000 and 164 tonnes in 2001. Some of this was exported as opium, some as processed morphine and heroin. The proportion exported as heroin appears to have risen over the last four years but the data available, based largely on seizures in Afghanistan's immediate neighbouring countries, is insufficient to provide a detailed breakdown.
<P>

<a name="11019w07.html_para7">An international inspection in April/May confirmed that opium poppy cultivation was effectively eliminated in Taliban controlled areas. Nevertheless, drug trafficking from those areas continued at a high level from stockpiles: the product of surplus product in previous years.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what his policy is towards the recognition of <i>(a)</i> de jure and <i>(b)</i> de facto regimes; and to what extent that policy has changed since May 1997.  [8514]<P>

<a name="11019w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Since 1980, it has been HMG's policy to recognise states, not governments. As set out in Lord Carrington's statement of 23 May 1980 where a new regime comes to power, whether it qualifies to be treated as a government will be left to be inferred from the nature of the dealings, if any, which we may have with it and, in particular, on whether we are dealing with it on a normal government-to-government basis.

 Housing Benefit is available to help people on low incomes meet the reasonable cost of their accommodation. It was never intended to help with service charges in respect of personal care. However, at present people who are liable to pay service charges for accommodation-related support may claim help through housing benefit. From April 2003, help with these charges will be funded through the "supporting people" programme.

 Local education authorities themselves are best placed to assess the future demand for teachers in their areas. Like other authorities, Gloucestershire will continue to benefit from the measures to promote teacher recruitment and retention that the Government have put in place. Between January 1997 and January 2001, the number of full-time equivalent regular teachers working in maintained schools in Gloucestershire rose by 270, from 4,410 to 4,680. During the same period, the number of full-time teacher vacancies in the county remained unchanged at 14.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what plans she has to simplify the procedure for schools to apply for Standards Fund money; and if she will make a statement.  [9011]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w10.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Standards Fund grant is allocated and paid to local education authorities who must devolve around 75 per cent. of the grant to their schools to spend according to their own needs and priorities. It is for authorities and schools to agree the particular arrangements for allocating the grant to schools. Almost all Standards Fund grants are allocated to LEAs on a 



<P>
<P><I>19 Oct 2001 : Column: 1393W</I><P>
formula basis and the Government expect LEAs to devolve grants to schools by a fair formula, in which case schools should not have to apply for grant.
<P>

<a name="11019w10.html_para0">We have already simplified the operation of the Standards Fund for 2001&#150;02. Schools have more freedom to determine spending priorities&#151;they will be free to move money between most of their allocations. Schools have a full 17 months from 1 April 2001 to 31 August 2002 to spend their allocation. This will mean an end to the rush to spend grant by the end of the financial year. Separate auditing of the Standards Fund is no longer required. The Standards Fund will be audited as part of the overall arrangements for local education authority and school expenditure, reducing the need for detailed separate accounting records for each Standards Fund grant.

 As at the end of July 2001 the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) was supporting 27,740 <sup>1</sup>  asylum seekers in its accommodation outside of the London and south central regions and 1,070 <sup>1</sup>  in its accommodation in the London and South Central regions. It is the policy of NASS to offer accommodation in London only when there are exceptional reasons, such as medical reasons, to do so. NASS disperses asylum seekers to locations in the United Kingdom on a "no-choice" basis to relieve the burden on London and the south east; Brighton and Hove, Hastings and St. Leonards, Portsmouth and Southampton are the only four cluster areas used within the south central and east region.

There is no available figure for the number of disbenefited cases offered accommodation in the London and south central regions specifically because their children had been educated in the same school for 12 months or more. Also, some of those disbenefited cases who were being supported in NASS accommodation outside the London and south central regions may have already been there when they became disbenefited rather than having been dispersed subsequently.

 Section 24 of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 prevents the disclosure by Home Office Ministers and officials of information about the use of animals in scientific procedures that has been provided in confidence.

 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> The police have powers under the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994 to direct travellers or other trespassers to leave land when the appropriate statutory requirements are met. These are discretionary powers and it is the operational responsibility of the chief officer of the force concerned to decide when and how to enforce these powers. The effectiveness of this legislation is kept under regular review.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what policy guidance he has issued on the use of speed cameras to reduce speed on roads that do not present a specific problem nor have a record of traffic accidents;  [8212]
<P>
<UL>(2) what advice his Department has given to police authorities regarding the use of mobile speed cameras to reduce traffic speed with particular reference to their location.  [8214]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="11019w11.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Denham </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 October 2001]:</i> The guidance on the use of speed cameras, set out in Home Office Circular 38/1992, is that they should be located where there is a known history of accidents and where excessive speed is a major contributory factor. The primary objective is to reduce accidents and increase road safety.
<P>

<a name="11019w11.html_para15">Following the announcement in August of the national roll-out of the netting-off scheme for speed camera funding, the Government are working with the police and local authorities to strengthen this guidance. Under the netting-off scheme cameras may be placed only where there is a history of speed-related injuries or at accident

hotspots. Their use must be monitored to ensure that they help to reduce accidents. Those that do not will have to be moved to a more appropriate location or removed altogether.
<P>

<a name="11019w11.html_para16">Our aim in strengthening the guidance is to ensure that, as far as possible, one set of rules applies to all speed cameras, whether or not part of the netting-off scheme and this includes mobile speed cameras. Mobile cameras are not covered by the existing guidance, but we want to ensure that, in future, the use of these cameras is guided by similar principles to those that apply to fixed cameras to reduce accidents. Fixed site cameras will have to be highly visible, and so will officers using mobile cameras. All areas where cameras, whether fixed or mobile are in use will have to be clearly signed, and the deployment of cameras will have to be well publicised locally.

<a name="11019w12.html_para2">The Census Act 1921 was amended to include a question on religious identity in this year's census.
