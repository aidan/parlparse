<a name="20418w02.html_para0">Sexual and reproductive health care in developing countries continues to be a key priority for my Department. Achieving universal access to reproductive health for all by 2015 underpins our approach. Good reproductive health is of course also vital to achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) related to lowering maternal mortality and combating HIV/AIDS. We are working in partnership with national Governments and key organisations to strengthen the capacity of health systems to deliver good reproductive health care and services.

 The Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB and Malaria will consider applications against the principles, scope and purpose laid out in its framework documents, which can be found at www.globalfundatm.org.
<P>

<a name="20418w02.html_para2">The UK believes the fund should support applications for funding for reproductive health services only where these are clearly focused on preventing or treating one or more of the three diseases. It will be important for the fund to focus on supporting interventions where global financing will be most effective and where it can add most value to existing national and international efforts. Other channels of support will be more appropriate for wider efforts against the three diseases and for support to reproductive health services more broadly.

 Ensuring the accessibility of affordable condoms is a key priority for my Department. The UK is one of the leading bilateral providers of condoms and other forms of contraceptives in developing countries. We are also supporting a number of condom social marketing programmes which aim to make condoms accessible and affordable to the poorest. It is important that efforts meet the current and increasing need for condoms and to promote demand for condom use.

 While voluntary returns to Afghanistan from Pakistan and Iran continue to gather momentum, some Afghans continue to leave their country. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that approximately 40,000 Afghans are gathered in the Killi Faizo transit camp at the Chaman border crossing between Balochistan Province in Pakistan and Kandahar Province in Southern Afghanistan. Many of the group have been in the area since late February 2002. The majority of Afghans at Chaman are fleeing the effects of drought, while others are ethnic Pushtuns claiming to have been targeted by bandits or other armed groups in the north of Afghanistan, where they are a minority group. UNHCR are in discussions with the Pakistani authorities to urge them to allow those seeking refuge and assistance to be registered and transferred to existing refugee camps in Pakistan. At the same time, UNHCR and its partners are working to improve conditions&#151;including water and sanitation and health facilities&#151;in the waiting area; and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) are carrying out distribution of emergency food supplies.

 Between 1999 and 2000, individual programmes under the Technical Co-operation Training (TCT) Programme in India were evaluated following DFID's normal project review procedures, including assessments of the overall performance of each programme.

 The Public Administration Institutional Development project began in February 2000. Activities were put on hold in December 2000 following the outbreak of the intifada. An inception phase had been successfully completed. The environment since has not been conducive to progressing towards the project's objectives. We will explore ways to recommence activities once the circumstances permit.

 An independent project review of DFID's support to the Centenary Rural Development Bank was undertaken in August 2001. It reported that the bank had achieved all the goals set out in the project in terms of business growth (loans outstanding; value of deposits; reduced arrears). Outreach to rural areas had also increased through additional branches, and a positive relationship established between growth of the private sector through prudent lending and a reduction in poverty.

 The community forestry development project phase two (CFDP II) has been monitored regularly by DFID and the Government of Cameroon against its objective of supporting community based forest resource planning and management. Studies have shown that community forestry provides significantly higher benefits to local communities than existing systems.
<P>

<a name="20418w03.html_para4">Recent reviews have concluded that the project has been instrumental in helping establish the legal basis for communities to manage their forests, and in making the community forestry process more accessible. The project has also provided training for the Ministry of Environment and Forest and helped integrate community forestry training into the curriculum at the university of Dschang.
<P>

<a name="20418w03.html_para5">Part of the project completion work, to be undertaken prior to the end of the project (December 2002), will be to conduct a formal cost-benefit analysis of project inputs.

Implementation of the physical works of the project has only recently commenced and was delayed while a new Roads Prioritisation method for Ghana's feeder roads was developed. This method involves full community participation and takes into account both social and economic factors leading to a cost-benefit analysis of the roads being considered for construction and repair under this project.

 There are three components of our support for the Government of Bangladesh's health sector reforms. They are subject to on-going monitoring by our Bangladesh office and have in addition had two independent external reviews, one in May 2000 and one in May 2001. The costs of the inputs are highly competitive and the standard of work is consistently high. DFID is thus satisfied that they are achieving good value for money and have produced demonstrable results, despite the high-risk nature of this kind of work.

 This project is intended to re-orientate agricultural extension services to better meet the expressed needs of farmers. It started in July 1999. In addition to regular monitoring by DFID, biannual Joint Supervision Missions with the World bank and the Government of Bangladesh have taken place throughout the project. The most recent review was undertaken in November 2001.
<P>

<a name="20418w03.html_para6">The main findings of the November 2001 review noted that substantial progress had been made and institutional strengthening activities have improved management structures and procedures.

<P>

<a name="20418w03.html_para7">In addition to close monitoring by the DFID office in Bangladesh, it is subject to annual review, the last of which was carried out in January 2002.

 This project is jointly funded with the World bank with the objective of supporting sustainable and equitable growth in the benefits generated from increased fish and shrimp production. It started in September 1999. In addition to monitoring by DFID, biannual joint review missions have taken place with the World bank and the Government of Bangladesh. The most recent review was undertaken in November 2001. This review noted that there have been significant achievements in project implementation, with 93 per cent. of a target of villages and beneficiaries having so far been reached.
<P>

<a name="20418w03.html_para9">The report concluded that the project would largely achieve its overall objectives but continues to face significant challenges. It is too early to revisit the issue of cost-effectiveness but this will be addressed in a major review to be undertaken in May 2003.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w04.html_spnew0"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 DFID staff are not encouraged to work long hours and every effort is made to avoid overtime working and to help staff balance work and private life. No member of staff has been asked to opt out of the limits prescribed by the working time regulations.
<P>

<a name="20418w04.html_para0">Where overtime working is unavoidable, staff generally have the choice of overtime payments or time off in lieu. Overtime payments vary according to when overtime is worked and the grade of the staff concerned&#151;payments are normally at plain time, time and a half or double time, depending on the circumstances and whether staff wish to take time off in lieu. The rules are complex and we are currently in the process of simplifying them. Two groups of staff are presently not entitled to overtime payments&#151;senior civil servants and staff in Band A1 (equivalent to Senior Principal). We propose to review overtime entitlements for Band A staff by March 2003.

 Much progress has been made since the elections to a Kosovo Assembly took place on 17 November 2001. On 4 March 2002, Kosovo's first freely-elected and multi-ethnic provisional self- government was formed and Dr. Irahim Rugova was elected President of Kosovo. The majority of governmental functions are being transferred from the UN Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) to the government, with the exception of powers reserved under the terms of the 2001 Constitutional Framework, such as external affairs, security and law and order. These will remain in the hands of the UN Secretary-General's Special Representative. Most of the Ministers are now in place, and are establishing their departments and defining their priorities.

Following the report of this review, the Government received advice from counsel on 9 June 1997 on the question of whether, in the context of the action to determine if the case should be heard in New York, it would be beneficial to relax the embargo against Arthur Andersen for Government contracts. The embargo was relaxed on 24 June 1997, and was fully lifted when the final settlement was agreed on 12 November 1997.

<P>
<P>

 It is an offence under the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 to interfere with a badger sett without an appropriate licence. The maximum penalty for such an offence under the 1992 Act is a fine of &#163;5,000 or six months' imprisonment, or both.
<P>

<a name="20418w06.html_para4">The protection provided under the 1992 Act, which is unique for an unendangered animals, reflects the concern which is felt by the Government about the gratuitous acts of cruelty to which badgers have been subjected to all too often in the past.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w06.html_spnew11"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 We received a number of comments which suggested that Lincolnshire was slow or reluctant to reopen footpaths despite the fact that there were no cases of foot and mouth disease (FMD) in the county. The amount of correspondence was low with four letters from members of the public in favour of reopening footpaths and one against. There was one letter from an hon. Member early in the outbreak, urging strict enforcement of access prohibitions. Lincolnshire county council wrote last July objecting to my decision to revoke remaining blanket rights-of-way closures. That decision was taken in the light of the veterinary risk assessment which showed that the risk of walkers spreading FMD was extremely small and the fact that a small number of local authorities were being over cautious without good reason. The FMD outbreak demonstrated the importance of rights of way to tourism in rural areas in England, and most local authorities were keen to reopen them as soon as it was safe to do so.

 A licensing scheme for llama trekking was introduced on 28 March 2002 which allows treks to take place, while minimising the risk of disease spread. Controls are needed over this activity, as llamas are susceptible to foot and mouth disease and could become infected or could infect other susceptible livestock by crossing grazing land.

 All livestock farmers will have suffered some degree of financial loss as a result of the restrictions imposed on the movement of livestock and other foot and mouth disease related controls. It has been the policy of successive Governments only to pay compensation for the market value of livestock which is compulsorily slaughtered to control the spread of disease. However over the course of the last year the Government made available some &#163;155 million of agrimonetary aid and more than &#163;210 million in payments under the Livestock Welfare (Disposal) Scheme and light lambs schemes.

 On 9 August 2001 my right hon. Friend the Prime Minister announced two independent inquiries into the foot and mouth disease outbreak of 2001, namely the Lessons Learned Inquiry and the Royal Society Study.

[48557]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w07.html_spnew9"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> The total UK claim for reimbursement of the costs incurred in the foot and mouth outbreak is &#163;998 million. The claim includes compensation payments to farmers for animals slaughtered, and destruction of contaminated feeding stuffs of &#163;735 million. The other element of the claim is for cleansing and disinfecting of the farms and transport and haulage and disposal of livestock of &#163;263 million.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w07.html_spnew10"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> The Animal Health Act 1981 stipulates that for the purposes of compensation, the value of an animal shall be its value immediately before it became affected with foot and mouth disease or, if not so affected, its value immediately before it was slaughtered. Animals are valued by professional valuers. From 22 March to 30 July

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Meacher: </B> 
 Provisional figures from the Department's latest Municipal Waste Management Survey show that the proportion of municipal waste recycled or composted has continued to increase, from 7 per cent. in 1996&#150;97 to 12 per cent. in 2000&#150;01. Local authorities are required to further improve their recycling rates in order to achieve the statutory targets the Government have set for them, to double their recycling rates within three years and treble them in five. The recently announced &#163;140 million fund for waste minimisation and recycling will help them to do this.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment she has made of how many forms her Department required on average a farmer in England to fill out in 2001; and what efforts are being made to reduce this.  [46540]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 It is not possible to make such an assessment. The number of forms completed by farmers depends on the nature and size of individual enterprises. As far as statistical forms are concerned, in 2001 more than half of the main holdings in England received no forms and the average number of forms issued to the other 68,638 holdings was 1.39. Only 319 holdings received more than four forms during the year and of the 95,125 survey forms issued more than one third were in respect of voluntary surveys. Many of the forms the Department issues to farmers relate to particular schemes such as CAP subsidy and rural development schemes. The number will vary widely depending on which schemes they participate in.
<P>

<a name="20418w08.html_para0">The Department is committed to reducing paperwork. Electronic forms for IACS applications have already been introduced.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> Strategies for handling outbreaks of serious animal diseases vary in detail according to the characteristics of each disease, notably the means of spread and the species affected. Policies for dealing with the main diseases are set out in EU and UK legislation. Many elements of animal disease control contingency planning are common for a range of diseases. These include surveillance, reporting and investigation procedures; import controls; tracing and diagnosis; eradication options such as slaughter and vaccination; valuation and compensation procedures; controls over animal movements; and the principles of biosecurity, including cleansing and disinfection of premises and vehicles.

 The UK has shown leadership under the G8 Action Programme on Forests in promoting bilateral arrangements with timber producing countries whereby countries work together to tackle illegal logging and associated trade.

<P>
<a name="20418w08.html_spnew10"><B> Margaret Beckett </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> International trade in some woods is controlled under the terms of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES). Those species of wood listed in Appendix I & II of CITES, require import permits from the UK before they can be imported. These are issued only where the UK Management Authority (DEFRA) is satisfied that the wood has been legally obtained in the country of origin and has the necessary permit for export from that country. Species listed in Appendix III of CITES do not require import permits. For these species a self-completed import notification form must be presented to HM Customs prior to the arrival of the specimens, together with the relevant export permit(s) or certificate(s) of origin issued by the Management Authority in the exporting country. It is for the Management Authority in the country of origin to decide whether the import has been legally logged. On the basis of these procedures the Department has not initiated any seizures of wood in the past three years.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> Atmospheric deposition of nitrogen, from the air pollutants nitrogen oxides (mainly from vehicle exhausts and industry) and ammonia (mainly from livestock manure), is measured across the UK by the National Acid Deposition Network.
<P>

<a name="20418w09.html_para2">Most of the nitrogen deposited in arable areas is taken up by crops during the growing season, but in late autumn and winter, a proportion is vulnerable to leaching. Studies at the Institute of Arable Crops Research have shown that atmospheric deposition usually contributes around 20 to 30 per cent. of the nitrate leached from arable land.
<P>

<a name="20418w09.html_para3">Atmospheric deposition is a major cause for concern in upland semi-natural habitats which are naturally adapted to receiving low supplies of nutrient nitrogen. Atmospheric deposition is largest in the uplands, where rainfall is highest. Excessive deposition can lead to adverse changes in plant diversity and, in some cases, to nitrate leaching.
<P>

<a name="20418w09.html_para4">Under the UNECE Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone, and the European National Emissions Ceilings Directive, the UK is committed to further significant reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions, and to curbing ammonia emissions, from 2010.

 The main impact of industrial action has been on the Arable Area Payments Scheme where a little over 50 per cent. of payments were made in the first 2 or 3 weeks of the payment window as compared to the normal 60&#150;70 per cent. within that time.

 The dredger Sand Kite collided with one of the piers of the Thames Barrier and deposited a quantity of gravel on one of the operating gates. I understand that the remedial works costs to date have been reimbursed to the Environment Agency from the vessel's insurers and have not therefore resulted in any public cost. I further understand that there is some additional remedial painting and removal of gravel from inside the gate recess, to be carried out this summer, that may not be covered by the insurers and may result in a public cost of some &#163;100,000. This is expected be met from Environment Agency's operational budget with a contribution from the Port of London Authority.

<a name="20418w11.html_para5">Addressing the current aircrew shortfalls is a key priority and a number of actions have been taken to reduce the impact of these shortfalls. These include increasing the number of fast jet pilots entering into productive service, returning some middle ranking officers to flying duties and recruiting trained pilots released by the Royal New Zealand Air Force. To improve retention two new financial retention incentives were introduced on 1 April 2002, each linked to a commitment to five years further service.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence how many civilians are employed in connection with MoD PFI programmes.  [50789]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w12.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 There is a small central team with 15 civilian personnel that is responsible for developing policy and best practice for the Ministry of Defence's Private Finance Initiative (PFI) programme and other types of Public Private Partnership. The central team is supported by smaller teams within the Defence Procurement Agency, Defence Logistics Organisation and other management areas, which are responsible for managing the programmes within their own areas.
<P>

<a name="20418w12.html_para0">The management and delivery of the PFI programme also involves managers, both military and civilian, at all levels as members of project boards, scrutiny and approving authorities, commercial advisers and customer representatives. MOD legal and finance staffs are also involved, although they usually do not work on PFI programmes full-time.
<P>

<a name="20418w12.html_para1">PFI projects are run by dedicated integrated project teams, the size of which varies with the size of the project and the stage it has reached in the procurement cycle. The teams can include civilian and military personnel, as well as industry representatives. External consultants may be engaged by project teams. A small number also sit on project boards.
<P>

<a name="20418w12.html_para2">Once contracts have been signed, they are monitored and are managed by MOD personnel, both civilian and military depending on the services concerned.

 In December 2002, on current plans, of the Fleet's 32 Frigates and Destroyers, 26 will be operational or engaged in preparing for service, conducting trials or training. The remaining six will be either undergoing docking periods or refit or held at a low level of readiness.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The earlier than previously planned withdrawal of HMS Fearless will accrue savings of at least &#163;2 million. This will be achieved by cancelling a previously programmed assisted maintenance period and through the reduction in operating costs. Moreover, HMS Fearless is nearly 37 years old and is in poor material condition. The unique nature of much of her machinery such as boilers and steam plant make repairs and maintenance difficult and it is highly probable that further unprogrammed and potentially costly work would have been required to maintain her at the previously assumed readiness state.

 The main elements of HMS Illustrious's refit concern maintenance, repair and improvements to ships systems and equipment to overcome obsolescence, meet safety and environmental legislation and enhance capability in command, control and communications systems and in aviation facilities.
<P>

<a name="20418w12.html_para4">I refer the hon.

 The refit of HMS Illustrious is estimated to cost approximately &#163;110 million excluding costs attributable to Ministry supplied material and naval manpower.

of readiness. On commencement of her refit the crew numbers reduce to nine officers and 36 ratings. Personnel will then be employed as required in support of the refit. They will be subject to normal drafting and appointing notice, but as a reduced manned ship will, as far as possible, be protected from short notice movement of personnel. HMS Illustrious will then gradually build up to achieve full manpower by October 2004.

<P>
<a name="20418w12.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has a stockpile of munitions held against the risk of short notice conflicts. The method of calculating the size and composition of this stockpile has undergone significant development in the last three years, and it now reflects more accurately the likely nature of the conflicts that the UK armed forces could become involved in.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w12.html_spnew9"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Ministry of Defence has always considered security of supply and value for the taxpayer's money to be key criteria in the procurement of safe and reliable munitions for the armed forces. The issue of security of supply was examined in detail by the House of Commons Defence Select Committee in 1999 and the committee recognised that in balancing security of supply against cost, it is likely that there are very few capabilities that must, on strategic grounds, be retained in the UK.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w12.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence under what circumstances it is the Government's policy to subsidise ammunition manufacturers in the UK to ensure its supply.  [50935]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w12.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The framework partnering agreement between Royal Ordnance Defence and the Ministry of Defence provides the company with contracted ammunition requirements for a rolling three-year period, firm requirements for a further two years, and a best forecast up to the 10-year point. The agreement is not a subsidy; it is intended to provide a vital link to industry to help ensure the supply of safe and reliable munitions for our armed forces.
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w12.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Gray: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what contractual guarantees exist to safeguard the supply of ammunition by overseas manufacturers in <i>(a)</i> peace and <i>(b)</i> war.  [50933]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w12.html_spnew11"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 During the past year the Ministry of Defence has only obtained around 8 per cent. (by value) of its ammunition from overseas manufacturers. Supply and re-supply arrangements are taken into account when letting contracts. There is no difference in contractual arrangements for re-supply in peace or war. The supply of military stores and components for the UK armed forces from overseas is not a new venture, as our many collaborative projects demonstrate. Such contracts can meet both our requirements and demonstrate added value for money.

<a name="20418w15.html_para0">A comprehensive review of the blue badge scheme is currently being undertaken by my Department, which will look at the administration of the scheme and will also consider the case for temporary badges. Consultation on a discussion paper, which was issued to the main stakeholders, including disability organisations and local authorities, ended recently.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w15.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 In our assessment, in areas where the housing market is functioning well, vacant dwellings may lead to increased pressure on the housing stock and for development on greenfield land. They may also blight neighbouring properties. In areas of low housing demand, where the proportion of vacant dwellings may be more highly concentrated, they can escalate the decline of an area, act as a magnet for crime, vandalism, arson and antisocial behaviour and create negative equity problems for those living in adjacent dwellings.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w16.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Demolition of buildings is already part of the planning process. Generally speaking, the demolition of non-residential buildings does not constitute "development" (as defined in section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990), and consequently no planning permission is required. However, the demolition of a residential building does constitute development for which a permitted development right has been granted by Part 31 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995. This means that, instead of having to submit an application for planning permission for the demolition of a residential building, a developer has to apply to the local planning authority for a determination as to whether prior approval is required for the proposed method of demolition and any proposed restoration of the site. Planning authorities also have powers&#151;subject to approval by the Secretary of State&#151;to require planning applications for demolition of residential property, where amenity would be seriously threatened.
<P>

<a name="20418w16.html_para0">In addition, listed building consent is required for the demolition of any listed building, and conservation area consent is required for the demolition of an unlisted building in a conservation area.
<P>

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w16.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Keeble: </B> 
 Putting up a building usually amounts to "development", for which planning permission is required. However, Parliament has granted a general planning permission or "permitted development right" to carry out certain types of minor development without the need to submit an application. This removes a large burden of unnecessary planning work from local authorities.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what assessments he has made of the environmental effects of electricity generation for rail use; and what comparisons he has made with the use of diesel locomotives.  [49706]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w18.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The SRA commissioned work on the railway's environmental impact during 2001. The results are sensitive to factors such as the mix of sources of electricity generation, the type of diesel traction, and operational factors such as speed or loading. Given the current mix of fossil fuel, nuclear and other generative sources, carbon dioxide emissions per passenger km attributed to electric long haul express trains are about half those of some comparable diesel trains currently in operation. It is likely that the on-going introduction of more modern diesel trains will reduce carbon dioxide emissions.




<P>
<P><I>18 Apr 2002 : Column 1100W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="20418w18.html_para0">With the exception of sulphur oxides, most of rail's emissions of particulates, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and volatile organic compounds are from diesel trains. Again, the on-going introduction of more modern diesel locomotives offers benefits&#151;for example, reducing the level of emissions per tonne-km of these pollutants.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what the estimated environmental benefit is of increasing the number passenger kilometres of rail use by <i>(a)</i> 10 per cent., <i>(b)</i> 20 per cent., <i>(c)</i> 30 per cent., <i>(d)</i> 40 per cent., <i>(e)</i> 50 per cent. and <i>(f)</i> 60 per cent. by 2010&#150;11.  [49703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w18.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Byers: </B> 
 The environmental effect will vary depending on how the increase in rail passenger kilometres is achieved. An increase in rail use will, in general, cause an increase in emissions from the rail sector. However, to the extent that this is achieved through modal shift from more environmentally damaging modes, and accompanied by greater use of more fuel efficient rolling stock, there will be offsetting benefits.

 Nearly &#163;7 billion of private sector investment has already been committed for the 10-Year plan period covering renewals and enhancement investment, rolling-stock investment and the CTRL. Over &#163;1 billion has come since the turn of the year alone, through the GNER extension, Chiltern refranchise and South Central rolling stock order. Private sector investment will continue to be levered in through the franchising process, special purpose vehicles and specific funding schemes such as the Rail Passenger Partnership fund.

 <i>[holding answer 10 April 2002]:</i> My right hon.

In normal circumstances, the letter recognises the annual payments that will be made by London Underground to the infrastructure companies for the successful delivery of the required services, However, it also recognises that, in the unlikely event of an infrastructure company persistently and materially defaulting on its obligations in a way which leads to a termination of the PPP, then any funds put up by shareholders in the infrastructure company would be wholly at risk. In addition, an 'underpinned amount' would become payable to the lenders to the infrastructure

<P>

<a name="20418w20.html_para0">The contingent liability will be to repay some or all of the debt that has already been invested in the improvement of the Tube.

 The environmental effect will vary depending on how the increase in the volume of rail freight traffic is achieved. An increase in rail freight will, in general, cause an increase in emissions from the rail sector. However, to the extent that this is achieved through modal shift there will be some offsetting benefits, reducing the impact of transport on the environment.

This figure includes people who have been on the new deal for young people and new deal 25 plus and cannot be broken down. People recruited by the Department under the new deal 50 plus cannot be identified separately from new deal 25 plus recruits.New deal recruits take up existing vacancies so extra costs are limited to the subsidy, where appropriate, and any additional training and development which may be needed. The cost of the latter cannot be readily identified. The subsidy cost is approximately &#163;1.3 million.

low back pain among those of working age and <i>(b)</i> its implications for loss of working time and costs to the benefit system.  [48823]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Nicholas Brown </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2002]:</i> The Department has played an important role in raising awareness of back pain disability as an issue; in promoting best clinical practice to health professionals; in supporting the development of guidelines for managers and employees; and in devising more objective and rigorous assessment methods.
<P>

<a name="20418w23.html_para0">A Chief Medical Adviser bulletin has recently been issued to all General Practitioners which specifically mentions the management of low back pain and the need for doctors to follow the Royal College of General Practitioners management guidelines when treating this condition. The Department continues to work very closely with external experts in the field of back pain in developing policies, guidance and procedures.
<P>

<a name="20418w23.html_para1">An innovative approach to work preparation&#151;the "From Back Pain to Work" project&#151;has recently been piloted in at the main hospitals in Salford and Bristol. This involved Jobcentre staff working in partnership with medical practitioners to reintegrate people with back pain into employment. The project used a programme of psychological, physical and occupational elements to help people back into work.
<P>

<a name="20418w23.html_para2">Results from the initial trials have been encouraging and there are now plans for further expansion and evaluation of the pilots in additional locations starting in late summer 2002.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Pension credit figures have been calculated using the Policy Simulation Model for Income Related Benefit. This models the benefits system and is based on data from the Family Resources Survey (FRS) for 1999&#150;2000. The model has been uprated to model benefits in 2003&#150;04.<P>

2. The figures are based on entitlement to pension credit.<P>

3. The figures do not include pensioners in residential care or nursing homes (RCNH). This is because the FRS does not contain information on RCNH cases. It is estimated that 200,000 pensioners in RCNH will be eligible for pension credit, and the majority of these will be in single pensioner benefit units. Therefore the total case load estimated to be entitled to pension credit in 2003&#150;04 is around 4.1 million households. <P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how the take-up of means-tested benefits has changed <i>(a)</i> since 1997, <i>(b)</i> since 1998, <i>(c)</i> since 1999 and <i>(d)</i> since 2000.  [44245]<P>

 Estimates of take-up of income- related benefits for the financial years 1999&#150;2000 and 1998&#150;99 were published in "Income Related Benefits&#151;Estimates of Take-Up 1999&#150;2000". Estimates for 1997&#150;98 were published in "Income Related Benefits&#151;Estimates of Take-Up 1998&#150;99". Copies of both publications are available in the Library.
<P>

<a name="20418w24.html_para1">Estimates are presented as percentage ranges within which departmental statisticians judge the level of true take-up to lie. The ranges for different years overlap; as a result it is not possible to make firm statements about changes in take-up rates between 1997&#150;98 and 1999&#150;2000.

To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions what policy changes have been made to the conduct of appeal tribunal hearings in the UK as a result of the Tribunal of Commissioners decision in CSDLA/1019/99.  [49010]<P>

 The jurisdiction of appeal tribunals administered by the Appeals Service extends to Great Britain. Northern Ireland has a separate appeal tribunal jurisdiction. This decision is currently the subject of an appeal to the Court of Session. There have been no policy changes in the conduct of tribunal hearings.

<a name="20418w24.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 The Government believe that women and men should hold an equal proportion of all public appointments. Public Bodies 2001, published on 14 February, shows that at 31 March 2001, women held 34 per cent. of all appointments to the boards of non-departmental public bodies, nationalised industries, public corporations and health bodies.
<P>

<a name="20418w24.html_para2">The document "Public Bodies: Opening Up Appointments" which was also published on 14 February sets out the targets that individual Government Departments are working towards for increasing the proportion of appointments held by women and the action plans to achieve these targets.
<P>

<a name="20418w24.html_para3">We want to encourage more women to apply for national public appointments. That is why my hon. Friend, Minister for Women in the Cabinet Office, is currently hosting a series of regional seminars to give information and offer practical support.
<P>

<a name="20418w24.html_para4">The seminars aim to inspire women through real- life case studies, provide information about what appointments are available and practical advice on how to go about getting a public appointment. The seminars hosted so far have been very successful, and the programme is being extended. Research will also be conducted into the usefulness of the seminars.
<P>

<a name="20418w24.html_para5">The Women's National Commission is offering women who attend the seminars the chance to join an e-network. This will offer notifications of specific opportunities, occasional workshops and mentors.

<a name="20418w24.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 While we welcome business involvement in schools, decisions on the use of commercial materials in this sector are for the schools themselves to make. My Department issued guidelines entitled "Best Practice Principles: Commercial Activities in Schools" last year, to help schools make informed and sensible decisions about this. The guidelines make clear that schools should satisfy themselves that the educational benefits of the commercial activity outweigh the potential disbenefits; that it is free of incentives to children to engage in unhealthy, unsafe or unlawful activities; that explicit sales messages should be avoided wherever possible; and that the level of any branding should be appropriate to the activity.

<a name="20418w25.html_para1">In addition, 91,000 pupils are in maintained special schools, 87,400 of whom have statements. Information by specific category of SEN is not currently collected but we have conducted a pilot exercise to explore the feasibility of further categorisation without overburdening schools and expect to phase in new arrangements by 2004.
<P>

<a name="20418w25.html_para2">When dealing with dyslexia and other SEN, schools and local education authorities in England are expected to follow the SEN Code of Practice, published last November.

<P>
<UL>(2) what action her Department is taking to increase the number of specialist units able to support children with autistic spectrum disorder learning; and if she will make a statement.  [48884]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Timms: </B> 
 Children with autistic spectrum disorder are benefiting from the improvements we are making to special educational needs (SEN) provision along with all other children with SEN. We have, for example, increased the supported expenditure available for SEN five-fold from &#163;17 million in 1997&#150;98 to &#163;91 million in 2002&#150;03. Funds can be used for a range of activities including the training for staff in SEN and improvements in speech and language therapy. We have introduced a revised SEN Code of Practice, effective from 1 January this year, which strengthens the guidance to schools, local education authorities and others and encourages earlier identification of needs and more effective intervention.
<P>

<a name="20418w26.html_para0">We have also supported a nationwide network of SEN Regional Partnerships to promote a multi-agency approach to aspects of SEN provision. The West Midlands SEN Regional Partnership has concentrated on provision for children with autistic spectrum disorder and produced recommendations. The work of the West Midlands Partnership will be reflected in guidance which the Department's Autism Working Group will be producing in the coming months. This will raise awareness of autistic spectrum disorders and help schools and local education authorities, in particular, to audit their provision.
<P>

<a name="20418w26.html_para1">The Autism Working Group's guidance will point to the benefits of children with the disorder being taught by those with an understanding of the condition in all settings. Decisions on opening specialist units for children with autistic spectrum disorders are taken at local, rather than national, level. The Department welcomes the opening of good quality, specialist provision in the maintained, non-maintained and independent sectors. The All Party Parliamentary Group on Autism's report "The Rising Challenge: A survey of Local Education Authorities on Educational Provision for pupils with Autistic Spectrum Disorders" (December 2001) noted that several authorities commented that they had set up autism specific units attached to moderate learning difficulty schools.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what commitments the Government have made under the World Trade Organisation's general agreement on trade in services regarding the liberalisation of public services.  [50810]<P>

<P>
<a name="20418w28.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Public services&#151;ie services supplied in the exercise of governmental authority&#151;are in principle excluded from the scope of the GATS. The Government have therefore made no commitments under the GATS under which public services would be liberalised, and has said previously that it will make no commitments in the current World Trade Organisation negotiations that could call into question the supply of public services through for example the NHS or state educations system.
<P>

<a name="20418w28.html_para3">For the sake of clarity, the United Kingdom already allows the establishment of private educational establishments, hospital services and convalescent, rest and old people's homes, for example, and made commitments during the Uruguay Round confirming this market access.

<P>
<a name="20418w29.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Department has not itself established any external organisations as part of the Government's climate change programme. However, it has worked with the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which leads on climate change policy on several initiatives. The Department has helped with the establishment of the Carbon Trust whose remit is to help the UK move towards a low carbon economy, by encouraging the development and uptake of low carbon technologies and administering energy support and advice for business. The Carbon Trust is funded from receipts from the climate change levy and also receives support from DEFRA, the Scottish Executive, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland Executive.
<P>

<a name="20418w29.html_para0">The Department also assists the Tyndall Centre at the university of East Anglia which supports the work in nine research institutions to promote understanding of the causes and consequences of climate change. The Tyndall Centre is funded by the National Environment Research Council (NERC), Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC), the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC); and the Department contributes &#163;210,000 over three years for the development of assistance to business on climate change causes and its consequences.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how much direct Government funding has been made available to the renewables sector in the last financial year and the following year for <i>(a)</i> research and development, <i>(b)</i> capital investment and <i>(c)</i> revenue support; and to which projects it will be allocated.  [50434]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w29.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The Renewables Obligation, the Government's main policy instrument for the promotion of renewable energy, came into effect from 1 April, and is financed through payments by electricity consumers. The earlier Non Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) was also financed in this way. Hence most public support for renewable energy is not direct Government funding.
<P>

<a name="20418w29.html_para2">Estimated maximum payments available under the Renewables Obligation for England and Wales and the corresponding Renewables Obligation (Scotland) for 2002&#150;03 are &#163;282 million. The level of the obligation is set to rise each year to 2010&#150;11, when maximum payments for the year are estimated to reach &#163;1 billion. Actual payments, and the projects that will benefit, will depend on the capacity coming forward. Estimated payments from NFFO and comparable arrangements in Scotland in 2001&#150;02 were &#163;85.5 million. Payments under these arrangements are expected to decline substantially from 2002&#150;03 onwards, following the introduction of the Renewables Obligation.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what advice will be given to customers of post offices which are expected to be closed in the restructuring of Post Office Counters networks in respect of where they will be able to receive post office counter services; and if she will make a statement.  [48796]<P>

<P>
<a name="20418w30.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 April 2002]:</i> The Post Offices objective in restructuring the urban network is to retain and expand its customer base at modernised, improved facilities. Sub-postmasters leaving the network will be encouraged to help achieve this, for example, assisting customers by advising them of the nearest post office and introducing them to services available at the new outlet. Consultation on closure will involve the community, local stakeholders, sub-postmasters and Postwatch.
<P>

<a name="20418w30.html_para0">Under the Code of Practice, Post Office Ltd. are required to consult Postwatch on individual changes and plan to brief them on the process they envisage for reaching decisions.

 The Department makes an assessment of the costs and benefits of regulations when developing regulatory proposals. Where a regulatory proposal has an impact, in terms of costs, benefits and risks that affect businesses, charities and the voluntary sector, a regulatory impact assessment (RIA) is undertaken to inform policy development. Final RIAs are placed in the Libraries of the House when the regulation is presented to Parliament, but are not required for regulations where it has been assessed that no or negligible costs or savings would be

imposed or those that increase statutory fees via a predetermined formula. The Small Business Service are consulted on RIAs to ensure that the impact on small firms is not disproportionate.

 <i>[holding answer 16 April 2002]:</i> Where a breach of legislation over which the Department has oversight is identified, and that breach is addressed by way of criminal sanction, the Department will consider bringing a prosecution, taking account of the evidential and public interest tests set out in the Code of Crown Prosecutors.
<P>

<a name="20418w31.html_para0">The Department is unable to give legal advice about individual schemes in response to inquires from the public. The circumstances of individual schemes will vary. Individuals are advised that they should seek independent and impartial business and legal advice on a scheme prior to signing any agreement.
<P>

<a name="20418w31.html_para1">All trading schemes within the scope of current legislation are expected to comply with the regulatory controls. Whether and how the regulatory controls apply will depend on the operation of the individual scheme. In particular, in order to establish whether a scheme is a

"single-tier" scheme for the purpose of the legislation, a detailed assessment is required of the characteristics of the scheme in question.
<P>

<a name="20418w31.html_para2">The effect of the legislation is that, if all participants in a scheme are not making taxable supplies in the UK and not registered for VAT, the regulatory controls would apply. The issue of when to register for VAT purposes is a matter to be determined by reference to revenue legislation.

 The costs of pay awards for the 2001&#150;02 pay years for each of the DTI organisations are estimated in the table. It is not possible to cost the awards more precisely since the increases in organisational paybill are also affected during the period over which they are paid by other factors including promotions and other staff moves.

 <i>[holding answer 17 April 2002]:</i> We have carefully reviewed the reservation in the light of the legal opinion submitted by Save the Children and other recent requests that it should be withdrawn. We have taken legal advice which strongly suggests that the reservation remains necessary in order to maintain an effective immigration control. We consider that, not withstanding the reservation, there are sufficient checks and balances in place to ensure that children are protected.

<a name="20418w31.html_para4">The United Kingdom always takes its international obligations seriously. We are obliged, under the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, to consider all applications for asylum made in the United Kingdom. Each application is considered on its individual merits. While awaiting a decision on their claims, all asylum seeking children have access to primary health care and education facilities and there are currently no outstanding cases where the United Nations Convention on Rights of the Child (UNCRC) has been cited by children seeking asylum here. The majority of asylum seeking children are, of course, accompanied by their families.
<P>

<a name="20418w31.html_para5">We fully appreciate the potential vulnerability of unaccompanied children and the distress they may experience while awaiting a decision on their asylum claims. The need for anxious scrutiny is stressed in training and guidance to all staff involved in the asylum decision making process. Because of the particular sensitivities surrounding applications from unaccompanied children, their cases are given priority and dealt with by specially trained caseworkers, who are provided with comprehensive instructions setting out areas to consider when dealing with such applications. These instructions are available on the Internet and are reviewed on a regular basis.
<P>

<a name="20418w31.html_para6">All unaccompanied minors who apply for asylum are referred to the Refugee Council's Panel of Advisers, a non-statutory body which acts as adviser to the child in his/her dealings with the Home Office and other agencies

for the duration of the asylum claim. Unaccompanied minors are not entitled to benefits but are supported under the Children Act 1989 (maintenance and accommodation being provided by social services departments of the local authorities). It has been agreed that no unaccompanied child will be removed from the United Kingdom unless we are satisfied that adequate reception and care arrangements are in place in the country to which he/she is to be removed. If care arrangements cannot be established, the child is normally allowed to remain here exceptionally, outside the Immigration Rules, on compassionate grounds.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on his position towards Council Document 13957/01, on Harmonisation of Criminal Punishment.  [39653]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w32.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 The Government believe that it is desirable to set common penalties for serious organised crime offences across the European Union (EU), in line with the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. Council document 13957&#150;01 sets out different technical options for doing this, which were discussed at the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council on 6&#150;7 December 2001. The Government supported the "combined" option described in the paper, whereby a limited range of penalties would be introduced based on a number of different minimum levels.
<P>

<a name="20418w32.html_para5">Following further discussion of this option at the informal JHA ministerial meeting in Santiago de Compostela, 14&#150;15 February, 2002 it has now been agreed that the "combined" option should be used as the basis for setting common penalties for offences in future EU instruments. Such penalties do not affect judicial

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the reason underlying the reduction in the key performance target for staff sickness, as published in the Prison Service Corporate Plan 2001&#150;02 between 2000&#150;01 and 2001&#150;02.  [49968]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w32.html_spnew10"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Key Performance Indicator (KPI) target was agreed following the "Working Well Together" study published by the Cabinet Office in July 1998 and the recommendations of the National Audit Office report on the management of sickness in the Prison Service published in May 1999. The targets set aimed to achieve a stepped reduction in the average level of staff sickness by 20 per cent. by 2001 and 30 per cent. by 2003. These reductions are in line with Cabinet Office targets across the civil service.
<P>

<a name="20418w32.html_para6">The sickness figures for April 2001&#150;02 are not yet available. However, a figure for the year ending February showed a KPI of 13.93 days. The key performance target in the Corporate Plan 2001&#150;02 was to ensure that average staff sickness did not exceed 10 working days by April 2002. The service will not meet its KPI target.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w32.html_spnew11"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Information on the numbers of prisoners waiting to take up educational courses is not collected but we do know that waiting lists exist for courses in prison education departments including those in basic skills and computer skills. The Government are creating more learning opportunities through increased investment over the next two years and by mapping basic and key skills into learning in other prison regimes such as vocational training, workshops, kitchens and physical education so that prisoners can gain dual accreditation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w33.html_spnew0"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 We have no reason or intention to launch an investigation into conditions at Dungavel Removal Centre. We are confident that Premier Services Ltd., which manages and operates the centre, provides care of the highest order for all its detainees in line with the requirements of the Detention Centre Rules.
<P>

<a name="20418w33.html_para0">Reports that have recently been circulating suggesting that there has been a hunger strike by a number of detainees at Dungavel are completely unfounded.
<P>

<a name="20418w33.html_para1">On Tuesday 9 April 2002 a number of detainees announced their intention to stage what they termed a 'non-compliance' day. Detainees refused to get out of bed, take part in removal centre activities such as education or sport activities or eat in the centre's dining hall. They did, however, continue to buy food from the centre's shop.
<P>

<a name="20418w33.html_para2">Most detainees ate lunch and supper the next day and the centre has been operating normally since.
<P>

<a name="20418w33.html_para3">There are already in place a number of local befriending schemes at Dungavel and regular visits to detainees do take place. In addition, each removal centre has a Visiting Committee. The Visiting Committee is responsible for monitoring the state of the removal centre premises, the administration of the centre and the treatment of detainees. Dungavel has been visited by a range of representatives from national non-governmental organisations with a direct interest in asylum, immigration and detention.
<P>

<a name="20418w33.html_para4">The freedom of information provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 2000 will, when implemented, apply to immigration removal centres.

<a name="20418w34.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Liddell-Grainger: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many special constables there are in England and Wales; and how many there were on 1 May 1997.  [49023]
<P>
<UL><P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w34.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The number of serving special constables in England and Wales on 31 September 2001 was 12,068. In March 1997 there were 19,874 serving special constables.
<P>

<a name="20418w34.html_para0">The Government are committed to increasing the size of the special constabulary. Measures to achieve this would include improvements to the recruitment, training, conditions, management and deployment of specials&#151;focusing their role on intelligence-led, high visibility patrolling and local crime reduction initiatives. In January 2002 we ran a press campaign targeting specials as part of the national recruitment campaign for the regular Police Service.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the use of civilians to fulfil policing tasks.  [49024]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w34.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The use of civilian support staff in the police service is not a new concept. Support staff carry out a variety of administrative roles in police stations, and in headquarters units, in order to lighten the bureaucratic load on police officers.
<P>

<a name="20418w34.html_para1">The Police Reform Bill contains provisions which will develop these roles further, allowing limited powers to be extended to police employed support staff who will work in four areas as investigating officers, escort officers, detention officers or community support officers (CSOs).
<P>

<a name="20418w34.html_para2">These support staff will be employed by the police authority and will be under the direction and control of the chief officer. He or she will be responsible for deciding which of the limited powers currently provided for in the Bill they will be allowed to exercise.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what assessment he has made of the measures introduced by road hauliers to check for on-board illegal immigrants prior to cross-channel ferry embarkation to the United Kingdom.  [49934]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w34.html_spnew3"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 The civil penalty provisions introduced by the 1999 Immigration and Asylum Act are intended to encourage hauliers to take effective measures to prevent unauthorised persons travelling in their vehicles. The number of clandestine entrants dealt with by the Immigration Service at Dover fell from 12,679 in 2000 to 9,225 in 2001, a reduction of 27 per cent. This indicates that while many hauliers have taken steps to properly 



<P>
<P><I>18 Apr 2002 : Column 1166W</I><P>
secure their vehicles against unauthorised entry, a large number have not implemented effective systems to prevent this traffic.
<P>

<a name="20418w34.html_para3">Because of the high volume of cross-channel freight traffic, the security measures and checks employed by hauliers can only be assessed in respect of individual vehicles selected for examination upon arrival in the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="20418w34.html_para4">When vehicles are selected for examination at Dover, whether or not they are found to contain clandestine entrants, an assessment is made of the security measures in place. On average some 48 per cent. of vehicles examined are assessed as being properly secured.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w34.html_spnew5"><B> Angela Eagle </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 April 2002]:</i> The evaluations of the sites will inform site selection, acquisition negotiations and the evaluation of the forthcoming competition.

<a name="20418w34.html_spnew7"><B> Angela Eagle </B>

[44753]<P>

 As the White Paper "Secure Borders, Safe Havens", published on 7 February 2002, made clear asylum-seekers, before they leave the induction centre, will be asked to sign a document confirming that they understand:

In any other case, the Land Registry can correct an error in the register or title plan only with the consent of all relevant parties, or following a judicial determination by the Court, or by the Solicitor to HM Land Registry.

 <i>[holding answer 21 March 2002]:</i> Dentists on health authority lists are self-employed principal dentists. They do not have a standard working week and can vary their working hours.
<P>

<a name="20418w36.html_para4">In March 2000 the Office of Manpower Economics (OME) carried out a survey into the hours of work and workload of principal dentists taking any part in the General Dental Service (GDS) in Great Britain.
<P>

<a name="20418w36.html_para5">The survey found that 49 per cent. of female principals in the GDS considered themselves as carrying out dental work full-time. This would be equivalent to about 3,000 of the 6,122 female principals in the GDS in the UK at 31 December 2001. The survey found that about one quarter of full-time principals spent 100 per cent. of their time on GDS work. This would be equivalent to 780 female principals at December 2001.
<P>

<a name="20418w36.html_para6">10,194 female dentists were on the General Dental Council (GDC) Register at 1 January 2002. The 3,000 principals estimated to be doing dental work full-time are equivalent to 29 per cent. of the females on the GDC register. The 780 principals estimated to be doing dental work full-time and spending 100 per cent. of their time in the GDS are equivalent to 8 per cent. of the females on the GDC register.

 I refer my hon. Friend to the answer I gave to the hon. Member for Aylesbury (Andrew Lidington) on 1 February 2002, <i>Official Report</i>, columns 626&#150;27W.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w38.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Government guidance on charges for residential accommodation is updated regularly. It is based on the principle that those people who are able to pay for their care should do so, while those who have limited income and assets contribute according to a fair financial assessment. Advice on the fees which local authorities should negotiate with care home owners is contained in "Building Capacity and Partnership in Care", an agreement between central government and the statutory and independent social and health care and housing sectors. The agreement states that fee setting

should take into account the legitimate current and future costs faced by providers, the factors that affect these costs and the potential for improving performance and more effective ways of working.

<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w39.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We currently allocate funding to health authorities, and they allocate funding to primary care trusts (PCTs), on the basis of the relative needs of their populations. A weighted capitation formula is used to determine each health authority and PCTs fair share of available resources, to enable them to commission similar levels of services for populations in equal need.
<P>

<a name="20418w39.html_para0">The formula has the following components: hospital and community health services; HIV/AIDS; general practice infrastructure, i.e. practice staff wages, premises and equipment; general practice prescribing, i.e. drug costs of prescriptions dispensed not dispensing fees; and general medical services non-cash limited.
<P>

<a name="20418w39.html_para1">In future the intention is that allocations will be made direct to primary care trusts. This is subject to the passage of legislation through Parliament. Allocations will continue to be based on the principle of weighted capitation.

 Good progress is being made in extra training of NHS staff to help them extend their skills and offer increased support to people with cancer. A number of new initiatives are underway to develop existing NHS roles and to increase the number of training places available so that we meet the NHS Cancer Plan targets to increase the number of cancer specialists. New ways of working pilot projects have been set up in four breast screening centres and nine radiotherapy centres. These are testing and developing new ways to make the best use of the skills and abilities of staff. We are also developing a nationally accredited educational and training programme for cytology-screening.

The training programme will help district and community nurses to support people with cancer in remaining at home for as long as possible during their illness. &#163;2.5 million has also been made available to train additional staff in endoscopy procedures.

<a name="20418w40.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Simmonds: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the waiting times for chemotherapy and radiotherapy are in <i>(a)</i> Lincolnshire and <i>(b)</i> other counties in England; and what steps are being taken to improve these waiting times.  [40463]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w40.html_spnew1"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The NHS Cancer Plan set out maximum waiting time targets for first definitive cancer treatment which will come into effect over the next few years. From December 2001 there is a one-month maximum wait from diagnosis to first treatment for breast cancer and a one-month wait from urgent general practitioner referral to first treatment for childrens testicular cancer and acute leukaemia. By 2005 there will be a maximum one-month wait from diagnosis to first treatment for all cancers. Data to monitor the December 2001 target are being collected and will be published in due course. Data on waiting times for treatment of other cancers will be collected as the targets are introduced.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what powers PCTs have to commission services from outside the NHS.  [50804]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="20418w40.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Primary Care Trusts (PCTs) have a legal duty and freedom to secure the provision of locally relevant, high quality services for the populations they serve. This may be from the public (including local authorities) or independent sector. Commissioning decisions must be made on the basis of health care needs of the local community and should take into account of both clinical and cost effectiveness. PCTs may also legally secure the provision of services from countries in the European Economic Area for their patients. I also refer the hon. Member to the reply I gave the hon. Member for Woodspring (Dr. Fox) on 8 November 2001, <i>Official Report</i>, column 367W.

<P>
<a name="20418w40.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Trusts receive the bulk of their funding via service agreements with Primary Care Trusts (PCTs).

<a name="20418w40.html_para3">Trusts also receive revenue funding from the Department for medical and non-medical staff and nurse education services and for research and development.
<P>

<a name="20418w40.html_para4">In addition trusts can charge staff, visitors or patients for services provided, such as catering or provision of private patient facilities.
