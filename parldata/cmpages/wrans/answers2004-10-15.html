<a name="41015w01.html_sbhd0"><h3 align=center>Cyprus</h3>


<p><a name="41015w01.html_wqn0"><b> Andrew Mackinlay: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence which rights and benefits enjoyed by UK and Commonwealth Forces under the treaty relating to the Sovereign Base Areas in Cyprus do not extend to non-Commonwealth Forces operating on the bases; and if he will make a statement.  [190429]</p>




<p><a name="41015w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Ingram: </b> 
 The rights and benefits accorded to United Kingdom and Commonwealth Forces under the 1960 Treaty of Establishment are set out in Annex C to the treaty papers, which is effectively a Status of Forces Agreement between the UK and Republic of Cyprus (RoC) for UK and Commonwealth forces operating in and visiting the Republic. The benefits the treaty confers include: freedom of movement between the Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) and the RoC, jurisdictional protection for certain offences committed in the RoC, exemption from RoC taxes and import duties, and the right to bear arms. Non-Commonwealth forces are not covered under these arrangements and would need to negotiate their own status of forces arrangements with the RoC.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41015w01.html_para0">
Any Commonwealth and non-Commonwealth forces entering and operating within the SBAs who are covered by the Visiting Forces Act 1952 (which has been extended to the SBAs) are accorded generally the same rights and benefits as similar forces visiting the UK. These include jurisdictional protection and exemptions from taxes and import duties. Our ability to grant full tax and duty exemptions to non-Commonwealth forces is restricted by our treaty commitment to collect taxes, rates and fees from non-entitled persons on behalf of the RoC. Countries not covered by the Visiting Forces Act do not enjoy any privileges within the SBAs other than consent to operate within the bases and the use of SBA facilities. However, minor concessions, such as access to military messes and bars, can be agreed case-by-case for practical purposes.

<p><a name="41015w01.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Ivan Lewis: </b> 
 Information on the number of young people who have applied, enrolled and been paid EMA is available at local authority level. By the end of September 2,557 young people in the Leeds local authority area were enrolled for EMA by their school or college, with 2,281 having received an EMA payment. The Assessment and Payment Body is currently turning around correctly completed applications within 10 working days and 3,682 young people in Leeds have now received a Notice of Entitlement to EMA. By the end of September 5,994 young people had applied for EMA from the Leeds local authority area, and of these just over a quarter had applied in September. Incorrect applications are returned to the applicant, some of whom will be ineligible for EMA, while others may have decided to enter full-time work or work based learning. We expect the number of young people receiving EMA to increase over the next few weeks as those who applied late or whose applications needed to be returned, have their applications assessed and are enrolled for payment.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what financial help his Department offers mature students wishing to study for a degree.  [190261]</p>




<p><a name="41015w01.html_spnew6"><b> Dr. Howells </b> 
<i>[holding answer 11 October 2004]:</i> Eligible full-time undergraduate students are entitled in 2004/05 to income assessed grants for fees (up to &#163;1,150) and HE grants (up to &#163;1,000); and if aged under 50, or between 50 and 54 and planning to work after their course, to student loans (up to &#163;5,050 in London) with 25 per cent. of the loan income assessed. While the rates 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>15 Oct 2004 : Column 392W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
are the same as for younger students, mature students benefit disproportionately because the income assessed for independent students is normally lower and more get the higher levels of support. For example, we expect around a third of all those getting the full HE grant to be independent students, although such students make up only around 15 per cent. of the total student population.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41015w01.html_para6">
For students with dependants, additional grants include adult dependants grant (worth up to &#163;2,335), Parents Learning Allowance (worth up to &#163;1,330) and a Childcare Grant (worth up to &#163;8,840). As the grants are targeted at students with dependants the main beneficiaries are mature students.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41015w01.html_para7">
Part-time undergraduate students of any age, and this will include many mature students, may receive income assessed fee grants of up to &#163;575 and course grants of up to &#163;250.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41015w01.html_para8">
In addition, student parents are eligible to receive Child Tax Credit from the Inland Revenue and disabled students are eligible for DfES disabled students allowances which are not income assessed. Students may also receive additional financial assistance through the Access to Learning Fund, which is funded by the Department and administered by institutions. Priority groups for payments from the fund include student parents and other full-time mature students (especially those with existing financial commitments).

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how much his Department has paid towards nursing costs for those in residential care in the past 12 months; and what proportion this represents of the total amount spent on residential care from all sources.  [189002]</p>




<p><a name="41015w04.html_spnew8"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The total amount spent in 2002&#150;03, the latest year for which figures are available, by councils and primary care trusts (PCTs) in providing nursing care for adults was &#163;1.95 billion. In that year, PCTs were allocated &#163;220 million to meet the assessed nursing

In 2003&#150;04, PCTs became responsible for the nursing care costs of all residents in homes providing nursing care. PCTs were allocated &#163;584 million for this purpose. The total amount spent by councils and PCTs in that year is not yet available to make a comparison.

We would expect this to be about 25 to 30 per cent. of the amount spent on residential care. The balance comprises principally the costs of personal care provided to residents and their board and lodging costs.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health how many children were born at under 24 weeks gestation in the last two years for which figures are available; how many were still alive one year later; how many were handicapped; and from what handicaps they suffered.  [190167]</p>




<p><a name="41015w05.html_spnew0"><b> Dr. Ladyman: </b> 
 The Department estimates that 450 babies were born from 400 deliveries before 24 weeks gestation in 2001&#150;02. In 2002&#150;03, about 600 babies were born from around 650 similar deliveries. Deliveries at low gestational age are often, but not always, precursors to disability. We do not have any information on the number of babies born in the most recent years who have physical or sensory impairments or learning difficulties. Neither do we know how many of those babies were still alive a year after birth. However, results of a United Kingdom and Ireland longitudinal study conducted at Nottingham University based on babies born before 26 weeks in the nine months from March to December 1995 is available at http://www.nottingham. ac.uk/human-development/EPICure/study2.htm .

However, the BBC has explained that TV Licensing receives regular updates of the Postal Address File maintained by the Post Office. This information is checked against licensing data and, if an unlicensed property is identified, inquiries are made first by letter, then by telephone and if necessary by a home visit to establish if a television licence is required.

Defra has carried out one research project in the last 10 years which has included work on isolating TB in deer and other mammalian wildlife species (excluding badgers). The wildlife survey, carried out by the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) in the South West of England, confirmed infection in four deer species&#151;roe deer (1.0 per cent. of 885 samples), red deer (1.0 per cent. of 196 samples), fallow deer (4.4 per cent. of 504 samples) and muntjac (5.2 per cent. of 58 samples). The prevalence of infection was significantly higher in adult fallow and roe deer. The final report of the CSL research was published on the Defra website in July and can be viewed at: http://www.defra.gov.uk/science/project data/ DocumentLibrary/SE3010/SE3010 1628 FRP.doc

Note:<br>

The CSL survey looked at TB in a number of mammalian wildlife species and did not focus specifically on deer.<br>

While isolations of Mycobacterium bovis (the causative organism of bovine TB) from deer are a concern it is not clear what, if any, contribution any of the species examined in the study make to the problem of TB in cattle. We are currently considering the requirements for our future research programme.<br>

National insurance contributions fall within the remit of the Inland Revenue and I am replying as the Minister responsible. Regulation 145(3) of the Social Security (Contributions) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/1004), which dates back to 1948, allows certain foreign students employed in the UK during their vacations to be exempt from NICs for the first 52 weeks of their employment. It does not apply to students from within the EU or countries with which the UK has a Reciprocal Agreement (RA) or Double Contribution Convention (DCC).

 According to figures from the British Crime Survey (BCS), which are the most reliable indicator of long-term trends in violence in England and Wales, there were an estimated 2.7 million violent incidents against adults in 2003&#150;04. Levels of violent crime are now stable and are 26 per cent. down from 1997. The fear of violent crime has also fallen steadily since 1998, with the proportion of adults with a high level of concern about violent crime down from 21 per cent. in 2002&#150;03 to 16 per cent. in 2003&#150;04.

Half of all violent incidents reported to the BCS in 2003&#150;04 did not result in injury to the victim. However, this does not mean that public concern about violent crime is unjustified or that the ordeal of victims is not traumatic, even if injury has not occurred.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41015w08.html_para2">
Recorded violent crime has risen since 1997, reaching 1.1 million incidents in 2003&#150;04, but these data are affected by changes in reporting and recording practices. The Home Office Counting Rules for Recorded Crime were amended in 1998 to include a large number of offences particularly in the less serious violence categories. The introduction of the National Crime Recording Standard (NCRS) in April 2002 also resulted in an increase in recorded crime. The effect for violent crime was estimated to be an increase of 20 per cent.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41015w08.html_para3">
In addition, more violent crimes are being recorded by the police as public tolerance of violence in the family or by acquaintances diminishes. Along with a more proactive response from the police, more crimes that would have previously been unreported are now recorded in the official figures.

The Government&#039;s commitment to the provision of green space, including parks and playing fields, was laid out in Planning Policy Statement 1, which said that well designed public and green space were required as part of building sustainable communities. The Government stated in Planning Policy Guidance 17 that open space standards are best set at a local level as national standards cannot cater for local circumstances. Local authorities are expected to carry out assessments of the needs of their communities that will be used to set robust standards for the provision of all types of open space. This applies equally in the Thames Gateway as elsewhere in the country.
</p>


<p>

The Government are encouraging the enhancement and the creation of a range of new green space within the Gateway, not just playing fields and parks.

 The Thames Gateway is covered by three regional planning authorities&#151;the Mayor of London, East of England and South East England. These three authorities have issued collectively an Interregional Planning Statement, published in August 2004. It sets out the allocation of 128,500 new homes in the Thames Gateway sub-region by 2016. Alongside the housing projections, the statement also identifies work to deliver environmental, social, physical and essential services to support the growth agenda and secure overall sustainability.

Regional planning guidance for the South East and East of England regions is currently under development. It is a planning requirement that RSSs are prepared with the objective of contributing to the achievement of sustainable development. The draft strategies are being developed by the Regional Assemblies who will be expected to take into account community and infrastructure needs in producing their plans, and are duty bound to present several options. It is for example a requirement that regional strategies incorporate transport strategies that set out the transport infrastructure required to support development.

Where plans are developed for new primary schools, or to enlarge any other existing schools, to meet population growth, these must be subject to local consultation before being published.

 Most of the Thames Estuary is already protected to a greater than 1:1000 year level (possibility of 0.1 per cent. of flooding in any one year) until 2030. This includes a generous allowance for future sea level rise until 2030 and is a far higher standard of protection than in most other parts of the UK. Growth in the Thames Gateway will be largely concentrated on previously developed land in existing urban area, reducing the requirement for additional flood defences.

The Environment Agency is currently carrying out a six-year study of flood risk management called &#039;Thames Estuary 2100&#039;.

Redevelopment in the Thames Gateway provides the opportunity to deliver sustainable flood defences. Riverside walkways and green spaces can be used to accommodate occasional flooding as well as providing an attractive setting for development.

<p><a name="41015w11.html_spnew11"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Section 42A of the Landlord and Tenant Act 1987 does not impose liabilities to tax. It requires agents to hold the service charge contributions of tenants on trust in an account at a financial institution.

</p>


<p>
<a name="41015w11.html_para5">
As those service charge contributions are held in a trust, any income arising on the tenants&#039; contributions is taxable in the same way as any other funds held in a trust. There is consequently no requirement for trustees to identify to the Revenue that their trusts were established in consequence of section 42A, and in many cases trust arrangements were already in place when the section 42A requirement came into force.

<p><a name="41015w12.html_spnew0"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 The tax credits system is designed to be flexible: claimants&#039; payments can be adjusted in year if their circumstances or income change. The aim is to pay the right amount to claimants over the year.

The Inland Revenue&#039;s Code of Practice 26, &quot;What happens if we have paid you too much tax credit?&quot;, sets out the Inland Revenue&#039;s approach to tax credits overpayments and the several reasons why someone might find at the end of the year that they have been paid too much tax credit.

<p><a name="41015w12.html_spnew1"><b> Dawn Primarolo: </b> 
 Entitlement to tax credits is based on the income of the current tax year if that is lower than the previous year income. Claimants can ask to have their award adjusted during the year, to reflect their estimate of current year income, if they wish.

<p>
<a name="41015w12.html_para1">
Otherwise, underpaid tax credit will be paid out when the award is finalised at the year end.
