<p><a name="41011w01.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The 35 English and Welsh safety camera partnerships participating in the national programme confirmed to my Department in January this year that they were operating camera sites&#151;lists of which my Department published in June and placed in the Libraries of the House&#151;in line with the Department&#039;s rules and guidance for the programme.

 No quality bus contracts have to date been submitted to the Secretary of State for approval. We have issued for consultation draft guidance on the application procedure and the criteria for approval of schemes. As announced in the &quot;Future of Transport&quot; White Paper, we intend to streamline the statutory procedure by reducing the minimum period between making and implementing a scheme from the current 21 months to six months. Our guidance will make clear that use of the minimum period will only be appropriate for schemes with a limited impact on bus operators.

 The Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) advises that there is no simple way of defining the capacity of an individual station or route. The theoretical maximum capacity will be much greater than the actual capacity of an operational railway providing the mixture of services that demand dictates at an acceptable level of operational performance. The SRA&#039;s programme of Route Utilisation Strategies currently determines the most effective use of the network infrastructure. In accordance with the Government&#039;s White Paper &quot;The Future of Rail&quot;, Network Rail will take on responsibility for drawing up these strategies, for agreement by Government.

<p><a name="41011w01.html_spnew8"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 Traffic Officers (TOs) are directly employed by Highways Agency and will be designated to act on behalf of the Secretary of State in accordance with the Traffic Management Act.

<p><a name="41011w02.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Geoffrey Robinson: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a comparative assessment of <i>(a)</i> the effect on the safety of road users and <i>(b)</i> the level of pollutants emitted when a road vehicle performs (i) a u-turn and (ii) a three-point turn.  [189821]</p>




<p><a name="41011w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The safety aspects of any vehicle manoeuvre will be dictated by individual circumstances. Drivers have a responsibility for ensuring that any manoeuvre that has the potential to bring their vehicle into conflict with other road users is carried out in a manner that is safe, legal and convenient to do so. Drivers must also consider if they can control their vehicles in the given circumstances and, while knowledge of the Highway Code will help, if there is any doubt in the driver&#039;s mind, neither manoeuvre should be carried out and an alternative method of turning found.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w02.html_para0">
With regards to effects on pollutant emissions, no comparative assessments have been made and none are planned since, due to the infrequency of these manoeuvres, the impact on air quality would be negligible. However, in general terms, a higher level of pollutants might be expected from three-point turns due to the stop/start nature of the exercise.

<p><a name="41011w02.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 There are no plans at present to allow credit card payments due to the fact that finance companies levy up to a 3 per cent. surcharge for such transactions. Neither the Concessionaire (Severn River Crossing plc) nor the Government is currently prepared to fund this surcharge. However, the Concessionaire and the Government will continue to review this position.

<p>
<a name="41011w02.html_para1">
Providing such a facility may also require amending the legislation that prescribes the manner of payment of tolls (The Severn Bridges Regulations 1996&#151;SI 1316).

<p><a name="41011w02.html_spnew5"><b> Mr. Jamieson: </b> 
 The last National Roadside Survey of vehicle excise duty (VED) evasion for which figures are available was carried out in June 2002. The survey indicated that the revenue lost from VED evasion was equivalent to 4.5 per cent. of the total revenue that should be raised. In 2002&#150;03 this equated to &#163;193 million which was offset by &#163;110 million in fines, penalties and relicensing revenue through enforcement activities.

<p>
<a name="41011w02.html_para4">
A range of measures was announced in May 2003 to modernise and tighten the vehicle registration system. These included Continuous Registration which was introduced in January 2004. All those not paying their road tax or declaring their vehicles off the road are detected from DVLA&#039;s records and sent a penalty notice. It is now no longer necessary to detect evaders using their vehicles on the road. Early indications are that this system will reduce the amount of VED evaded by around &#163;70m in 2004&#150;05.

 The UK Government do not actively promote intercountry adoption. The Government do provide a telephone and web-based information service to prospective adopters. It also manages the transfer of intercountry adoption applications overseas, ensuring that the documentation is complete and complies with UK legislative requirements. The Department for Education and Skills also acts as the Central Authority for England under The Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption. The Central Authority for Wales is the National Assembly for Wales, for Scotland the Scottish Executive and for Northern Ireland the Department of Health, Social Services and Public Safety. The role of the Central Authority is to ensure that the requirements laid down by the convention are fully met. The UK ratified the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in respect of Intercountry Adoption in 2003. Bolivia has also ratified the Hague Convention. The convention sets out clearly the principles which govern intercountry adoption policy, practice and procedure between contracting states. Principally these are to establish safeguards to ensure that intercountry adoptions take place in the best interests of the child and with respect for his or her fundamental rights as recognised in international law, to establish a system of co-operation amongst Contracting States to ensure that those safeguards are respected and thereby prevent the abduction, the sale of or traffic in children and to secure the recognition in Contracting States of adoptions made in accordance with the convention. Prior to the UK&#039;s ratification of the Hague Convention Bolivia has refused to accept applications for intercountry adoption. The Department for Education and Skills has subsequently received correspondence from the Bolivian authorities setting out their additional requirements in relation to intercountry adoption. However, we believe that the convention adequately addresses arrangements for adoption between contracting states.

<p><a name="41011w05.html_wqn0"><b> Mr. Woodward: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what estimate the Government has made of the average amount of money parents in England contribute to the cost of child care.  [186863]</p>




<p><a name="41011w05.html_spnew0"><b> Margaret Hodge: </b> 
 A number of surveys of parents provide figures relating to the average amount parents pay for child care. Estimates differ depending on the methodology used.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w05.html_para0">
According to the &#039;Repeat Survey of Parents Demand for Childcare&#039; <sup>1</sup> , households paying for childcare were spending on average &#163;40 a week on child care. Half of these families paid up to &#163;21 per week and one-in-ten paid more than &#163;100.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w05.html_para1">
The 2002 Families and Children Study <sup>2</sup>  shows that the median total weekly child care costs among all paying families where the mother works were &#163;25 per week in term-time and &#163;35 per week in holidays.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w05.html_para2">
The Government recognise that making child care affordable is a key challenge for the National Childcare Strategy and has made a substantial investment to achieve this. Working parents, subject to the level of their income, may receive support through the child care element of the working tax credit. We are also introducing greater incentives for employers to support parents with the cost of child care from April 2005. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Oct 2004 : Column 19W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Inland Revenue data on the child care costs of UK parents benefiting from the child care element of the working tax credit show that in April 2004 they had mean allowed weekly costs of &#163;71.12 <sup>3</sup> . As a result of this support, almost 318,000 working families in April 2004 were receiving an average of &#163;49.66 per week towards their childcare costs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w05.html_para3">
In addition, all 3 and 4-year-olds are now entitled to free, part-time early education which guarantees each of them up to six terms of high quality provision before they reach statutory school age. This reduces the amount of child care that parents of children of this age have to pay for. Government also provides financial support to child care providers to help with start-up costs and sustainability, which will further reduce the costs that must be borne by parents.

Many of the measures in the Bill are about better and more effective ways of working and, in themselves, will not have any significant additional cost implications. However the Government will increase investment in children&#039;s services by almost &#163;1 billion by 2007&#150;08 compared with 2004&#150;05.

 At 31 March 2003 there were an estimated 41,100 children in foster placements in England, representing 68 per cent. of all looked after children. The Department itself does not collect information centrally about the number of foster carers. However, a recent survey of local authorities, carried out by the Fostering Network, indicated a shortage of around 8,200 foster carers in England, inevitably limiting the range of placements available to looked after children. Assisting local authorities to recruit and retain foster carers is a key priority for my Department and a number of national initiatives are already in place or planned to encourage greater numbers of people to become and remain foster carers.

In my reply I alluded to the difficulty in establishing totally accurate statistics of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Colombia. In gauging the extent of the problem we compare figures provided by the Colombian Government with those provided by reputable Colombian NGOs, including Consultoria Para Los Derechos Humanos Y El Desplazamiento (CODHES) or Consultancy for Human Rights and Displacement in English. This comparison enables us to monitor trends in IDP figures, increasing or decreasing, and helps in our efforts to establish the reason for such changes. The CODHES figures for 2001 were 341,925 (Colombian Government figure is 327,606) and in 2002 were 412,553 (Colombian Government figure is 379,289).

 In my reply I alluded to the difficulty in establishing totally accurate figures of internally displaced people (IDPs) in Colombia. To do so we compare figures of IDPs from different, respected sources and thereby try to gauge trends. We supplement the assessment of such data by our Embassy in Bogota seeking to establish the true picture through discussions with the Government of Colombia, NGOs, international organisations working in Colombia such as the UN, ICRC, the church and civil society. The respected Norwegian Refugee Council is one of these interlocutors. Embassy officials also travel around the country to assess the situation at first hand, although such travel can be restricted by security concerns. There is no guaranteed, comprehensive means of checking the accuracy of figures of IDPs. The marked decline in numbers of IDPs in 2003 referred to new displacements in that year.

For those people in receipt of income related benefits, such as income support, income based jobseeker&#039;s allowance and pension credit, which are intended to help people whose resources are insufficient to meet their day-to-day living expenses; this is treated in the same way as other types of earnings and attracts the normal &#163;5 or &#163;20 earnings disregard.

For those in receipt of incapacity benefit, which is normally paid to people who are incapacitated by the effects of their illness or disability, there is an exception for local authority councillors.

 Independent research commissioned by DWP shows that there are very high levels of satisfaction among benefit and pensions customers who have transferred to direct payment and those who have started claiming and chose to receive direct payments. Overall 91 per cent. of customers were happy with the process of setting up direct payments (the figure for pensioners was 88 per cent.).

Direct payment is now the normal method of payment. The Department provides staff with the factual information they need to give to customers, in order for customers themselves to choose the account which best meets their needs and circumstances.

We will also be looking at redeployment opportunities in other parts of this and other Government departments. Following this redeployment exercise we will have a clearer picture of whether redundancies might be necessary, and the numbers affected.</p>

Notes:<br>

1. Projections with this breakdown are only available for private households. In addition to pensioners in private households, there are approximately 200,000 pensioners in care homes eligible for Pension Credit. The figures in Tables 1 and 2 above do not include pensioners in care homes.<br>

2. Estimates for private households and individuals in 2004&#150;05 are based on the Family Resources Survey data for 2002&#150;03 projected forward to 2004&#150;05 to reflect changes in taxes, benefit rates and pensioners&#039; incomes.<br>

3. For projections beyond 2004&#150;05 it has been assumed that pensioners&#039; incomes will rise in line with average earnings; the guarantee credit will be uprated in line with average earnings; and the savings credit threshold will be uprated in line with prices.<br>

4. The numbers entitled under these assumptions have then been scaled up to reflect growth in the pensioner population, using projections from the Government Actuary&#039;s Department.<br>

5. Projections have been rounded to the nearest 50,000 cases, are subject to a wide margin of error and should be used as broad indications of the likely eligible population only.<br>

6. A pensioner household is defined as single persons aged 60 or over and couples where at least one partner is aged 60 or over. Individuals are single pensioners with eligibility and both partners in a couple with eligibility.<br>

7. Rows might not sum exactly due to rounding.<br>

 To ask the Secretary of State for International Development what assessment he has made of <i>(a)</i> the advantages and <i>(b)</i> the disadvantages of genetically-modified crops to developing countries.  [190095]</p>




<p><a name="41011w15.html_spnew2"><b> Mr. Gareth Thomas: </b> 
 DFID&#039;s approach to GM crops and developing countries is based on the principle that the health of people and the environment is of primary concern. GM technologies have the potential to provide significant benefits for poor farmers. For example, the potential for increased yields in developing countries from the use of GM technology far exceeds the potential in European and North American conventional agriculture, where yields have been high for many years. GM technology could also improve the nutritional quality of staple foodstuffs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w15.html_para7">
A report published by the Nuffield Council on Bioethics contains a number of case studies detailing the actual and potential benefits of GM crops for developing countries. The report offers a constructive contribution to the on-going debate on genetic modification technologies. The Government share the report&#039;s conclusions that achieving food security and reducing poverty in developing countries are complex issues, that GM crops are unlikely to feed the world but that in some circumstances they could make a useful contribution to improving the livelihoods of poor people in developing countries.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w15.html_para8">
Recognising that there are both potential benefits and risks associated with GM crops, DFID believes that developing countries need to be able to make their own informed choices about whether to adopt GM technologies or not. The UK Government have pushed for the implementation of international legislation such as the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety, which provides for rigorous assessment and management of the risks involved in the use of Genetically Modified Organisms. The UK has ratified this Protocol.

It is the Royal Parks&#039; normal practice, under the terms of their contracts, to make their concessionaires responsible for the maintenance of the buildings they occupy. The Royal Parks do not normally have information about the expenditure incurred by concessionaires on maintenance or improvements. However, during the last seven years there have been three instances where concessionaires have made significant investment in the buildings&#151;Pembroke Lodge in Richmond Park; Inn The Park in St. James&#039;s Park; and the boathouses in Regent&#039;s Park. The Royal Parks estimate that a total of &#163;3.3 million of private finance has been invested in these ventures over the period. The Royal Parks does not have a breakdown of expenditure by year for these concessions.

 Our latest assessment is that this year&#039;s harvest is now largely complete, despite very substantial delays and difficulties in many parts of the country as a result of the extremely wet weather during the summer. Total yield is likely to be higher than last year, when output fell because of excessive heat and drought. But the majority of crops will be of poorer quality than expected, reducing farmers&#039; returns in a weaker market, in addition to more expensive field and drying operations. There will also be some knock-on effects in relation to plantings and establishment of following crops.

Having considered the position very carefully in close contact with farmers&#039; representatives and following discussions between my right hon.

The areas in question are likely to include Northumberland, Tyne and Wear, County Durham, North and East Yorkshire, North Lincolnshire, Nottinghamshire, Leicestershire, Rutland and Northamptonshire.

 The introduction of Cattle Passports improved our ability to check the movement of animals during their lives, which makes it possible to trace animals potentially exposed to a disease risk such as the offspring and cohorts of BSE cases, and to trace the potential sources of infection.

<a name="41011w23.html_para11">
Cattle passports have played an important role in identifying cattle that are required to be tested under the EU&#039;s BSE surveillance programme. This programme has enabled us to gain a more detailed understanding of BSE epidemiology, notably its prevalence across various age groups. This has allowed the monitoring of the beneficial effects of the control measures applied and, most importantly, facilitated our submission to the European Commission for moderate risk status for the UK.

 Evidence of a link between BSE in cattle and nvCJD (now known as vCJD) in humans is based on the close similarities in disease patterns in mice infected with BSE and vCJD.

Although BSE has been confirmed in one cow born in the UK in 2000, no cases have yet been confirmed in cattle born after this date. There is still a great deal of uncertainty about the range of duration of the incubation period for vCJD, but there is evidence that it is substantial. Therefore, there is unlikely to be a direct link between BSE in cattle born in or after 2000 and any recent cases of vCJD.

The White Paper accepted that in appropriate circumstances this return policy can be implemented by waste substitution arrangements which ensure broad environmental neutrality for the UK. Substitution of HLW for low level radioactive waste (LLW) was permitted because of the availability of the LLW disposal facility at Drigg in Cumbria. Intermediate level radioactive waste (ILW) substitution was the subject of a Department of Trade and Industry consultation paper issued in January 2004, and the responses to this are currently being considered. All reprocessing contracts signed by BNFL since 1976 have included return of waste provisions, and these has been reinforced by exchange of intergovernmental letters.

 The Government set up regional development agencies (RDAs) in the English regions in 1999 to co-ordinate the economic development and regeneration of the regions. The RDAs are the strategic drivers of regional economic development, working with regional and local partners and stakeholders to improve the performance of the regional economies. The RDA&#039;s activities include promoting business efficiency, investment and competitiveness in various ways. Details of these and other activities to further economic development and regeneration, skills and employment, are set out in their corporate plans, which are approved by Ministers.

<p>
<a name="41011w36.html_para0">
As part of their policy for decentralising power and strengthening the English regions, the Government are providing for the establishment of elected assemblies in regions that want to take greater responsibility for the decisions that affect them. The Government published the draft Regional Assemblies Bill and accompanying policy statement on 22 July. As set out in the draft Bill, in a region where an elected regional assembly is created, the RDA will become a functional body of the assembly. The assembly will fund the RDA from its block grant, and the RDA will be accountable to the assembly, rather than to central Government, including for the public funding it uses for business support. It will be up to each assembly to decide the precise arrangements it puts in place for its working relationship with the RDA.

The map identifies areas of acute labour market need and business opportunity, according to broad criteria established by the Commission.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry what plans she has to encourage greater use of renewable obligation certificates; and if she will make a statement on how the changes introduced in the Energy Act 2004 will work in practice in relation to the new mutualisation power.  [189911]</p>




<p><a name="41011w36.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 The Renewables Obligation provides suppliers with a strong incentive to acquire Renewables Obligation Certificates (ROCs) as suppliers who do not have enough certificates to meet their share of the Renewables Obligation have to pay the buy-out price for the remainder. The proceeds of the buy-out fund are then recycled to suppliers who hold ROCs, so that those suppliers paying into the buy-out fund are effectively subsidising those who use ROCs.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w36.html_para4">
The Government&#039;s current consultation paper on a number of limited changes to the Renewables Obligation, which was published on 8 September, includes a proposal to increase the level of the Obligation from 10.4 per cent. to 15.4 per cent. over the period from 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Oct 2004 : Column 129W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
2010&#150;11 to 2015&#150;16. This measure is in response to calls from the renewable industry to give additional confidence for the period beyond 2010 and should encourage the development of renewables and therefore the use of ROCs. In addition, the forthcoming review of the Renewables Obligation in 2005&#150;06 will include, among other things, an assessment of the effectiveness of the Renewables Obligation, including the extent to which the Obligation has led to new renewables projects coming forward.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w36.html_para5">
The current consultation paper also sets out the Government&#039;s plans to give effect to the changes introduced in the Energy Act 2004 in respect of mutualisation. Where there is a shortfall in the Renewables Obligation buy-out fund, mutualisation will work by requiring each licensed supplier with a renewables obligation (excluding the defaulting supplier) to contribute an additional sum to make up the shortfall. These sums will form a separate &quot;mutualisation fund&quot; which will be redistributed to suppliers holding ROCs in the same way as the existing buy-out fund.
</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry if she will break down how shortfalls in the Renewable Obligation Certificates Fund were made up in <i>(a)</i> 2003 and <i>(b)</i> 2004.  [189912]</p>




<p><a name="41011w36.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Mike O&#039;Brien: </b> 
 In 2002&#150;03, there were shortfalls in the Renewables Obligation buy-out fund totalling &#163;23.6 million. This was the result of the failure of two companies&#151;TXU (UK) Ltd. (which lead to a shortfall of &#163;23.1 million) and Maverick Energy Ltd. (a shortfall of &#163;0.5million). I understand that the administrators of TXU expect to make an interim payment to the affected suppliers very shortly.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w36.html_para6">
It is too early to give precise figures for shortfalls in 2003&#150;04, although I understand that two companies&#151;Atlantic Electric and Gas Limited and Maverick Energy Limited&#151;both of which are in administrative receivership will not have any funds available to comply with the Renewables Obligation. The resulting shortfall from Atlantic will be around &#163;8.5 million and from Maverick some &#163;0.7 million.

<p><a name="41011w37.html_spnew7"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 Following the abolition of community health councils on 1 December 2003, the responsibility for community health council premises transferred to NHS Estates, therefore no premises are owned or leased by community health councils. 115 premises are awaiting assignment to national health service organisations, other tenants or are awaiting sale. None of these premises is currently occupied.

No data are held centrally on the proportion of these cases which relate to people living today, nor what the likely life expectancy might be of those who remain alive today.

 Yes, and we take every opportunity to advocate the benefits of vocational training in our contacts with the European Commission and the health departments of those Member States which do not have schemes.

<p><a name="41011w39.html_spnew0"><b> Ms Rosie Winterton: </b> 
 The Department&#039;s building at 79 Whitehall (Richmond House) is connected by cable link to the parliamentary annunciator system from the Palace of Westminster. This link was in place when Richmond House opened in 1988, having first been established in 1969 in a previous headquarters building. The purpose of this is to provide Ministers, their Private Offices and other staff access to debates in the House of Commons and the House of Lords. Currently, this system is free of charge and comes in the form of a package of 24 audio and visual channels, which provide access to a range of broadcast services in addition to the parliamentary channels. Of these, Sky Sports is the only service which would be categorised as a premium channel. Separate from this, the Central Office of Information also provides a link for viewing the parliamentary committee broadcasts, at a current annual cost to the Department of &#163;27,739.40, including VAT.

In her reply to a similar question from the hon. Member for South Suffolk (Mr. Yeo) on 23 April 2002, <i>Official Report,</i> column 241W, my hon. Friend the Member for Salford (Ms Blears) attributed this separate charge to the provision of the annunciator system. 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Oct 2004 : Column 141W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
This was based on wrong advice, arising from a misunderstanding at the time about the operation of the system. I have written to the hon. Member apologising for the mistake and drawing his attention to this reply. A copy of that letter has been placed in the Library.

 Since 1997, the number of contact hours of domiciliary care have increased from 2.6 million to 3.1 million in 2003. More people are being kept out of residential care through the provision of intensive care packages in their own home. The number of households receiving intensive support at home has increased from 60,700 at September 1998 to 87,000 at September 2003.

 Information on waiting times, which is available at http://www.performance.doh. gov.uk/waitingtimes/, for in-patient and out-patient treatment in England is collected by consultant specialty rather than for specific conditions. This means that the information is not available in the format requested. However, we are aware that waiting times for treatment for eating disorders are sometimes too long and this is why we asked the National Institute for Clinical Excellence to develop a guideline on the effective treatments and why the national director for mental health is developing guidance for commissioners of specialised services.

 Both national health service treatment centres and independent sector treatment centres are intended to build capacity to treat NHS patients as safely, quickly and cost effectively as possible.

 The Department&#039;s policy is to encourage responsible employers and businesses, large, medium and small, to invest in occupational health services for all their employees.

Notes:<br>

Diagnosis (Primary Diagnosis)<br>

The primary diagnosis is the first of up to 14 (seven prior to 2002&#150;03) diagnosis fields in the HES data set and provides the main reason why the patient was in hospital.<br>

Main operation<br>

The main operation is the first recorded operation in the HES data set and is usually the most resource-intensive procedure performed during the episode. It is appropriate to use main operation when looking at admission details, for example, time waited, but the figures for &quot;all operations count of episodes&quot; give a more complete count of episodes with an operation.<br>

Grossing<br>

Figures are grossed for both coverage and missing/invalid clinical data, except for 2002&#150;03, which are not yet adjusted for shortfalls.<br>

Time Waited<br>

Time waited statistics from HES are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

<p><a name="41011w45.html_wqn2"><b> Norman Baker: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the increase in the number of procedures involving animals compiled under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986.  [188098]</p>




<p><a name="41011w45.html_spnew2"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The latest available data on the number of licensed scientific procedures involving animals are in the publication Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals in Great Britain (Command 6,291&#151;copies are in the Library).
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para1">
This shows that 2.79 million procedures, regulated under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, were started in 2003. This is an increase of 2.2 per cent. from the previous year, but this is within the limits of what are regarded as minor variations between years. It does not necessarily signal an established upward trend in animal use.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para2">
The pattern of species use is similar to that recorded in previous years. Rats, mice and other rodents were used in 85 per cent. of the procedures. A further 10 per cent. involved use of fish and birds.




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Oct 2004 : Column 162W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para3">
The species afforded special protection under the 1986 Act&#151;cats, dogs, primates and equidae&#151;were used in less than 1 per cent. of the total. Though within this relatively small percentage there was an increase in procedures using primates, the number of such animals used for the first time fell slightly. This is because some animals can be reused in certain mild procedures, such as blood sampling.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para4">
The trend over recent years, whereby the overall balance of use has gradually tipped more towards genetically modified animals, has continued. Such animals&#151;mainly mice&#151;were used in 2003 in 27 per cent. of all procedures, which is only 1 per cent. up on 2002, but compares with 8 per cent. in 1995. Most regulated procedures concerning these animals relate to breeding and the maintenance of colonies.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para5">
The total number of procedures in 2003 is considerably less than those recorded annually in the 1970s and 1980s, though the general downward trend since then has levelled out over the last decade.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para6">
It is impossible to predict the number of procedures likely to be undertaken in future years, as many factors are involved over which the Government have no direct control. These include strategic decisions by funding bodies, global economic trends and developments as a result of scientific innovation and endeavour.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para7">
But further increases as part of a longer term upward trend are likely, as use of genetically altered animals opens up new avenues of medical research, as more drugs and medicines are developed, and as new regulatory safety and testing requirements come into effect.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para8">
The numbers used will, however, be minimised in each programme of work, through rigorous application by the Home Office of the licensing controls in the 1986 Act.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to achieve his policy to reduce the number of animals involved in experimentations.  [188099]</p>




<p><a name="41011w45.html_spnew3"><b> Caroline Flint: </b> 
 The Government&#039;s responsibilities are to seek to reduce the animals used by minimising the number in particular projects, rather than through a reduction in the overall total, which in a demand-led area such as scientific research would not be practicable.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para9">
The use of animals can be licensed only under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 where there is no non-animal alternative, and then only when both the number of animals to be used and any resulting suffering is minimised. This reflects application of the 3Rs (replacement, reduction and refinement). Every step is taken in assessing licence applications, both at the establishments concerned and within the Home Office, to ensure that no 3R alternative is overlooked, and that licence authorities maintain that position.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para10">
The Home Office has previously funded work to the value of approximately &#163;250,000 a year for projects to promote and deliver reduction and refinements. We also co-sponsored the 4th World Congress on Alternatives and Animal Use in the Life Sciences, and are a co-sponsor of the 5th World Congress due to take place later this year.

<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para11">
Earlier this year we announced the setting up of the National Centre for the 3Rs, which will act as a focal point for research in this important area. This implements a recommendation of the House of Lords Select Committee on Animals in Scientific Procedures. Responsibility for the National Centre rests with the Office of Science and Technology.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w45.html_para12">
The Home Office continues to lead in running the Inter-Departmental Group on the 3Rs, a cross-Government body which considers many alternatives issues and keeps under review the Inter-Departmental Data Sharing Concordat.

The main gains in the 3Rs have come from the scientific community itself, and any future progress is likely to come in the main from its own continuing efforts to develop, validate and adopt alternatives.

The UK is not participating in the adoption of the Border Agency Regulation because the Council took the view that the UK could not opt in under the Title IV Protocol, because the regulation builds on the external border provisions of the Schengen acquis, in which the UK does not participate. Accordingly the UK has no vote on adoption. The UK disagrees with this interpretation and with the express exclusion of Gibraltar.

<p><a name="41011w49.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Cousins: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the recommendations were of the Sentencing Advisory Panel set out in spring 2003; and what his proposals are regarding implementation of each recommendation.  [188707]</p>




<p><a name="41011w49.html_spnew3"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 In February 2003, the Sentencing Advisory Panel issued advice to the Court of Appeal proposing a new sentencing guideline for the offence of causing death by dangerous driving. The advice is available on the Panel&#039;s website.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w49.html_para1">
On 3 April 2003, the Court of Appeal issued sentencing guidelines based on the proposals from the Panel.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department whether the sentencing guidelines will assist victims&#039; representatives to understand the basis of sentences.  [187241]</p>




<p><a name="41011w49.html_spnew4"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 Yes. The Sentencing Guidelines Council will, in due course, provide guidelines that indicate a sentence of a particular kind, or within a 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Oct 2004 : Column 180W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
particular range for each criminal offence. Under the Criminal Justice Act 2003, the court has a duty to state in open court, in ordinary language and in general terms, its reasons for deciding on the sentence passed. As part of this duty, where the court departs from guidelines relevant to the sentence it must state its reasons for doing so. The aim of these provisions is to enable the offender, victims and other interested parties better to understand why a particular sentence was imposed.
</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the reasons are for the changes in the <i>(a)</i> frequency and <i>(b)</i> number of sentences of imprisonment over the past 10 years.  [187242]</p>




<p><a name="41011w49.html_spnew5"><b> Paul Goggins: </b> 
 The foremost reason for the increase in frequency and number of prison sentences is increased severity of sentencing. In 1993 the custody rate for persons sentenced at all courts in England and Wales was 4.2 per cent.; this had risen to 7.9 per cent. in 2002 (latest data available).

<p>
<a name="41011w49.html_para2">
The new Sentencing Guidelines Council established by the Criminal Justice Act 2003 (CJA) will in due course create and revise a comprehensive set of Guidelines for all offences, so as to promote consistent and just sentencing by the courts within the framework provided by Parliament. In every individual case, judges and magistrates will continue to make their own decision as to the appropriate sentence, but will be required to operate within the council&#039;s guidelines or explain why they have gone outside them in that particular case.

 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how many people have been <i>(a)</i> arrested and <i>(b)</i> charged with an offence under the Anti-Terrorism Act 2000 in each year for which records are available;  [187595]
</p>



<p>(2) how many convictions have been secured for each category of offence under the Anti-Terrorism Act 2000 in each year for which records are available.  [187596]</p>




<p><a name="41011w50.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Blunkett: </b> 
 The figures requested are not routinely collected centrally by the police in the form requested. However, their records show that, cumulatively from 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Oct 2004 : Column 182W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
11 September 2001 until 30 June 2004, 609 people were arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000. 61 of these were charged under the Act and 38 under both the Terrorism Act and other legislation. The remainder were either released without charge, bailed to return, cautioned, charged under other legislation (such as that for murder, grievous bodily harm and use of firearms or explosives), or dealt with under immigration or mental health legislation. Of the 99 individuals charged under the Terrorism Act, 15 have been convicted.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w50.html_para0">
The above figures now appear on the Home Office website and will be updated every six months.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w50.html_para1">
Home Office Research Development and Statistics publish an annual Command Paper and supplementary volumes of criminal statistics. A breakdown of prosecutions and convictions under the Terrorism Act 2000 for 2001 and 2002 is in the accompanying table. Figures for 2003 will not be available until later in the year.
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w50.html_para2">
We are currently undertaking further work on the numbers of those arrested under the Terrorism Act 2000 and subsequently charged under other legislation. We will publish these figures once they are available. Previous estimates, which are likely to under-estimate those charged in this way, had suggested up to January 2004. Of the 530 people then arrested under the Terrorism Act, 263 are known to have been released without further sanction. Of the remaining 267, 165 had been charged (94 under the Act and 71 under other legislation). Others were released to immigration service detention, sectioned under the Mental Health Act, bailed, cautioned or at that point still not dealt with.

<p><a name="41011w50.html_wqn1"><b> Mrs. Lait: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he plans to publish the research commissioned by his Department into <i>(a)</i> TimeBank and <i>(b)</i> Do-it.  [186687]</p>




<p><a name="41011w50.html_spnew1"><b> Fiona Mactaggart: </b> 
 The Home Office research into the work of TimeBank and the do-it website was commissioned for internal Home Office use and it is not intended that it should be published in full, as it contains commercially sensitive information. However summaries of the main findings of this research are:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>TimeBank</i></p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">TimeBank&#039;s performance does not compare unfavourably with that of other Government funded programmes.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">TimeBank has managed to attract people into volunteering who have never volunteered before and has managed to broaden the base from which volunteers are recruited to some extent by attracting significant numbers of young people and people from black and minority ethnic communities.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Perhaps its biggest success has been its targeted campaigns which have been extremely well received by the Campaign Partners, but less so by TimePartners.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">There are ongoing difficulties with the TimePartner system and the link-up with the do-it database.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The functions of TimeBank and other key, strategic volunteering agencies such as do-it, the Community Channel and the National Centre for Volunteering overlap.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><i>do-it</i></p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">do-it has made a good start. In October 2001 it reported 9,000 page impressions per week, and by January 2002 it was up to 17,000. In March 2003 do-it was receiving 100,000 unique users per month. Opportunities cover a broad spectrum of service areas and skill levels.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">There are gaps in the evaluation that need to be addressed. There are currently no systematic data to indicate how many people have started to volunteer as a result of their contact with do-it, or indeed any feedback from users on the services that do-it provides.</p>
</ul>
<p>




<br>&nbsp;<br><i>11 Oct 2004 : Column 184W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">In the absence of user feedback, feedback from organisations was mixed. Three quarters of organisations that responded said they had received volunteers through do-it (average of 22 in the last year per organisation). Three in five organisations felt that do-it had been an effective recruitment tool.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">The capital modernisation scheme was felt to have been a great success, both by recipient organisations and representatives from the wider voluntary sector.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>


<p>
<a name="41011w50.html_para3">
These issues are currently being addressed by both organisations.

<p><a name="41011w51.html_spnew0"><b> Paul Goggins </b> 
<i>[holding answer 14 September 2004]:</i> In recent years the Home Office grant to victim support has more than doubled, from &#163;11.7 million at the start of the financial year 1997&#150;98 to &#163;30 million in 2004&#150;05. We anticipate that the level of Home Office funding for victim support will continue to be in the region of &#163;30 million for 2005&#150;06 and 2006&#150;07.

Altogether there were around 13,000 inter-prison transfers of young prisoners (aged 18 to 20) in 2003&#150;04. As this figure refers to all movements in this period, it may include some young prisoners who were transferred more than once during this period. It is not possible to identify how many of these transfers were on overcrowding drafts, although the considerable majority will have been the result of normal sentence planning procedures.
