 On 15 November 2004 the Learning and Skills Council (LSC) received its grant letter for 2005/06 from the Department. The letter reiterated our key priorities for 2005/06 to meet the needs of young people, those lacking literacy, numeracy and English language skills and those without a foundation of skills for employment. It also allocated an additional &#163;630 million for the financial year 2005&#150;06 when compared to 2004&#150;05 planned expenditure&#151;an increase of over 7 per cent. The LSC allocates funds to providers to deliver our priorities which are set out annually in the grant letter. Individual colleges and providers agree plans with the LSC and funding is allocated accordingly.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs whether cull dairy cows destined for the beef market after the end of the over-30-months scheme will be subject to dual inspection by milk and meat inspectors.  [149]</p>

 I have been asked to reply.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50525w01.html_para0">
I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that dairy hygiene inspectors carry out hygiene inspections focusing on facilities and equipment on production holdings. When the restrictions imposed by the over-30-months scheme are eventually lifted, dairy cows, which are no longer required to produce milk for human consumption can be slaughtered for meat for human consumption in licensed slaughterhouses. All such animals would be subject to ante-mortem and post-mortem inspections in licensed slaughterhouses by an official veterinary surgeon.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) under what circumstances motor sports can take place on land eligible for single farm payments; [37]

 Land used in support of claims for payment under the 2005 Single Payment Scheme (SPS) must be at claimants&#039; disposal for the 10-month period nominated on their claim forms. Under recently updated guidance issued by the Department, motor sports have been moved to Section B from Section C. This means such may take place on up to 28 days during the nominated 10-month period, in addition to all of the remaining two months of the year. It remains the case that all claims for payment are subject to observance of set cross-compliance conditions, which apply for the whole calendar year. There are no immediate plans to further update the guidance, but it will be reviewed for the 2006 scheme in the light of experience of this first year of operation of the SPS.

<p><a name="50525w01.html_wqn3"><b> Miss McIntosh: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what her policy is on whether motor sports are an activity which is consistent with land being considered as remaining in agricultural use.  [40]</p>




<p><a name="50525w01.html_spnew3"><b> Jim Knight: </b> 
 The Department has drawn up guidance on the Single Payment Scheme (SPS) and non-agricultural use of land which balances the need for diversification opportunities with the necessity to abide by the EU rules on eligibility of land under the scheme. That guidance is built around the degree to which non-agricultural use impedes or is inconsistent with normal farming activities and has recently been updated to provide for more flexibility in respect of motor sports.
</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on the impact of the Single Farm Payment Scheme on farm land being used for motor sports.  [148]</p>

It remains the case that all claims for payment are subject to observance of set cross-compliance conditions, which apply for the whole calendar year. The updated guidance takes on board representations made by motor sports interests and, overall, we would expect the impact of the SPS on farmland used for such sports to be limited.

<p><a name="50525w01.html_wqn6"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General what assessment he has made of the reasons for the attrition rate in rape prosecutions.  [593]</p>




<p><a name="50525w01.html_spmin0"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 Research indicates a number of reasons for the attrition rate in rape cases. Victims may withdraw for fear of not being believed; others are fearful that judgments will be made about their behaviour; some withdraw through fear of the process, particularly the court system; and victims can be scared of reprisals.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50525w01.html_para1">
In 2002, the Government implemented the Rape Action Plan (RAP) in order to address these issues. There will be an audit of its implementation later this year. HMIC and HMCPSI will then review again the manner in which the police and the CPS deal with rape cases. This review work will enable the Government to determine what is working and what remains to be done in tackling attrition in rape cases.
</p>





<p><a name="50525w01.html_wqn7"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General what the Crown Prosecution Service&#039;s policy is on dealing with defence applications to admit previous sexual history in rape cases which were not made in accordance with rules of court prior to trial.  [597]</p>




<p><a name="50525w01.html_spmin1"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service&#039;s policy is that advocates must be robust both in dealing with such applications and in ensuring that the correct procedure is followed. This applies to applications made before the trial and at trial. The policy also provides that, if the court grants leave to cross-examine a complainant about previous sexual history, the prosecuting advocate should review the position relating to special measures, and in particular should consider whether it is necessary to make an application to the court for one more of the special measures provided by the Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, or to apply to vary a pre-existing direction.
</p>





<p><a name="50525w01.html_wqn8"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General (1) what monitoring is carried out by <i>(a)</i> the Law Officers and <i>(b)</i> the Crown Prosecution Service on the timing of applications by the defence to admit previous sexual history in rape trials, in relation to the trial date;  [598]
</p>



<p>(2) what monitoring is carried out by <i>(a)</i> the Law Officers and <i>(b)</i> the Crown Prosecution Service of defence applications to introduce previous sexual history into rape trials.  [599]</p>






<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 May 2005 : Column 106W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>



<p><a name="50525w01.html_spmin2"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The joint inspection of rape cases carried out in 2002 by HMIC and HMCPSI made a large number of recommendations to improve the investigation and prosecution of rape cases, nearly all of which the Government accepted. It was not recommended that either the Law Officers or the Crown Prosecution Service monitor applications to admit previous sexual history or the timing of such applications, and no such monitoring is carried out. But the Home Office has commissioned research into the operation of section 41 Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999, which it will publish in due course.
</p>





<p><a name="50525w01.html_wqn9"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General what quality control the Crown Prosecution Service carries out on barristers instructed to prosecute rape trials.  [600]</p>




<p><a name="50525w01.html_spmin3"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service instructs experienced and committed advocates to prosecute cases involving allegations of rape. This involves seeking to instruct advocates of the necessary skill, competence and sensitivity to prosecute rape cases. In London and the south-east advocates are instructed from a specialist list. In other parts of the country, Grade 4 advocates are instructed where possible. CPS Areas have been advised in guidance issued in August 2003 that local monitoring is appropriate. Examples of local monitoring carried out by CPS Areas include the monitoring of the performance of counsel at trial by experienced caseworkers; monitoring by rape specialists for part of the trial and the raising of performance issues with local Heads of Chambers and at Joint Advocates Selection Committee as appropriate.
</p>





<p><a name="50525w01.html_wqn10"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General how many specialist rape prosecutors there are in England and Wales.  [601]</p>




<p><a name="50525w01.html_spmin4"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The CPS has appointed 520 specialist rape prosecutors across England and Wales. In addition, each area appoints a rape co-ordinator, whose function is to provide guidance on good practice to specialist rape prosecutors.
</p>





<p><a name="50525w01.html_wqn11"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General what advice the Crown Prosecution Service gives to police about the inclusion of details of a rape complainant&#039;s previous sexual history in a witness statement made for trial. [602]</p>




<p><a name="50525w01.html_spmin5"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 It is the duty of the police to investigate allegations of rape and to obtain evidence. The relevance, and so the admissibility, of a complainant&#039;s previous sexual history has to be resolved according to the particular circumstances of the case. Accordingly, there is no general advice given by the Crown Prosecution Service to the police about the inclusion of details of a rape complainant&#039;s previous sexual history in a witness statement.
</p>





<p><a name="50525w01.html_wqn12"><b> Vera Baird: </b> 
 To ask the Solicitor-General what proportion of applications to admit previous sexual history into rape trials was opposed in the last period for which figures are available; and what proportion was not opposed by the Crown Prosecution Service.  [606]</p>




<p><a name="50525w01.html_spmin6"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 The Crown Prosecution Service does not keep statistical records of applications to admit previous sexual history in rape trials, and so there are no figures available to ascertain the proportion of applications that were opposed and not opposed.

 To ask the Solicitor-General what training the Crown Prosecution Service provides for barristers instructed for the prosecution in rape cases. [607]</p>




<p><a name="50525w01.html_spmin7"><b>The Solicitor-General:</b> 
 In November 2004, the CPS provided training to the Criminal Bar Association on its legal guidance on the Sexual Offences Act 2003, and in particular on the exercise of prosecutorial discretion and charging under the 2003 Act. On a local level, some CPS Areas have provided training to their local bar on the Sexual Offences Act 2003 as well as circulating to them the CPS public policy statement on rape.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Defence why IVF treatment is not available to service personnel or their spouses in Germany through <i>(a)</i> his Department, <i>(b)</i> the British Forces Germany Health Service and <i>(c)</i> primary care trusts.  [743]</p>




<p><a name="50525w02.html_spnew0"><b> Mr. Touhig: </b> 
 A number of options are available to Service personnel and their dependants requiring IVF treatment while posted to Germany:
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">Although the British Forces Germany Health Service (BFG HS) is not funded for the provision of full IVF and equivalent treatment, it does fund the investigation of infertility and the provision of drug treatments following IVF. This takes place in our primary care facilities or our regional contracted German hospitals. It will also fund correction of any anatomical abnormality that may be causing infertility. In addition Artificial Insemination by Husband (AIH) is available at one of our contracted German hospitals.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">A patient can seek private treatment in Germany bearing the full cost themselves. In unusual cases presenting strong medical/social reasons for IVF treatment, BFG HS may pay for treatment.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">If a patient has embarked on investigation or treatment in the United Kingdom on a NHS programme and is then posted to Germany, they receive full administrative support, including the provision of transport by air trooper. The Ministry of Defence also takes a sympathetic view with regard to the posting of personnel while they are undertaking a course of treatment in the UK by deferring the posting if it is the individual&#039;s wish and if it is possible to do so.</p>
</ul>
<p>
</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext">For patients wishing to return to the UK to begin treatment for IVF, the BFG HS makes use of the excellent facilities offered by a charity based service which is provided at Hammersmith hospital in London at no cost to the patient or the MOD. In these cases BFG HS authorises transport by air trooper. In other instances where personnel wish to be posted back to the UK and this is supported by their posting authority, they can be referred to their local primary care trust (PCT) in the UK for the duration of the treatment.</p>

VAT registrations do not capture all start-up activity. Businesses are unlikely to be registered if they fall below the compulsory VAT threshold, which has risen in each year since 1997. Only 1.8 million out of 4 million enterprises were registered for VAT at the start of 2003.

 The Department commissioned GHK Consultants to undertake a wide-ranging evaluation of the first two rounds of Phoenix Fund support for Community Development Finance Institutions (CDFIs). GHK published its findings and recommendations in May 2004.
</p>

<a name="50525w03.html_para5">
The evaluation looked at many issues facing CDFIs in the provision of debt finance to enterprises in disadvantaged communities. This included the assessment of risk in relation to loan management.

Through the Department&#039;s core funding of the Community Development Finance Association (CDFA), the trade association for CDFIs, more recent and specific research has been conducted into CDFI interest rates. A summary of this can be found in this year&#039;s &quot;Inside Out&quot;, the CDFA&#039;s report on the industry for 2004. (Copies available through the CDFA website at: http://www.cdfa.org.uk).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50525w03.html_para7">
The CDFA&#039;s research concluded that CDFI interest rates vary, generally depending on the market being served, client type, loan size and term. Social enterprise lenders continue to operate with the lowest average rates at 9.22 per cent. static and +3.07 per cent. above base rate. A number of CDFIs targeting for-profit micro-enterprises use static rates with an average of 12.95 per cent., with others using variable rates with points above base rate at an average of +4.23 per cent.

A work trial allows a jobseeker to check whether a job is likely to work out before leaving the security of benefit.

 Operational noise complaints (as distinct from representations about policy) are properly a matter for individual airports, many of which regularly publish their own summary statistics of complaints or enquiries.

 The Government are strengthening the enforcement of the law against overseas drivers. The Road Safety Bill, introduced into Parliament on Tuesday 24 May, includes provisions designed to make it easier to take action against drivers who do not have a licence counterpart, which includes most foreign licence holders, by allowing enforcers to issue them with fixed penalty notices in respect of endorsable offences. At present they can only be dealt with by a court.

On the M25 between junctions 10 and 16 the temporary speed limit signs are set automatically in response to sensors in the road which detect traffic speed. The signs, on this section of controlled motorway, are mandatory. Data on the level at which speed limits are set and the duration for which they are applied are recorded and available.

<p><a name="50525w10.html_spnew1"><b> Ian Pearson: </b> 
 We condemn the recent attacks against humanitarian workers in Darfur. Many of these attacks appear to be the result of opportunistic banditry and general lawlessness. The African Union mission in Darfur has made a positive impact on security in the areas in which it has deployed and we fully support its expansion as the best way of addressing the security situation in Darfur. We continue to make clear to the Government of Sudan that it is their responsibility to provide security for all their people, and to actively pursue those who breach the law. We have made clear to all parties that attacks against humanitarian workers are in violation of international humanitarian law and it is imperative that those responsible are brought to justice. UN Security Council Resolution 1591, adopted on 29 March, allows for sanctions to be brought against those who commit violations of international humanitarian or human rights law or other atrocities. And Resolution 1593, which we sponsored on 31 March, referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court. Both these Resolutions provide a means towards addressing the impunity which has been prevalent in Darfur to date; we will follow their impact closely.

 The Government of Sudan appear to be taking the referral of the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court (ICC) seriously. Since UN Security Council Resolution 1593 referred the situation in Darfur to the International Criminal Court on 31 March, the UN Secretary-General has concluded, in his monthly report on the situation in Darfur in April, that there were no incidents of regular Government forces attacking either rebel groups or civilians, and that they had made no hostile use of aircraft. We understand that the Government have established a legal committee to study how it can co-operate with the ICC. We continue to press the Government, and all parties in Sudan, to address the problems within their own judicial system; to co-operate fully with the ICC; and to ensure that those responsible for crimes in Darfur are brought to justice.

 My right hon.

</p>


<p>
<a name="50525w10.html_para0">
This commitment is embodied in two proposed regulations. The first would enable the disbursal of &#8364;259 million aid for north Cyprus. The second would enable preferential direct trade between north Cyprus and the rest of the EU. The Government discusses these proposals regularly at senior official level with EU partners, the Commission and parties on the island, and the Foreign Secretary last discussed ending the isolation of the north with the Turkish Foreign Minister in March. The EU has yet to reach agreement on these regulations.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50525w10.html_para1">
The Government believe that direct trade will reduce the economic disparity between the north and south of the island and will help the Turkish Cypriots to raise standards towards EU norms. Narrowing the economic divide between the north and south will remove a major obstacle to a future settlement to the Cyprus problem. We therefore call upon all EU partners and the Commission to co-operate to find a way to fulfil the EU&#039;s commitment to end the isolation of the Turkish Cypriots.

<p><a name="50525w11.html_wqn2"><b> Mr. Hayes: </b> 
 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs if she will make a statement on the Government&#039;s policy on the accession of the EU to the Hague Conference on International Private Law. [448]</p>




<p><a name="50525w11.html_spnew2"><b> Harriet Harman: </b> 
 The Government supports the application by the European Community to become a full member of the Hague Conference on Private International Law. This reflects the increasing amount of Community law in this field and the need to ensure that the Community continues to play a full and constructive role in the work of the Conference. The United Kingdom&#039;s support for this application is consistent with our support for the Conference and the valuable work which it undertakes. There have already been encouraging negotiations on this matter in the Hague; these will be resumed at a further meeting in June at which the Government hopes that they will be successfully concluded.

<p><a name="50525w11.html_wqn3"><b> Mr. Allen: </b> 
 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs if she will take steps to ensure that hon. Members can receive an electronic copy of the marked electoral register for their constituency.  [531]</p>




<p><a name="50525w11.html_spnew3"><b> Harriet Harman: </b> 
 Access to the marked electoral registers is the responsibility of the Clerk of the Crown. The marked register which is made available for inspection or copying is the paper copy of the register kept at the polling station, and marked by polling station staff. No electronic copies are compiled, and we have no current plans to provide for it. Paper copies may be purchased, as has been the case in previous elections.

<p><a name="50525w11.html_wqn4"><b> Mr. Prentice: </b> 
 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs if she will bring forward legislative proposals to make it an offence for candidates for parliamentary elections to use children in their election addresses where the children are shown wearing uniforms of schools they do not attend and where the school in question has not given permission. [654]</p>




<p><a name="50525w11.html_spnew4"><b> Harriet Harman: </b> 
 The Government have no plans to introduce legislation covering these specific circumstances. Section 91 of the Representation of the People Act 1983, currently provides that material used in election addresses should relate to the election only. The Government believe that the Representation of the People Act 1983, along with the existing laws governing publications and copyright already cover possible complaints about the contents of election addresses. As a matter of principle, the Government do not believe that it would be appropriate to prescribe too closely what candidates may or may not include in their election communications.

Includes adjustments for (1) those whose intended length of stay changes so that their migrant status changes; (2) asylum seekers and their dependants not identified by the IPS; and (3) flows between the UK and the Republic of Ireland.<br>

Note:<br>

A small weighting adjustment has been applied to IPS data for 1991 to 1998. This reflects the estimated effect of applying the weighting improvements made to IPS data from 1999 onwards.<br>

 The Government provides financial assistance for a range of town/city centre regeneration initiatives, and this forms a key part of the work of English Partnerships, the Government&#039;s national regeneration agency, in pursuance of the Sustainable 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>25 May 2005 : Column 154W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
Communities Plan. English Partnerships is committed to the provision of mixed-use development rather than single use: the need for facilities, including retail, to support sustainable communities is recognised and retail provision is factored into many of its projects, including at the local level. The extent of funding availability from English Partnerships will depend on specific local circumstances and whether a particular project accords with English Partnerships&#039; corporate priorities.

<a name="50525w14.html_para6">
The redevelopment of derelict retail precincts would in general terms be eligible for support from the Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) Single Programme (including Single Regeneration Budget). The appropriate regional development agency should be approached in the first instance: again, funding availability will depend on specific circumstances and the fit with RDA priorities.

The Government also supports the introduction of Business Improvement Districts (BIDs) to assist the delivery of high-quality town centre regeneration and enhance existing business environments, although this is not through large-scale capital funding. Government funding, together with assistance from private sector partners, has been provided through the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister for the BIDs pilot research project, which looked to test the BIDs concepts in a number of locations around the UK. BIDs do not relate solely to retail centres, but many town and local centres do include a large retail element.

<p><a name="50525w15.html_spmin1"><b>The Prime Minister:</b> 
 The Government have a wide ranging strategy to tackle antisocial behaviour, In order to help address the issue of antisocial neighbours, the Anti-Social Behaviour Unit at the Home Office has set up a National Nuisance Neighbour Expert Panel made up of experts from the police, local authority, social services, youth offending teams and the voluntary sector. The panel has heard over 120 cases. Feedback received indicates that in 66 per cent. of cases behaviour had improved and the problems curtailed as a result of the panel&#039;s intervention.

<p>
<a name="50525w15.html_para0">
We have already seen significant successes in dealing with antisocial behaviour, as confirmed by the fall in the number of people who perceive it to be a significant problem (as reported by the British Crime Survey). During this Parliament, we will step up the work of the Anti-Social Behaviour Unit, driving through cultural change in local communities especially in deprived areas. This will be a Government-wide programme, with the active support of a number of Government Departments.
