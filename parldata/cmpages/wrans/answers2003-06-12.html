12. <a name="30612w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Dalyell: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will estimate the cost of maintaining a military presence in the Persian Gulf in the last three months.  [118671]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It would be premature to make such an estimate but we expect the costs of the military campaign to be covered by the &#163;3 billion reserve announced by the Chancellor in the Budget.

<P>
14. <a name="30612w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Redwood: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what his current assessment is of growth prospects in <i>(a)</i> the UK and <i>(b)</i> the euro area.  [118673]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The Government published their latest forecasts for the UK economy in the Budget on April 9. We forecast:
<P>

 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what discussions he has had since the Budget with representatives of manufacturing industry regarding competitiveness.  [118674]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Treasury Ministers meet regularly with manufacturing representatives to discuss a wide range of issues and this Government has introduced a series of measures to promote business efficiency, investment and competitiveness.

16. Keith Vaz: To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the Inland Revenue's action relating to the former employees of BCCI.  [118675]

<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w01.html_spnew3"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 I understand that Revenue officials are continuing to provide guidance on the tax aspects of the proposed BCCI settlement, and I hope it will prove possible to finalise the tax position of ex-employees in the near future.

<P>
18. <a name="30612w01.html_wqn4"><B> David Cairns: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what progress the UK is making on the target ratio of aid to national income.  [118677]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w01.html_spnew5"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The Government remain fully committed to reaching the UN target of an official development assistance to Gross National Income ratio (ODA/GNI ratio) of 0.7 per cent. In the 2002 Spending Review the Government made substantial increases to the aid budget. The UK's level of official development assistance will be increased to 0.33 per cent. by 2003&#150;04, up from 0.26 per cent. in 1997, and will reach 0.40 per cent. of GNI by 2005&#150;06. This is the largest ever increase in UK aid and represents a 93 per cent. real terms increase since 1997.
<P>

<a name="30612w01.html_para0">Aid effectiveness is also important as well as aid volumes. We are committed to redirecting the development assistance budget to the poorest countries, particularly those with effective governments pursuing high growth and pro-poor economic and social policies. In addition, the Government have untied all their aid as from 1 April 2001.

<a name="30612w01.html_sbhd6"><H3 align=center>Bank of England</H3>


<P>
20. <a name="30612w01.html_wqn5"><B> Sir Teddy Taylor: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what difference has been recorded in the present value of the reserves in consequence of the instruction to the Bank of England to sell gold and to invest in particular currencies.  [118679]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w01.html_spnew6"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 The restructuring of the reserves portfolio announced in May 1999 was a long-term, prudent restructuring to reduce the risk of over-exposure to a single asset. As such it is inappropriate to measure gains or losses resulting from fluctuations in market values on a particular day or over a short-term period.
<P>

<a name="30612w01.html_para1">Once account is taken of all the elements of the restructuring programme, including earnings on foreign currency assets purchased from the proceeds of the sale, the annualised return on the assets invested in (from the sales of gold to the end of May 2003) was approximately 9 per cent. per annum in US dollar terms.

<a name="30612w01.html_sbhd7"><H3 align=center>Debt Relief</H3>


<P>
21. <a name="30612w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Love: </B> 
 To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what proposals he has for further debt relief to be agreed by the G8 group of countries.  [118680]

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer (1) what plans there are for further co-operative working between the Customs and Excise departments of the UK and Eire;  [118538]
<P>
<UL>(2) what meetings have taken place in the last two years between the Customs and Excise Service of the Republic of Ireland and the UK Customs and Excise concerning co-operative working to tackle <i>(a)</i> drugs smuggling, <i>(b)</i> cigarette smuggling, <i>(c)</i> oil smuggling and <i>(d)</i> illegal immigration.  [118539]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w01.html_spnew11"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 Customs work closely with the Republic of Ireland (as well as other member states) on a number of issues and meet with them regularly, both bilaterally and as part of larger meetings.
<P>

<a name="30612w01.html_para5">These meetings take place at both the high level to discuss strategic plans for future working and also at operational levels to discuss specific cases. There is consequently a regular flow of information between UK Customs and Excise and their Republic of Ireland counterparts in relation to suspect drug consignments and cash related movements, cigarette smuggling and oils smuggling.

 Customs has prime responsibility for controls on the movement of goods into and out of the United Kingdom, including the detection of terrorist material. A significant part of the &#163;330 million announced by the Chancellor in the Budget for counter-terrorism purposes will be used to equip Customs with new technology and staff measures to assist their detection effort.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w01.html_spnew14"><B> John Healey: </B> 
 There is not, and never has been, a South East Region Enforcement Team in Customs and Excise.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what percentage of the working hours of the local Pembroke Customs team have been spent <i>(a)</i> in and <i>(b)</i> outside their home areas during the past two years.  [118530]<P>
<P>
<P>

 Customs will maintain the current intelligence resource levels, but will deploy them differently to combat the changing nature of criminality in Wales. They will work more closely with partner law enforcement agencies to focus on the threats posed whether they are drugs, other illegal goods or terrorism. In particular, they are joining with South Wales, Gwent and Dyfed Powys police forces to form a new Joint Intelligence Cell in Bridgend.

<a name="30612w02.html_para1">Moreover, under Customs' plans there will be an overall increase in the deployment of mobile teams to Wales, from a contingent of 100 officers based in Wales and the West Midlands, supported by the National Strike Force. This capability to deploy larger numbers of officers on unpredictable targeted operations will provide a real deterrence to professional smugglers and bootleggers.

 The European Commission has recently published proposals to amend the provisions of the Sixth VAT Directive concerning the VAT arrangements applicable to postal services. Postal services provided by the universal service provider, Royal Mail, are currently exempt from VAT, and the Government believe that the vital social role played by the universal postal service should continue to be reflected in the tax system. The Government are therefore opposed to VAT on stamps, and will make this clear in negotiations on the proposals. Amendments to the Sixth VAT Directive must be agreed unanimously by member states.

 In our 2000 White Paper&#151;"Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor"&#151;the Government made a commitment to strengthen the voice of developing countries in the international system. We are actively pursuing this agenda in three broad ways both at the IMF and World Bank.
<P>

<a name="30612w03.html_para0">Firstly, strengthening developing country offices in the IMF and World Bank. Many of these offices suffer from a lack of capacity, combined with a heavy workload. That is why, earlier this year, we pushed for the provision of extra staff to the Sub-Saharan African offices. This was subsequently agreed at both the Fund and Bank. We also support the provision of more training opportunities, improved links between Washington-based delegations and their Capitals and the creation of a Fund that these offices can draw on to finance analysis.
<P>

<a name="30612w03.html_para1">Secondly, we actively encourage the two institutions to recognise their own role in strengthening the representation of developing countries, for example through increased staff diversity.
<P>

<a name="30612w03.html_para2">Thirdly, increasing developing country representation and voting rights on the Executive Board. The UK believes that the issues of developing country representation on the Executive Board&#151;particularly for Africa&#151;and increasing the basic vote, both merit serious consideration.
<P>

<a name="30612w03.html_para3">All of these issues are being discussed at both the IMF and World Bank and the UK will continue to push for early and substantive progress.

pillar of our efforts to increase their effectiveness has been to encourage greater developing country ownership of policy reforms and decisions.
<P>

<a name="30612w03.html_para4">Experience suggests that when countries 'own' their policies, they are more likely to implement them. That is why both IMF and World Bank resources are increasingly being used in support of country-led strategies, such as the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers.
<P>

<a name="30612w03.html_para5">This ownership agenda also extends to the institutions themselves. In our 2000 White Paper&#151;"Eliminating World Poverty: Making Globalisation Work for the Poor"&#151;the Government made a commitment to strengthen the voice of developing countries in the international system. The need to address this problem was subsequently endorsed by all UN member states at the International Conference on Financing for Development in March 2002.
<P>

<a name="30612w03.html_para6">Since then the IMF and World Bank have been actively progressing this agenda, most recently at their spring meetings in April. The UK has strongly supported this work and will continue to push for early and substantive progress.

 The UK was influential in getting agreement, at the 1999 Annual Meetings of the World bank and IMF, to the consultation process on the design of the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative being widened to include developing countries. In order to ensure developing country involvement in discussions about the delivery of debt relief, we and other donor countries are co-financing the HIPC Ministerial Network, as part of the HIPC Capacity Building Project. This network, which held its first meeting in Copenhagen in November 1999, brings together, once or twice a year, Finance Ministers and senior officials from all of the HIPC countries to discuss issues relating to the design and implementation of the HIPC Initiative. These meetings help to inform our own views on debt issues. The Commonwealth HIPC Forum also provides an important platform for Ministers from HIPC countries to discuss matters of mutual interest, and has stimulated wider debate within the Commonwealth, as well as within the International Financial Institutions themselves. The UK also contributed to the recent review of the HIPC Initiative by the Operations Evaluations Department (OED) of the World Bank, and funded two meetings between the evaluators and HIPC representatives, to allow HIPC countries to feed in their views. The OED report has now been published.

<a name="30612w05.html_para0">Defra's Energy Crops Scheme provides grants to establish crops for any valid heat, combined heat and power and electricity generation end use. Grants of &#163;280,000 have been made to plant 280 hectares of short rotation coppice (SRC) under the Energy Crops Scheme. 1,157 hectares of SRC had previously been planted under the Forestry Commission's Woodland Grant Scheme at a cost of approximately &#163;1 million.
<P>

<a name="30612w05.html_para1">Funding for the capital cost of the Arbre demonstration project has come from the European Commission and the project partners, with support for the establishment of energy crops coming from the Forestry Commission and Defra.
<P>

<a name="30612w05.html_para2">DTI have not received a request for assistance from the purchasers of the Arbre plant, but have agreed to consider any proposals to minimise the technology risk of taking the plant to full operation. Any support would be from our research and development programme.
<P>

<a name="30612w05.html_para3">In terms of the farmers with contracts to supply the Arbre project, that is essentially a commercial undertaking between the farmers and the owners of the plant. No compensation would be paid from the schemes mentioned.
<P>

<a name="30612w05.html_para4">Defra's Energy Crops Scheme provides a one-off payment when the crop is established. It is a condition of the grant that the crop is used to produce energy. Arbre growers are setting up a producer group to harvest and market their energy crops with assistance from the Energy Crops Scheme and Objective 1 funding. The scheme does not restrict growers to supplying the Arbre plant and they can seek alternative markets.
<P>

<a name="30612w05.html_para5">Whether the crops come from the Vale of York is a matter for the owners of the Arbre plant as they decide on a route to commercial operation of the plant.

 The bulk of British Energy's (BE) reported loss is made up of asset write-downs. These are based on expected future cash flows of the business, as reflected in the company's restructuring plan, and consequently have already been taken into consideration when considering the on-going viability of the business.
<P>

<a name="30612w05.html_para7">On 9 September 2002 the Government agreed to provide BE with a credit facility for up to &#163;410 million in respect of its working capital requirements and cash collateral for trading in the UK and North America. On 26 September 2002 the Government agreed to extend the facility and increase it from &#163;410 million up to &#163;650 million. My right hon. Friend, the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry informed the House on 7 March 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 89WS that BE had repaid to Government all outstanding amounts under the facility. On a contingency basis the facility has been extended at a reduced level of &#163;200 million to the earlier of 30 September 2004 or the date on which the company's restructuring plan becomes effective. As part of BE's restructuring, the Government plan to meet the cost of BE's historic nuclear fuel liabilities. This will include a payment of &#163;175 million in financial year 2004&#150;05 in line with the Secretary of State's statement of 28 November.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>An on-going 1 per cent. per annum reduction in greenhouse gas emissions from buildings, expressed in terms of carbon savings. New energy targets are now being developed on an assessment of the Estate's performance against national standards. Using this information, we will set new targets for reducing our energy consumption. These targets will be central to the energy section of the Framework and will be put in place during 2003.

Minimum of 10 per cent. of green energy is purchased by March 2008
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="30612w05.html_para11">To help meet this target, DTI undertook an estate-wide energy audit to identify areas where further savings could be made. This resulted in the enhancement of a DTI Building Energy Management System and the installation of Inverter Variable Speed Drives.
<P>

<a name="30612w05.html_para12">Other measures which contribute to this target include; ISO 14001 certified Environmental Management Systems across the DTI HQ estate; 33 per cent. of electricity in the DTI HQ estate is purchased from renewable sources; promoting environmental and energy awareness to DTI staff through 'Green Teams' who disseminate green and energy issues to their colleagues; a number of specific measures such as installation of solar film for windows.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry pursuant to her answer to the hon.

[118259]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w06.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Hewitt: </B> 
 Mislabelling can already be prosecuted: it is an offence under the Trade Descriptions Act of 1968 to apply, by any means, false or misleading statements to goods including about their composition. However, the Trade Descriptions Act is difficult to enforce in the case of made-up goods containing fur until we can ensure a robust testing method for such products.
<P>

<a name="30612w06.html_para7">We are working with other governments and scientific advisers to develop such an enforcement mechanism as soon as possible. The Laboratory of the Government Chemist (LGC Ltd.) have provided advice detailing why DNA testing of these products is both difficult and, as yet, unreliable (copies of this advice are available in the Libraries of the House). However, we have identified an alternative testing method (based on mass spectrometry) that may be more reliable and are working to determine whether this is the case.

 The department does not provide financial support to animal sanctuaries. However, a considerable number of animal sanctuaries are registered charities.

In addition, tax relief is available on gifts to charity of listed shares and securities, land and buildings.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what the basis was for her policy on invoking the Hague Preference, in the current year, to the UK's benefit in fish stocks; what stocks qualified for the Hague Preference but were not invoked; and who the beneficiaries and losers were in each case as a result of her policy.  [116966]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w09.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The policy was, as usual, to invoke Hague Preference on stocks where the UK's quota allocation would otherwise fall below the trigger level. This involves, in particular, invoking to counteract the effect of Irish invocations of Hague Preference on the UK's allocation. However, we do refrain from invoking in some cases where stocks are seriously depleted, as in these cases the operation of Hague Preference would transfer a very high proportion of other member states' allocations to the UK. This is the approach that we judge to be, overall, to the benefit of UK fishermen. For 2003 we did not invoke Hague Preference for any of the depleted North Sea stocks or for saithe in Area VI (where there was no Irish invocation).

 The report of the Review of Non-native Species Policy provided rough cost estimates for national control programmes for various invasive species, including invasive non-native plants, by way of illustration of the issue. For example, the report included estimates that a national Japanese knotweed eradication programme using current techniques would cost approximately &#163;1.56 billion. At this level of cost, national control programmes are unlikely to be feasible. This shows the importance of effective measures to prevent introductions. However, the Department is also contributing research into novel methods of control of Japanese knotweed, which may help reduce costs.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w10.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 As a result of the Thomsen European Court of Justice (ECJ) judgment, quota holders who are no longer in active milk production will, by 31 March 2004, have to sell their milk quota, resume production, or otherwise have their quota confiscated. We anticipate that the vast majority will either sell their quota or resume production. Where quota is confiscated, under the current UK legislation the quota holder has six years in which to resume production (and thus have the quota restored to him or her) before the quota is definitively taken into the national reserve of quota, and therefore potentially available for redistribution. Under the current CAP reform proposals, this period would be reduced to two years. We would propose to consult relevant trade organisations on the basis for redistributing quota confiscated as a result of the Thomsen ECJ case, if significant amounts of quota were confiscated, and thus potentially available for redistribution.

 In 1998, OSPAR agreed strategies on hazardous substances, eutrophication, radioactive substances, biodiversity, and assessment and monitoring. A strategy for offshore oil and gas was agreed the following year. These strategies set long term goals&#151;in some cases, looking a generation ahead (i.e. 2020).
<P>

<a name="30612w10.html_para4">The strategy with regard to hazardous substances sets the objective of preventing pollution of the maritime area by continuously reducing discharges, emissions and losses of hazardous substances, with the ultimate aim of achieving concentrations in the marine environment near background values for naturally occurring substances and close to zero for man-made synthetic substances. The UK has worked with other OSPAR contracting parties, including the European Commission, to update and prioritise a list of substances that cause concern for the marine environment and to identify the most appropriate additional action to achieve the objective.
<P>

<a name="30612w10.html_para5">The objective of the strategy to combat eutrophication is to seek to achieve and maintain a healthy marine environment where eutrophication does not occur by the year 2010. A key milestone to this is the assessment of the current eutrophication status of the various parts of the OSPAR maritime area. In this assessment the UK identified 16 marine areas of concern. These are being addressed by action under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive and the Nitrates Directive.

In July 2002, the Government published a strategy showing how the United Kingdom will contribute to the achievement of the 2020 target.
<P>

<a name="30612w10.html_para7">OSPAR's biodiversity strategy aims to protect and conserve ecosystems and marine biological diversity. Annex V was brought into force on 30 August 2000. Since then, the UK has prepared for the forthcoming meeting in Bremen by helping to develop a criteria for identifying threatened and declining species, developing guidelines on the identification and management of marine protected areas, developing guidance on the construction and operation of offshore wind farms, developing an agreement on sand and gravel extraction, and the development of proposed ecological quality objectives which will be piloted in the North sea.
<P>

<a name="30612w10.html_para8">The strategy for oil and gas addresses the effects of offshore activity through the setting of environmental goals and the establishment of management mechanisms to achieve them. Good progress has been made, in particular with controls on chemicals being agreed and an ambitious goal being set to reduce discharges of produced water. A goal of all operators having internationally recognised environmental management systems in place by the end of 2005 has also been developed and is expected to be adopted at the meeting later this month.

 The United Kingdom has an excellent record in fulfilling its Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) obligations on nuclear disarmament.

 The Government keep under appropriate review all options, including those relating to nuclear deterrence, consistent with their international legal obligations, for maintaining and enhancing national and international security. There are no current plans for any replacement of Trident and no decisions are yet needed. We stated in the New Chapter to the Strategic Defence Review, published last year (Cm 5566), that the United Kingdom's nuclear weapons have a continuing use as a means of deterring major strategic military threats, and they have a continuing role in guaranteeing the ultimate security of the UK. In line with the 1998 Strategic Defence Review, it is our policy to maintain a minimum capability to design and produce a successor to Trident should this prove necessary.

 None. School transport safety over and above the legal minimum is a matter for individual LEAs, consequently no national assessment has been made.

While children are, occasionally, required to evacuate home to school transport quickly, I am not aware of any problems that have arisen during that process. Nevertheless, schools and local education authorities should consider the benefits of carrying out regular evacuation drills in collaboration with bus operators, so that pupils know what to do in an emergency.

<a name="30612w12.html_para9">Expenditure by individual policy teams which is not processed through the publicity division system is not categorised in the same way, (although the same framework contracts are used), and therefore the information requested on document costs produced through them is not available.

We have a duty to consult on and inform our customers, stakeholders and interest groups of policy changes and developments.

 <i>[holding answer 9 June 2003]:</i> The Government's proposals for a new LEA funding system were first set out in the Local Authority Finance Green Paper of September 2000, and subsequently reconfirmed in last autumn's Schools White Paper and the Local Government White Paper. DfES and ODPM had extensive consultation with external partners throughout all of 2001 and most of 2002, with a three month consultation on a range of options carried out in July 2002. Building on the responses to the consultation, ODPM and DfES explored a large number of options for the distribution of Formula Grant and Education Formula Spending Shares between authorities before determining this year's settlement. In particular, we decided on a minimum like-for-like grant increase of 3.5 per cent. and a minimum like-for-like Education FSS increase of 3.2 per cent. per pupil to ensure that each education authority received a reasonable increase.
<P>

<a name="30612w13.html_para6">Our analysis of options included a detailed assessment of the implications for each LEA and therefore it's schools necessary passporting requirements.

It is for local education authorities or, where the budget for school meals is delegated to them, a school's governing body, to decide the ingredients and dishes that will be on offer at lunchtime.

<P>
<UL>The Solicitor-General <i>[holding answer 14 May 2003]:</i>
<P>
<i>The Crown Prosecution Service</i>
<P>
The Crown Prosecution Service is currently finalising its resource accounts for 2002&#150;03. The final outturn position will be known with certainty when the accounts have been completed and certified by the National Audit Office. Against the main control total, the departmental expenditure limit, the Crown Prosecution Service anticipates an underspend of &#163;2.5 million, which is half of one per cent. of the gross provision of &#163;484 million and provides evidence of the effective financial budgetary, planning and control systems in place in the Department. Spending plans for CPS Areas and CPS HQ are regularly reviewed during the year and remedial action taken where appropriate to ensure spending targets are met. Such reviews will continue in 2003&#150;04. On expenditure that is outside the departmental expenditure limit, there will be an underspend of around &#163;13 million in respect of the costs of depreciation of IT assets, which were transferred to the Department's public finance initiative partner, LogicaCMG plc, on 1 April 2002. Future estimates of depreciation costs reflect the transfer and such an underspend cannot recur in the future.
<P>
<i>Serious Fraud Office</i>
<P>
The Serious Fraud Office plans to fully utilise its resources available in 2003&#150;04. The Serious Fraud Office does not plan to underspend in any financial year but it is subject to short-term volatility in its resource consumption plans. The ability to make use of the End Year Flexibility scheme and carry resources forward to future years ensures that consumption can be managed efficiently and effectively to achieve value for money.
<P>
<i>HM Crown Prosecution Service Inspectorate</i>
<P>
HM Crown Prosecution Service's underspend for 2002&#150;03 is estimated to be &#163;87k, attributable to managed vacancies while revising inspection methodology. Recruitment is currently under way. The underspend will be reduced in the Financial Year 2003&#150;04 by recruiting additional staff, although it is still possible that there may be an underspend on the salaries budget because of the time taken to recruit.
<P>
<i>Treasury Solicitor's Department</i>
<P>
The Treasury Solicitor's Department had two main areas of underspend in 2002&#150;03, namely staff costs and capital expenditure. In the later months of 2002&#150;03, the Department was successful in recruiting staff as a result of a programme of continuous recruitment coupled with the overall position in the market for lawyers. This means that the Department is well placed to achieve the budgeted complement for 2003&#150;04. The Department's major capital projects are on course for completion in accordance with their individual project targets and significant increases in expenditure over the previous year's levels will be achieved in 2003&#150;04 as several major projects come on stream.
<P>
<i>Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers</i>
<P>
The total budget for the Legal Secretariat to the Law Officers for the financial year 2002&#150;03 was &#163;3.1 million. Although figures have not yet been finalised, it is not expected that there will be any significant underspend for that period.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w19.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was established in May 2002. From May 2002 to the end of March 2003 expenditure on training totalled &#163;3.2 million. There is no specific budget for the training of young people. In accordance with Government-wide resource accounting and budgeting guidelines, expenditure on training and other services is recorded on an accruals basis; there is therefore no record of expenditure on a cash basis.

<a name="30612w19.html_para1">The Government attaches great importance to the development of advocacy services as one of the means that enable the views of patients to be represented.
<P>

<a name="30612w19.html_para2">Our policies for improving services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers are set out in the White Paper "Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century" (Cm 5086) published in March 2001. The importance of advocacy is a theme running throughout the White Paper: effective advocacy services can make a real difference to the lives of people with learning disabilities and their families by helping them to put forward their views and play an active part in planning and designing services.
<P>

<a name="30612w19.html_para3">"Valuing People" announced the creation of two new funds, the Implementation Support Fund and the Learning Disability Development Fund, to provide central support for key aspects of the strategy. Money from the Implementation Support Fund is being used to support and develop self and citizen advocacy projects across the country. Two voluntary organisations, the British Institute of Learning Disabilities (BILD) and Values into Action (VIA) are running separate schemes to develop and fund citizen advocacy and self advocacy respectively on the Department of Health's behalf. Both organisations have steering groups to oversee the projects and to ensure fairness in the way the funds are allocated.
<P>

<a name="30612w19.html_para4">&#163;900,000 from the Implementation Support Fund was allocated to advocacy projects in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;1 million in 2002&#150;03; &#163;1 million is being allocated in 2003&#150;04. A further &#163;300,000 was allocated in 2001&#150;02 to administer the funding schemes and support development workers to work with and strengthen existing advocacy schemes and help set up new ones: this amount increased to &#163;400,000 in both 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04.

The learning disability task force, which has members drawn from both the self and citizen advocacy movements, will be involved in discussions about the detailed use of the Support Fund.

<a name="30612w19.html_para6">Mental health policies pay equal importance to the use of advocacy. The draft Mental Health Bill, published on 25 June 2002, provides for the first time that specialist mental health advocacy must be available for all patients being treated under compulsory powers and their nominated persons. This new duty ensures that patients can have the help of specialist advocacy when it is most needed. There are also proposals in the draft Bill for safeguards, including access to advocacy,

 The introduction of congestion charging in the centre of London provides additional opportunities to identify vehicles with cloned number plates and for the Metropolitan police to take action against them. The Metropolitan police are currently considering how they can get the best crime reduction return from the investment of police resources in this work. But existing procedures already provide for cloned registration numbers to be entered on the Police National Computer and on the databases used by police Automatic Number Plate Reader operations. This increases the likelihood of cloned vehicles coming to police attention and appropriate action being taken.

<a name="30612w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Bob Ainsworth: </B> 
 Methadone is the preferred clinical option in the treatment of opioid dependency and is supported by strong international evidence base.
<P>

<a name="30612w21.html_para0">There is a growing body of evidence for the efficacy of buprenorphine (Subutex) in the treatment of opioid dependence. The level of evidence does not suggest that buprenorphine should replace methadone as a substitution treatment, but rather that buprenorphine should now be considered an evidence-based addition to the range of pharmacological maintenance treatments. Much of the emerging evidence derives from other European countries and the evidence for efficacy of this treatment in Britain is very limited and based on very few studies.

A proportion of passports are reported lost or stolen at British Diplomatic posts abroad. This coupled with the fact that the UK Passport Service does not routinely receive notification of passports recovered by other authorities, makes it extremely difficult to make a reasonable estimate as to the number of such passports in circulation within the United Kingdom.

 The provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill which reform the sentencing framework will make it possible to ensure that the most serious violent, sexual and persistent offenders spend longer in prison while allowing other offenders to be dealt with by means of tougher and more effective community sentences. In addition, custody plus and custody minus will provide an option for those offenders whose offences are serious enough to justify custody, but where the concentration of rehabilitative work occurs in the community. The projected net effect on the prison population of the implementation of the provisions to reform the sentencing framework, is an increase of about 1,000 in the prison population by 2009. The impact is estimated to be about 500 once all the changes have been implemented and sufficient time has passed for their full effects to be seen.
<P>

<a name="30612w21.html_para7">The firearms offences provisions in the Bill will provide for a mandatory minimum custodial sentence for unauthorised possession of a prohibited firearm. The estimated effect on the prison population of the implementation of these provisions, and the implementation of the provision providing for increase in penalties for certain driving-related offences causing death, is an increase of about 500 in the prison population.
<P>

<a name="30612w21.html_para8">The effect of life sentence provisions in the Bill will provide for the determination of minimum term in relation to mandatory life sentence. It is assumed that the effect of these provisions on the prison population will not be felt for a decade. In around 20 years time, the projected effect on the prison population is estimated to be an increase of about 1,000 in the prison population. In around 30 to 60 years time, once all the changes have been implemented and when sufficient time has passed for the full effect to be seen, the impact is estimated to be in the order of 1,200.
<P>

<a name="30612w21.html_para9">The restriction on bail for drug users provision will be piloted in selected court areas. The provision aims to reduce re-offending by encouraging drug-misusing offenders into effective drug treatment programmes where appropriate. Part of the pilot evaluation will focus on the likely impacts of the provision on prison population if it were to be extended more widely. A study is planned to assess the likely effect on the prison population of the provisions introducing a presumption against the grant of bail to defendants who have failed to surrender. The measure is intended to deter offenders from abusing bail.
<P>

<a name="30612w21.html_para10">The Government is providing additional capacity. Spending Review 2000 and the 2003 budget provided funds for 2,820 additional prison places to be built at existing prisons. Two new prisons will also be opened at Ashford and Peterborough.

 The Government's strategy recognises the importance of intelligence and joint operations in source and transit countries.

 Social services have a duty under the Children Act 1989 to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need by providing a range and level of services appropriate to those children's needs or, where appropriate, by arranging for the provision of services from other agencies. Child victims of trafficking are referred to social services to receive assistance and support based on their particular needs. They may arrive in this country as unaccompanied minors seeking asylum, or accompanied by an adult. In the latter case, if anyone who comes into contact with the child is concerned that the child is the victim of abuse or neglect, they should refer the child to the relevant local authority's social services department. Unaccompanied minors seeking asylum will also be referred to social services. This care will be determined by a needs assessment according to the Framework for the Assessment of Children in Need and their Families. Child victims of trafficking are likely to be in need of welfare services and&#151;in many cases&#151;protection under the Children Act 1989.
<P>

<a name="30612w22.html_para4">Where there is a risk to the life of a child or a likelihood of serious harm, an agency with statutory child protection powers, for example, the police or councils with social services responsibilities, will act quickly to secure the immediate initial safety of the child. In some cases, it may be necessary to ensure that the child remains in, or is removed to, a safe place. Under section 20 of the Children Act 1989 a local authority may provide accommodation for any child within their area if they consider that to do so would safeguard or promote the child's welfare. This may involve placing the child in a foster placement or it may place the child in a children's home.
<P>

<a name="30612w22.html_para5">There are only very limited circumstances in which it is an option to hold a young person in secure accommodation. The Children Act 1989 permits that children may only be held in secure conditions if they satisfy certain specific grounds such as a likelihood of absconding together with a likelihood that injury would be caused to the young person themselves or others. This requires the approval of the courts.

<P>
<a name="30612w23.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Smith: </B> 
 The Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in pursuing its vision of "a confident, creative, informed and prosperous society" is committed both to promoting a greater respect and understanding of the richness of our cultural and linguistic diversity and to celebrating this diversity. In progressing this objective the Department supported Diversity 21 as a means of examining cultural diversity with a view to promoting deeper understanding and to represent this diversity as a sign of strength in our society. Diversity 21 provided the means of promoting cultural diversity work already happening; identifying and delivery of new projects aimed at stimulating the imagination and exploring diversity in an open, creative and accessible way; and providing a cultural diversity grant funding scheme. In this way the Department supported a schedule of exhibitions on language, faith and history in Northern Ireland and the wider Commonwealth, to a number of organisations and community groups throughout the Province; a programme of workshops on the different drums of Northern Ireland and various projects aimed at progressing the cultural diversity agenda. In addition the Department under the Diversity 21 funding programme supported a range of community based projects.
<P>

<a name="30612w23.html_para0">Since the suspension of the Assembly the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure has fulfilled its commitments within the Diversity 21 programme and funding scheme. In the interests of ensuring the optimum approach to cultural diversity within the DCAL remit, the Department has also evaluated the Diversity 21 Programme and is currently considering a policy framework which will enable it to take forward the cultural diversity agenda in a structured and comprehensive way.

 The Department expects all emergency patients, including children, to be taken in an emergency to the nearest appropriate hospital able to receive emergency admissions. Which hospital is most appropriate depends on the clinical condition of the patient. In some cases this will be the nearest hospital.

 The Government attaches great importance to the development of advocacy services as one of the means that enable the views of patients to be represented.
<P>

<a name="30612w24.html_para0">Our policies for improving services for people with learning disabilities, their families and carers are set out in the White Paper "Valuing People: A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century" (Cm 5086) published in March 2001. The importance of advocacy is a theme running throughout the White Paper: effective advocacy services can make a real difference to the lives of people with learning disabilities and their families by helping them to put forward their views and play an active part in planning and designing services.
<P>

<a name="30612w24.html_para1">"Valuing People" announced the creation of two new funds, the Implementation Support Fund and the Learning Disability Development Fund, to provide central support for key aspects of the strategy. Money from the Implementation Support Fund is being used to support and develop self and citizen advocacy projects across the country. Two voluntary organisations, the British Institute of Learning Disabilities (BILD) and Values into Action (VIA) are running separate schemes to develop and fund citizen advocacy and self advocacy respectively on the Department of Health's behalf. Both organisations have steering groups to oversee the projects and to ensure fairness in the way the funds are allocated.
<P>

<a name="30612w24.html_para2">&#163;900,000 from the Implementation Support Fund was allocated to advocacy projects in 2001&#150;02 and &#163;1 million in 2002&#150;03; &#163;1 million is being allocated in 2003&#150;04. A further &#163;300,000 was allocated in 2001&#150;02 to administer the funding schemes and support development workers to work with and strengthen existing advocacy schemes and help set up new ones: this amount increased to &#163;400,000 in both 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04.
<P>

<a name="30612w24.html_para3">We announced in our report on learning disability, "Making Change Happen" (HC514&#150;11), published in April 2003, that the Implementation Support Fund would continue until March 2006. The fund will support the same areas of work as at present. The learning disability task force, which has members drawn from both the self and citizen advocacy movements, will be involved in discussions about the detailed use of the Support Fund.
<P>

<a name="30612w24.html_para4">Mental health policies pay equal importance to the use of advocacy. The draft Mental Health Bill, published on 25 June 2002, provides for the first time that specialist mental health advocacy must be available for all patients being treated under compulsory powers and their nominated persons. This new duty ensures that patients can have the help of specialist advocacy when it is most needed. There are also proposals in the draft Bill for safeguards, including access to advocacy,

 Standard One of the older people's national service framework (NSF) sets out the commitment to address age discrimination in access to health and social care. Since its publication in March 2001 significant progress has been made in starting to tackle age discrimination:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>There is a now a wider appreciation and awareness across health and social care of age discrimination as an issue.
<P>
<BR>
National health service organisations have checked their written polices to ensure they have no age bias. Only a very small number have been found that discriminated against older people. In these cases, procedures are being reviewed.
<P>
<BR>
Our monitoring through strategic health authorities at October 2002 indicates that, 91 per cent. of areas had strategic and operational plans to address identified age discrimination.
<P>
<BR>
Councils and care trusts have received guidance to make sure everyone has fair access to services&#151;regardless of age.
<P>
<BR>
In November last year we released a computerised information tool to enable those implementing the NSF at local level to compare their treatment rates in 10 different hospital procedures, in relation to different age groups.
<P>
<BR>
We supported the development of a practice guide published in February 2002 by the King's Fund, "Auditing Age Discrimination&#151;a practical approach to promoting equality in health and social care".
<P>
<BR>
A reflection of this new attitude, coupled with some of the wider Departmental initiatives, can be seen in hospitals' greater action in providing surgery for older patients:
<P>
<BR>
 between 2000 and 2002, for example, breast cancer surgery for patients 85 and over rose by 13 per cent. and while coronary artery bypass grafts increased by 16 per cent. for those 65 or over, while the increase was 32 per cent. among patients 75 or over and 65 per cent. in the 85 plus age group.</FONT></UL>

<P>

<a name="30612w24.html_para5">Detailed, comprehensive information on representations of age discrimination made by organisations and individuals to the NHS are not collated centrally. The Department at a national level and local NHS organisations are continuing to work closely with older people and their representative bodies to identify individual and specific areas of concern and take action to address them.

 The Medical Research Council Institute of Hearing Research estimates that there are now approximately 7.5 million people in England who are deaf or hearing impaired. Most of these people acquire their hearing impairment. It is estimated that 55.1 per cent. of people aged over 60 are deaf or hearing impaired compared, to 6.7 per cent. of the under 60s. The Royal National Institute for Deaf People estimates that 1.8 per cent. of young adults under 30 have a hearing impairment.

<P>
<a name="30612w25.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 16 May 2003]:</i> The Government's Civil Contingencies Capabilities Programme has identified broad areas of activity under which Departments group specific projects, activity and programme expenditure. The purpose is to deliver broad generic capabilities which allow the United Kingdom to respond effectively to a wide range of disruptive challenges.
<P>

<a name="30612w25.html_para4">In 2002&#150;03 the Department of Health allocated some &#163;85 million to strengthen national and regional resilience to ensure that the national health service is prepared and equipped to meet the demands of chemical, biological, nuclear and radiological threats to the public. This figure is &#163;69 million over and above the &#163;16 million spent in 2001&#150;02. Through this funding, medical countermeasures, including vaccines, antibiotics, antidotes and respiratory support equipment, and personal protective equipment are now in place in the NHS. Although it is not possible to apportion specific expenditure to each area, this funding has served to strengthen overall capability and resilience to threats to essential services, the treatment of mass casualties and the treatment of infectious disease. For 2003&#150;04, the Department of Health has allocated &#163;98.5 million to this on-going programme of work, which is &#163;82.5 million over and above the &#163;16 million spent in 2001&#150;02.
<P>

<a name="30612w25.html_para5">The capabilities that we are working to deliver have been developed to allow the Government to deal with the fullest range of scenarios. Should a specific additional urgent operational need arise, at any point of the spending cycle, action would be taken to meet it. The public expenditure framework the Government have put in place provides the flexibility to deal with unexpected pressures.

 In England, primary care trusts are responsible for oral health promotion and currently they attach particular importance to ensuring that oral health is covered in initiatives such as Sure Start, health action zones and healthy living centres. In August 2001, to complement this work, we launched our Brushing for Life scheme, which targets families with young children in the 31 areas where dental decay is highest. There are currently 32 schemes running nationally. When carrying out developmental checks, health visitors demonstrate good tooth brushing practice and give the families a free pack containing a tube of fluoridated toothpaste, a toothbrush and a leaflet on oral hygiene.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the recommended period is after which patients should be recalled for a dental check-up for <i>(a)</i> people under 18 and <i>(b)</i> people over 18; and what proportion of the population attended such a check-up on time in (i) England, (ii) each NHS region and (iii) each strategic health authority in each of the last six years.  [116946]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 While it is accepted that oral examinations at appropriate intervals are of value in maintaining oral health, there is little direct evidence to support a specific interval or to quantify the benefit. There is, therefore, a requirement for the practitioner to undertake a needs assessment exercise for each individual patient. Individual recall intervals result from a balanced consideration of the risks to maintaining oral health. General dental services remuneration arrangements do not normally permit payment for a recall examination where the same dentist received an examination fee in the previous five complete calendar months.
<P>

<a name="30612w25.html_para6">The National Institute for Clinical Excellence has been asked to prepare guidance for the national health service in England and Wales, on the clinical and cost effectiveness of a dental recall examination for all patients at an interval based on the risk from oral disease.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30612w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lammy: </B> 
 In 1999, the Department of Health asked the Royal College of Physicians to lead a multidisciplinary working party to devise new clinical guidelines for the use of domiciliary oxygen. Although the working party's terms of reference precluded making specific recommendations about alterations in service provision, a number of the guidelines had implications for the content of the existing domiciliary oxygen service and for the way in which the service is delivered. It was clear, therefore, that this vital resource&#151;that has seen only one significant change, the introduction of oxygen concentrators, in the past 50 years&#151;had become out of date, both in terms of the service offered to patients and its cost effectiveness. It was against this background that the then Under-Secretary of State, my noble Friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath directed that a review of the domiciliary oxygen service should take place.
<P>

<a name="30612w26.html_para0">This review is now complete and we are ready to move forward to create a modernised and integrated service for the provision of domiciliary oxygen.
<P>

<a name="30612w26.html_para1">At present, domiciliary oxygen is ordered for patients by general practitioners. The service consists principally of the provision of oxygen either from large cylinders supplied by community pharmacies, or delivered by way of an oxygen concentrator, installed in the patient's home by a contractor.
<P>

<a name="30612w26.html_para2">The modern, integrated service that is proposed represents a considerable advance on this organisational and service model.
<P>

<a name="30612w26.html_para3">The new model will transfer responsibility for ordering oxygen for long-term oxygen therapy from general practitioners to specialist consultants in hospital. This will relieve general practitioners of the bureaucratic burden of writing prescriptions, effectively on doctors. (Patients who need long-term oxygen will invariably have their needs assessed by hospital staff). The hospital consultant will decide, in discussion with the patient, what the patient's needs for oxygen are. For 



<P>
<P><I>12 Jun 2003 : Column 1076W</I><P>
example, many patients would benefit from having oxygen available in a form that allows then greater freedom of movement both in and outside the home than is possible with large cylinders or oxygen concentrators. General practitioners will continue to be able to prescribe oxygen for patients who need small amounts of oxygen.
<P>

<a name="30612w26.html_para4">Once the hospital consultant or general practitioner has discussed and determined the patient's need for oxygen, it will be the responsibility of contractors to work closely with the patient and decide what technology, that is what type and method of oxygen supply, will best suit the patient's therapeutic need, and to provide it. These specialist contractors will be well placed to keep pace with developments in the technical aspects of service delivery, so patients will benefit from advances in technology as they are developed.
<P>

<a name="30612w26.html_para5">Thus, the modernised integrated service represents a sensible division of responsibility in the provision of domiciliary oxygen services. It places clinical responsibility for assessing oxygen need with doctors, and places technical decisions on the best and most up to date method of delivery with service contractors. Over the next few months a specification for the provision of the integrated service will be drawn up. Contractors will be invited to tender against this specification and fully operational early in 2005. The current arrangements for the provision of domiciliary oxygen will continue as at present to cover this transitional period.

 Entitlement to free national health service hospital treatment is based on residence in the United Kingdom: anyone deemed "ordinarily resident" in the UK should not be charged for their treatment, other than statutory charges, such as those for NHS prescriptions. The National Health Service (Charges to Overseas Visitors) Regulations 1989 set out the circumstances in which those not ordinarily resident should be charged for their treatment. It is for individual NHS trusts to apply the Regulations and establish whether a patient is eligible for free treatment.

 <i>[holding answer 3 June 2003]:</i> Professional indemnity should ensure that patients who have suffered harm receive the compensation to which they are entitled. Indemnity cover should be occurrence based, that is claims are met that arise from events when the clinician was covered but only come to light later, even if this is after the period of cover has ceased. Experience in the United Kingdom is that proper indemnity cover can be provided through membership of a defence society or a suitable insurance policy.

 The Department of Health has conducted a number of pieces of research relating to the question.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The national programme on forensic mental health research and development was established in April 1999 and built on the work of the research and development programme set up as part of the High Security Psychiatric Services Commissioning Board (first established in September 1996). The programme supports the evidence base for the provision of services for mentally disordered offenders by commissioning research and developing research capacity.
<P>
<BR>
Response from the forensic mental health (FMH) project on 'Aspects of Suicide among mentally disordered offenders' project.
<P>
<BR>
The National Research Register (www.update-software.com/nrr/) has 30 on-going projects listed on suicide and just over 200 recently completed projects.
<P>
<BR>
Some European studies on suicide.
<P>
<BR>
The Department has also recently commissioned a research project that will examine coroners' records for details of around 570 cases of suicide involving hanging (the most common method of suicide for men in England), firearms or self-poisoning. The study is being undertaken on a collaborative basis by researchers at the Universities of Oxford, Bristol and Manchester. It will report by the end of 2003 and will provide evidence to support the implementation of the National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England.
<P>
<BR>
In 2002 the Department of Health published a 'National Suicide Prevention Strategy for England'. This identified young men as a key high risk of suicide group and also refers to research which is being promoted by the National Institute for Mental Health in England (NIMHE) into high risk groups such as young men.

 All patients with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk of developing atheroma, a pathological process that may lead to an increased incidence of coronary heart disease, cerebrovascular disease and peripheral blood vessel disease. The exact mechanism of atheroma formation in rheumatoid arthritis is unclear, but may be associated with the vasculitis observed in rheumatoid arthritis. Peripheral gangrene may result from atheroma in peripheral blood vessels, and sometimes from vasculitis itself. On average, life expectancy is reduced in rheumatoid arthritis by about five years and atheroma is a key contributing cause.
