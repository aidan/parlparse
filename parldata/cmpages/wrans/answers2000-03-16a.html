<a name="00316w01.html_sbhd0"><H4><center>Welfare Reform</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Peter Bradley: </B> 
To ask the Prime Minister what further progress the Government have made in their welfare reform programme; and if he will make a statement.  [115348]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 Welfare reform is central to this government's agenda of modernisation, and to our goals of tackling poverty and social exclusion. Today I am announcing plans for the next stage of welfare reform which will radically change the way the Government provides support for people of working age. The aim is to accelerate the move from a welfare system that primarily provide passive support to one that provides active support to help people become more independent, based on work for those who can and security for those who cannot.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para0">During 2001 a brand new, modern agency will be established with a clear focus on work. This will draw together the Employment Service and the parts of the Benefits Agency which support people of working age. It will deliver a single, integrated service to benefit claimants of working age and to employers. The agency will continue and develop the partnership approach to working with local authorities and the private and voluntary sectors which the Government have adopted in implementing their welfare to work policies.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para1">Already the New Deal has helped around 260,000 people back into work. The national minimum wage and tax credits are helping work pay. And the ONE pilots are showing how, working together, the Benefits Agency and the Employment Service can provide a radically improved service to clients and employers alike. The new agency will have a new culture, and will be firmly focused on helping people to become independent. It will help further to embed a culture of rights and responsibilities within the welfare system. Personal advisers will steer clients towards work or training, help them claim the benefits they need, and provide additional support tailored to their needs. Help will be directed to those that need it, while fraud will be squeezed out of the system.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para2">The agency will provide a proactive and responsive service to employers--helping people to find jobs and helping employers to fill their vacancies with the right people.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para3">The agency will also help and support working age people who are out of the labour market for whatever reason. A single agency will provide a better and more responsive benefits service to all people of working age, tailored to individual needs and asking the question "what can we do to help you become independent".




<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2000 : Column: 258W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para4">The agency will provide a single point of contact for all working age people to access the following benefits: Jobseeker's Allowance, Income Support, Incapacity Benefit, Severe Disablement Allowance, Maternity Allowance, Widows' Benefit, Industrial Injury Disablement Benefits and Invalid Care Allowance. The administration of the Social Fund is under review.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para5">The new agency will be in the front line of the drive to modernise government. It will have the technology to provide the most up-to-date service to more than 10 million customers each year. Job vacancies, information about services and benefits and availability of child care will all be on hand at the press of a button. Located in high streets and town centres across the country this new service will represent the face of 21st century government. Over time the new agency will produce efficiency savings compared with the current arrangements.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para6">Design and development of the new agency will be carried out jointly by the Secretaries of State for Education and Employment and for Social Security. I am asking them to establish the agency as soon as possible in 2001 so that, alongside the new service for pensioners announced yesterday, it can start to deliver our vision of a modern welfare state and contribute to reducing poverty and expanding opportunity.

To ask the Prime Minister what advice has been given to civil servants on the conduct of Government business during the forthcoming elections to the Greater London Authority and to local councils on 4 May.  [115349]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_spmin1"><B>The Prime Minister:</B> 
 The Government have issued guidance to civil servants on the principles which they should observe in relation to the conduct of Government business in the period before the forthcoming elections.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para7">The guidance stresses that civil servants should conduct themselves in accordance with the Civil Service Code and is based on the need to maintain political impartiality of the Civil Service and the need to ensure that public resources are not used for party political purposes.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para8">The guidance will come into force on 13 April.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para9">Copies of the guidance have been placed in the Libraries of the House, and are also available from the Vote Office.

<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_wqn2"><B> Miss Widdecombe: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the annual number of convicted offenders who would receive a shorter custodial sentence than at present if the Criminal Justice (Mode of Trial) (No. 2) Bill became law; how many offenders convicted of each type of offence would receive shorter sentences; what estimate he has made of the average reduction in the length of sentence <i>(a)</i> received and <i>(b)</i> served; and if he will make a statement.

<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 March 2000]:</i> It is estimated that 5,400 convicted offenders would receive shorter custodial sentences because their cases would be dealt with in the magistrates courts. This covers all categories of either-way offences. It is also assumed that the average reduction in the length of sentence <i>(a)</i> received would be 4.6 months and <i>(b)</i> served would be 2.3 months.

<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Hammond: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what estimate he has made of the cost to the Metropolitan police of the presence of Senator Augusto Pinochet in Surrey for 17 months; what discussions he has had with the Chief Constable of Surrey relating to such costs incurred by his force; and what payments have been made by his Department to each force in reimbursement of those costs.  [113559]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The information as regards the estimated cost to the Metropolitan police of the presence of Senator Augusto Pinochet in the United Kingdom cannot be provided for security reasons.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para10">In relation to the costs incurred by Surrey Constabulary, the Chief Constable asked for additional financial assistance in January. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary approved a special payment in the financial years 1998-99 of &#163;200,000 for Surrey police. There was no commitment to provide any further assistance.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para11">No special payment was provided to the Metropolitan police for their involvement with the policing of Senator Pinochet.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what steps he is taking to deal with beggars and squeegee merchants on the streets of Croydon.  [114259]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis informs me that there have been a number of operations during the past year in the Croydon area to address these problems and that his officers will continue to respond appropriately to any complaints.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para12">The Commissioner has also advised me that he proposes next month to launch a drive to reduce street crime. Under the new initiative, specialist task forces will be introduced to assist boroughs with particular problems. Aggressive begging, which is intimidatory and often uses force, will be part of the focus of this initiative.

<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Coaker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what response he has had to his letter to local authorities and chief constables asking for comment on the operation of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 with respect to <i>(a)</i> child curfews and <i>(b)</i> anti-social behaviour orders;  [114532]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many child curfews have been agreed using powers given by the Crime and Disorder Act 1998;  [114531]




<P>

<UL>
<P>
(3) what assessment he has made of the effectiveness of the child curfew powers; and if he will make a statement.  [114533]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 No applications have been received from local authorities to establish child curfew schemes under section 14 of the Crime and Disorder Act 1998. My right hon. Friend the Home Secretary wrote on 15 October 1999 to local authority chief executives and chief officers of police about the provisions in the 1998 Act to tackle problems caused by unruly and anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para13">Responses have been received from a number of local authorities and police forces and from professional and staff associations. They are being studied with a view in the operation of the Crime and Disorder Act provisions. An action group has also been established, involving local authority representatives and others, to consider issues relating to the use of anti-social behaviour orders. Regional seminars arranged by the group are currently being held and provide an opportunity to share good practice.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what assessment he has made of the impact on re-offending of the kerb crawlers re-education programme in West Yorkshire;  [114563]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will introduce a nationwide kerb crawlers re-education programme.  [114562]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Home Office have not been involved in the Kerb Crawlers Rehabilitation Programme in West Yorkshire. We have, however, received a copy of the evaluation of the programme carried out by West Yorkshire Police.
<P>

<a name="00316w01.html_para14">We hope to discuss the programme with interested parties to see what lessons can be learned but we have no current plans to introduce such a programme nationwide.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what disciplinary action has been taken against staff at Harmondsworth Detention Centre as a result of incidents involving injuries to detainees over the period 1 March 1999 and 29 February 2000.  [114432]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 No disciplinary action has been taken against staff at Harmondsworth Detention Centre between 1 March 1999 and 29 February 2000, as a result of any incidents involving injuries to detainees.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. McDonnell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will publish the staffing structure of the Harmondsworth Detention Centre, including the ratio of staff on duty to detainees.  [114433]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The staffing structure and ratio of staff to detainees employed by the contractor at Harmondsworth is commercially sensitive information and it would not be appropriate to publish it.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para0">The contractor was appointed after a competitive tendering exercise and one of the factors taken into account during the evaluation was the proposal for staff coverage.

<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) how long the journey time was on each occasion wild-caught baboons were imported into the UK in <i>(a)</i> 1998 and <i>(b)</i> 1999; and if he will make a statement;  [114106]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make it his policy to end the importation of wild-caught baboons for research; and if he will make a statement;  [114107]
<P>
(3) when approval was last given for baboons to be imported into the UK; and if he will make a statement;  [114104]
<P>
(4) when an inspector from his Department last visited Mr. Richard Mann's wildlife trading premises near Nairobi, Kenya; and if he will make a statement;  [114108]
<P>
(5) how many wild-caught baboons from Kenya have been imported into the UK for research during <i>(a)</i> 1998 and <i>(b)</i> 1999; and if he will make a statement.  [114105]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 March]:</i> All but a small number of primates used in scientific procedures in the United Kingdom are captive-bred and not taken from the wild. Under measures introduced in 1996, authority to use wild-caught primates will be given only if the applicant can establish exceptional and specific justification. Such cases are very rare. We must also be satisfied that the applicant has made (and continues to make) appropriate efforts to find suitable captive-bred primates. All applications to use wild-caught primates are referred to the Animal Procedures Committee for its advice.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para1">The last authorisation was given in 1998 for up to 40 wild-caught baboons to be imported into the United Kingdom for use in scientific research into aspects of xenotransplantation. The first part of this consignment--28 animals--arrived from Kenya in May 1999. No more have been imported since then and none were imported in 1998.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para2">The work with these baboons is to improve transplant procedures. Xenotransplantation includes the transplantation of organs such as hearts and kidneys between different animal species and from animals into humans. Organ transplantation is a hugely successful medical procedure--one that has transformed the lives of tens of thousands of people across the world. The critical shortage of human donor organs has led scientists to investigate xenotransplantation as an alternative potential source of organs. This is policy on which the Department of Health leads. Baboons are used in heart xenotransplantation procedures because of the need to use primates of suitable body weight to sustain the size of the heart. They are extremely difficult to breed in captivity. 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2000 : Column: 262W</I><P>
Captive-bred animals are therefore available on the world market only in very limited numbers, and United Kingdom researchers have been unable to become "preferred clients" of the captive-bred sources.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para3">The total journey time for the May 1999 consignment was 34 hours from placing the animals in transport crates at the supplier's premises in Kenya to their receipt at the designated establishment in the United Kingdom. All of the animals arrived in good condition.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para4">The Inspectorate last visited Richard Mann's premises in Kenya in November 1995. This visit revealed that standards were not satisfactory and the Secretary of State was advised that approval of this establishment would be withheld unless and until substantial improvements were made to the accommodation and care offered to wild-caught baboons destined for supply to the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para5">By February 1997 documentary evidence confirmed that the necessary improvements had been made and the establishments "approved status" was restored. Animals destined for the United Kingdom are group-housed in large, modern outdoor enclosures. The Home Office is aware that the "sub-standard" areas remain in use for animals for supply to non-United Kingdom customers. We cannot regulate premises in Kenya used to accommodate animals that will never be shipped to the United Kingdom. Confirmation has been obtained that all animals destined for shipment to the United Kingdom have been held in the improved accommodation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man have produced reports setting out the steps that they have taken and are continuing to take to give effect to the conclusions of the Edwards Report. I have today placed copies of the Islands' reports in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para6">I am encouraged by the positive and constructive way in which the authorities in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man have responded to the challenge of the Edwards Report. Although the Report placed them in the top division of offshore centres, the authorities in all three jurisdictions have been implementing programmes of further improvement in their systems of financial regulation which had begun even before the publication of the Report in November 1998. These programmes are still being taken forward; the islands recognise that the process of improving financial regulation must be a continuing one that works for the benefits of their economies and will strengthen the integrity of offshore financial centres.

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_spnew5"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 At the end of February 2000, a total of 5,615 asylum appeals were outstanding at the Immigration Appellate Authority. This figure includes 3,580 Adjudicator appeals, 310 applications for leave to appeal to the Tribunal and 1,725 appeals to the Tribunal.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para7">Information on the number of appeals against asylum decisions on a quarterly basis, in 1998 and 1997, is given in Table 8.1 of Home Office Statistical Bulletin "Asylum Statistics United Kingdom, 1998", a copy of which is available in the Library. Information covering earlier years can be found in previous editions of the Statistical Bulletin.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will make a statement on the criteria for detention of asylum seekers at Oakington Reception Centre.  [115345]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 Oakington Reception Centre will strengthen our ability to deal quickly with asylum applications, many of which prove to be unfounded. In addition to the existing detention criteria, applicants will be detained at Oakington where it appears that their application can be decided quickly, including those which may be certified as manifestly unfounded. Oakington will consider applications from adults and families with children, for whom separate accommodation is being provided, but not from unaccompanied minors. Detention will initially be for a period of about seven days to enable applicants to be interviewed and an initial decision to be made. Legal advice will be available on site.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para9">If the claim cannot be decided in that period, the applicant will be granted temporary admission or, if necessary in line with existing criteria, moved to another place of detention. If the claim is refused, a decision about further detention will similarly be made in accordance with existing criteria. Thus, detention in this latter category of cases will normally be to effect removal or where it has become apparent that the person will fail to keep in contact with the Immigration Service.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Darvill: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what support arrangements exist for asylum seekers to submit material in support of their claim for asylum.  [115346]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 The White paper 'Fairer, Faster and Firmer--A Modern Approach to Immigration and Asylum' published in July 1998, standardised the period allowed for asylum seekers to submit further material after a substantive interview at five days. We have decided that some adjustment to this policy is needed to deliver faster asylum decisions, while at the same time ensuring that asylum seekers have a proper opportunity to establish their claim.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para10">In the case of applications considered at Oakington Reception Centre, we are arranging for the Refugee Legal Centre and Immigration Advisory Service to provide legal advice on-site. It has been agreed with those organisations that the consideration process should operate so that such advice may be provided both before and after the substantive interview. Other than in very exceptional circumstances, the substantive interview will take place 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2000 : Column: 264W</I><P>
on the third day at the centre and so there will normally be two more days after the interview in which to submit additional representations. The five day period for submission of supporting material will in these cases therefore commence as soon as the asylum application has been made, rather than from the date of the substantive interview.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para11">We have also decided that the five day period for submission of further supporting evidence will not apply to asylum claims where no substantive interview is conducted at the time the claim is made. In those cases, applicants are issued a Statement of Evidence form which they are required to submit to the Immigration and Nationality Directorate within 14 days. We think this gives applicants a reasonable period to set out their claim, and time to seek legal representation if they wish. Where an application is not granted on the basis of the evidence in the Statement of Evidence form, applicants are interviewed and in these cases a decision will be made immediately after this substantive interview.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para12">The five day standard period for applicants to submit further material after substantive interview, as set out in the White Paper, will continue to apply in all other cases.
<P>

<a name="00316w02.html_para13">Discretion will be exercised to permit an extension of the applicable period for the making of post interview representations where exceptional circumstances require--for example, where possible torture victims are identified.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to review the policy of considering applications for permission to work by asylum seekers who have been in the UK for six months or more; and if he will make a statement.  [114566]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 As we announced in the information document "Asylum Seekers Support", which we published in March last year, we intend to end, with effect from 3 April 2000, that element of the employment concession whereby asylum seekers who are appealing against the refusal of asylum are, on application, granted permission to work. However, we have no plans at present to withdraw the remainder of the employment concession whereby asylum seekers who have not received a first determination of their case within six months are, on application, given permission to work. We will, however, be keeping this under review, particularly with regard to whether, in the light of progress in processing all asylum claims within an average of six months, such a concession can continue to be justified.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if Prison Service areas are to be reorganised so as to improve alignment of criminal justice boundaries.  [115347]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w03.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The response to a consultation document issued in December 1999 was overwhelmingly supportive of Prison Service proposals to continue its predominantly geographic structure but to re-align its boundaries so that they match those of police areas and planned probation areas, the English regions and Wales. From April 2000, 12 area managers will manage establishments grouped by police areas within the boundaries of the nine English regions. Three regions--the South-East, the North-West 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2000 : Column: 265W</I><P>

<a name="00316w03.html_para0">These arrangements will improve alignment of criminal justice boundaries around the nine Government Offices for the Regions and Wales and provide the Prison Service with a platform for further joint working regionally and locally with other agencies. The move to a criminal justice focus on the 42 police areas is accelerating. The Crown Prosecution Service is organised on that basis already. Crown Courts Circuits are being organised on the basis of groups of police areas, and 42 criminal justice strategy committees and trial issues groups are being established this year. Forty-two magistrates courts' committees and probation areas are planned from April 2001.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many police officers and constables there were in the Chelmsford Division of the Essex Constabulary <i>(a)</i> on 1 May 1997 and <i>(b)</i> at the latest available date; and what reports he has received from the Chief Constable about the number of (i) officers and (ii) constables there will be in that division in the next three years.  [114784]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The information requested has been provided by the Chief Constable of Essex and is set out in the table. I have not received any reports on the Chief Constable's future plans for the policing of Chelmsford. Ministers have no direct control over police numbers. Under legislation passed by the previous Government in 1994 it is for individual chief constables to determine the number of police officers in their force within the resources that are available. It will also be for the Chief Constable to consider how he wishes to deploy the 103 police recruits that have been allocated to the Essex police under the Crime Fighting Fund over the next three years.

<P>

<a name="00316w04.html_para0">This is because the Act also contains a number of provisions empowering enforcement offices to take civil action against non-paying employers and the enforcement body will always use these in the first instance.

 Promotion of Inward Investment in the regions is undertaken by Regional Development Agencies (RDAs) which were established by this Government in April 1999. My Department funds Yorkshire Forward (the Yorkshire and Humber's RDA) Inward Investment activities to the tune of &#163;1.4 million. The Government and Yorkshire Forward are keen to attract Inward Investment to the former South Humberside area. Yorkshire Forward is actively developing a Sub-Regional Action Plan for the Humber area in conjunction with national and regional partners including the Government Office and DTI's Invest In Britain Bureau. The action plan is scheduled for completion in June 2000.
<P>

<a name="00316w04.html_para1">One of Yorkshire Forward's key objectives is to attract and retain more investment. An important feature of the Humber Sub-Regional Action Plan will be the development of a Humber Trade Zone. This should help exploit the significant advantages of the estuary's deep water ports and provide the foundation for attracting new industry. In addition, the Humber Chemical Forum, with an active DTI contribution, is playing an increasingly important role in helping the development of the chemical industry along the South Bank.
<P>

<a name="00316w04.html_para2">Yorkshire Forward statistics indicate that, since May 1997, there have been 11 Inward Investment projects in the former South Humberside area. These projects are expected to lead to the creation/safeguarding of around 1,000 jobs.

<P>

<a name="00316w05.html_para0">The proposition for the review was endorsed at a meeting in November between Lord Sainsbury and a wide range of senior representatives of the engineering community. Although some of those present expressed a wish to see more industrial representation in the membership of the Group, the large majority supported Lord Sainsbury's view that for the Group to be effective there should be a minimum number of members. It was also recognised that Dr. Hawley's experience as a leading industrialist would be highly valuable in leading the Group.
<P>

<a name="00316w05.html_para1">My noble Friend Lord Sainsbury has received a small number of representations from individuals and bodies on various issues relating to the review and some of those who have responded to Dr. Hawley have copied their replies to him. He has also had discussions with his counterpart in DfEE. Other Government Departments have contributed to the review process at official level. I understand also that following the extensive first stage consultation exercise Dr. Hawley has received nearly 100 detailed responses from a range of individuals and organisations. These are providing helpful contributions towards the Group's continuing work.

 The Government recognise the important contribution role that social enterprises have to play in the nation's economy, including helping to overcome problems of social exclusion. They can be effective at developing services which the private and public sectors may be unable or unwilling to provide. Social enterprises can also be valuable in engaging local communities in economic activities that they would otherwise not have undertaken. Some estimates put the number of people employed in the not for profit sector nationally as high as 2.6 million.

<a name="00316w05.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Maternity and Parental Leave Regulations 1999 confer a right for employees who adopt a child on or after 15 December 1999 to take parental leave from work to care for the child. The right applies to any employee who has completed one year's qualifying service with his or her employer; the amount of leave provided for is thirteen weeks' leave for each parent. This has to be taken over the first five years after the child is placed with the parents for adoption.
<P>

<a name="00316w05.html_para10">Employees can take the leave in accordance with arrangements agreed with the employer through a workforce or collective agreement. If there is no agreement in place, the fallback scheme provided for in the Regulations applies. That provides for an employee to take up to four weeks' leave in a year. This leave can be taken at the time of the placement provided the notice provisions are followed.
<P>

<a name="00316w05.html_para11">The leave is unpaid. We will be encouraging employers to build on the minimum standard as part of the Government's commitment to help employees achieve a better balance between their work and the rest of their lives.

 I welcome the focus that Oxfam--and The Guardian "Read the World" campaign--have placed on raising awareness of the plight of the 125 million children who are not in school. Educational opportunity for all, especially at the primary level, is both a fundamental human right and a precondition for progress in development and the reduction of poverty. Our White Paper on International Development, published in 1997, committed us to seek to mobilise the international community to meet the international development targets which include universal primary education by 2015 and gender equity in primary and secondary education by 2005. In our bilateral programmes substantial resources are allocated to education for the achievement of these targets.

First, we need a real and sustained commitment by the Governments of developing countries to securing universal primary education. Secondly, we need to address the issue of resourcing for education. There is a clear need to increase the level of resources that developing country Governments commit to primary and basic education. And development agencies should allocate significant additional resources where Governments have developed well-focused education strategies. Thirdly, we need to shift from a projects-based approach to a sector-wide approach to basic and primary education, and we need to pull together the work of all the different development donors around a focused, agreed strategy drawn up by the Government of the country concerned.
<P>

<a name="00316w07.html_para1">The fourth thing we need to do is link education policy with the wider development strategy of the country, including policies on health, sanitation, livelihoods and rural transport.
<P>

<a name="00316w07.html_para2">This is the agenda that I will be taking to the World Education Forum in Dakar next month, which I will attend on behalf of the British Government. The Dakar meeting provides an important opportunity for Governments, development agencies and non- governmental organisations--from North and South--to recommit themselves to Education for All (including the achievement of universal primary education by 2015, and gender equality in primary and secondary education by 2005).

 As hon. Members may know, a McKenzie Friend is someone who attends a court hearing with a litigant in person. The friend can assist that litigant in person in conducting their case but is not formally representing them and is not entitled to address the court on their behalf. The use of McKenzie Friends is part of the operation of the Court Service and therefore primarily the concern of the Lord Chancellor's Department. I personally have not had any recent discussions with other Government Departments on this subject.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>FY98-99 NRTA Key Targets</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>KT2--To obtain a Customer Satisfaction Rating of a least 90%.</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>94% of feedback forms received from employers of ex-NRTA trainees indicated that the training received had satisfactorily fitted the trainee for his or her subsequent employment.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The principal factor behind this achievement is the fact that the RN Systems Approach to Training produces training courses which focus accurately on the skills and knowledge required by the trainee to be effective in his or her operational role.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The target was raised to 95% for 99-00. At Min(AF)'s office's request, it is now described as "Fitness for Purpose" rather than "Customer Satisfaction".</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>KT3--To maintain success rates of 95% in Career Training and 97% in examined Pre-joining Training.</i></FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Achieved with success rates of 97% and 99% respectively.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The principal factors are the generally strong motivation of the trainees to succeed in their RN careers, and the fact that, wherever appropriate, training is delivered by uniformed staff who have themselves carried out, at sea, the tasks towards which the training is directed.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>To seek further improvement in these success rates would not be cost-effective as some residual failure due to trainee attitude or aptitude is inevitable. Nonetheless, the target remains key as a drop in the success rate is likely to be the first indicator of any loss in training quality.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Assessment of achievement against this target is complicated by in-year adjustments to the programme and the cash allocation and in-year requirements for additional savings.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The principal factors contributing to the outcome were the high requirement against which the variance is calculated, which has increased fourfold since 1994, a difficult recruiting climate, and the wastage of personnel from training pipelines which are running at full capacity.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 99-00, recruiting performance has improved substantially, including the particularly difficult area of Engineer Officers where a number of initiatives are showing signs of success.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Wastage remains a difficult area. Failures during training are being reduced by backclassing and remedial training with many trainees achieving the required standards.

<P>
<UL>(2) what plans he has to protect the Garden of Remembrance at Serle's House, Winchester, in the event of the sale of Serle's House;  [113901]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w08.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The decision to sell Serle's House was taken following a review which examined a number of sites upon which MOD has Museums and Regimental Headquarters in Winchester. It was concluded that all the Museums and Regimental Headquarters should be co-located in the Upper Barracks. The MOD is well aware of Serle's House status as a Grade II listed property and of its associated memorial garden and will consider disposal options that best preserve its future. Defence Estates, who are responsible for managing this disposal, are consulting with the Trustees of the Regimental Museum over the level of access required and intend to impose a restrictive covenant on the purchaser which would ensure the retention and upkeep of the memorial garden and continued access to it.
<P>

<a name="00316w08.html_para0">Serle's House has already attracted interest from a number of potential purchasers including Hampshire County Council. In taking forward its disposal, Defence Estates will expose the property to the open market, while seeking to ensure that the historic building and its memorial garden are protected.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what measures are being taken to protect reservists in the armed forces from dismissal by their civilian employers; and if he will make a statement.  [114916]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w08.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 Reservists are afforded protection under the terms of the Reserve Forces (Safeguard of Employment) Act 1985, which is sponsored by the Department of Trade and Industry. This Act makes dismissal between notification of call-out and actual mobilisation a criminal offence. After demobilisation, the Act requires the employer to reinstate the reservist on 



<P>
<P><I>16 Mar 2000 : Column: 283W</I><P>
application, or to offer him or her the most favourable alternative work available. The Act provides for a Reinstatement Committee to consider applications for reinstatement which are rejected by employers, and to make orders for reinstatement or the payment of compensation, or both. Over 5,000 reservists have been called out for service since NATO operations commenced in the former Yugoslavia. We are aware of only one application to a Reinstatement Committee in that time. It is our policy to seek the employer's agreement before any reservist is mobilised.
<P>

<a name="00316w08.html_para1">The National Employers' Liaison Committee (NELC) works hard to win and retain the support of employers for the Reserve Forces. NELC can also act in an advisory capacity where difficulties related to Reserve liability arise in the employer/employee relationship. Over 6,000 companies, employing around 70 per cent. of the nation's workforce, have now affirmed their support. These companies have recognised that they get a good deal from employing reservists. Reserve service teaches skills that can be used in the civilian workplace, such as teamwork, leadership, and the ability to take sound decisions quickly.
<P>

<a name="00316w08.html_para2">The Reserve Forces Act 1996 and subsequent legislation introduced new safeguards for employers. The Act enables employers to apply for their employees to be exempted from call-out or for that call-out to be deferred. The Reserve Forces (Call-out and Recall) (Financial Assistance) Regulations 1997 (SI 1997/309), enable employers to claim financial assistance to cover the costs associated with the loss of a member of staff who is mobilised for reserve service, and for any necessary retraining for that individual on his or her return to the workplace.

<P>
<a name="00316w12.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Headteachers will be responsible for assessing teachers against national standards at a Performance Threshold to move to the new upper pay spine proposed by the Government. DfEE has contracted Cambridge Education Associates Limited (CEA) to manage the appointment, deployment and quality assurance of external assessors who will verify, through sampling, headteachers' assessments.

<P>

<a name="00316w12.html_para0">The payment of external assessors is a matter for CEA, but it will be made on a pro rata basis dependent upon the number of applicants in each school.
<P>

<a name="00316w12.html_para1">The number of external assessors to be deployed will be dependent upon the number and distribution of teachers who apply to cross the Performance Threshold. This number will not be known until summer 2000. The total cost of administering the scheme will be dependent upon the number of assessments carried out and again this will not be known until later in 2000.

[106299]<P>

 The Department is fully committed to public consultation, and a great many consultative exercises are carried out by the Department and throughout the NHS.

 No. We consulted widely before introducing regulations on 1 July 1999 restricting the prescribing by general practitioners of treatments for impotence, including Viagra. No representations were made suggesting that men without pituitary glands should be included in the groups of patients for whom such treatments can be prescribed. We shall be reviewing the operation of the regulations after a year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w12.html_spnew6"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The cost of the provision and maintenance of internal and external plants is included as part of the overall contract cost for the provision of cleaning services to the Department's central London buildings. It is not budgeted for separately. However, our best estimate is an annual cost to the Department of about &#163;4,000 for Wellington House and &#163;2,000 for Skipton House.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w12.html_spnew7"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The cost of the renewal and replacement of internal and external plants forms an integral part of a lease maintenance agreement which is included in an overall contract to provide cleaning services to the Department's central London buildings. The costs of the provision and maintenance of plants are not identified separately. However, our best estimate for the cost of plant provision, maintenance and replacement since 1 January is &#163;700.

 The Department gets feedback from patient groups. The Human Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy Foundation, a voluntary organisation run by families of variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD) patients and funded by the Department, brought to our attention that some families had been caused unnecessary distress by inappropriate restrictions placed on them regarding funeral arrangements.

<P>

<a name="00316w13.html_para3">The guidance states that there is no need for special precautions to be taken for either burial or cremation (where the risk is described as likely to be negligible), and that superficial contact, such as touching the face, need not be discouraged.

So far none have emerged.

 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2000]:</i> The "Saving Lives--Our Healthier Nation" White Paper has a central aim to improve the health of the worst off in society and narrow the health gap.

This will involve dealing with the broader determinants of health (eg poverty, social exclusion etc.), addressing risk factors (eg by providing smoking cessation clinics in Health Action Zones), encouraging early detection and uptake of screening (especially in deprived groups and ethnic minorities), and by ensuring equity of access to high quality cancer treatment across the country as part of our national strategy to improve cancer services.

10. <a name="00316w15.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Tynan: </B> 
 To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what recent estimate he has made of the savings for consumers from the Agenda 2000 reform of the common agriculture policy.  [113378]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Agenda 2000 reforms should result in savings of around &#163;1 billion a year for UK consumers when all the changes have worked through. This will equate to a saving of around &#163;65 per year for the average family of four.

<P>
14. <a name="00316w15.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Cox: </B> 
 To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what estimate he has made of the overall benefit to the UK economy of the Agenda 2000 reforms of the CAP.  [113382]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Once fully implemented the economic benefit to the UK is estimated to be worth around &#163;0.5 billion per year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 If price reductions are passed to retail, UK consumers will save around &#163;250 million in 2001, &#163;450 million in 2002 and &#163;600 million in 2003 as a result of the Agenda 2000 reform.

 To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food if he will take steps to ensure that farmers receive prices for animal products which reward better welfare standards.  [113381]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Nick Brown: </B> 
 The Government have always maintained that UK welfare standards offer the domestic livestock industry, particularly the pig industry, a strong marketing advantage. That is one reason why the Government have agreed to fund half of the &#163;4.6 million welfare linked pork promotion campaign developed by the Meat and Livestock Commission.

 To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what progress has been achieved since May 1997 in improving conditions for live animals exported from the UK and transported around the continent.  [113383]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 We introduced the overdue EU rules on animal welfare in transit immediately after coming into office, and tighter pre-export inspection procedures for livestock in May 1999. We ensure the rules are enforced strictly while live export consignments are on our territory: we have pressed the Commission to ensure the same standards throughout the EU, and welcome the review they are now carrying out.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew9"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Certain antibiotic feed additives authorised by the EU may be used as growth promoters in animals. They may be used only if they satisfy stringent statutory criteria including a requirement that, at the level permitted, they do not adversely affect human or animal health or the environment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew10"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Our policy is that UK industry should not be denied access to GM technology, provided that valid concerns are addressed. The GM industry has agreed that no GM crops will be grown on a commercial basis before the farm scale evaluation programme has been completed.

 To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what conclusions he has drawn from the recent OECD conference on genetically modified crops.  [113392]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew11"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The OECD conference held last week in Edinburgh was extremely useful in bringing together scientific experts, policy regulators and other parties interested in GM crops and food from around the world. The conference allowed a balanced debate, scrutinising the safety assessment systems for GM foods and considering whether and how GM foods and crops could serve the needs of society. It is too early to draw any firm conclusions but we await the chairman's final report with interest.

<P>
25. <a name="00316w15.html_wqn12"><B> Mr. Swayne: </B> 
 To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what procedure he will follow when licensing genetically modified crop varieties.  [113395]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew12"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Genetically modified crops are not licensed. Releases of Genetically Modified Organisms are regulated by the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and secondary legislation made under it. The National Listing of plant varieties (which could include genetically modified varieties) is regulated by the Seeds (National Lists of Varieties) Regulations 1982. The relevant procedures are set out in the legislation.

<P>
26. <a name="00316w15.html_wqn13"><B> Dr. Naysmith: </B> 
 To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what action he has taken to provide information to the public concerning the safety of genetically modified foods.  [113396]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew13"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 The Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) is responsible for assessing the safety of genetically modified foods in the UK. The ACNFP already publishes agendas, reports and minutes of its meetings, committee papers and detailed assessment reports on individual GM food applications as well as an Annual Report. In addition the Committee has held a number of open meetings on issues such as postmarket surveillance.
<P>

<a name="00316w15.html_para0">Those seeking novel food approvals have been encouraged for many years to deposit data supporting their applications in the British Library. All new applications will however be made available electronically on the ACNFP website from now on and public comments invited, which the ACNFP can then take into account in reaching its preliminary conclusions. These conclusions will be made available for comment in turn before they are forwarded to the European Commission. The UK is encouraging other European member states to follow a similar approach.
<P>

<a name="00316w15.html_para1">General information about the safety of genetically modified foods is also contained on the Government GM website at www.gm-info.gov.uk. This has been widely publicised.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew15"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2000]:</i> Under Council Directive 90-220, on the Deliberate Release of Genetically Modified Organisms into the Environment, no viable GM material can either be grown or imported into the EU without a marketing consent.

<a name="00316w15.html_wqn16"><B> Mr. David Heath: </B> 
To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what research he has commissioned into the implications for safety or welfare of animals of being fed on GM crops.  [113768]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00316w15.html_spnew16"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2000]:</i> Research to date has concentrated on the effects of processing on animal feed materials and the ability of DNA to survive processing and passage through an animal's gut. No incidental ill-effects have been detected in animals, nor have any been reported in countries where GM crops have been grown and fed to animals for a number of years.

<a name="00316w15.html_spnew17"><B> Ms Quin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2000]:</i> We have been pressing the Commission for some time to bring forward its proposed Novel Feeds Regulation which will contain labelling rules.

 <i>[holding answer 13 March 2000]:</i> Ministers are presently considering whether or not to propose a GM forage maize variety (CHARDON LL) for addition to the National List. When this decision is taken it will be published in the <i>Plant Varieties and Seeds Gazette</i>, and persons affected by the proposed decision may then make representations and/or be heard by a person appointed by Ministers for that purpose.

 Payments to farmers under agri- environmental schemes in England were &#163;44.4 million in the 1996-97 financial year and are expected to be &#163;87.4 million in 1999-2000. This is an increase of 97 per cent. over the three year period. Our target this year for the Countryside Stewardship Scheme is to enter into around 3,000 new agreements compared to around 1,300 in 1999.

 The number of people receiving Disability Living Allowance and total expenditure on this benefit are continuing to increase.

Against this background, our priorities are to look at ways of improving the information we provide about these benefits and to make it easier for people to supply us with the details we need to decide entitlement. We are also trying to develop clearer and more secure gateways, so that it is easier for people to know whether they may be entitled. These initiatives have involved extensive and continuing discussions with disabled people and their representatives, and with disability experts.

<a name="00316w18.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 I am today announcing the names of the 22 local authorities which will be able to proceed, on a voluntary basis and subject to the approval of their tenants, with proposals to carry out 23 transfers of all or part of their housing stock to Registered Social Landlords in 2000-01. The programme will involve over 160,000 dwellings in large scale voluntary transfers, generating capital receipts of over &#163;940 million.
<P>

<a name="00316w18.html_para0">Transfers can offer benefits for tenants. The new landlord must plan for proper maintenance and future repairs. Increased investment means that any backlog of repairs can be carried out more quickly than if the properties had remained in local authority ownership. Rent increases are normally limited by a guarantee that rents will not rise by more than 1 per cent. above inflation for the first five years.
<P>

<a name="00316w18.html_para1">But housing transfers are voluntary and may only take place if tenants are in favour. The consent of the Secretary of State is also required before a transfer can proceed and will not be granted if it appears that a majority of tenants do not wish the transfer to proceed.
<P>

<a name="00316w18.html_para2">The 2000-01 programme reflects the Government's commitment to support a continuing programme of transfers as a means of generating private finance to repair and improve the condition of social housing.
<P>

<a name="00316w18.html_para3">Sunderland City Council and Birmingham City Council have applied for a place on this year's programme but I have given them more time to develop their transfer proposals.

<a name="00316w18.html_para4">Four of the authorities on the 2000-01 programme--Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council, Calderdale Metropolitan Council, Coventry City Council and Walsall Metropolitan Council--expect to have housing debt remaining in their Housing Revenue Account (HRA) after their stock is transferred. This is because the capital receipt will not be sufficient to clear all of the debt in their HRA. Under the new arrangements, announced on 16 December 1999, the Government are prepared to use a one-off payment to assist those authorities repay their overhanging debt. A guidance note setting out the detailed arrangements has been issued to all local authorities and a copy is available on the DETR website.

 The Environment Agency does not have evidence that pollution events have led to any major aquifer becoming unsuitable for the supply of water for human consumption since 1995. Water from aquifers is, however, treated by water companies before being put into public supply using disinfection and such other processes as are necessary to comply with the standards for drinking water quality.

 London Underground Limited will retain responsibility for the operation of services and for safety at all those stations and on all those lines for which it is currently responsible. Under the PPP proposals an infrastructure company will enter into a long term service contract with London Underground for the provision of infrastructure services--primarily, maintenance and renewal--for each of three groupings of lines:

 Current planning policy provides Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONBs) with a high degree of protection similar to that applicable in National Parks. Planning Policy Guidance (PPG 7: The Countryside--Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development) requires policies and development control decisions affecting AONBs to favour conservation of the natural beauty of the landscape. The environmental effects of new proposals will be a major consideration, although it will also be appropriate to have regard to the economic and social well-being of the areas. It would normally be inconsistent with the aims of designation to permit the siting of major industrial or commercial development in these areas and only proven national interest and lack of alternative sites can justify an exception. Applications for mineral workings or new roads must also be subject to the most rigorous examination.

 The International Maritime Organisation (IMO) is actively considering international regulations for the carriage of Voyage Data Recorders (VDR), which will next be discussed at the IMO Maritime Safety Committee (MSC) in May 2000. At the European level, Council Directive 1999/35/EC, which was adopted on 29 April 1999, provides for the fitting of voyage data recorders to roll-on/roll-off ferries and high-speed passenger craft. Implementation is to be no later than 30 months after the publication of IEC standard No. 61996 or by 1 January

 Enforcement of road traffic regulations is a matter for the police.

 The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 grants a general planning permission for a range of minor works of development to dwelling houses. This includes the insertion of dormer windows, subject to certain limits on size and except where it would alter a roof slope facing a highway. In granting permitted development rights, we have to strike a balance between giving freedoms to individual householders to improve their homes, and protecting the amenity of neighbouring properties. We are not aware of any significant problems in the exercise of permitted development rights relating to dormer windows and therefore have no plans to change these at the present time. We will, however, continue to monitor any representations received on this issue.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will publish a list of those areas to be designated as urban priority areas for redevelopment funding.  [115017]<P>

<P>
<a name="00316w22.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 The Urban Taskforce report--"Towards an Urban Renaissance"--published in June 1999 recommended the introduction of urban priority areas as one of a wide-ranging series of proposals for the renewal of towns and cities. The report was welcomed by the Government as an important contribution to the urban renaissance debate. Many of the recommendations have already been taken forward. Others, including those on urban priority areas and the measures that might be applied within them, are being considered as part of our preparations for the White Paper on urban policy, due to be published later this year.

 It is not possible to make a meaningful estimate at present. Costs may vary greatly, according to the size of the designated area and the environmental and traffic calming measures employed. We have established a programme to monitor nine pilot home zones, and will have a clearer idea of the costs associated with different approaches when these schemes have been implemented.
