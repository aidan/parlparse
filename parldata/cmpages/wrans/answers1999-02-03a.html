To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland if she will publish a table in the <i>Official Report</i> to show for each month in 1998 the <i>(a)</i> profit and <i>(b)</i> loss in respect of (i) each weaner pig produced and (ii) each finished bacon pig from the Government Agricultural College Pig Unit or as much of such information as is readily available.

<P>

 The Government College Pig Unit operates a birth to bacon system and the financial records are accurate only for finished bacon pigs. Financial records are not maintained for weaner pig production.
<P>

<a name="90203w01.html_para0">Monthly figures are very variable in a 100-sow unit because numbers sold in a month can vary markedly and meal deliveries can also distort the picture.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what responsibilities which her Department had prior to the Comprehensive Spending Review are to be <i>(a)</i> discontinued by her Department, <i>(b)</i> transferred to another department, <i>(c)</i> transferred to an executive agency and <i>(d)</i> added to her Department over the period 1998-99 to 2001-02.  [68409]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Paul Murphy: </B> 
 The Comprehensive Spending Review did not lead directly to any of the Secretary of State's responsibilities being discontinued, transferred or added over the period 1998-99 to 2001-02. Under devolution, many of the functions currently the responsibility of the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland will transfer to the Northern Ireland Assembly.

 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> The RUC use a number of different forms associated with the Criminal Records Office (CRO). Unfortunately it is not clear to which of these my hon.

<a name="90203w01.html_para11">At January 1998, there were 30,734 pupils in key stage 1 classes of over 30 pupils. On the basis of grant approvals for local authorities to employ additional teachers from September 1998, it is estimated that 23,525 fewer pupils are being educated in classes of this size than would have been the case without grant. The 1999 Schools' Census will give the actual position.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w01.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Michael: </B> 
 I met the Welsh Local Government Association on 15 December and Welsh police authorities on 4 January to discuss the proposed settlement that I announced in December. I have given very careful consideration to their comments on it and to the many comments that I have received from hon. Members and others.
<P>

<a name="90203w01.html_para16">I have decided that, net of specific grants, total standard spending (TSS) for 1999-2000 will be &#163;2,986.6 million and net aggregate external finance will be &#163;2,570.2 million. These final figures represent increases on 1998-99 of 5.1 per cent. and 4.8 per cent. respectively.
<P>

<a name="90203w01.html_para17">Both figures are &#163;0.2 million higher than the provisional amounts I announced on 9 December, because of a small increase in funding to match grants for education, support and training. The extra amount within net TSS for education is also increased, to &#163;70.2 million.
<P>

<a name="90203w01.html_para18">In response to concerns expressed to me during the consultation period, I have decided to alter the formula for calculating the capital charges element of standard spending assessments (SSAs). The effect of the change is to increase SSAs for police authorities by &#163;1.8 million. Details of final SSAs for councils and police authorities are shown in the table.
<P>

<a name="90203w01.html_para19">It also takes account of other minor changes between provisional and final SSAs caused by data changes.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Wales if he will make a statement about the operation of the Social Exclusion Unit in Wales.  [69036]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 The remit of the Social Exclusion Unit covers England only. However, its members and officials from the Welsh Office keep in regular contact to ensure that best practice and good ideas are shared. From time to time, the Unit also draws on expertise from Wales or visits projects in the Principality.
<P>

<a name="90203w02.html_para0">I am a member of the Ministerial Network which guides the work of the Unit. This ensures that Wales has a voice at an early stage in the development of policy with an impact beyond England and that Welsh experience and innovations can be considered as part of the wider process of policy formulation.
<P>

<a name="90203w02.html_para1">The Secretary of State has ensured that policies to combat social exclusion are given renewed priority in the Welsh Office and in future this will become the responsibility of the National Assembly.

 Following my answer on 25 January 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column <i>79,</i> there is to be no change of responsibilities between Departments.

 We have no plans to do so. Any dissatisfaction with the exercise of the coroner's discretion is a matter for the courts. Complaints about the conduct of the coroner or the administration of the court may be referred to the Home Office.

authority and police in every area, in partnership with a wide range of other bodies, to carry out a full audit of the levels and patterns of crime and disorder in that area. Based upon the findings of the audit and after consultation with the community about them, police and council must then formulate and implement a strategy for the reduction of crime and disorder. Where the audit identifies crime or disorder problems in town centres as a major concern, we would expect the strategy to address them.

<a name="90203w03.html_para2">Home Office booklets have been issued providing "Information for Members of Parliament about immigration and nationality enquiries" and "Guidelines on the handling of representations by Members of Parliament in immigration cases". These booklets seek to help Members of Parliament decide whether or not to make representations in immigration cases and to decide whether those representations should be directed to Home Office Ministers or direct to the Immigration and Nationality Department.

 The independent Scientific Committee on Toxicity, Ecotoxicity and the Environment (SCTEE) was asked by the European Commission to provide an opinion on the use of phthalate plasticisers in soft PVC toys, including tethers.

These include concerns about the possible use of one phthalate (DEHP) in toys intended to be mouthed by children and a recommendation on a safe migration level for DINP.

 Information in the 1998-99 Public Expenditure Statistical Analysis was provided on the basis of the existing financial control framework. The comprehensive spending review introduced new departmental expenditure limits which (i) included elements previously outside the control total and (ii) excluded elements previously within the control total. For this Department the new elements included within its departmental expenditure limit were provision for the Capital Receipts Initiative and bus fuel duty rebate. The elements excluded from this Department's departmental expenditure limit were provision for Housing Revenue Account Subsidy and National Air Traffic Services Ltd.

 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, in its 1995 assessment, reported that global mean sea level has risen 10-25cm over the last 100 years, and that it is likely that this rise has been largely due to the concurrent increase in global temperature over the same time period.
<P>

<a name="90203w07.html_para0">The Panel's projections for the future, for a wide range of emission scenarios, are that global mean sea level will rise by 15-95cm by the year 2100. Research funded by my Department at the Hadley Centre suggests that, for a "business as usual scenario", global mean sea level will rise by about 50cm by the year 2100.
<P>

<a name="90203w07.html_para1">Estimates of sea level rise for regions of the UK were prepared for the UK Climate Impacts Programme and published in 1998, for various climate change scenarios which take account of expected land movements. Similar allowances to the changes now estimated have been used since 1989 for the construction or improvement of sea defences.

 It is already an offence under Section 47 of the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984 to park a vehicle which is not displaying an Orange Badge in an on-street designated disabled persons' parking bay.
<P>

<a name="90203w07.html_para2">The Orange Badge Scheme does not, however, apply to off-street car parks, whether local authority or privately owned, and enforcement of those disabled persons' parking bays is a matter for the operator concerned. In the case of local authority off-street car parks, their off-street parking place orders normally make it either an offence for someone not displaying a valid Orange Badge to park in a disabled persons' parking bay or make it subject to the payment of an "excess charge". In private car parks, we understand it is possible in law for the owners to agree with the local authority that a parking place order be made in respect of that car park. Conditions of use can then be enforced as if it were a local authority car park, with penalties or excess charges levied on offenders.

Also in December, I met BOND--which represents the smaller NGOs. They agreed with the need to develop and strengthen the link between debt relief and poverty reduction and welcomed the fact that we are pressing for this issue to be considered during the forthcoming comprehensive review of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Debt Initiative, and for civil society in developing countries to be involved in the review.

 The Chancellor and I are working to see international agreement to speed up the implementation of the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) debt initiative so that all eligible countries will be on track for debt relief by 2000. We are pressing for this and other key issues, including the level of debt relief and the link to poverty reduction, to be examined during the comprehensive review of the HIPC initiative which is to report by July this year. Over the past two years, the Department for International Development (DFID) has cancelled some &#163;30 million of bilateral aid debts and provided some &#163;36 million to help the African Development Bank meet its share of the cost of implementing the HIPC debt initiative. We are also providing around &#163;100 million to help a number of developing countries meet their debt service payments to international financial institutions. In addition, DFID is providing technical assistance in debt management to poor countries and funding research on the key issues of debt sustainability and internal debt. In the run-up to the Cologne Summit, we are working closely with the German government, whose proposals for debt relief are similar to those in our own Mauritius Mandate.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w09.html_spnew4"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 We welcome the recent German proposals for debt relief. In many of their elements, they reinforce the Mauritius Mandate, launched by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in September 1997. It is encouraging to see that the German proposals call for the cancellation of aid loans to Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) but we should like to see them extending aid debt relief to more countries.
<P>

<a name="90203w09.html_para0">My greatest concern remains that debt relief should be linked to poverty reduction. This aspiration was contained in Chancellor Schroeder's proposals. We have pressed that the IMF/World Bank review of HIPC should give more emphasis to the link between debt relief and poverty reduction.

<P>
<a name="90203w09.html_spnew7"><B> Clare Short: </B> 
 The provision of medical assistance for children caught up in emergencies is considered alongside other needs as an integral part of our humanitarian assistance provided in response to crises caused by conflicts and natural disasters. We channel support through United Nations agencies, the Red Cross and non-governmental organisations; looking first to agencies that are well established in the country and have the local knowledge and expertise to deliver assistance most effectively. Children affected by armed conflict have special needs for protection, and we strongly support the efforts of the Special representative of the United Nations Secretary-General on children in armed conflict, and UNICEF, to promote the safety and welfare of children in war zones.

<P>

<a name="90203w09.html_para4">The Commonwealth Development Corporation needs to be tax efficient if it is to be able to achieve its goal of investing in developing countries using private capital raised within the context of a competitive private investment market dominated by offshore funds. In order to compete directly with offshore funds for private capital for investment in its area, CDC would need to provide a similar financial return. A material UK tax charge within CDC would make this less achievable.

 We are deeply disturbed about the impact of the ongoing conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the consequences for the people throughout the Great Lakes region. The involvement of so many other countries in the continuing conflict in the DRC and the risks of escalation are very serious. We are ready to provide humanitarian assistance where this is possible. But a ceasefire is needed urgently. Britain is supporting efforts by President Chiluba and other regional leaders to secure this ceasefire and to find a political solution which will protect the sovereignty of the DRC, ensure the rights and protection of all Congolese and address the security concerns of neighbouring countries.
<P>

<a name="90203w09.html_para5">An important part of the solution will be progress on reconciliation in Rwanda. Rwanda needs international support to help it achieve peace and reconciliation and I have agreed to provide &#163;30 million in three annual grants to help.

 Access to clear, safe, water is a major focus for our programme as it is crucial to health, agriculture and freeing women and girls' time for education and production. We are giving increased focus to water and sanitation in our work.

<P>
<a name="90203w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 No specific discussion have been held between Ministers and Senior Officers on their responsibilities in ensuring the welfare and protection of young children living on military bases. The Ministry of Defence does, however, takes very seriously its responsibilities of duty of care towards its personnel and their dependants. Commanding Officers are made well aware of their duty towards the welfare of all personnel and their dependants, through instructions issued through the chain of Command.
<P>

<a name="90203w12.html_para4">In the United Kingdom, the Ministry of Defence does not have statutory responsibility in matters of child welfare and protection. This responsibility falls to the relevant local authority. Under the Children Act 1989, it is the statutory duty of the local authority, to investigate cases where it believes a child is suffering, or is likely to suffer, harm. Service authorities are, however, required to notify the local Director of Social Services off any cases of abuse of which they become aware and any further action is to be taken in collaboration with the other agencies involved.
<P>

<a name="90203w12.html_para5">Overseas, the Ministry of Defence acts as a de facto local authority and replicates those statutory responsibilities falling to local authorities in the United Kingdom. All statutory health care and social services are provided for, and on behalf of, the Department under contract by the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association--Forces Help, which employs appropriately qualified social work staff. The SSAFA-FH social work service works in close co-operation with military authorities, Service police, medical and health professionals in accordance with Defence Council Instructions and The Armed Forces (Protection of Children of Service Families) Regulations 1996.

On current plans, this collaborative programme will start initial production in 2004, with initial deliveries to the UK in 2006. The system is expected to enter UK service in 2010.

 SFOR does not have a "de-mining programme" and does not undertake de-mining in Bosnia and Herzegovina other than in support of its own operations. Under the General Framework Agreement for Peace (the Dayton Accords) the responsibility for mine clearance lies with the Entity Armed Forces. SFOR's involvement is limited to monitoring their progress and to the provision of mine awareness training.

It is intended to be fitted on Tornado GR4, Harrier GR7 and Eurofighter. The major programme milestone is to finalise development and commence production in the spring/summer of 2001.

 The Brora bypass, Portgower to Green Park and Crackaig to Culgower schemes were progressed to outline feasibility stage in the early 1990s. However in 1995 the Government announced the A9 Dornoch to Scrabster Route Action Plan (RAP). The objectives of this plan were to consider (i) road safety, (ii) consistent journey times, (iii) improved overtaking opportunities, and (iv) traffic calming through the communities. The 3 schemes are being assessed against this criteria. Improvement schemes identified in the RAP will be implemented subject to competing priorities on the trunk road network and the availability of appropriate levels of funding.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w16.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Rammell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment which measures of local deprivation his Department and its agencies use in considering allocation of funds to local projects.  [66718]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Andrew Smith: </B> 
 This Department's policies are central to local activity in addressing social exclusion and in stimulating the regeneration of deprived communities. As well as our mainstream funding of education and employment initiatives, the Department leads on a number of local area-based initiatives which aim to raise educational standards, improve skills and employability and encourage lifelong learning. This Department is keen to ensure that disadvantaged communities benefit, and therefore includes measures of deprivation when selecting areas in which initiatives will operate. As well as using a variety of data sources, including the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions' Index of Deprivation, the Department also recognises that the identification of pockets of deprivation in otherwise non-deprived areas needs local knowledge.
<P>

<a name="90203w16.html_para0">The range of indices used for each initiative varies depending on the policy objectives, as the following examples illustrate.
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) Assessment of Education Action Zones draws on indicators of deprivation at school level, such as eligibility for free school meals.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) The second round of New Start partnerships which are focused on areas which show relatively high levels of disengagement from learning by young people. Government Offices also used information available to them on levels of deprivation to select the project areas.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) The selection of Employment Zones used indices based on the level of long-term unemployment (12 months and over, and 18 months and over) and the local employment rate.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1></FONT></UL>
<P>

<a name="90203w16.html_para1">The selection of successful bids for running most pilots or area-based initiatives is also based on the quality of plans and feasibility of proposals. A final criterion for selecting pilot areas is an assessment of what is already happening in the area to avoid partnerships being overburdened by the bureaucracy involved in participating in different initiatives. This Department is very supportive of the DETR's work in improving the co-ordination of area-based initiatives so that communities can benefit from a coherent approach to regeneration in their area.

Where a grant-maintained school's budget for 1999-2000, as calculated through its local education authority's Fair Funding allocation formula, is greater than its protected level of funding, calculated from its 1998-99 funding per pupil, it will receive that higher amount.

(18) Information for items prescribed and dispensed in National Health Service hospitals is not available.<P>

<P>

(19) The prescription information was obtained from the Prescribing Analyses and Cost (PACT) system and is based on a full analysis of all prescriptions written by general practitioners and Practice Nurses in England which are dispensed in England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man. All figures exclude dressings and appliances.<P>

(20) Drugs prescribed by prescribing practices which are dispensed by community pharmacists.<P>

<P>

(21) Includes drugs prescribed by dispensing practices which are dispensed by community pharmacists.<P>

<P>

(22) The net ingredient cost is the basic cost of a drug. This cost does not take account of discounts, dispensing costs, fees or prescription charge income.<P>

<P>

(23) The number of patients is derived from patient lists and includes temporary patients. The patient list size is based on information submitted by practices to the Prescription Pricing Authority. List size as at March 1998 has been used. Figures for average net ingredient cost per patient have been rounded to the nearest &#163;.<P>

<P>

(24) In PACT, prescription items can be prescribed generically, and recorded as a generic, but dispensed and reimbursed as a proprietary because a generic does not exist. The percentage of non generic drugs prescribed in the reply does not include these items. <P>

 In 1997-98 total National Health Service expenditure on drugs was &#163;5,195 million. Drugs prescribed by Family Health Services (FHS) practitioners account for &#163;4,107 million of the total, and those prescribed by hospital and community health service (HCHS) providers account for &#163;1,088 million.

 Ministers have asked the Medicines Control Agency, in the light of the expansion in the range of herbal remedies on the market in recent years, to consider whether there is a need to update the lists of specified potent or toxic herbs which are subject to restrictions on sale and supply.

<a name="90203w18.html_para1"><i>Letter from Peter Mathison to Mr. David Hinchliffe, dated 2 February 1999:</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I am replying to your recent Parliamentary Question asking what level of qualifications and experience is required for those undertaking the role of independent adjudication officers in social security cases, what medical training or guidance they receive with regard to their duties, and if he will make a statement.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The relevant experience of Benefits Agency staff appointed to be Adjudication Officers (AOs) is taken into account in deciding the level of duties undertaken. AOs considering Disability Living Allowance (DLA), Attendance Allowance claims and questions in relation to claims for Industrial Injury Disablement Benefits are of an executive grade. The minimum qualifications for direct entry into this grade are five 'O' levels/GCSEs and two A levels.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Prior to commencing their duties all AOs receive a full adjudication training programme as well as periodic refresher training as and when appropriate, for example when changes in legislation occur. In addition to training, both general and specific adjudication guidance is provided in the Adjudication Officer's Guide issued by Central Adjudication Services.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Non medical adjudication officers have access to Medical Services as a source of advice when considering adjudication decisions on claims to disability benefits including Incapacity Benefit (IB). This advice may take the form of specific advice on a particular query, or a full medical report following examination of the claimant. For the All Work Test on IB the medical report forms part of the evidence of AO uses in reaching their decision.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Guidance is also available to AOs dealing with DLA in the form of the Disability Handbook which provides information on the likely effects on a variety of medical conditions. The Handbook has been written by medical staff of the Department of Social Security with advice from the DLA Advisory Board and contributions from many organisations representing people with disabilities. Decisions on entitlement to DLA are not medical decisions although AOs may consult Medical Services doctors for advice when considering more complex cases. Medical services doctors, who are all experienced medical practitioners, receive special training for this role.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Some adjudication decisions, in claims for Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit and Severe Disablement Allowance, are made by Adjudicating Medical Authorities (AMAs). These individuals are fully qualified medical practitioners with wide experience of general medicine. In addition the AMA will undergo specific training to enable them to undertake this specialised form of assessment. The Chief Medical Advisor to the Department of Social Security formally appoints the AMA on successful completion of this training and the length of the appointment is dependent on the doctor maintaining the quality and professional standards laid down for them. In addition to their formal training AMAs are issued with Handbooks, for each of the above benefits, which acts as an aide memoire to the doctor and which cover all aspects of this work.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Under the Government's Decision Making and Appeals (DMA) provisions medical examinations will remain the same. However for IIDB and SDA instead of making a decision under DMA the AMA will instead offer advice in the form of a doctor's report. The Decision maker will be guided by the Doctor's Report in reaching their decision on any entitlement to benefit.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Mr. Gilbert submitted a DLA claim on 21 February 1995 and was awarded the higher rate of the mobility component from and including 7 February 1995.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On 29 February 1996, Mr. Gilbert requested a review and asked for care needs to be considered. He was awarded the lowest rate of the care component from and including 1 March 1996. His entitlement to the mobility component was unaffected.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On 29 October 1998, Mr. Gilbert asked for a review of his entitlement to the care component. He completed a claim pack with details of his current care needs but on 9 December 1998 an adjudication officer (AO) was unable to find grounds to review the previous decision. The decision was notified to Mr. Gilbert on 23 December 1998 with details about his right of review within 3 months.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I should explain that if a review is requested more than 3 months after the previous decision was notified, the decision may only be reviewed if specific criteria are satisfied. For example, the previous decision must have been made in ignorance of a material fact, or based on a mistake as to a material fact, or there must have been a relevant change of circumstances.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On 13 January 1999, a request for an appeal to a Disability Appeal Tribunal against the decision dated 9 December 1998 was received from Mr. Gilbert. The team leader of the operational section responsible for Mr. Gilbert's claim telephoned him on 28 January and explained that the correct next stage in the adjudication process was a review and that this would include a full explanation of the reasons for the decision. Mr. Gilbert said he was happy about this and had merely been confused about the procedures when he requested an appeal. The team leader explained that if Mr. Gilbert was dissatisfied with the outcome of the review decision, he would then have the right to request an appeal to a Tribunal within 3 months of the notification date.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>On 28 January a different AO considered all the evidence, including further clarification of his care needs given by Mr. Gilbert during his telephone conversation with the operational team leader. A review decision, upholding the previous decision, was completed on 28 January and was issued to Mr. Gilbert on 1 February 1999. The decision carries the right of appeal to a Disability Appeal Tribunal.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>If Mr. Gilbert does request an appeal against the decision of 28 January, the Independent Tribunal Service (ITS) will be responsible for the administration of the appeal hearing and for inviting Mr. Gilbert to attend. The ITS is wholly independent of the Benefits Agency.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Secretary of State for Social Security has asked me to respond to your recent Parliamentary Questions asking, how many arrests have been made each month by Benefits Agency Security Investigation Service (BASIS) Southern Command since its establishment to date, and how many of the investigating team of BASIS Southern Command were restricted to work in their office and unable to pursue investigations in the field from September 1998 to date.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the period April to December 1998 BASIS investigations resulted in 667 arrests. BASIS investigators do not have powers of arrest and therefore these arrests were effected by the police. Of these, 350 arrests related to investigations conducted by the Southern Unit teams and a monthly breakdown of these is shown on the attached table.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>No BASIS team has been restricted to work in their office other than where this has been necessary to complete the detailed court preparation work following an intensive investigation.</FONT></UL>

Decisions have yet to be made about the distribution of these resources between different programmes. We have recently consulted on a proposal to combine capital receipts initiative and other housing capital support (apart from that for disabled facilities grants) into a single funding regime from 2000-01 onwards.

 At the Annual Meetings of the IMF and World Bank in October 1998 the Chancellor secured agreement on his proposals for a comprehensive review of the HIPC initiative in 1999, and is currently pressing for the review to address, among other things, the timing of debt relief given under the initiative.
<P>

<a name="90203w20.html_para4">The decision was also taken to allow IMF post conflict assistance programmes to count towards a country's track record under the HIPC initiative. This could bring decision points (and therefore debt relief) forward by up to twelve months for certain countries such as Rwanda.

 31 out of 40 countries originally identified by the IMF/World Bank as being eligible for inclusion into the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) initiative have begun the process of securing a sustainable exit to their debt burden. Two countries have reached the end of the process. A further seven countries have reached Decision Point.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w20.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Milburn: </B> 
 The Government have today published a consultation document, "Helping to deliver stakeholder pensions: flexibility in pension investment". Copies are 



<P>
<P><I>3 Feb 1999 : Column: 678</I><P>
available in the Vote Office and in the Library of the House. This takes forward the remit in the Green Paper "A new contract for welfare: partnership in pension", Cm 4179, chapter 7, paragraph 39. This contribution to the Government's pension reform strategy opens up potential for greater transparency in the pensions market which should in turn improve labour market flexibility and contribute to the strategy for improving productivity discussed in the Pre Budget Report, Cm 4076.
<P>

<a name="90203w20.html_para6">The financial instrument proposed in the document will be suitable for any kind of defined contribution pension: personal, occupational and, in time, stakeholder. It is not a pension in its own right. It will hold units in pooled investment schemes, making it possible for scheme members to move easily and at low cost between different kinds of pension, for example on a change of employment or a move into self employment.

<P>
<a name="90203w20.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. George Robertson: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="90203w20.html_para7">The UN Special Commission on Iraq believes it has accounted for all but two of Iraq's 819 Soviet origin SCUDs and all declared launch vehicles. However, owing to the indigenous production of components and uncertainties attending the verification of the destruction of complete missiles, it is possible that Iraq has concealed a small number of 650km range SCUD type missiles. It is also possible that components were removed from missiles that were unilaterally destroyed.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w20.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 It is for the Maltese Government to make representations to the Turkish Government to request the death penalty is not used against the suspect. The UK, along with our EU partners, opposes the use of the death penalty, and calls upon all States to abolish it.

<a name="90203w20.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the meeting between Baroness Symons and the Turkish Ambassador on 7 January 1999 in respect of the Edgar Fernandes case; what was the result of that meeting; and what action his Department has taken since then.

<a name="90203w20.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 My noble Friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State had a private meeting with the Turkish Ambassador on 7 January 1999 at which they discussed a variety of bilateral issues.

 Overseas posts' budgets, including entertainment budgets, are devolved to each post. No central record is kept of detailed budget allocations for each post, and they could only be provided at excessive cost. However, central records are kept of posts expenditure, and the figures for 1997-98 are set out below.

<a name="90203w21.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 Saladin and Saracen armoured vehicles were exported to Indonesia in the 1960s. No formal mechanisms exist for monitoring the use of British defence equipment once it has been exported. We have made clear to the Indonesian authorities that British supplied equipment should not be used against civilians to prevent the exercise of their rights of free expression, assembly and association, or in violation of other international human rights standards.

<a name="90203w21.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 No amendments to the CFE Treaty are required before the accession of new members to NATO. But our aim is that the process of adapting the Treaty, under way since 1996, will result in an agreement which better reflects the realities of today's European security environment, by moving the Treaty from a structure based on the Cold War military alliances to one based on national limits.

<a name="90203w21.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 There are no plans to make any substantive changes to the criteria.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w21.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We do not have a list of countries which sponsor terrorism. This Government condemn state sponsorship of terrorism and monitors closely any evidence of such activities. Where there is evidence, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office makes the governments in question aware of our concerns as and when they arise.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 The fatwa against Salman Rushdie was decreed by the late Ayatollah Khomenei, not by any organisation or group of organisations. Ayatollah Khomenei died in 1989. A number of groups, Iranian and non-Iranian, have made statements about the fatwa over the years; many of them are of obscure status. The Iranian government have made clear their position, that they have no intention of taking any action against Salman Rushdie, nor will they encourage or assist anybody else to do so. We welcome these assurances.

<a name="90203w21.html_para4">The European Union, including individual member states, has made a major contribution to supporting the Middle East Peace Process by providing 54 per cent. ($1.7 billion) of total development assistance to the Palestinians since 1993. This includes over 650 mecu provided directly by the European Commission to the Palestinian Authority.
<P>

<a name="90203w21.html_para5">To enable member states to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of EC aid, we have pressed for an evaluation of the EC's last five-year programme of assistance for the Palestinians, which ended in December 1998. We understand that this evaluation is soon to be finalised, and expect the findings to be formally presented by the Commission shortly. As soon as they are available, we will place a copy in the Library.

<a name="90203w21.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Fatchett: </B> 
 We commend Palestinian efforts to clamp down on terrorism and their compliance so far with the security commitments signed up to in the Wye River Memorandum. Measures taken by the Palestinian Authority include the arrest of terrorist suspects, collection of illegal weapons, anti-incitement laws and provision of security plans to the Israelis. Meetings of the bilateral and trilateral committees on security issues continue to take place. We are glad to be able to assist the Palestinians in their efforts through major EU programmes of counter-terrorism assistance and security assistance. But there is still room for improvement and we urge continued co-operation between the parties to implement Wye.

<P>
<P>
<a name="90203w21.html_spnew23"><B> Mr. Tony Lloyd: </B> 
 We remain extremely concerned by Iran's flight test of its Shahab-3 ballistic missile in July of last year. The acquisition of this system, with an approximate range of 1300km, threatens the stability of the whole of the Middle East. We assess that though the Shahab-3 is at a relatively advanced stage of its development, Iran will not be able to deploy the system in the immediate future. Whilst we understand Iran's legitimate security concerns, we have repeatedly urged the Iranian authorities to refrain from developing ballistic missiles. It is in nobody's interest for an arms race to develop in this already volatile region.
<P>

<a name="90203w21.html_para7">The UK, as a founder member of the Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR), works with its partners to halt the proliferation of ballistic missile programmes of concern.

 We are in close contact with both sides and also with the US which plays a key role in monitoring compliance with the Wye Memorandum. Our Missions in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem also carefully monitor the level of compliance on the ground. Both the US and the Israelis declared themselves satisfied with Palestinian compliance with their commitments under Wye prior to the first redeployment on 20 November. Since then we continue to believe the Palestinians have made good progress.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1><i>Viable</i> GM feed materials--ie., those capable of replication--are regulated under Council Directive 90/220 on the Deliberate Release of GMOs. Following a 1997 amendment to this Directive, any <i>viable</i> GM materials subsequently issued with a marketing consent are required to be labelled, although these provisions are non-specific. Because this amendment was not retrospective, the Monsanto soya and Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis) maize already authorised are not subject to these requirements for feed use. However, this is largely academic, as the vast majority of feed materials are processed by-products (ie., <i>non-viable</i>).</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In the absence of crop segregation and comprehensive legislative requirements, it is not possible to know the extent to which GM material is being used in animal feed in the UK. However, given the widespread use of materials derived from soya and maize, the probability is that some is present, although most likely in processed form (eg., maize gluten feed). Moreover, there could also be by-products from GM crops, such as cotton seed, which have been grown in the USA but for which marketing consent has not been sought in Europe under 90.220.</FONT></UL>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>With regard to the effects of processing on GM material, it is known that this disrupts DNA. In the case of the Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis) maize, tests were conducted on maize gluten feed which indicated that the antibiotic resistance gene plus its replicator could not have survived processing. Further work on the effects of processing for a number of crops is being undertaken.</FONT></UL>

 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> The Government do not commission research into an individual company's crops but can require additional work to be undertaken by all companies themselves when this is considered to be necessary. All toxicology data submitted for safety evaluation is required to have been produced to Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) standards. Under GLP, all studies must follow written standard procedures and all laboratory records and samples must be archived. All UK GLP certified laboratories are subject to independent inspections by Department of Health inspectors in accordance with EC requirements. Laboratories in the USA are subject to GLP inspections by the US authorities.

In addition, the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes strongly encourages companies seeking food safety assessment to deposit a copy of their submissions with the British Library.

To ask the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food what plans he has to ensure that consumers can purchase animal produce which does not originate from animals fed genetically modified feed.  [68777]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 2 February 1999]:</i> All genetically modified (GM) animal feed is rigorously assessed to ensure that the safety of consumers is not compromised by its use. However the Government recognise the desire of some consumers to be able to purchase products that have not been produced in this way. We therefore welcome the EC Commissions intention to draft a regulation on the labelling of GM Feed which will enable this wish to be satisfied. This is expected to be presented to the Council for agreement later this year. In the meantime, organic food producers and some others are already offering products which meet the needs of consumers who do not wish to purchase food produced using this feed.
