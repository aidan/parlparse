<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Miller: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what plans he has to reform the law relating to involuntary manslaughter, and in particular corporate manslaughter; and if he will make a statement.  [123518]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have today issued a consultation document containing the Government's proposals on how the law on involuntary manslaughter might be reformed. The paper accepts and builds on the Law Commission's proposals contained in their report number 237, "Legislating the Criminal Code: Involuntary Manslaughter".
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para0">Copies of the consultation document have been placed in the Library.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para1">This is an important document dealing with a complex area of the law, but one which most commentators accept is in need of reform. The Government are deeply indebted to the Law Commission, not only for the detailed consideration they gave to this subject in their report number 237, but for their continuing help by participating in the inter-departmental working group we set up to consider their proposals.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para2">The consultation document concentrates on those areas of the Law Commission's proposals which are more contentious or where, for the reasons set out in the document, we have taken a different view from the Law Commission. In a number of areas we have not come to any conclusion but are seeking comments on possible options.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para3">We wish to clarify and rationalise the existing law relating to individual involuntary homicide and we agree with the Law Commission that the law relating to corporate liability for involuntary manslaughter is in need of radical reform. Our proposals in this respect raise important and difficult issues of policy, principle and practice.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para4">I would urge all those who are concerned about the reform of the law on involuntary manslaughter to read this paper and respond to it.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Burgon: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he intends to publish the criminal justice system business plan.  [123711]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 My right hon. and noble Friends the Attorney-General, Lord Williams of Mostyn QC, the Lord Chancellor, Lord Irvine of Lairg, and I will today be publishing jointly a Business Plan for the criminal justice system in England and Wales 2000-01.




<P>
<P><I>23 May 2000 : Column: 396W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para5">The Plan describes the aims, objectives and performance targets that the Government expect the criminal justice system as a whole to work to deliver.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Pond: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will announce the results of the consultation process on the design of a pilot study for financial bonds for visitors under sections 16 and 17 of the Immigration and Asylum Act.  [123712]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_spnew2"><B> Mrs. Roche: </B> 
 I have today placed in the Library a detailed analysis of responses to our recent consultation paper on bonds for visitors, together with an analysis of responses to this proposal in the 1998 White Paper on Immigration and Asylum. I am grateful to all those who responded to our consultation document. We have taken full account of their views, and of the many other representations made to us, in considering how the pilot study should run.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para7">The pilot study on financial bonds will begin in October at two posts overseas, Manila and Casablanca. It will run for six months, followed by a further six months to monitor departure from the United Kingdom, and a further brief period for analysis of the results.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para8">The scheme is intended to enable more people to visit the United Kingdom by providing an additional facility to prospective visitors in borderline cases where their intention to return is in doubt. It will enable a British Citizen or overseas national settled in the United Kingdom who is a family member to provide a financial bond, in the form of a cash payment in advance, as an additional guarantee that the visitor will leave the United Kingdom at the end of their stay. The scheme will be open only to those seeking to visit close family members in the United Kingdom. The amount of the bond will be set at &#163;3,000. The bond will be returned when the visitor leaves the United Kingdom.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para9">We shall monitor the scheme closely to ensure that it operates fairly, effectively and swiftly. We shall make available our analysis of the operation of the pilot study when it is complete.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para10">Further details about how the scheme will operate will be provided nearer the time.

<a name="00523w01.html_sbhd3"><H4><center>Pet Cloning</center></H4>


<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what guidelines exist in respect of the use of DNA from pets for future cloning purposes; and if he will make a statement.  [122920]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The cloning of a pet animal would not be a permissible purpose under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 which the Home Office operates. There are, therefore, no guidelines for the use of DNA from companion animals for cloning purposes.

<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Prison education is contracted out. The Prison Service purchases and measures education in terms of teaching hours rather than numbers of teaching staff. The number of teaching hours purchased in each of the last five years is given in the table.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what the procedure is for prisoners receiving educational publications from relatives.  [123492]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Educational publications for prisoners, such as books or periodicals, can either be left at reception, brought in on visits or sent in by post. These would be checked by prison staff before being passed on to the prisoner.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para11">The governor of each establishment has the discretion to restrict the handing or sending in of any item of property. If the governor of an establishment restricts the handing or sending in of property which prisoners may normally have in their possession, facilities will be made available for prisoners to purchase these items either through the prison shop or through approved mail order arrangements by using their private cash and/or earnings.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what educational facilities are available in the Aylesbury Young Offenders Institution.  [123493]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 The education department at Aylesbury Young Offenders Institution is run by Amersham and Wycombe College, which is expected to deliver 16,000 hours of education classes in the current financial year. Prisoners who are employed on a full-time basis have access to two hours education per week, and those in part-time employment for approximately 12 and a half hours per week. A wide range of courses is available and prisoners' individual needs are identified as part of their sentence plan.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how many prisoners undertake distance-learning courses at their own expense.  [123498]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 As at 3 April 2000, a total of 383 prisoners in England and Wales were registered on Open University distance-learning courses. Of these, 139 have not previously studied with the Open University.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para12">A range of other distance-learning courses are available in prison, including GCSE, A level and vocational courses.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para13">The majority of prisoners undertaking distance-learning courses pay for their courses through mixed funding arrangements, including self funding and charitable funding. Information on the number of prisoners who undertake distance-learning courses entirely at their own cost is not held centrally.

<a name="00523w01.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Loughton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department how much has been spent on educational facilities in prisons and other custodial institutions in each of the last five years.  [123495]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Information is not available centrally on funds spent at individual prison establishments specifically on the provision of educational facilities over the last five years.
<P>

<a name="00523w01.html_para14">However, funds from the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) have been made available to prison establishments to spend mainly on enhancing basic and key skills through, for example, extending education contracts, improvements to prisoners' basic pay to encourage them to participate in basic education, training Prison Service staff as basic skill support tutors and developing imaginative integrated basic skills tuition. Some of this money will also be invested in enhancing educational facilities. The table gives a breakdown of these funds provided to each prison establishment over the three year period covered by the CSR.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what educational facilities are available to sex offenders in prisons held in accommodation separate from other prisoners.  [123497]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 It is not possible to identify separately the education provision for sex offenders. The Prison Service aims to provide them with similar education facilities to other prisoners. However, where sex offenders have to be segregated for their own protection pending allocation to a prison which offers suitable training facilities for them, safety considerations may limit their access to education.

 At Aylesbury, sex offenders are fully integrated with the rest of the establishment's population and have access to the same education.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. To date (19 May) there have been 35 self-inflicted deaths in prison custody in England and Wales.<P>

2. Totals for each year contain the numbers of all self-inflicted deaths in prison custody; not only those deaths where there has been an inquest verdict of suicide.<P>

3. The term employed by the Prison Service to refer to an apparent suicide is "self-inflicted death". This is broader than the term suicide and includes all those deaths where it is clear that the person has acted specifically to take his/her own life. It is not restricted to the official verdict from the Coroner's inquest where verdicts of "open" or "misadventure" may be recorded in cases where there was doubt about a person's intent to end their life. <P>

<a name="00523w02.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The 15 individuals arrested in Copenhagen were not convicted of any offence and no legal action can be taken against them in the United Kingdom. None are subject to a restriction or any other category of football banning order. Under current football legislation, the only individuals who can be prevented from travelling to Euro 2000 are the 106 hooligans currently subject to an international ban. However, the Dutch and Belgian police have extensive powers to refuse

entry to any individual or group felt to pose a risk to public order. The National Criminal Intelligence Service will provide them with details of the 15 individuals along with details of the 388 persons currently subject to domestic football bans. Police will be monitoring all England supporters at every United Kingdom exit point throughout the tournament and the information gathered will be shared with the Dutch, Belgian and French police, in addition to the United Kingdom police teams operating in all three countries.

<P>
<a name="00523w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 No such powers are available to the Secretary of State.
<P>

<a name="00523w02.html_para0">The Crossbows Act 1987 applies to crossbows with a draw weight of 1.4 kilogrammes or greater. It makes it an offence to sell or hire a crossbow to persons under the age of 17, and prohibits persons aged under 17 from possessing a crossbow unless supervised by someone aged 21 or over.
<P>

<a name="00523w02.html_para1">In addition, the Prevention of Crime Act 1953 prohibits the possession in a public place of any offensive weapon without good reason or lawful excuse.

<P>
<P>

 The decision whether to charge for costs of policing at local events is for the local police authority and the Chief Constable.

<a name="00523w02.html_para5">The rationale behind charging is that the taxpayer at large should not be asked to pay for services provided at private events or events which benefit only a relatively small section of the community.

<P>

<a name="00523w02.html_para10">As of 30 April 2000, 710 prisoners placed on the Home Detention Curfew scheme had breached the conditions of the curfew.
<P>

<a name="00523w02.html_para11">Information on curfewees whose licences are revoked and who disappear before being recaptured is not held centrally. However, information is held on the number of curfewees unlawfully at large at any one time. On 30 April, there were 40 curfewees who remained unlawfully at large. This represents less than 5 per cent. of the total number of revocations. In the vast majority of cases, when a curfewee's licence is revoked, he can expect to be quickly apprehended and returned to custody. While the priority to be given to pursuing individual cases will be an operational matter for local police forces, Home Office Circular 1/1999 made clear that Home Detention Curfew recalls should be regarded as "urgent action" cases. In addition, the National Identification Service at New Scotland Yard issues "The Police Gazette" weekly to all police forces, including details of curfewees who are unlawfully at large. When curfewees are apprehended following a period unlawfully at large, they are required to serve the period of time outstanding at the point their licence was revoked.

<a name="00523w02.html_para12">As of 30 April 2000, 965 curfewees had their licences revoked, using the powers available to the Secretary of State under Sections 38A(1) and 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The reasons for revocation were as follows:

 Information held centrally on the Home Office Court Proceedings Database combines sections 50(2)(3), 68(2) and 170(1)(2) of the Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 "Fraudulent evasion of duty etc. other than drugs". However, the type of goods involved (tobacco, spirits, beers, wines, oils and guns) are not identified separately.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his policy is in respect of experiments involving animals where the primary objective is to obtain information concerning human medical conditions which can reasonably be assumed to be self-inflicted.  [122918]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w03.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Evaluating research proposals involving the use of animals is difficult and requires a delicate moral balance to be struck. Scientific developments have saved many human lives and cured many illnesses. Human medical conditions are likely to 



<P>
<P><I>23 May 2000 : Column: 407W</I><P>
derive from a variety of causes. For example, bronchitis and emphysema can be caused by a genetic predisposition, various occupational causes and passive smoking as well as smoking. It would be immoral, in our view, to deny victims of such diseases the assistance that new scientific knowledge could bring from current work.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w03.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department when he plans to establish a Royal Commission into animal experimentation.  [122940]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w03.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The position remains that we have not ruled out a Royal Commission, but strongly believe that resources can best be used to make immediate improvements to the operation of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and to promote the fullest application of the 3Rs: to replace the use of animals with alternative methods, to reduce the numbers of animals used and to refine the procedures to minimise pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm.
<P>

<a name="00523w03.html_para0">In this context, the Animal Procedures Committee will be issuing a public consultation paper this summer as part of its review of the cost/benefit assessment. As part of this work, the Committee plans to produce an authoritative statement on the validity of animal experiments.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w03.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his policy is in respect of animal experiments where the sole or primary purpose is one of commercial gain.  [122916]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w03.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Section 5(4) of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 requires that, in determining whether and on what terms to grant a project licence, the Secretary of State must weigh the likely adverse effects on the animals concerned against the benefit likely to accrue as a result of the programme specified on the application.
<P>

<a name="00523w03.html_para1">For the purposes of the cost/benefit assessment, the cost to the animal is considered as the adverse effects of pain, suffering, distress or lasting harm. The benefits must be for humans, animals or the environment and relate to the scientific and/or medical progress likely to result directly from the programme outlined in the application.
<P>

<a name="00523w03.html_para2">The identification and assessment of benefit is set out in detail in the Chief Inspector's paper on the cost/benefit assessment, included in the Annual Report of the Animal Procedures Committee for 1997. My policy is that the profitability of a company applying for authorities and the researchers' career prospects are not valid considerations for the purposes of the cost/benefit assessment, but that the socio-economic advantages of cheaper healthcare cannot be ruled out as possible legitimate benefits.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w03.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department (1) what criteria have been used to make appointments to the Inspectorate in respect of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986; what plans he has to review these criteria; and if he will make a statement;  [122305]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will list the names of those appointed to the Inspectorate in respect of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986;  [122306]
<P>
(3) what steps he is taking to ensure that those inspectors appointed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to investigate allegations against

<UL>licence holders have not been party to the original decision on granting that licence; and if he will make a statement;  [122302]
<P>
(4) how many establishments have been inspected by the Inspectorate appointed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 over the last three years; and with respect to each establishment of how many visits notification of the inspection was given; how many visits were unannounced; and if he will make a statement.  [122304]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w03.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 There are approximately 300 designated establishments and the Inspectorate visits all of them. The number of visits to each establishment varies according to its size and the type of work being conducted at any particular time.
<P>

<a name="00523w03.html_para3">Approximately 1,800 visits of inspection are conducted each year, two-thirds of which are without notice. Visits by appointment are usually made to conduct interviews with staff, to discuss new work proposals and ongoing work, to examine records of work, to investigate non-compliance or to view premises being considered for designation.
<P>

<a name="00523w03.html_para4">When third party allegations are made against establishments or individuals, the investigation is handled by a Superintending Inspector from another region with no connection with the establishment or person, and no line management responsibility for the local inspector. The Chief Inspector quality assures these investigations and the resulting reports.
<P>

<a name="00523w03.html_para5">The 1986 Act requires that Inspectors must be either medical or veterinary graduates: the former must be registered with the General Medical Council and the latter must be Members of the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons.
<P>

<a name="00523w03.html_para6">Candidates are expected to have additional higher professional or academic qualifications, and to have first hand experience of designing and conducting research in a clinical, academic or commercial environment. They must have a sound knowledge of medicine and surgery and be familiar with current trends and technologies used in medical and biological research.
<P>

<a name="00523w03.html_para7">Members of the Inspectorate are civil servants, appointed to advise the Secretary of State whether and on what terms authorities should be granted under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. It is the Secretary of State who has ultimate responsibility for deciding what is licensed and the conditions which will apply. It is not normal practice to reveal widely the names of individuals where it is not in the interests of personal safety and security to do so.

 UN sanctions are already designed to target the Revolutionary United Front.

It also imposes an embargo on the supply of arms and related material to Sierra Leone other than to the Government of Sierra Leone (with certain exemptions). We have not discussed the option of freezing the bank accounts of leading members of the Revolutionary United Front and their families with the US Administration or with European counterparts. However, the UK will ensure that the Security Council keeps the impact and effectiveness of sanctions under review and will make proposals for modification of the sanctions regime as we consider appropriate.

 <i>[holding answer 22 May 2000]:</i> Where mortgage borrowers have been mis-sold an endowment, the regulators have powers to take disciplinary action which can result in firms being directed to make compensation. Mis-selling may arise from unsuitable advice, ie recommending that a borrower plans to repay a mortgage with a product which is either

unsuitable for the purpose or unsuitable for the borrower's circumstances. The Government intend that the FSA will have comparable powers under the Financial Services and Markets Bill when enacted.
<P>

<a name="00523w05.html_para4">Recently many endowment providers have contacted their customers to tell them that their endowments may not yield enough to repay associated mortgages. This does not necessarily arise from mis-selling and reflects the reduction in inflation in response to the Government's policy to deliver a stable macroeconomic environment conducive to long term economic growth. When inflation falls, investment returns also reduce so that the cash proceeds of an endowment may be lower than initially expected, eg insufficient to repay an associated mortgage.

 The amount of excise duty raised on road fuels for the last five years is published in Table K2 of "HM Customs and Excise Annual Report 1998-1999". The estimated amount of VAT raised on road fuels can be calculated from the amount of household expenditure on petrol and derv. This is shown in Table 6.1 of "Consumer Trends", published by the Office for National Statistics.

<a name="00523w07.html_wqn3"><B> Mrs. Brinton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what consultations he has had with <i>(a)</i> medical <i>(b)</i> patient and <i>(c)</i> other organisations as part of the review of the funding of specialised neurology services;  [122579]
<P>
<UL>
<P>
(2) what representations he has received from <i>(a)</i> medical, <i>(b)</i> patient and <i>(c)</i> other organisations as part of the review into the funding of specialised neurology services.  [122580]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w07.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 We are currently considering how best to undertake an independent review of the evidence for the use of neurostimulator implants in the treatment of severe Parkinson's Disease and we are not in a position at the moment to undertake consultations. Once we have established the best mechanism for taking this work forward we will then consult with the relevant bodies.
<P>

<a name="00523w07.html_para1">Since February 2000 we have responded to 35 representations in the form of ministerial correspondence regarding specialised neurology treatments. These representations are categorised as follows:
<P>

<a name="00523w07.html_para2">

<BR>
<i>(a)</i> Medical: 6
<BR>
<i>(b)</i> Patients: 1
<BR>
<i>(c)</i> Other organisations: 25 (generally the Parkinson's Disease Society and its local branches)
<BR>
<i>(d)</i> Hon. Members' constituents: 3 (whether clinician or patient is unknown)
<BR>


<P>

<a name="00523w07.html_para3">In addition, we have responded to three pieces of ministerial correspondence about the use of out of area treatments to fund specialised treatments in general.
<P>

<a name="00523w07.html_para4">Officials regularly meet with representatives from a range of the relevant voluntary and patient organisations.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w07.html_wqn4"><B> Mrs. Brinton: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Health what progress has been made in implementing service agreements for neurosurgery and specialist neurology in the Eastern region.  [122578]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Denham: </B> 
 The Eastern Region Specialised Services Commissioning Group is reviewing the arrangements for specialised neurosciences in the light of the two recent national reports on standards and models of care.
<P>

<a name="00523w07.html_para5">In the meantime, health authorities in the Eastern region have no plans to change existing commissioning arrangements.

<a name="00523w07.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Stuart: </B> 
 Interchange is a key component of the reform agenda. The Modernising Government White Paper committed us to increasing interchange, in particular by bringing in more people on secondment and sending more people out. Secondments and attachments are part of the Interchange Initiative which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the Civil Service and other organisations. All sectors of the economy are involved: voluntary, education, health, public and private.
<P>

<a name="00523w07.html_para6">Central records are held on five secondments from the private sector.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what research has been undertaken or evaluated by his Department to establish the health risks to the public posed by dioxins in the environment;  [123510]
<P>
<UL>(2) if links have been established between dioxins and cancer in humans;  [123511]

(3) what assessment he has made of the incidence of illnesses in the United Kingdom linked to dioxins <i>(a)</i> currently and <i>(b)</i> in 1995.  [123480]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w08.html_spnew4"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The Department and the Food Standards Agency seek advice on the health implications of dioxins from the independent expert advisory Committees on the Toxicity and on the Carcinogenicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment. The Committee on Toxicity has evaluated the scientific data on dioxins on a number of occasions, most recently in 1995. The evaluation can be found in the 1995 Annual Report of the Committee which is available in the Library. The Committee on Carcinogenicity concluded in 1998 that it would be prudent to consider one specific dioxin, 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, as a "probable weak human carcinogen". The Committee's statement can be found on the Department's Internet site www.doh.gov.uk/coc.htm, and in the 1998 Annual Report.

<a name="00523w09.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 When this Government came to power they inherited spending plans under which capital investment in housing was set to fall from &#163;1.54 billion in 1997-98 to &#163;1.37 billion by 1999-2000. We took early action to reverse this decline through our Capital Receipts Initiative and the Comprehensive Spending Review. As a result, we are making available nearly &#163;5 billion extra over the life of this Parliament. In 2001-02, capital investment in housing will be over &#163;3 billion--double the level we inherited in 1997-98. Our current Spending Review will determine investment levels in future years and decisions will be announced in the summer.

 There are a number of important links between housing and employment, many of which are set out in our Housing Green Paper, "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all". Housing investment supports employment in the construction industry, while the provision of decent homes enhances people's educational attainment and employment opportunities. The Government are investing nearly &#163;5 billion extra in housing over the life of this Parliament.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will take steps to develop action zones in areas where the market has failed to provide sufficient housing in order to promote the development of additional housing.  [123011]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w09.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Government are not aware of any areas where the market is failing to provide a sufficient amount of housing but we are aware of examples where housing is not necessarily of the right quality or design, and where it does not meet the most urgent needs of the community. That is why we have put in place the range of policies set out in revised Planning Policy Guidance for housing--PPG3--and our Housing Green Paper, "Quality and Choice: A decent home for all". Our policies encourage more sustainable patterns of development, improvements in quality and design, better use of existing housing, and the provision of more affordable housing.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will estimate the number of additional affordable homes required in each of the next five years; and how many are currently provided for under the Housing Corporation Programme and the local authority social housing grant.

 We do not make national estimates of housing need, since these are unable to adequately reflect the diversity of needs and priorities at the local level. The Housing Corporation forecast that the Approved Development Programme will provide around 18,000 homes for rent, and 4,000 homes for sale on a low cost basis in 2000-01. The Housing Corporation also forecast around 11,000 completions in 2000-01 through Local Authority Social Housing Grant.

<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Plan does not convey a clear sense of the spatial strategy, or of the preferred mix of waste management methods, and there are no specific development proposals or land allocations, or clear locational guidance. Government policy advises that local plans need both to set out the authority's policies for the control of development and to make proposals for the development of land and to allocate land for specific purposes. It is important to confront these issues, because the Plan indicates that important choices will need to be implemented well within the plan period to 2011. The Plan should therefore make those choices and propose the key developments necessary to implement them.

 On the assumption that the question refers to the average time taken by HSE inspectors to report on such incidents following investigation, the answer is that data are not maintained that would provide an average time for the completion of a report.

 Discussions on the future of the Longbridge Rover plant have been undertaken by my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. My right hon. Friend established a Task Force to assess the impact of Rover restructuring on the West Midlands economy. He appointed Alex Stephenson, the Chairman of Advantage West Midlands, as Chairman of the Task Force, and received an interim report in April. My right hon. Friend met with the Task Force on two occasions, and is due to meet with them before they submit their final report in June. The Government Office for the West Midlands is involved in working with the Task Force, and helping to co-ordinate effort across a number of Government Departments.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w10.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The omission of the Unitary Borough of Thurrock and the landfill sites in Basildon and Thurrock was an oversight, due to an editorial error. This has already been brought to the attention of the Environment Agency by local government and the Agency will amend the snapshot when it publishes the second edition in September 2000.
<P>

<a name="00523w10.html_para2">The cost of production of the "Environmental Snapshot for the East of England" was &#163;4,470. The report was produced by Robert Runcie, Regional Director of the Environment Agency (Anglian Region).

<P>
<a name="00523w11.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Tactically Enhanced Arrival Measures (TEAM) procedure at Heathrow involves the use of the departure runway to increase arrival rates and reduce holding delays. The procedure is approved only when it can be accommodated within the Heathrow Departure air traffic controllers' workload.
<P>

<a name="00523w11.html_para0">For environmental reasons, controllers are required to record the occasions on which the TEAM procedure is implemented. During the period 1 January to 18 May the TEAM procedure was implemented on the westerly runways at Heathrow on 53 occasions.
<P>

<a name="00523w11.html_para1">In accordance with local environmental restrictions, when the easterly runways are in use, arriving aircraft are permitted to use either of the parallel runways, Runway 09 Right or Runway 09 Left, at any time without restriction during the majority of the operating day. For environmental reasons, Runway 09R is normally used for all departures.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on progress towards the introduction of the new financial framework for local authority housing.  [123709]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w11.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Minister for Local Government and the Regions announced on 22 June 1999, <i>Official Report,</i> column 337W, that the Government intended to proceed with their proposals for the introduction of a new financial framework for local authority housing. Our Housing Green Paper "Quality and Choice: A Decent Home for All" repeated that commitment. The new financial framework will place authorities' accounts on a more businesslike footing and encourage more efficient investment in the stock. Together with Best Value, it will help ensure that local authority housing assets are managed in a way which will ensure that the resources which have been and will continue to be invested in them provide good-quality homes which reflect tenants' wishes and needs.
<P>

<a name="00523w11.html_para2">Our intention remains to introduce the new financial framework from 1 April 2001 with the exception of removing rent rebates from the HRA where primary legislation is needed. We are providing resources through HRA subsidy to help authorities with initial costs. Over recent months we have undertaken consultation on a number of detailed aspects of the new system and my officials have continued to work closely with local government and others. Significant progress has been 



<P>
<P><I>23 May 2000 : Column: 439W</I><P>
made and my officials are today writing to local authorities with detailed material on various aspects of the change. The material is also being made available in the Library of the House and will shortly be available on the Department's website.
<P>

<a name="00523w11.html_para3">We have consulted on four particular topics since my right hon. Friend's announcement of 22 June. On stock valuation, we are today publishing the final version of the guidance. There was general support for the approach proposed based on the identification and valuation of beacon properties. The final version of the guidance reflects a number of detailed comments made in response to consultation. It will help authorities in preparing the valuations which will be necessary for the new-style accounts.
<P>

<a name="00523w11.html_para4">On business planning, there has been a general welcome for the concept. We will be publishing final guidance taking account of comments made in response to consultation in June; authorities will be expected to produce initial business plans by 31 October.
<P>

<a name="00523w11.html_para5">On the methodology for calculating the Major Repairs Allowance, we have carefully considered the comments made and are sending authorities a detailed list of our responses. We have made some adjustments to the assumptions underpinning the calculations as a result of the consultation process. The Major Repairs Allowance will be part of HRA subsidy from April 2001, and will form part of our normal consultation on subsidy later this year. All this material, and the guidance on shadow accounts which the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy expect to be issuing in June, will help authorities prepare for the new regime.
<P>

<a name="00523w11.html_para6">On removal of rent rebates from the HRA, there was general support for the principle involved. The majority of respondents agreed that it was right to regard local authority housing as a national programme and that assumed surpluses in authorities' housing accounts should be retained within housing and redistributed through a pooling mechanism. Some authorities in negative subsidy have expressed particular concerns about the impact of the new system, and the Under-Secretary of State, my hon. Friend the Member for Sunderland, South (Mr. Mullin), announced on 4 April 2000, <i>Official Report,</i> column 810, that we would introduce transitional arrangements for authorities in negative subsidy from 2001. We will be consulting on the details of the transitional measures.
<P>

<a name="00523w11.html_para7">I am grateful for the positive and helpful contribution that local authorities have made to the development of these important proposals. I hope that they will approach their implementation in the same way.

<P>
<a name="00523w11.html_spnew6"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Department does not collect information in the level of detail requested. Expenditure by each local education authority in England supported by the Government's Standards Fund grant for school security, which is allocated directly to authorities, is shown in Table 1 for 1998-99, the latest year for which outturn information is available, along with the total sums available to authorities for 1999-2000.
<P>

<a name="00523w11.html_para8">Specific grants for school security measures have been made available since 1997-98, following a recommendation from the Government's Working Group on School Security. To date, &#163;94 million has been made available to support a variety of security measures in schools in England, to help make a safer environment for pupils and staff. A breakdown, by year, of this total funding is given in Table 2.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. GEST and the Standards Fund grants for school security had grant rates. This means Government provide the set grant rate and local education authorities are required to contribute the remainder in order to take up the grant.<P>

2. In 1997-98 and 1998-99, an additional &#163;2 million per year was made available to schools in the grant-maintained sector via the Funding Agency for Schools.<P>

3. The Standards Fund school security grant is allocated to local education authorities by formula and can be used on a variety of physical measures and on security related training for staff and governors. Local education authorities are required to devolve at least 70 per cent. of their grant allocation to schools, while being allowed to retain a maximum of 30 per cent. of their allocation to co-ordinate a training programme for staff and governors. <P>

<a name="00523w13.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 The Government have been encouraged by the high level of interest shown by employers, the media, other organisations and individuals in age diversity since the publication of the Code and we have made it clear that the effectiveness of the Code on reducing age discrimination in the workplace will be fully evaluated, with comprehensive findings published early next year.
<P>

<a name="00523w13.html_para0">To this effect an independent organisation, NOP (National Opinion Polls) has been commissioned to carry out a large scale research project in three stages, to help evaluate the effectiveness the Code is having on reducing discrimination. We will be publishing the first and second stage findings of the evaluation in June.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how much was spent in each year on the New Deal for Lone Parents; and how many lone parents have benefited from this scheme in each year.  [122602]

<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w13.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hodge </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 18 May 2000]:</i> The full national New Deal for Lone Parents (Phase 3) was implemented on 26 October 1998. It had already been operating in eight prototype areas from July 1997 (Phase 1), and nationally for new and repeat claimants from 6 April 1998 (Phase 2).
<P>

<a name="00523w13.html_para1">The cost of implementing the New Deal for Lone Parents (NDLP) prototype phase 1 areas was &#163;7.9 million. The cost of implementing the national programme has been &#163;58.6 million--broken down as &#163;0.311 million in 1997-98, &#163;22.3 million in 1998-99 and &#163;36 million in 1999-2000. The figure for 1999-2000 is provisional.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what his policy is in respect of the practice of dissecting animals for educational purposes in <i>(a)</i> maintained and <i>(b)</i> independent schools.  [122941]

<P>
<a name="00523w13.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 There is no requirement in the National Curriculum for dissection to be carried out although individual teachers may choose to use dissection to illustrate various aspects of the science curriculum. In the key stage 3 schemes of work which have been published recently by the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority, organ dissection is suggested as one of a range of possible teaching activities in some contexts. Where dissection is used, teachers in both state and private schools must always take account of potential threats to the well-being of pupils, particularly in relation to health and safety, religious or ethnic background and individual sensitivities. GCSE and A level exam boards no longer require pupils to undertake dissection for assessment and there should therefore be no pressure on pupils to dissect or watch a dissection. Dissection of living vertebrates and bovine eyeballs is banned in all schools and further directives or advice may be given to teachers by their employers. In maintained schools this is provided by the local education authority, in foundation and voluntary aided schools by the governing body and in private schools by the head teacher or governing body.

 A full analysis of the recommendations of the Select Committee on Modernisation of the House of Commons and their implementation is set out in that Committee's First Special Report of Session 1998-99, HC 865.

To ask the Chairman of the Information Committee, pursuant to his answer of 4 May 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 215W, on voicemail, for what reason he was not able to provide the installation cost; and on what basis the service cost of &#163;92,000 was calculated.  [122536]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w13.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Allan: </B> 
 I am advised by the Head of Telecommunications that the voicemail facility currently used by Parliament is purchased as a service from the Central Computing and Telecommunications Agency (CCTA). Since it is a service, and since it is provided globally via Parliament's voice network, there are no site specific installation costs.
<P>

<a name="00523w13.html_para5">The sum of &#163;92,000 can be broken down as follows: megastream rental &#163;8,225 (this provides the connection between Parliament's voice network and the external CCTA managed voicemail system); mailbox rental &#163;37,900 (annual cost--the last quarter has been estimated); applications development and manual &#163;800; and training &#163;45,330.
<P>

<a name="00523w13.html_para6">I am advised that training costs are expected to fall in the current financial year, since the first and major tranche of roll-out to new users is now completed. Mailbox rental costs are expected to increase as the majority of mailboxes will now incur full-year rental costs.

<P>
<a name="00523w13.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Dennis Turner: </B> 
 Purchasing policy is essentially a matter for the Refreshment Department. However, I am advised by the Director of Catering Services that the Department's purchasing guidelines include the following provisions related to animal welfare:
<P>

<a name="00523w13.html_para7">

<BR>
1. fresh meats must be sourced from livestock raised under an accredited "farm assurance scheme". Such schemes ensure that all stock is reared according to good animal husbandry and welfare practices. The Department periodically tests the claims of suppliers by requiring them to provide documentary evidence tracing the cut of meat delivered back to source and, where possible, to the animal;
<BR>
2. fresh meat suppliers must meet standards set by the Meat and Livestock Commission, who provide both detailed and general advice to the Department about animal welfare issues in the meat industry;
<BR>
3. veal must be from calves raised in group housing systems, not crate systems;
<BR>




<P>
<P><I>23 May 2000 : Column: 453W</I><P>
4. pigmeat supplied to the Department must be from pigs raised in loose-housed systems, not stall and tether systems; and
<BR>
5. eggs must be from free-range flocks. The supplier is licensed under the RSPCA's Freedom Food Scheme.

<P>

<a name="00523w13.html_para8">The Refreshment Department consults widely with other organisations to ensure that its purchasing guidelines are regularly and authoritatively reviewed. In addition to working closely with the Meat and Livestock Commission, the Department is a member of the Soil Association, and periodically seeks advice from bodies such as the Freedom Food Association, Compassion in World Farming and the NFU.

 Monitoring of Railtrack PLC's compliance with its railway safety case is carried out by the Health and Safety Executive's Railway Inspectorate who also considered Railtrack's safety case and any subsequent revisions. The safety case includes a strategy for the maintenance of structures on Railtrack's infrastructure. The Railway Inspectorate hold regular meetings with Railtrack to establish that they are maintaining this strategy robustly for the Forth Rail Bridge and other structures.

To ask the Parliamentary Secretary, Lord Chancellor's Department how many vacant posts 



<P>

<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w16.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Lock: </B> 
 There are currently no vacancies on the High Court Bench. The assessment of my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor is that the current demands on the High Court are fully met by the number of judges in post.
<P>

<a name="00523w16.html_para0">In November 1999 the statutory ceiling on the number of High Court judges was increased by eight, from 98 to 106. Since then, four additional High Court judges have been appointed in preparation for the implementation of the Human Rights Act in October 2000. This has taken the number of judges from 98 to 102 (excluding Mr. Justice Bratza, who is serving full-time on the European Court of Human Rights).
<P>

<a name="00523w16.html_para1">There remains capacity within the statutory ceiling to appoint a further four judges. The Lord Chancellor will continue to monitor the demands on the High Court, and he will recommend the appointment of further judges, within the statutory ceiling, when he considers it is necessary.
<P>

<a name="00523w16.html_para2">In February 2000, as part of his regular search for potential candidates, the Lord Chancellor again invited applications for consideration for appointment to the High Court Bench. When vacancies arise, appointment will be made on merit from those who have applied, either in 1998 or this year, or from others whom the Lord Chancellor regards as meeting the criteria to the required degree of distinction. Of the 19 High Court judges appointed since February 1998, eight had applied for appointment, and 11 were invited to accept appointment.

<a name="00523w16.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00523w16.html_para3">The Family Homes and Domestic Violence (NI) Order 1998 creates a new unified and coherent legal regime for dealing with domestic violence. The old personal protection orders have been replaced by non-molestation orders. The non-molestation orders are civil orders made by the court for the protection of the applicant and any children who may be at risk of family violence. The breach of a non-molestation order, involving as it does the threat of violence to the protected person(s), is appropriately a criminal offence and police officers are empowered to arrest for breach of such an order.
<P>

<a name="00523w16.html_para4">An access order, since the introduction of the Children (NI) Order 1996 known as a contact order, is an order by the court to provide for contact between a parent and a child in circumstances where that parent is not living with the child. Breach of contact orders may be treated as contempt of court. However, difficulties in ensuring contact between children and parents may involve many complicated relationship factors and require to be dealt with sensitively within the family civil law system.

As a result of the work conducted thus far, it has been decided to include all non-core training support activities and services because there is scope for better value for money if the boundaries of the study were to be extended in this way. In addition, a site utility review is going to be conducted to establish the usage of sites and this may lead to rationalisation of some sites. It is too early to say what the impact of this work is going to be, both on jobs and individual sites, but the MOD Trades Unions will be consulted at every stage.

<a name="00523w16.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 I have recently decided, as part of my Department's continuous attempts to improve the effectiveness and operability of the naval reserve forces, to disband the Merchant Navy Reserve (MNR).
<P>

<a name="00523w16.html_para6">The MNR was formed in 1989 to provide a modest pool of experienced British Merchant Seamen to augment the crews of UK registered merchant ships in times of tension and war. The MNR's membership has never been called-out since its inception and there are no foreseen circumstances where the Government may be required to do so. The Cold War environment that generated the requirement for the Merchant Navy Reserve has changed fundamentally, resulting in the necessity for the Government to review all elements of the armed forces. Such reviews have demonstrated there is no longer a requirement to maintain the Merchant Navy Reserve in circumstances where there is no foreseeable need for its services.
<P>

<a name="00523w16.html_para7">My Department has therefore made arrangements for letters to be sent to individual members of the MNR thanking them for their past service and informing them of this decision and the reasons behind it. The letters encourage MNR personnel to consider joining the Royal Naval Reserve, an organisation which offers valuable training and personal development opportunities to all those with an interest in acquiring or maintaining the Nation's much-needed maritime skills.
<P>

<a name="00523w16.html_para8">The measure in no way effects the Government's wholehearted and continuing support for the Merchant Navy, a matter demonstrated amply in the 1998 White Paper "British Shipping: Charting A New Course". Industry, the unions and Government continue to work together to regenerate the UK merchant navy and seafaring skills base to meet the Nation's future needs.

 The additional cost of the Ministry of Defence Police (MDP) search of the home of Tony Geraghty was &#163;606.00. The search lasted just under seven hours and was conducted by two detective sergeants and four detective constables. A computer, associated equipment and documentation was taken by the MDP. Items for use in a forthcoming court case involving one of Mr. Geraghty's associates have been retained by the MDP. Items relevant to a West Mercia police investigation, concerning Mr. Geraghty, were passed to that Force. All items not required for the forthcoming court case and not passed to West Mercia police have been returned to Mr. Geraghty. Mr. Geraghty was charged under section 5 of the Official Secrets Act 1989 on 13 May 1999. The decision not to proceed against Mr. Geraghty is a matter for the Attorney General.

 Mr. A. I. Mullineux was discharged from the Regular Army on 10 August 1992 under Queen's Regulations 9.374--"At the Soldier's request on payment--transfer to the Regular Reserve". He was not employed in support of any UK sponsored military operations at the time of his death in Bosnia in February 1993. A careful examination of Mr. Mullineux's contemporary Service records indicates that the Ministry of Defence did not play any role in the repatriation of Mr. Mullineux's body to the UK, nor any post-mortem, which would properly have been the responsibility of the civil authorities.

<P>

<a name="00523w18.html_para3">The document endeavours to present a broadly factual account of British Coal's dismissal and re-employment policy around the time of the strike and in its aftermath. It focuses in particular on those individuals who were not re-employed in the aftermath of the strike and whose cases were not considered by Industrial Tribunals at the time. It also addresses concerns which have been expressed over the pension rights of individuals who were found by Industrial Tribunals to have been unfairly dismissed.

 In May 1999 the OST commissioned ADD Consultants to consider the comparative advantages, benefits and costs of the site location and its effect on the New Synchrotron project. Their report (completed in June 1999 and made public in January 2000) considered both the Daresbury Laboratory in Cheshire and the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory in Oxfordshire. This report indicated some saving in running costs if the facility were located at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory.
<P>

<a name="00523w20.html_para0">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry commissioned a further survey into the same two sites in November 1999 and this was carried out by Allott and Lomax. Their report (completed and made public in January 2000) concluded that there were no differences in cost between constructing the facility at the Daresbury Laboratory and at the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory site, within their estimation errors.

 ADD Consultants were originally commissioned by CCLRC (the Council for the Central Laboratories of the Research Councils) to write a business case for the New Synchrotron in January 1999. Because of ADD's existing involvement in the project, and the time constraints, they were a natural choice to carry out the additional study on the suitability of the sites for the new synchrotron.

The service provided under contract in the pilot area will be compared with that provided under present arrangements before decisions are made on whether to extend competitive tendering for local veterinary inspection work.

 The Government's policy is to reduce the risks to people and the developed and natural environment from flooding and coastal erosion by encouraging the provision of technically, environmentally and economically sound and sustainable defence measures. The flood and coastal defence operating authorities (the internal drainage boards Environmental Agency, and local authorities) undertake these measures. In April 2000 the Government put in place a series of High Level Targets to help achieve a more certain delivery of its policies by the operating authorities. The Government have also set out a priority for the Environment Agency to work with other bodies, including local authorities and the emergency services, in achieving a seamless and integrated service of flood forecasting, warning and response.
<P>

<a name="00523w21.html_para1">The two main sources of funding for flood and coastal defence are (a) Ministry contributions towards approved capital schemes undertaken by the operating authorities and (b) that delivered to local authorities through the local government finance mechanisms. The latter is used to fund the levies that local authorities pay to the Environment Agency and internal drainage boards, as well as their own spend on flood and coastal defence. A review of the current funding mechanisms is currently being conducted.
<P>

<a name="00523w21.html_para2">Following the Comprehensive Spending Review, the Government increased the funding available from the Ministry by &#163;23 million over three years from 1999-2000, to a total of &#163;230 million. The Government have also increased flood defence Standard Spending Assessments beyond inflation. Future funding levels depend on decisions to be taken in the Spending Review later this year.

 A review of interest rates provided in the Office for National Statistics' financial table 7.1L over the period January to December 1999 shows that a combined building society/bank rate is on average just under 0.28 per cent. higher than the weighted average of the main building societies interest rates. Building Societies continue to provide a comprehensive range of products in a very competitive market. Recent figures show that they continue to outlend the mortgage banks.

 No information is collected by my Department about the accrual of arrears in mortgages taken out by income support and income based jobseekers allowance recipients. Benefit help for homeowners with housing costs is intended to provide reasonable protection to help secure the home. The mortgage lenders have agreed, under The Mortgage Code, to consider all cases of financial difficulty and mortgage arrears sympathetically and positively.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w21.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 We have no plans to revise the index. The standard interest rate used to calculate ISMI entitlement is based on the weighted average of the main building society rates. The building societies continue to provide a broad range of products in a very competitive market. Recent figures produced by the Building Societies Association show that building societies continue to outlend the mortgage banks.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what plans he has to make the ISMI mechanism more quickly responsive to changes in interest rates.  [123235]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w21.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 There is no delay in the ISMI mechanism. As soon as the Department is informed by the Office for National Statistics of a change in interest rates, procedures are set in motion to amend regulations. Regulations are required to be laid 21 days before coming into force to allow for proper parliamentary scrutiny.

<P>
<a name="00523w21.html_wqn10"><B> Mr. Gordon Marsden: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security what estimate his Department has made of the average time between changes in the ISMI rate being triggered and higher payments being made to those in receipt of ISMI, in the most recent year for which figures are available.  [123237]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w21.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 It normally takes five to six weeks from receipt of the official notification from the Office for National Statistics to implementation of a change in interest rates. This allows for the Department to reprogramme its computer systems and for new regulations to be laid and made available for proper parliamentary scrutiny.
<P>

<P>
<UL>(2) how many repossessions of homes of those in receipt of ISMI there were in each of the last five years for which figures are available.  [123240]
<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w21.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 This Department does not keep any figures relating to home repossessions. The benefit system is designed to provide homeowners with reasonable protection and we encourage everyone, particularly those taking out new loans, to consider how they would meet their mortgage repayments if they lost their income. The Council of Mortgage Lenders and the Association of British Insurers have recently announced a new minimum standard for mortgage protection insurance. Most repossessions are caused by wider, more serious difficulties than any shortfall in benefit. Recent figures produced by the Lord Chancellors Department show that in England and Wales repossession activity is declining.

 We have received a number of letters and Parliamentary Questions about the ISMI scheme. In addition, the Department is in close contact with the Council of Mortgage Lenders and are active members of a lending industry/Government partnership group.

<a name="00523w22.html_wqn0"><B> Dr. Lynne Jones: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security for each of the past five years for which figures are available, how many applications for 



<P>
<P><I>23 May 2000 : Column: 484W</I><P>
Incapacity Benefit were refused and what proportion of total applications this represents; what proportion of applicants refused Incapacity Benefit appealed to the Appeals Service and how many were successful; and what proportion of applicants whose appeals were rejected by the Appeals Service appealed to the social security commissioners and how many were successful.  [122152]
<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w22.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 Information on numbers of claims for Incapacity Benefit (IB), awards and disallowances are in table 1. The available information on appeals is in table 2. It should be noted that the time lags between stages of the process (e.g. between claim and disallowance, or between disallowance and the hearing of an appeal) means that there is no direct relationship between the numbers in the various categories in each. This in turn means that the figures cannot be used to derive proportions. However, it is estimated that around 22 per cent. of those referred are disallowed following a medical test, that of those disallowed around 30 per cent. appeal, and that around 3 per cent. of those who are not successful at tribunal appeal to the Social Security Commissioners. Claimants who are disallowed IB because they fail the contribution conditions may be awarded National Insurance credits ("credits only" cases): and disallowances following the All Work Test and appeals include IB recipients and credits only cases: it is not possible to disaggregate the figures.

<a name="00523w22.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Wigley: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will instruct the Benefits Agency to ensure that Disability Living Allowance is not withdrawn from a person to whom it had previously been awarded for life, without there first being a detailed personal letter explaining the reasons for the withdrawal being given to the beneficiary, and an immediate opportunity being made available to that person for a review of the decision which can consider further evidence from or on behalf of that person.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00523w22.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 As with any benefit, any person whose award of Disability Living Allowance (DLA) is changed, in any way and for whatever reason, is offered, and may demand, a reconsideration of that decision and a right of appeal. Any representations they make will be considered as part of these processes.
<P>

<a name="00523w22.html_para1">It has always been the intention that "life awards" of DLA should only run as long as a person is entitled to that rate of benefit, and the law has always allowed for awards to be altered when there are ground for doing so. People receiving the benefit have always been informed that changes in their circumstances needed to be reported to the Department, and that benefit entitlement could change, even where an award had been given for life.
<P>

<a name="00523w22.html_para2">Nonetheless, we recognise that the "life award" terminology in DLA caused problems; in particular, that the words used suggested that entitlement could continue even when the conditions for receiving the benefit were no longer met. We therefore took powers in the Welfare Reform and Pensions Act 1999 to remove references to "life awards". Accordingly, from 12 January this year the terminology was altered to replace "life award" with "indefinite award" to help clarify the situation. The rules that apply to altering awards, whether made for life, or for an indefinite period, have remained unchanged.

<P>
<a name="00523w22.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Bayley: </B> 
 The administration of Disability Living Allowance is a matter for Alexis Cleveland, the Chief Executive of the Benefits Agency. She will write to the right hon. Member.
<P>

<a name="00523w22.html_para3"><i>Letter from Alexis Cleveland to Mr. Dafydd Wigley, dated May 2000:</i>
<P>

<a name="00523w22.html_para4">

<BR>
The Secretary of State has asked Alexis Cleveland to reply to your recent Parliamentary Question about how many people who have been awarded disability living allowance (DLA) for life have had that benefit withdrawn during the past twelve months. As she is on annual leave I am replying on her behalf.
<BR>
The number of people awarded DLA for life whose award was terminated in the twelve months ending November 1999 was 80,200. This is the most recent figure available and it represents termination of benefit due to death; residence and presence conditions no longer satisfied; voluntary cancellation and cancellation by the Department.

To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security, pursuant to his answer on 18 April 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 439W, on pensions, what the National Insurance Fund balance would be, and how far above the minimum level recommended by the Government Actuary, at the end of each of the years <i>(a)</i> 2000-01, <i>(b)</i> 2001-02, <i>(c)</i> 2002-03 and <i>(d)</i> 2003-04, if the basic pension and linked benefit rates remained at their present level in 2000-01 and were uprated in line with prices thereafter.

 Precise long-term forecasts of any excess to the Fund reserves would be misleading, given the sensitivity of the differences between forecasts of receipts and expenditure to the variables involved. The Government Actuary's report <sup>1</sup>  shows a projected Fund balance of &#163;16.6 billion at the end of the 2000-01 financial year, which is &#163;8.8 billion in excess of the minimum recommended.

<a name="00523w23.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Social Security if he will provide illustrative examples of cases where taxes and benefits interact to produce a marginal income deduction rate of <i>(a)</i> 50 per cent. and above, <i>(b)</i> 60 per cent. and above, <i>(c)</i> 70 per cent. and above, <i>(d)</i> 80 per cent. and above, <i>(e)</i> 90 per cent. and above and <i>(f)</i> 100 per cent. and above on the same basis as Figure 37 in the departmental report, Cm 4614, p.81.

<a name="00523w23.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Rooker: </B> 
 Marginal net income deduction rates in Figure 37 of the latest departmental report were calculated by micro simulation modelling, using a sample of households from the 1996-97 Family Resources Survey. The following examples are drawn from the survey results underpinning the latest estimates, for 1999-2000. They are shown by 10 per cent. bands. As in Figure 37, the examples are restricted to households where at least one person is working for 16 hours or more per week.
<P>

<a name="00523w23.html_para0">50 to 59 per cent. rate: None of the cases in the 1996-97 survey are modelled to have a marginal net income deduction rate of between 50 and 59 per cent.
