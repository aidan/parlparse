 The Youth Justice Board (YJB) places young offenders according to various factors including distance from home, age, gender and suitability of establishments to deliver the offender&#146;s sentence plan. On 20 February 2009 the average distance from home for a 15-year-old was 45.2 miles. The data collection system cannot discount double counting where young offenders during that period have been remanded, sentenced or moved to other establishments within the estate.

 The formal justice system in Afghanistan is weak, often corrupt and typically inaccessible to women, children and rural communities. Furthermore, there is a shortage of trained judges and legal representation. For the majority of Afghans, justice and dispute resolution is dispensed through informal, traditional systems. We estimate that over 80 per cent. of justice/dispute resolution is dispensed through informal systems and in Helmand we believe this to be even higher. Aspects of these systems have been used for hundreds of years and tend to have a high level of acceptance and legitimacy among the public. This includes Taliban courts in Taliban controlled areas.</p>

 Together with our EU partners we continue to have serious concerns about the situation of all religious minorities in Iran. These groups suffer state-sponsored and systematic forms of intimidation and persecution. They face gross human rights violations such as arbitrary detention without charge and without access to lawyers, confiscation of property and denial of education. Such detentions are becoming increasingly common in Iran, and are cause for serious concern.</p>

 Consular staff in Bangkok last spoke with the Director of Aviation Safety Standards from the Civil Aviation Department for Thailand before Easter. The investigation into the cause of the One Two Go airline crash at Phuket airport on 16 September 2007 is still going on. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) have passed the official technical investigation report to the Thai Government. The Thai technical sub-committee is reviewing the report and it is due to be finalised and endorsed by the Thai Minister for Transport in mid May 2009. However, this time frame could slip, depending on decisions by the technical sub-committee. Once the report is finalised it will need to be translated into several languages, including English, and then checked by the ICAO. The Thai authorities have 30 days to produce the translation and the ICAO have a further 60 days to check and verify the technical details of the translation. This would mean that the verified English translation of the report will be released by mid August 2009 at the earliest.</p>

While the UK supports these efforts, in the case of the United Nations paying a significant share (7.8 per cent.) of the rising costs, the increased costs have forced the UK Government to review its funding of discretionary activity, in conflict prevention, management and resolution, and post-conflict stabilisation. The finite funding available has been prioritised and effort focused on those countries or regions where the risk and impact of conflict is greatest. Ghana has shown with its successful elections and transfer of power that it has developed a stability lacked by many others in Africa.</p>

 The UK has not held any recent discussions with our counterparts in countries which do not engage in whaling on coastal whaling. However, the UK participated in the intersessional meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and Small Working Group in Rome in March, where the issue of coastal whaling was discussed, and UK officials have also had discussions with EU counterparts. We have stressed throughout that we could not agree to the setting of catch limits for coastal whaling unless these were fully supported by the IWC&#146;s Scientific Committee and such catch limits formed part of a package, the adoption of which we considered to be beneficial to long-term whale conservation.</p>

 The UK continues to have concerns about potential proposals by Japan to introduce a new type of &#145;small type coastal whaling&#146; into the schedule of the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling (ICRW).

<p><a name="stpa_361"><a name="90423w0010.htm_para4"><a name="09042362000839">We are also concerned that if one country is allowed to carry out coastal whaling, then other countries would argue that they should be allowed similar provisions, ultimately outside direct control of the International Whaling Commission (IWC).

 The Department has commissioned a number of surveys and pieces of research on use of the European Health Insurance Card (EHIC). Most recently, this informed departmental press and media communications to make the British population aware that a new EHIC is only valid for five years. All British citizens should make sure they have a valid EHIC so they can access state-provided health care that becomes necessary while travelling in Europe. Travel insurance is also needed as the EHIC does not cover all eventualities (like repatriation).</p>

We will then feed our findings into the discussions of the National Quality Board, which has been set up to oversee the priorities for the service in the future.</p>

<i> [holding answer 10 March 2009]:</i> When an application for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) is refused, any subsequent appeals dismissed, and the applicant has no other grounds for leave, the UK Border Agency will seek to enforce compliance with the immigration decision. Those who refuse to leave voluntarily are classed as overstayers and are liable for enforced removal.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_406"><a name="90423w0015.htm_para7"><a name="09042366000092">In 2008, we introduced case ownership for all in-country cases. Disallowed applications for ILR are owned by a case owner, based in the region where the applicant lives, who is responsible for pursuing the case to conclusion and giving priority to cases according to the harm they may potentially cause to the public. In addition to this, work is being undertaken on the development of electronic embarkation controls (e-Borders) to record departures, allowing us to monitor compliance and focus enforcement resource on those who do not comply.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_407"><a name="90423w0015.htm_para8"><a name="09042366000093">Further information on the UK Border Agency's enforcement strategy is available to view at:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_408"><a name="90423w0015.htm_para9"><a name="09042366000094">The efficacy of this approach is assessed by measuring the number of voluntary departures and removals. In 2008, 66,275 people were removed or departed voluntarily from the UK (which will include overstayers)&#151;a 5 per cent. increase on 2007. This includes a 10 per cent. increase in non-asylum cases from 49,660 in 2007 to 54,635 in 2008. These figures (not percentages) are rounded to the nearest five and are provisional.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_409"><a name="90423w0015.htm_para10"><a name="09042366000095">The Home Office publishes statistics on the number of persons removed and departed voluntarily from the UK on a quarterly and annual basis.

 While the United Kingdom has not opted-in to this directive, we agree that a collective approach to removal would have advantages. However, we are not persuaded that this directive delivers the strong returns regime that is required for dealing with irregular migration. We prefer to formulate our own policy in line with retaining control over conditions of entry and stay; including the returns procedure. Our current practices on the return of illegal third country nationals are in line with the prescriptions of the directive.</p>

 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change last reported in 2007. Since then my Department has evaluated evidence from numerous peer-reviewed papers, conference proceedings and research by the Met Office Hadley Centre. It is clear that some climate change impacts associated with human activities are happening even more quickly than previously expected, for example in the Arctic, and that, while natural temperate variations caused some temporary cooling in 2007 and 2008, the overall trend remains upward.</p>

 Rents of business premises are set in the market by agreement between the parties. The Government do not plan to limit increases. However, when business tenancies expire, the Landlord and Tenant Act 1954 gives the tenant the right to a new tenancy and restricts the rent to the market value. The new rent will be fixed by the courts if the parties cannot agree. This protection is not available in cases where the tenant agrees to 'contract out' of the protection of the Act before the grant of the original lease.</p>

It is important that, subject to market conditions, tenants should be able to negotiate terms reflecting their business needs. The Government remain committed to lease reform and, dependent upon the impact of the 'Code for Leasing Business Premises in England and Wales 2007', has not ruled out legislation as an option in the longer term.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 April 2009]:</i> Major refurbishments carried out under the Building Schools for the Future programme normally include removal of all asbestos in areas in which it would be disturbed by the work undertaken. Asbestos is also removed when buildings are demolished. Asbestos-containing materials (ACMs) that are likely to deteriorate are identified by an asbestos survey for each refurbishment and are normally then removed. Where minor refurbishment  <br>

work takes place, an asbestos survey is done and, depending on the condition of the ACMs, they are either removed or managed in place.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_493"><a name="90423w0025.htm_para7"><a name="09042373000030">Asbestos does not pose a serious risk if it is managed properly in accordance with the Control of Asbestos Regulations. The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) does not recommend the routine removal of asbestos. Its advice remains that, providing that ACMs are maintained in good condition, they can be left where they are and managed until a building reaches the end of its life and asbestos can be removed without risk of exposing building users to risks arising from significant disturbance.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_494"><a name="90423w0025.htm_para8"><a name="09042373000031">The risks created by removal need to be borne in mind; unless the removal is carried out perfectly, the process may leave contamination. If the asbestos is in good condition and is not likely to be damaged or disturbed, it is usually safer to leave it in place and manage it until the building has reached the end of its useful life.</p>

<p><a name="st_307"><a name="09042373000033"><a name="90423w0025.htm_spnew7"><a name="09042373000084"><b>Jim Knight</b>
<i>  [holding answer 22 April 2009]:</i> In April each year the pensions of some 500,000 former teachers and their dependants are increased in line with inflation (i.e. pensions increase), consequently all teacher pensioners received increases in their pensions of 5 per cent. this financial year.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_495"><a name="90423w0025.htm_para9"><a name="09042373000034">The teachers&#146; pension scheme is a statutory scheme and pensions are reduced where there has been an overpayment, i.e. where the pension in payment exceeds the statutory entitlement. There are a number of reasons why overpayments can arise, for example, from this April some 20,000 former teachers had their pensions adjusted because an element of their pension known as the guaranteed minimum pension had previously been overpaid. However, it should be noted that only around a half of those pensioners had a reduction in the level of their pension payments as the adjustment was timed to coincide with the annual pensions increase uplift.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_496"><a name="90423w0025.htm_para10"><a name="09042373000035">Details of each and every adjustment to former teachers&#146; pensions are not collated centrally, and the records of over half a million former teachers who are in receipt of a teacher&#146;s pension would need to be individually investigated in order to do so. This could be done only at disproportionate cost.</p>
