<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Jim Cunningham: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what assessment he has made of the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission's response to the White Paper, "Legislation Against Terrorism".  [108530]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Ingram: </B> 
 A consultation paper "Legislation Against Terrorism" (Cm 4178) was published by the Government in December 1998 and was followed by a period of consultation. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission responded in April 1999. In all, the Government received a total of 80 responses from interested groups, practitioners and members of the public.
<P>

<a name="00208w01.html_para2">The Human Rights Commission's response was considered closely as were all the responses to the White paper and an analysis of the responses was set out in a 



<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 2000 : Column: 84W</I><P>
brief summary compiled by the Home Office, excluding 29 respondees whose representations were to remain confidential. The previous Secretary of State also met Professor Dickson, Chief Commissioner, in July 1999 to discuss their response and particularly their proposed approach to counter-terrorist legislation.
<P>

<a name="00208w01.html_para3">The Government published the Terrorism Bill on 2 December 1999. In preparing this it drew on the advice Lord Lloyd of Berwick gave in his report on the future of Counter-Terrorism Legislation published in December 1996, and took into account the views expressed by those who responded to the consultation paper. My officials and legal advisers have also met with the Human Rights Commission following introduction of the Bill to discuss the new legislation in detail and address any ECHR compatibility issues they have raised.
<P>

<a name="00208w01.html_para4">In parallel with the passage of the Terrorism Bill, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland has commissioned a review of the Diplock Court system. This was announced during the Bill's Second Reading on 14 December 1999. The Diplock Review Group has invited comment from legal and human rights bodies and I have written to Northern Ireland political parties for their views. Any responses will be considered by the Group in preparing its report for the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State has written to Bert Massie, the Chair of the Disability Rights Commission, to offer broad guidance on how we see the body discharging its functions and priorities and the tasks to which the Government attaches particular importance in its first year of operation. We will look to the Commission to ensure that its first set of strategic

<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Terry Davis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what is the time currently taken, in the context of pensions mis-selling, for the Teachers Pensions Agency to complete the reinstatement process once the Agency has been notified; and if he will make a statement.  [109223]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w01.html_spnew5"><B>  Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The average time taken to complete a re-instatement case is 14 weeks, measured from the time Teachers' Pensions are notified that mis-selling has taken place. Cases which take longer than the average are frequently the result of the personal pensions provider failing to act on the re-instatement quotation within the three month period for which the quotation is guaranteed. Some 25 per cent. of restoration quotations have to be re-calculated for this reason.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Terry Davis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what steps are being taken to reduce the time taken to rectify pensions mis-selling to teachers in England and Wales.  [109222]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 A number of initiatives have been introduced by Teachers' Pensions to streamline the reinstatement processes. These include improvements to their computer systems; the introduction of a dedicated e-mail address; regular contact between Teachers' Pensions staff and personal pension providers; and monthly productivity targets.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Terry Davis: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment how many staff have been allocated by <i>(a)</i> the Teachers Pensions Agency and <i>(b)</i> the Government Actuary's Department solely to rectify the mis-selling of pensions to teachers.  [109224]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The administration of the teachers' pension scheme is undertaken under contract by Teachers' Pensions, part of Capita Business Services Ltd. Sixteen staff within Teachers' Pensions work exclusively on the restoration of pension benefits of those teachers who have been mis-sold a personal pension. The Government Actuary's Department does not have any staff dedicated solely to this work. Advice on mis-selling cases is provided by staff who carry out a range of functions on behalf of this Department.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Wicks: </B> 
 The Higher Education Funding Council for England has a statutory duty to make provision for assessing the quality of education provided in institutions for whose activities it provides financial support. It currently contracts with the Quality Assurance Agency to carry out subject reviews on its behalf. In 1998-99 QAA carried out 233 subject reviews in England at a cost of &#163;4.2 million. For 1999-2000 QAA is contracted to carry out 375 subject reviews in England at a cost of &#163;5.6 million.

<P>
<a name="00208w02.html_spnew0"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Islington Council have signed, and are therefore responsible for, the education services contract with Cambridge Education Associates (CEA at Islington). Their council papers have made known the fact that the cost of the seven year contract is fixed at &#163;86.6 million and that CEA agreed to cap their target related management fee at &#163;600,000 net per annum. CEA are working to clear specifications and if they do not deliver they will not be rewarded. 50 per cent. of their profit is linked directly to standards. All changes in standards will be reflected in the published performance tables.
<P>

<a name="00208w02.html_para0">The London Borough of Islington is overseeing the tight contract monitoring arrangements with the assistance of DfEE officials. It is therefore up to Islington Council to decide whether they wish to publish an annual report regarding the monitoring of the contract.

<P>
<a name="00208w02.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 Young people on incapacity benefits are not eligible for New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds which is designed for jobseekers actively looking for work. However, we are developing initiatives to ensure that all disabled people who want to work are given the help they need. For example, the New Deal for Disabled People offers personal adviser support in 12 pilot areas to people

of all ages on incapacity benefits. The personal adviser offers an individually designed programme to tackle the specific needs of each client, including any who may need to overcome drug or alcohol misuse. We hope to make an early announcement about the next stage of the New Deal for Disabled People taking account of emerging findings from the pilots.

 The Government believe it is very important that children should be able to have healthy and enjoyable school meals.

Schools and local education authorities will be under a duty to comply with the Regulations, to be laid this year, which will set out the new standards. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State will investigate any complaints that the standards are not being met and could issue a direction to ensure compliance with the statutory duties.

<a name="00208w02.html_spnew5"><B>  Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 3 February 2000]:</i> In March 1998 we received from Stonewall a copy of the report "Playing it Safe", which they commissioned with the Terrence Higgins Trust. This contains, among other things, evidence and recommendations on homophobic-related bullying. And in October 1998 the noble Lord Tope's unstarred question in the Other Place about bullying in secondary schools focused to a large extent on the problem of homophobic bullying.
<P>

 In his written answer on 1 February 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 498W, my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Education and Employment made clear his assessment that the pay settlement would be affordable within the resources available to local authorities in 2000-01. The cost from 1 April 2000 will be 3.3 per cent., with assimilation costs of around 0.1 per cent. West Sussex will receive an increase in its Education Standard Spending Assessment of 6.11 per cent., which takes account of changes in local authority function. Its share of the &#163;50 million special grant to support school budgets will add the equivalent of a further 0.2 per cent. to this. The rescheduling of increased employers' contributions to teachers' pensions will save the authority 0.7 per cent. of the cost of its teachers' pay bill.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w02.html_spnew7"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The Education (School Premises) Regulations 1999 (SPRs) prescribe minimum areas, as well as quality standards, for team game playing fields for which schools must have access. No data have been gathered on the extent of access which schools have to sports playing fields since May 1997, or before.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w02.html_spnew8"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 Schools and Local Education Authorities (LEAs) decide how much to spend on sport in schools. We do not collect centrally information on this support. However there are a number of organisations which support sport in schools nationally, and many others which give support at a local level. Sport England, the Sports Lottery distributor, spent &#163;14.4 million in schools and colleges in 1998-99. The National Sports Governing Bodies also contribute a great deal at national and local level through coaching and talent development schemes and competitions involving schools. We are working closely with DCMS, OFSTED, QCA and national PE and sport bodies to further develop and expand the range and quality of opportunities available to all young people.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w02.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 7 February 2000]:</i> As part of the drive to raise the achievement of ethnic minority pupils, we are making available more money than ever before through the Ethnic Minority and Traveller Achievement Grant. For 2000-01, &#163;162.5 million will be available to LEAs to improve the attainment of ethnic minority, Traveller and refugee pupils, an increase of 7 per cent on the amount available for these purposes in 1999-2000. From April 2000, we are phasing in a needs-based formula for allocating the Grant for raising ethnic minority achievement. Increasingly, as we build up for the first time a national picture of achievement levels, we will target the Grant at those who need it most. In further developing the Grant we will seek to embed in local strategies the knowledge we are acquiring about good practice in raising achievement levels.

We have pressed for revenues to be used for development projects and for transparency in the oil account. The Government of Sudan has made public assurances that this will happen. We look to them to honour them. But the key issue for Sudan's development is the ongoing civil war. We are encouraging all sides to play a constructive part in current peace talks.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made in implementing the recommendation of the Social Exclusion Unit to allow housing authorities to accept as being vulnerable under the provisions of homelessness legislation 16 and 17 year olds who have no family support.  [108520]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w05.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Local authorities already have the power to accommodate young people whom they consider to be vulnerable and therefore in priority need, under the provisions of the Housing Act 1996. We recognise that young people who are leaving care may face particular difficulties in making the transition to independent living, as a consequence of institutionalisation and perhaps having limited back up support. The Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions' revised draft Code of Guidance on the Allocation of Accommodation and Homelessness, due to be published in the Spring, will therefore recommend that local authorities treat young care leavers, and 16-17 year olds with little or no back up support, as being vulnerable under the homelessness legislation.
<P>

<a name="00208w05.html_para0">In the revised Code of Guidance we will be recommending strategies for co-ordinated working between agencies, including the value of exploring joint assessments for those with multiple needs at an early stage. The Guidance will also explicitly refer to the need for this approach when assessing homelessness applications from vulnerable people and when dealing with the needs of young people between the ages of 16-18. The forthcoming Housing Green Paper is likely to include proposals for reform of the homelessness legislation to provide further protection for vulnerable people in priority need.

 Funding for the capital cost of heavy rail schemes is now generally a matter for the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority (SSRA). The SSRA is currently in discussion with Nottinghamshire County Council about the Strategy. I understand that the County Council will shortly be submitting a pre-qualification bid for funding to the SSRA under the Rail Passenger Partnership scheme for a new station at Ilkeston.

 Assessment of the relative spending pressures faced by local authorities is an important step in the distribution of revenue grants from central to local government.

Decisions about the merits of the various options for reform will not be taken until we have consulted widely this summer.

 We have no plans to shorten the period of notice a local authority must give before removing from public or private land any vehicle which it considers has been abandoned. The existing regulations are intended to provide owners with safeguards against a local authority prematurely assuming a vehicle is abandoned and having it towed away for scrap. They also ensure that local authorities do not have to go to the unnecessary expense of removing and storing vehicles that may not, in the event, have been abandoned.

 My Department supports a &#163;7.8 million programme on climate prediction at the Hadley Centre, which is based at the Met Office. Part of this research programme considers how sea level is projected to rise as a result of climate change. Extreme climate events are characterised by their "return period", i.e. the 100-year water level is the water level which occurs once in every 100 years. The Hadley Centre projections have been used by the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory to calculate how the return period for the current 100-year water level might change by the 2050s at a number of UK ports. The projections are currently very uncertain because of 



<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 2000 : Column: 104W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00208w07.html_para0">The projections indicate that in England and Wales, a current high tide which would be expected to occur once in every 100 years will occur more frequently. This would be exacerbated if storminess were also to increase as a result of climate change.

<P>

<a name="00208w07.html_para2">The new arrangements, proposed in the current Transport Bill, will lead to the separation of SRG as the regulator, from NATS as operator, as recommended by the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and the Regions. Under these arrangements, SRG will continue to have robust oversight of all NATS operations. This oversight will include the approval of processes and procedures through the NATS Safety Management System to ensure that traffic flows are regulated and managed at safe levels, irrespective of increasing demand, and that staff are rostered in compliance with the Scheme for the Regulation of Air Traffic Controllers' Hours (SRATCOH), so as to deal safely with the resulting volume of traffic.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w08.html_spnew0"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 I have been asked to reply.
<P>

<a name="00208w08.html_para0">The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) has funded a considerable amount of research into the exploitation of solar energy in the UK. This research can be divided into three technology sectors: Passive Solar Design--the direct use of solar heat gain and daytime light in buildings to display conventional energy demand--Solar Thermal Hot Water Heating--to displace energy from other conventional heating sources--and Photovoltaics--which produce electricity from the action of daylight on photovoltaic cells.
<P>

<a name="00208w08.html_para1">To date most of the DTI funded PV research has focused on issues which are common to all applications of PV in buildings, and to research into aspects of PV integration into larger non-domestic buildings. The 



<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 2000 : Column: 107W</I><P>
potential contribution that PV can make to UK conventional electricity demand has been estimated in "New and Renewable Energy Prospects for the 21st Century. Supporting Analysis. March 1999. ETSU R-122". This gave a theoretical estimate of around 270 TerraWatt hours a year (TWh/yr) if PV were installed on all available walls and roofs for the entire building stock. More realistically, if PV were to be installed on all south-facing roofs and facades this would yield an annual output of around 70 TWh, or a little over 22 per cent. of current electricity consumption, which stands at around 324 TWh/yr. Obviously, if we are looking only at the roofs of domestic properties, the theoretical potential would be proportionately less. Installing 2 kW systems on 50,000 homes would cost around &#163;500 million at current prices, but would generate less than one half of one tenth of 1 per cent. of current UK electricity demand.
<P>

<a name="00208w08.html_para2">In the short to medium term, up to 2010, the installed cost for PV on dwellings is expected to remain a major barrier to faster deployment of the technology. However, costs are expected to continue to reduce, and a market for domestic PV should develop accordingly, so that in the longer term PV has the potential to make a significant contribution to reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.
<P>

<a name="00208w08.html_para3">The DTI funded a demonstration project for a domestic PV roof in Oxford in the mid to late 90s. The 4 kW system cost in the region of &#163;25,000, and showed that, over the year, output from the system could match demand from an energy-efficient home, with surplus electricity generated by PV during the day, particularly during the summer months, being exported to the grid, and being balanced by imports during the night and winter months.
<P>

<a name="00208w08.html_para4">The DTI is contributing &#163;1 million towards a field trial looking at the implementation of PV on clusters of domestic dwellings. It is hoped this will result in total investment of &#163;2 million and the installation of PV systems on two to three hundred dwellings. Other ongoing work within the DTI Solar Programme is investigating the development of PV systems for domestic roofing.

The medical records of personnel fall into two types:
<BR>
 (a) Records of a clinical nature which are required to be held under conditions of medical confidentiality. Where there has been any occupational health intervention of anything more than a trivial nature, such a record should exist and will be held within the occupational health department under the control of suitable medical staff for the duration of a person's employment. Material maintained in the record will include items such as the results of medical examinations, results of health surveillance and clinical correspondence from other medical practitioners.
<BR>
 (b) Records not requiring storage under conditions of medical confidentiality which are retained on an individual's personal file. These will include items such as sickness certificates, any medical advice from a doctor to the employer (which should not include medical-in-confidence material) and records of sickness absence.
<BR>
All records are maintained for the duration of an individual's employment by DERA. In the case of individuals taking up further Civil Service employment, it is our policy to forward records to the new department or unit along with all other personal records. Otherwise, the clinical records are associated with the personal file (in a suitably sealed package) and forwarded to the Defence Storage and Distribution Centre at Llangennech.

I hope this information is helpful.

<P>
<a name="00208w09.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 It is not for us to account for the actions of the Iraqi military over a specific period of time. It is clear, however, that Saddam's internal security organisations continue to persecute all opponents of the regime on the ground. Coalition patrols of the no fly zones prevent Saddam Hussein from using his air force to repress the Iraqi people in the north and south of Iraq. Previously he has made extensive use of helicopter gun ships to repress the Kurdish population in the north, as well as both fixed wing aircraft and helicopter gun ships to repress Sh'ia Muslims in the south. Given the extensive history of brutality by Saddam Hussein's regime, there is no reason to believe that he would not resume these tactics were we to cease patrols. Coalition patrols of the no fly zones remain an essential humanitarian task in support of UN Security Council Resolution 688; without our continued presence in the air, he would be free to use his air force to return to an all out assault.

 Jennie Page has done a sterling job seeing the Millennium Dome through from its inception to opening, on time and on budget, on 31 December. The scale of this achievement should not be underestimated. However, it is the view of the NMEC Board, supported by the Shareholder on behalf of the Government, that a different approach and different skills are now needed to manage the project successfully during its year of operation. Jennie Page has resigned as Chief Executive of NMEC. The NMEC Board have appointed Pierre-Yves Gerbeau to succeed her. He took up his post yesterday.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what was the incidence of (a) serious kidney disease, (b) prostate cancer and (c) cervical cancer (i) in the last 12 months for which figures are available and (ii) five years ago.  [108524]<P>

<P>
<a name="00208w11.html_spnew2"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The category of "serious kidney disease" is not used in the statistics collected. One definition would be those with end stage renal failure, who are receiving renal replacement therapy (dialysis and transplant). The last published national survey of renal units showed the number of such patients treated in England and Wales in 1995 was 473 per million population. The 1999 report of the United Kingdom Renal Registry shows that the most comparable figure for 1998 was 528 per million population. The latest available incidence figures (1996) for prostate and cervical cancer together with data for 1991 for comparison are shown in the table.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health (1) what progress has been made by his Department in developing a joint strategy with the Home Department to provide services for children who run away from home; [108521]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make it his policy to introduce central monitoring of the number of children running away from local authority care; and if he will make a statement; [108522]

<P>
<a name="00208w11.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 We are taking forward a comprehensive range of measures to prevent children reaching the point where they feel the need to run away from home. These include the Government's Supporting Families programme and the Quality Protects programme to transform social services for children in need and their families. These initiatives will help to reduce the pressures felt by families which can lead to conflict and the breakdown of relationships. Schools have also been asked to pay greater attention to the home circumstances of a child and to liaise with other agencies where a child appears to have problems or difficulties. The proposed youth support service for 13-19 year olds will also have a significant role in identifying and assisting children in difficulty at home or at school.




<P>
<P><I>8 Feb 2000 : Column: 119W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00208w11.html_para5">It is essential that a holistic multi-agency approach to runaways is taken locally and the Department's Children's Services Planning Guidance advises social services departments to plan services for runaways on a collaborative basis with other agencies. Current provision includes refuges, drop-in centres, advocacy for young children, emergency foster care placements and night-stop accommodation.
<P>

<a name="00208w11.html_para6">Children's Services Planning Guidance also stresses the need for local authorities to monitor incidence and patterns of running away to assist the planning of services and to identify both families and institutions from which children run away repeatedly. From this April we will require local authorities in England to record absences of more than 24 hours from agreed placements for a sample of one third of their looked after children. These data will provide the first national estimate of the incidence of running away.

 In the 12 months to November 1999 major power producers' net purchases of coal amounted to 40.1 million tonnes. Of this, 32.8 million tonnes (82 per cent.) was of UK purchased coal and 7.3 million tonnes (18 per cent.) was of imported coal. The total quantity of coal consumed by major power producers over this 12 month period was 39.2 million tonnes. Data for individual coal-fired power stations are not available.

<P>
<a name="00208w12.html_spnew1"><B> Mrs. Liddell: </B> 
 As part of its Review of Energy Sources for Power Generation, the Department of Trade and Industry commissioned International Mining Consultants Limited (IMCL) to provide a report on the prospects for coal production in England, Scotland and Wales in the period to 2020. That report was substantially undertaken in May 1998 and published by The Stationery Office in March 1999. Since that time the world price of coal has fallen and this is likely in general terms to have reduced the levels of economically workable reserves and to have accelerated the date at which economic reserves of some collieries are likely to exhaust.

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry which EU document promotes the lowering of the monopoly limit on postal services of member states; what measures restrict national choice; and what consultation he has had with postal users in the United Kingdom concerning the policies of Her Majesty's Government in these matters.  [108722]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w12.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson: </B> 
 The Postal Services Directive (97/67/EC) sets the agreement between the European Union member states and the European Commission on common rules for the development of the internal market of community postal services and the improvement of quality of service. The Directive established the principle that postal services may be reserved by member states only to the extent necessary to ensure the maintenance of the universal service. The initial upper limit to the reserved area was set at five times the public tariff for an item for correspondence in the first weight step of first class post provided that it weighs less than 350 grams. The United Kingdom's reserved area is within this limit. The Directive also provided for further steps to be taken towards the completion of the internal market of postal services and tasked the European Commission to come forward with proposals for gradual and controlled liberalisation. It is expected that these proposals will issue shortly.
<P>

<a name="00208w12.html_para5">In the United Kingdom, extensive consultation has taken place, in relation to the reserved area and other postal matters, during the review which led to the White Paper on Post Office Reform which was published in July 1999. A Bill has now been laid in with the intention of consolidating the reforms outlined in the White Paper.
<P>

<a name="00208w12.html_para6">The Government are of the view that greater competition is essential for postal reform. Liberalisation promotes competition and greater choice and keener pricing for consumers. It also encourages greater innovation, productivity and growth of businesses. The Postal Service Commission (which takes up its duties on 1 April 2000) will have a duty to promote the interest of consumers of postal services, having regard to the need for effective competition wherever possible and appropriate.
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, pursuant to his answer of 17 January 2000, Official Report, columns 258-59W, on match funding, (a) what structural funds grants were received in the United Kingdom for (i) 1999 and (ii) preceding years, (b) what was the total of associated matched funding for that sum, and (c) if he will initiate a scheme to record the sources of matched funding for each grant received in 2000.  [108966]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w12.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Caborn: </B> 
 As explained in my previous answer of 17 January 2000, Official Report, columns 258-59W, there are no specific annual allocations to structural funds programmes and grants for individual years therefore cannot be identified. However the total value of grants to the UK's structural funds programmes which ended in 1999 amounted to approximately &#163;5.5 billion.
<P>

<a name="00208w12.html_para8">The previous answer also explained that the level of match funding varied from programme to programme, and depended on the nature of the various projects. That information was not recorded centrally.
<P>

<a name="00208w12.html_para9">It would require disproportionate effort to record and collate the precise source of match funding for each of the many thousands of projects which receive structural funds assistance.

 The latest published data show that during 1998 the amounts of kerosene and gas oil used by industry were 841 and 2,894 thousand tonnes respectively, the latter figure including some eight thousand tonnes of gas oil used by industry for on-site generation of electricity during the year. The figure for gas oil does not include any amount of gas diesel oil used as a fuel for round transport, i.e. DERV fuel. Information on the amount of DERV fuel used by industry is not available. Preliminary figures for 1999 suggest that industrial kerosene use has increased by approximately 15 per cent. while industrial gas oil use has decreased by approximately 10 per cent.

 It is not possible to provide an estimate based on the information given in the question. The cost of any paid parental leave scheme to the Exchequer and employers will depend upon the assumptions made about take up, the length of leave taken as well as the level of support provided.

 The Government want to hear what people have to say about suggested new proposals and policies, and this is an important aspect of the modernising government initiative.

<a name="00208w13.html_para0">For the Wales Office from 1 July 1999, a joint consultation with DETR titled "Improving Rights of Way in England and Wales" has been carried out. The actual consultation was carried out by the Assembly, on my behalf, and they wrote to me summarising the responses, and copied them to the relevant Whitehall department, to ensure that the responses were fed into the outcome. The results have not yet been published, and it is too soon for any analysis of the extent and nature of policy changes arising from the consultation to have been conducted.

 We set out our strategy for combating fraud and reducing error in "Safeguarding Social Security", published on 23 March 1999. We are putting this strategy into practice with strong and sensible safeguards to ensure the right money goes to the right people. Among the new initiatives that carry this forward are the following:
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>New more robust powers for fraud inspectors in The Child Support, Pensions and Social Security Bill published on 1 December. These provisions give greater clarity and allow all benefit fraud investigations to proceed on the basis of common powers.
<P>
<BR>
All payments will move to automated credit transfer (ACT) from 2003 as a modern, more secure and efficient method of paying benefits. This will virtually eliminate "instrument of payment" fraud and enhance security over the life of a claim. This is expected to yield fraud savings in the region of &#163;140 million--&#163;240 million.
<P>
<BR>
A regional radio campaign, costing some &#163;500,000, with supporting adverts in local newspapers, to advertise the Benefit Fraud Hotline. This has led to thousands of extra calls to the Hotline. Later this year the public will be able to contact the Hotline via the internet.

<P>
<a name="00208w15.html_spnew2"><B> Angela Eagle: </B> 
 Local and central government have a common aim in transforming the delivery of Housing Benefit/Council Tax Benefit (HB/CTB) so that all local authorities can provide their communities with a faster, more accurate service which is more secure against fraud and error, provides value for money and takes account of the views and needs of clients.
<P>

<a name="00208w15.html_para3">Many local authorities are providing an excellent benefits service and are committed to modernising the way in which they provide it for local people. We are delighted that Leeds City Council was one of the five councils awarded Beacon status under the Modern Service Delivery theme along with the London Boroughs of Camden and Harrow, Exeter City Council and New Forest District Council. Beacon councils have a key role in disseminating best practice so that others can benefit from their experience.
<P>

<a name="00208w15.html_para4">New Best Value performance indicators will target key areas of benefit administration from April 2000. All local authorities will be required to set and meet challenging targets against indicators and demonstrate that they are achieving continuous improvements in the standards of service they provide.
<P>

<a name="00208w15.html_para5">There are many other initiatives underway between local and central government, including the pilot ONE service where Leeds City Council is a key player. Their involvement has been key to the delivery of the ONE service in Leeds, not only because of their responsibility for delivering housing benefit and council tax benefit, but also because of their expertise in providing a wide range of local services and information.

 Secondments and attachments are part of the Interchange Initiative which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the Civil Service and other organisations. All sectors of the economy are involved: Voluntary, Education, Health, Public and Private. Interchange is a key component of the reform agenda. The Modernising Government White Paper committed us to increasing interchange, in particular by bringing in more people on secondment and sending more of our people out.

 When he published the Quinquennial Review of the Public Trust Office, my noble and learned Friend the Lord Chancellor indicated that he would explore the Review's recommendations in a programme of reform and would make a further announcement on the way forward in February 2000. It remains his view that radical reforms are needed but he is also determined to ensure, in an area where we are trying to protect the interests of some of the most vulnerable in society, that we consider very carefully the full implications of any changes we make. Several organisations and professional groups commenting on the Quinquennial Review have asked for an extension of the timetable in order to put forward their views. In order to ensure that all have sufficient time to give their views, the Lord Chancellor now intends to allow comments to be submitted up until 3 March. The Lord Chancellor will consider these and make an announcement on the way forward for the Public Trust Office by this Easter.

<a name="00208w17.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Vaz: </B> 
 We recognise that it may be helpful in some cases for visa applicants to be accompanied at interview by a friend or relative. For this reason entry clearance posts have discretion to allow this. But in other cases the presence of a second person at an interview may make it more difficult for entry clearance officers to judge the applicant's intentions, which they are required to do under the Immigration Rules. I therefore believe that the current policy of allowing posts discretion to decide should be retained.

We welcome the fact that the new government has committed itself to abiding by the common obligations and values of EU membership, but we will be judging it by its future actions. We also support the Commission statement on this issue. The measures which Britain agreed on 31 January with the 13 other member states are now a force to limit bilateral contact with Austria.

<P>

<a name="00208w17.html_para6">The UN Inter-Agency-Coordinated Appeal for East Timor, launched on 27 October 1999, set out requirements of US$199 million for urgent humanitarian needs. This was subsequently revised to $126 million, with the remaining $57 million of spending plans assumed into those for longer term reconstruction and development spending. Of this $126 million, $40 million was expected to have been disbursed by the end of 1999.
<P>

<a name="00208w17.html_para7">A United Nations/World Bank Donor meeting held in Tokyo on 17 December 1999 also set out requirements of $300 million over three years for reconstruction and medium to long-term development and $28.3 million for the governance and public administration of East Timor. Voluntary contributions for these requirements will be channelled through Trust Funds established by the World Bank and United Nations respectively.

 The Passport Agency's partnership arrangement with Post Office Counters Limited, entered into in January 1996, provided a facility for applications marked as urgent to be processed within a minimum of four working days. The service proved very difficult to operate and the urgency of the applications was not always clear. When the Agency re-tendered the partnership arrangements late in 1999, the specification was for a guaranteed 10 day service for customers applying via a partner. The Agency believes this is the best way to meet its customers needs. Final negotiations are currently taking place with Post Office Counters Limited on the new arrangements, but the Agency considered it sensible to implement the standard 10 day turnaround now.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department, pursuant to his answer of 31 January 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 431W, on electronic tracking, (1) which category of one-off absence was used to allow a professional footballer to breach the home detention curfew restrictions; who gave authority for this one-off absence; and if the player will be allowed further one-off absences;  [108682]
<P>
<UL>(2) if he will make it a requirement for private sector contractors operating the home detention curfew scheme to notify his Department of all one-off absences and the circumstances in which they occur.  [108683]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w18.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Mr. Gary Croft was granted a variation in the hours of his Home Detention Curfew on 21 and 22 January by the Governor of Her Majesty's Prison Hollesley Bay. The variation in hours was, therefore, not a one-off absence, which can be granted by contractors in specified circumstances as outlined in my earlier reply to the hon. Member.
<P>

<a name="00208w18.html_para2">Governors have the discretion to vary an offender's curfew hours, taking into account legitimate reasons for the necessary absence of the curfewee from his or her home at certain times. This would include working hours, and would take into account reasonable travelling times. Mr. Croft was granted the variation in hours to enable him to represent his employers, Ipswich Town Football Club, in an away match against Bolton Wanderers Football Club. He was subsequently granted a similar variation in hours to enable him to represent Ipswich Town in an away match against Barnsley Football Club on 5 February.

 <i>[holding answer 3 February 2000]:</i> Mr. Ram is currently held at Full Sutton prison which does not provide a specific offending behaviour course.

 <i>[holding answer 3 February 2000]:</i> As with any mandatory life sentence prisoner, Satpal Ram will be released from prison on life licence only if, following a review of his case by the Parole Board, the Board recommend his release and Ministers, after consulting the judiciary, agree. Satpal Ram's latest Parole Board review began in December 1999. The review will take account of reports prepared by prison and probation staff familiar with Mr. Ram's case, an interview between Mr. Ram and a Parole Board member (who will not be a member of the Panel who ultimately considers Mr. Ram's case) and any representations which Mr. Ram wishes to make for consideration by the Board. A Panel of the Board will then consider his case and make their recommendation. This all takes time, but the outcome of Mr. Ram's latest review should be known later this year.

 Graffiti is a form of criminal damage, which is recorded in the Home Office Statistical Bulletin--Notifiable Offences. According to the Recorded Crime Statistics covering England and Wales from October 1998 to September 1999, there were 908,585 offences of criminal damage. There is no sub-total for graffiti and it is not, therefore, possible to estimate the costs of graffiti over the past four years.
<P>

maximum penalty is ten years imprisonment for those over 18 and over, and up to two years detention in a Young Offender Institution for those aged 15-17.

<a name="00208w19.html_para6">The Home Office recognise that the most effective way to tackle vandalism is through co-ordinated preventive action at the local level involving all of the relevant agencies, such as the police, local authorities and schools.

<P>

<a name="00208w19.html_para7">Regarding guidance for paint spray manufactures and retailers, I understand the attraction of introducing a ban on the sale of aerosol paint. To introduce a blanket ban on the sale of aerosol paint, however, would penalise young people who have a legitimate reason for their purchase. Such a ban would prevent the determined graffiti "artists" from obtaining aerosol paint and continuing their criminal activity. Retailers should, as a matter of course, give consideration to whom they sell such products. There are no plans to issue guidance on this; nor do we have any present plans to legislate against the sale of spray paints. The matter will be kept under review.

 Under the Crime Reduction Programme Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) Initiative, the Government are investing &#163;153 million over three years in public area CCTV systems in England and Wales. We have already allocated &#163;32 million for 180 car park related schemes under the first round of the initiative.
<P>

<a name="00208w20.html_para1">The second round of the initiative will be launched in the spring. We will continue to encourage applications aimed at reducing theft in car parks, particularly where CCTV is being introduced as part of a package of measures to achieve Secured Car Park status.

 We have received 110 comments in response to the report of the Vehicle Crime Reduction Action Team (VCRAT) published in September 1999 setting out measures to achieve the Government's 30 per cent. vehicle crime reduction target. All but two of the comments referred specifically to the VCRAT proposal for the compulsory fitting of electronic immobilisers to seven to 10-year-old cars and most of these were opposed to the proposal. Two comments were received on the question of compulsory carriage of driving licenses (one for and one against). In addition, two of the comments covered wider issues including the role of the courts, motor projects, the insurance industry, crime and disorder partnerships, legislative protection of marks on vehicle component parts, retention of motor salvage, motorcycle theft and the possibility of reducing the rate of Value Added Tax on vehicle security products.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what representations he has received on changing the law in England and Wales to ban wheel clamping on private land; and if he will make a statement. [R] [108385]<P>

<P>
<a name="00208w21.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 We regularly receive representations from members of the public, right hon. and hon. Members, and others about wheel clamping on private land, but the majority are in favour of regulating, not banning, the practice.

<P>
<a name="00208w21.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Lidington: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what recent discussions he has had with chief officers of police regarding his proposals to amend the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill to make public authorities subject to legislation forbidding indirect discrimination.  [109212]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00208w21.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Commission for Racial Equality's Third Review of the Race Relations Act 1976 recommended, among other things, that the Act apply to all activities of Government and to all public sector bodies. The Association of Chief Officers of Police responded positively to this recommendation, as part of the Government's public consultation on the Commission's proposals, indicating support for it. The Association reiterated that support in March 1999 in the context of the recommendation in the Report of the Inquiry into the Death of Stephen Lawrence that the full force of the Race Relations legislation should apply to the police.
<P>

<a name="00208w21.html_para0">The Government had initial concerns that including indirect discrimination in the Race Relations (Amendment) Bill might leave public bodies open to routine legal challenges to regulatory, economic and social policies in circumstances where these were entirely proper, in particular those that helped ethnic minorities the most. On balance, however, the Government concluded having listened carefully to the arguments put forward about this issue in Parliament and elsewhere that the risk of spurious challenge is outweighed by the principle of including indirect discrimination in respect of public sector functions in the Bill. No further formal public consultation was conducted.
