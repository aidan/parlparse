 It is my Department&#039;s policy to make all relevant information available via its website as a matter of course unless that information should more correctly be published elsewhere online. For example, Acts of Parliament are published by HMSO. In these latter cases, my Department&#039;s policy is to provide links from its website to the information.

 To ask the Minister of State, Department for Constitutional Affairs whether guidance has been issued to courts requiring the granting of maintenance awards on an equal basis for each parent in cases where custody is awarded on an equal basis.  [4032]</p>








<p><a name="st_1"><a name="50616w01.html_spnew1"><b> Bridget Prentice: </b> 
 No guidance on this matter has been issued to the courts. Under existing legislation the courts are empowered to make a number of orders in relation to the division of family property and financial provision for children. The courts will consider a range of issues in each case, including the contribution, both financial and other, made by each of the parties to looking after the home and children. The courts have the discretion to make the orders that they see as appropriate and fair with regard to the specific circumstances of each case. The needs of children are always the paramount consideration. Orders are made with regard to the financial status, and disposable income, of both parties.

 In line with its manifesto commitments, the Government will examine the potential of moving away from the current system of motoring taxation towards a national system of road pricing.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50616w05.html_para5">
<a name="stpa_30">The Feasibility Study of Road Pricing in the UK, published by the Department for Transport in July 2004, concluded that a scheme could reduce congestion by some 40 per cent. and achieve benefits of up to &#163;12 billion a year in time savings and increased reliability. This would bring benefits for the economy as a whole and individuals using the road network for business and leisure.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50616w05.html_para6">
<a name="stpa_31">The Feasibility Study recognised that before road pricing could be implemented much more work would need to be done. It is too early to specify all the details of a scheme, or to determine precisely its impacts. It will be important to learn from the experiences of charging schemes already in place, such as the London Congestion Charge. We need to design a system that works at a reasonable cost, with clear benefits to road users as well as the country as a whole. Key considerations include the need to safeguard our environmental objectives, respect privacy and the setting of prices.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50616w05.html_para7">
<a name="stpa_32">More detailed work is now being taken forward to allow a decision to be made about whether national road pricing should be introduced and what form it should take.

 Estimates published in March this year suggest that in 2004 UK greenhouse gas emissions were provisionally about 12.5 per cent. below base year levels. The data released in March also indicate that, even without the further action currently being considered under the review of the UK Climate Change Programme, the UK will be about 20 per cent. below base year levels in 2010. The UK is therefore on course to meet its Kyoto protocol commitment to reduce emissions of a basket of six greenhouse gases by 12.5 per cent. below base level years by 2008&#150;12. This is a significant achievement. On the basis of existing policies, emissions of carbon dioxide are projected to be about 13 per cent. below the 1990 level in 2010.

For example, the Royal Botanic Gardens (RBG) Kew, a non-departmental public body sponsored by Defra, carries out much important work, in support of the Convention on Biological Diversity. All living collections held at RBG Kew have undergone a conservation audit so that their endangered state is known and this material is available for propagation and reintroduction. RBG Kew assists governments to identify areas of floristic diversity which should be protected in countries such as Bolivia, Brazil, Madagascar, Cameroon, Thailand and Brunei, and manages the Millennium Seed Bank Project which involves partnerships between 18 countries which seek to collect and conserve long-term, seed from 24,200 species. Seed of 96 per cent. of the seed bearing flora of the British Isles are also held in the Millennium Seed Bank. Seeds of rare and threatened species, such as the Lady&#039;s Slipper Orchid, are micro-propagated prior to reintroduction into the wild as part of the national Biodiversity Action Plan (BAP), managed by English Nature and other UK conservation agencies. Collections of rare UK BAP lower plants (bryophytes) are held as a cryo-preserved collection and work is currently under way to develop methods to recover and reintroduce these cryo-preserved collections.

<p>
<a name="50616w10.html_para1">
<a name="stpa_59">Also, in recognition that zoos can play a role in breeding endangered species for conservation purposes, British zoos are regulated through the Zoo Licensing Act 1981 to require them to participate in conservation measures including captive-breeding programmes for endangered species of animals.

All woodland management by the Forestry Commission is consistent with this standard and we expect private woodland owners that receive grant aid from the Forestry Commission to also meet the standard. The Government have encouraged the development of the voluntary UK Woodland Assurance Standard that provides an independent verification of compliance with good practice and measures to ensure the continuing good health of woodland.

Notes:<br>

1.Differences in sampling methodology between 1980 and 1998 may account for some of the differences.<br>

2.In the 1980 Census the area assigned to broadleaves and conifers included any associated open space such as roads and rides. In the 1998 Inventory open spaces are separately identified and to obtain meaningful comparison between the two datasets the 1980 Census data has been reduced by the percentage of open space identified in the 1998 Inventory (Nationally 6.5 per cent.).<br>

<p><a name="qn_152"><a name="50616w16.html_wqn7"><b> Annette Brooke: </b> 
 To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills for what reasons the budget of Bournemouth and Poole College of Further Education for the academic year 2005/06 is being reduced.  [741]</p>








<p><a name="st_151"><a name="50616w16.html_spnew7"><b> Bill Rammell  </b> 
<i>[holding answer 25 May 2005]:</i> Funding for further education is increasing and will rise by over &#163;1 billion in 2005/06 compared to 2002/03&#151;almost a 20 per cent. real terms increase over three years. Funding increases for individual colleges will depend on a number of factors including the extent to which college activities align with our key priorities. The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) have not yet confirmed Bournemouth and Poole College&#039;s allocation for 2005/06. As the allocation of funding to colleges relates to the LSC&#039;s operational responsibilities. I have asked the LSC&#039;s Chief Executive, Mark Haysom, to write to the hon. Member with the information requested. A copy of his reply will be placed in the Library.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50616w16.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_110"><i>Letter from Mark Haysom to Annette Brooke, dated 9 June 2005:</i>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_73">I write in response to your recent Parliamentary Question to the Secretary of State for Education and Skills regarding FE funding for Bournemouth and Poole College. Following discussions with colleagues who work with the College, I hope the following will answer your concerns.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_74">Bournemouth and Poole College&#039;s Further Education allocation for 2004/05 was &#163;22,684,000. The budget for this year, (2005/06) has been confirmed at &#163;23,134,337&#151;an actual increase on the previous year. Written confirmation of this amount was given to the college on 27 May.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_75">The LSC is aware that some FE institutions are warning of serious cuts in courses for adults, particularly part-time courses, to make ends meet while others talk of the need for staff redundancies. We have always been clear that this funding round was going to be tough and that the whole sector is going to have to make difficult choices.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_76">None of this is due to the LSC cutting FE budgets. In fact we have increased FE funding nationally from &#163;3.5 billion to &#163;4.5billion from 2001/02 to 2005/06, an increase of 29 per cent. This year we will be increasing national funding by a further &#163;170 million. This increase is reflected across the country with Bournemouth and Poole College seeing an increase of &#163;450,337.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_77">The fact that budgets have increased does not disguise the immense challenges ahead. Public funds are always finite and there will never be enough money to do all that the LSC or the FE colleges would like to do. There are a number of key factors to explain why colleges like Bournemouth and Poole are feeling the funding squeeze. The first is their success in driving up participation and achievement. For example, we now have the highest ever level of 16&#150;18 year olds in education and training. These numbers have to be funded and this has put a strain on budgets, leaving less for other areas and ensuring that money will be tight in the next academic year and beyond.</p>
</ul>
<p>





<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Jun 2005 : Column 587W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>

</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_78">Funding is also being squeezed because we are concentrating funding on key priorities we have agreed with the Government in the areas of education and training for 16&#150;18 year olds, young people taking Apprenticeships, anyone needing to improve their literacy and numeracy and anyone without a full level 2 qualification. These priorities are vital to delivering the Government&#039;s Skills Strategy.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_79">Copies of The Skills We Need&quot;: Our Annual Statement of Priorities, which sets out the key actions for this coming year, were distributed during December 2004 and this was followed by a paper outlining local priorities, several group presentations and one to one meetings with the College. The last of these was held on May 12 to finalise allocations and gave them a week to respond with views.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_80">We recognise this situation will not be easy and we understand that some colleges find it difficult to reduce courses outside our priorities. That is why we believe they can develop additional funding by increasing the fees for those individuals with higher-level qualifications and from employers.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_81">The Skills Strategy clearly emphasised the need for employers and individuals to contribute more in relation to the significant benefits they receive from education and training. That is why following consultation last year, the LSC increased the levels colleges are assumed to charge for courses from 25 per cent. to 27.5 per cent. Raising fees is designed to ensure public funds are concentrated on those people with low or no skills to bring about a better balance between public and private investment in education and training.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_82">In the summer of 2004, I discussed with college principals from all parts of the country the major and urgent issues facing further education. The extensive dialogue was an essential part of the LSC&#039;s commitment to work in partnership with FE in a spirit of trust, openness and transparency.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_83">Following this we produced an agenda for change, identifying issues crucial to the transformation of FE to meet the needs of learners and employers. For our part, the LSC made very clear the scale of the challenges that we face together and the transformation agenda that we must pursue in FE to meet those challenges. I will be speaking further about our progress during a second series of regional road shows planned for this summer.</p>
</ul>
<p>


</p>
<ul>

<p class="tabletext"><a name="brev_84">Trish Taylor, Executive Director for Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole plans to keep you updated throughout this year with progress against our priorities for Bournemouth, Dorset and Poole. In the meantime, I hope this letter answers your questions regarding funding for Bournemouth and Poole College.</p>

 Research has shown that fathers play a vital part in children&#039;s lives and that they can make a real difference in children&#039;s educational, emotional and social development, for both girls and boys. We have introduced a range of measures aimed at supporting fathers in their important role. For example, we have developed materials for schools on working with fathers, including a booklet on Engaging Fathers&quot; and an Involving Parents Raising Achievement&quot; toolkit. We have supported, through the Parenting Fund and the Strengthening Families Grant, projects run by organisations in the Voluntary and Community Sector which focus on fathers. We are currently considering what further measures we might put in place to meet the specific needs of fathers, and particularly to encourage them to support their children&#039;s development and learning, as we develop our work to support parents more generally.

<p><a name="st_155"><a name="50616w17.html_spnew3"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 The content of the Higher Education Act 2004 was decided by Parliament after full debate. Parliament did not decide to include specific provisions about bursaries or loan repayments for any students, whether or not from the European Union.

<p><a name="st_156"><a name="50616w17.html_spnew4"><b> Bill Rammell: </b> 
 Assuming that 91 per cent. of EU students are charged the full &#163;3,000 fee and 9 per cent. charged &#163;2,000, and assuming that 80 per cent. of them take out a fee loan and that their repayment behaviour is similar to English and Welsh students, costs are estimated to be around &#163;40 million <sup>1</sup>  per year (steady state at academic year 2006/07 terms). These costs are made up of the interest rate subsidy of loans together with the costs that are never repaid for example loans that are written off after 25 years or death.

<p>
<a name="50616w17.html_para0">
<a name="stpa_111">The costs of EU students studying in the UK are offset by the longer term economic benefits which they bring. It is estimated that each EU student provides a net benefit of over &#163;6,000 per year in living expenses to the UK <sup>2</sup> . Multiplying this estimate for individual contributions to the UK economy by the estimated number of eligible EU students suggests that these students alone contribute &#163;270 million per year. Of the known first destinations of EU undergraduates, 25 per cent. remain in the UK to work after graduation and on average they pay &#163;5,000 in income tax over 1.5 years <sup>2</sup> . In addition there are substantial unquantifiable benefits to the UK. In particular, the UK benefits from an addition to its stock of employed manpower of a significant number of highly skilled young people. Other benefits arise from the contribution of these EU students and researchers within UK HEIs, and from having a significant proportion of the young future elite of Europe living, studying and working in this country for an important and formative period in their lives.

<sup>(13)</sup>The Age Participation index (API) is defined as the number of home domiciled young (aged less than 21) initial entrants to full-time and sandwich undergraduate courses expressed as a proportion of the averaged 18 to 19-year-old GB population. The Age Participation Index has been superseded by the Higher Education Initial Participation Rate (HEIPR) which measures the participation of 18 to 30-year-olds, and in 2002 the social class categories were replaced by a new socio-economic group (SEG) classification. The Department has commissioned a report to look at disaggregating the HEIPR by SEG Class, or recommend other alternatives if this is not possible.<br>

As for mainstream schools, depending on local circumstances, these plans can include new buildings and/or improvements to existing buildings. Costs of each project are only identified as they proceed through procurement and are not finalised until contract signature. We have indicated to local authorities broadly where in the 15-year programme their projects will come, but have not specified in which wave.

<p>
<a name="50616w19.html_para3">
<a name="stpa_123">Building Schools for the Future is not the only programme which supports building improvements in special schools. Each special school receives its own allocation of Devolved Formula Capital and local authorities can use their formulaic capital allocations to address the needs of special schools, which should be included in their asset management plans. Special schools are also a priority project within the Targeted Capital Fund, and we are currently considering applications for funding in 2006&#150;07 and 2007&#150;08.

The 2005 results, which will be published in a Statistical First Release in October, will inform the calculation of a challenging trajectory to enable the progress made by children to be measured. The 2005 survey will also collect for the first time information about children in the 20 per cent. most disadvantaged areas and this will be used to measure the rate of development achieved by children in these areas compared to the national picture. The figures from the 2004 survey indicate that 51 per cent. of children are working securely within the Early Learning Goals for communication, social and emotional development.

 The Government&#039;s overarching priority for children with SEN is that their needs should be met in an appropriate way, through an appropriate package of support.

The Home Secretary decided to implement the recommendations of the PSPRB in full with the local pay rates for most London prisons remaining at &#163;4,000.

We are exploring sector-specific initiatives with business, e.g. in construction and engineering, to ensure that companies operating in these high-risk areas understand their obligations.

<p>
<a name="50616w24.html_para9">
<a name="stpa_166">More generally, the Government have taken a number of steps in recent years with regard to preventing corruption and empowering law enforcers to investigate such offences. For example, by means of part 12 of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 (ATCS Act), which clarifies that the existing offences of bribery apply to the bribery of foreign officials and introduces a new jurisdiction over acts of bribery committed by UK nationals or UK-based companies overseas.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50616w24.html_para10">
<a name="stpa_167">The UK have also ensured it has an adequate legal framework to implement the OECD Convention, as specifically acknowledged by the OECD Working Group on Bribery. In addition, the Government have made progress towards ratification of the UN Convention Against Corruption with the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50616w24.html_para11">
<a name="stpa_168">The Government continues to make efforts elsewhere to prevent foreign bribery, for example, by stepping up its awareness-raising activities with the business community, public officials&#151;in the UK and overseas missions&#151;and NGOs to improve knowledge of the law and of the damage caused by international corruption. We are exploring sector-specific initiatives with business, e.g. in construction and engineering, to ensure that companies operating in these high-risk areas understand their obligations. And we continue to support codes of conduct and business principles promulgated by the likes of the International Chamber of Commerce and the World Economic Forum. Separately, ECGD has launched a consultation exercise on its anti-bribery measures (applicants for Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD) support must of course already comply with its anti-bribery and corruption procedures, which are amongst the most robust in use by any of the world&#039;s leading Export Credit Agencies).
</p>


<p>
<a name="50616w24.html_para12">
<a name="stpa_169">At the same time, law enforcers have streamlined the arrangements that relate to the handling of such allegations. To this end, the Serious Fraud Office now 



<br>&nbsp;<br><i>16 Jun 2005 : Column 614W</i><br>&nbsp;<br>
plays a central part in the process and is investigating a number of cases. Law enforcers continue to keep these arrangements under review. The Government have also highlighted the provisions of part 12 of ATCS Act in the National Policing Plan, which asks forces to support SFO investigations involving these new powers and to take on those investigations not falling within the SFO&#039;s remit.

 Insolvency levels, both personal and corporate can and do fluctuate, influenced by a number of economic factors such as inflation rates, the availability and price of credit, employment levels and economic growth. The trend in personal insolvencies has been steadily upward since 1997 and reflects in part the extent to which access to personal credit has increased. Corporate insolvencies increased modestly between 1997 and 2002, since when they have fallen, due to a stable economic environment for business and an increasing tendency for businesses to address their financial problems at an earlier stage.

 For financial years 2002&#150;03 and 2003&#150;04, information for each Regional Development Agency (RDA) in England is detailed as follows. The Department does not monitor the RDAs&#039; spend in terms of running costs and management costs. However, these costs, included as shown, are based on certain assumptions (see footnote). Figures in bracket represent these categories as percentage of each RDA&#039;s net budget allocation for that year.

 The numbers leaving incapacity benefits and returning to work are not recorded in this format. An estimate of the proportion of incapacity benefit leavers returning to employment can be obtained from the annual Destination of Benefit Leavers Survey (DWP In-House Research Report no. 132), which is available in the Library. The latest published figures, for 2004 benefit leavers, show that 49 per cent. of incapacity benefit leavers surveyed had returned to work of 16 hours or more per week.

Ongoing studies by industry will determine the optimum and most cost-effective way in which any co-operative options can be implemented.

<a name="stpa_218">It is the Government&#039;s intention to focus patient forum activity at the primary care trust (PCT) level but with arrangements in place to ensure the whole patients&#039; journey&quot; is covered by forum activity. In the context of the London Ambulance Service NHS trust, it is envisaged that all London PCT forums would work together to ensure that ambulance services are monitored and reviewed effectively from the patient perspective. It will be for the forums themselves to decide how best to achieve a comprehensive and robust arrangement, but one approach might be for each PCT forum to nominate one of its number to form a pan-London specialist ambulance review panel. Such an arrangement would mean that there was strong input from across the city with a membership of 29, with each London locality having a real chance to input into the LAS at both strategic and operational levels.
