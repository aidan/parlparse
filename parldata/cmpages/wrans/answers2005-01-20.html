<sup>(1)</sup> In April 1999, London Underground adopted new accounting treatment for its investment expenditure which removed the category &#039;renewals&#039; and reclassified such expenditure as capital or operating costs as appropriate. Therefore the figures up to and including 1998&#150;99 are not directly comparable with those for subsequent years.<br>

<sup>(2)</sup> This includes the investment in fixed assets undertaken by the infracos under the PPP contracts, for those assets on LUL&#039;s balance sheet.<br>

<sup>(3)</sup> This excludes expenditure on assets provided under the PFI contracts, as they are not on LUL&#039;s balance sheet.<br>

 On 4 January 2005 the Veterinary Medicines Directorate (VMD) issued a letter to more than 300 organisations and individuals announcing a formal consultation exercise and inviting comments on the draft Veterinary Medicines Regulations 2005 and associated guidance notes which set out revised controls on veterinary medicines. The new Regulations are intended to implement amendments to EU legislation, carry forward some recommendations of the recent Marsh and Competition Commission Reports on the supply of veterinary prescription only medicines, and to simplify and consolidate existing UK legislative provisions which are currently contained in the Medicines Act 1968 and some 50 statutory instruments. It is proposed to replace these with a single set of Regulations containing all the provisions, which will come into force at the end of October 2005 to comply with the timetable for implementing the amended EU requirements.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs how many tonnes of waste mercury were produced in <i>(a)</i> 1999&#150;2000, <i>(b)</i> 2000&#150;01, <i>(c)</i> 2001&#150;02 and <i>(d)</i> 2002&#150;03; and how much of this was recycled.  [206782]</p>




<p><a name="50120w04.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Morley: </b> 
 A key source of mercury waste arises from the chlor-alkali industry. Annual figures for the three UK mercury cell chlor-alkali plants for the years in question are set out in table 1. Large amounts of mercury will no longer be required when mercury cell plants are decommissioned, although this mercury is pure enough to be re-used without further treatment. Mercury can be present in waste arising from a range of other industries, including from power generation, and mining activities, although there are no aggregated national figures available for these. Mercury is also present in used dental amalgam, some forms of lighting equipment, certain thermometers, thermostats, manometers, some batteries, switches and relays, although the use in all these applications is declining. Implementation of the WEEE Directive and the hazardous waste regulations should encourage the greater recovery and recycling of mercury from these sources.

 To ask the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions how many <i>(a)</i> pensioners and <i>(b)</i> pensioner households in Sunderland (i) are eligible for winter fuel allowance, (ii) have not yet received their entitlement and (iii) have reported non-receipt of their allowance; and if he will make a statement.

<p><a name="50120w09.html_spnew8"><b> Malcolm Wicks: </b> 
 It is not possible to provide an estimate of the number of people or households in Sunderland who are eligible to receive a winter fuel payment. Nor is it possible to say how many have not yet received their entitlement. The great majority of those who are entitled to a payment receive this automatically. Others have until 30 March 2005 to make their claim. So far there have been 78 reports of non-receipt of the winter fuel payment from people in Sunderland. These are being investigated and payments posted as appropriate.

As the National Met Service for the United Kingdom, the Met Office has a responsibility for warning the citizens of the UK of severe weather events. Severe weather warnings are issued when it is judged there is a possible danger to life and property, or when disruption to transport is possible. Two types of warnings are issued. Flash warnings are typically issued three to six hours ahead of a predicted event and early warnings are issued up to five days ahead of a forecast event. These warnings are made available to the public via a range of media (including national television and radio) and to other Government bodies and agencies who have a responsibility for the protection of life, property and infrastructure. During 2004 a total of 406 severe weather warnings were issued. The Met Office records for 2004 indicate that some 87 per cent. of severe weather events occurring in the UK were preceded by a severe weather warning.

The measures under consideration include: raising the minimum age for purchasing a knife to 18; adding new categories of knife now being used in crime to the list of banned offensive weapons; providing a power to require specified licensed premises to search for an offensive weapon on entry; giving head teachers a new power to search pupils for knives; pulling together best practice from initiatives and schemes focusing on knife crime and developing local crime reduction and enforcement strategies on dealing with the carrying of knives.

<p><a name="50120w16.html_spnew7"><b> Mr. Browne: </b> 
 The UN Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families is not compatible with the Government&#039;s immigration policies. For example, most overseas nationals coming to the UK to take employment require a work permit. The UK employer applies for a work permit to enable them to fill a specific vacancy in the UK, following which the worker applies for leave to enter or remain in the UK. If the migrant worker leaves this employment they are expected to leave the UK or to apply for a work permit for their new employment. The Convention, however, would allow them to remain in the UK for the duration of their leave, whether or not they were still employed. We consider that unemployed migrants being able to remain in the UK and claim benefits in these circumstances would act as an unnecessary &quot;pull factor&quot; and undermine current immigration controls.

 Last June, the Council concluded that any Community instrument in the fields of nuclear installation safety or the safe management of radioactive waste and spent fuel should be developed only following a process of consultation involving stakeholders and should take account of future developments in the international arena running through at least into 2006. Last December, the Working Party on Atomic Questions adopted an Action Plan for implementing these Council Conclusions. It envisages a programme of activities for the member states, acting individually or collectively, linked to the standards-making work of the IAEA, the peer review processes of the relevant international Conventions and the efforts to harmonise regulatory approaches currently being undertaken by Europe&#039;s national nuclear safety authorities. At their meeting on 13 January, experts considered ways in which this work should be carried forward with a view to identifying what, if any, further action at EU level might be helpful in order to improve nuclear safety. At this stage, it is not clear what source documents will be considered although the Health and Safety Executive&#039;s expert intends to draw the Working Party&#039;s attention to the United Kingdom&#039;s third national report for the Convention on Nuclear Safety.

3. Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data, ie, the data are ungrossed.<br>

4. Time waited statistics from hospital episode statistics (HES) are not the same as the published waiting list statistics. HES provides counts and time waited for all patients admitted to hospital within a given period whereas the published waiting list statistics count those waiting for treatment on a specific date and how long they have been on the waiting list. Also, HES calculates the time waited as the difference between the admission and decision to admit dates. Unlike published waiting list statistics, this is not adjusted for self-deferrals or periods of medical/social suspension.<br>

5. A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one healthcare provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Please note that admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
