To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the business plan of the Driving Standards Agency concerning its future policy on test centre closures; if he will list, by region, the test centres targeted for closure; and what the timetable is for such closures.  [125588]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The Driving Standards Agency's Business Plan for 2000-01 announced targets for the disposal of all vacant space over a five-year period. The target for 2000-01 is a 48 per cent. reduction, which should save fee payers about &#163;145,000 annually. Closures of individual test centres will be considered on their merits and with regard to local circumstances.
<P>

<a name="00620w01.html_para0">The Agency has consulted on the closure of the following driving test centres in the Wales and Western Area:

<a name="00620w01.html_para5">For the future, proposals for test centre openings and closures will, as far as practicable, be considered across the group of centres serving a locality. When proposals for a locality have been developed, the Agency will consult interested parties. This strategy should provide a network of improved test centres delivering a better quality of customer service, while adapting to changes in the demand for driving tests and test requirements.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions, pursuant to his answer of 5 June 2000, <i>Official Report</i>, column 59W, on RMS St. Helena, for how long RMS St. Helena was made available for service during the Falklands conflict; and for how many days it was in the war zone.  [125592]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 RMS St. Helena was made available for Royal Navy charter between May and September 1982 but did not leave the UK until 13 June 1982. The ship was in the war zone for 17 days from 26 June 1982 to 12 July 1982 which was the end of the qualifying period.

<a name="00620w01.html_para6">In the Local Transport Capital Settlement for 2000-01, North Yorkshire County Council (NYCC) received &#163;8.5m as a block allocation, an increase of 58 per cent. over 1999-2000. This increase will allow NYCC to place additional emphasis on local safety schemes during the current financial year.
<P>

<a name="00620w01.html_para7">We have also in the region commissioned two safety studies which will investigate trunk road safety problems, one between Bramham and Barton on the A1 and the other between Scotch Corner and Penrith on the A66.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w01.html_wqn6"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions (1) what steps he is taking to evaluate new approaches to allocating social housing, as proposed in the Housing Green Paper; and if he will make a statement;  [126013]
<P>
<UL>(2) what recent guidance he has given to local authorities on dealing with categories of applicants who have not traditionally applied for local authority accommodation; and if he will make a statement.  [126017]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 In April, we published a Housing Green Paper, "Quality and choice: A Decent Home For All". This included our proposals for modernising policies that affect people's opportunities to access social housing. The Housing Green Paper set out proposals to give applicants for social housing a greater say over where they live. Local authorities will be encouraged to develop lettings systems which provide applicants with much more information about available housing, allowing them to make decisions about their housing options. People who may not have traditionally applied for social housing will be able to apply for vacant properties but we will want to ensure that priority goes to people in the greatest housing need. However, in some areas, local authorities may wish to implement local lettings plans to tackle social problems on particular estates. This may involve giving priority to people who would help to create more sustainable communities or to provide housing for key public sector workers.
<P>

<a name="00620w01.html_para10">Responses to the Housing Green Paper have been invited by 31 July 2000. Following the consultation period, the Government will invite local authorities to pilot customer-focused schemes. This will include the need to test the impact of local lettings plans. All the pilot schemes will be carefully evaluated. The Government will also issue a revised version of the Code of Guidance on lettings and homelessness advising local authorities how they can implement choice-based lettings under the current legislative framework.

<a name="00620w01.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Hancock: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if the definition of homelessness contained in the Housing Act 1996 will be used in future housing legislation; and if he will make a statement.  [126016]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Housing Green Paper, which was issued for consultation on 4 April, includes proposals for strengthening the protection available to homeless people. The Government intend to take forward these proposals in the light of responses to the Green Paper. There are no present plans to change the statutory definition of homelessness.

<P>
<a name="00620w01.html_wqn8"><B> Dr. Cable: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what plans he has to review the system of landing slot allocations at major UK airports.  [126201]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 Slot allocation is governed by EC Regulation 95/93. At airports where demand for slots significantly exceeds supply, they are allocated by an independent slot co-ordinator, using criteria set out in the Regulation, in international guidelines, and in any local rules. There are currently four such airports in the UK: London Heathrow, London Gatwick, London Stansted and Manchester. We are awaiting proposals from the Commission for reform of EC 95/93.

<a name="00620w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Baker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assessment his Department made, prior to the publication of the Waste Strategy 2000: England and Wales (Command Paper 4693), of the experiences in other countries of landfill mining, with particular reference to Germany; and if he will make a statement.  [126633]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Mullin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2000]:</i> UK landfill practices differ from most other countries. The mixing of hazardous and non-hazardous waste is more common in UK landfill sites, and they contain more moisture due to wet landfill operating systems. There would be significant engineering problems in drying excavated waste, some of which would be hazardous. The Environment Agency has therefore advised that landfill mining has limited potential in the UK.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what estimate the Government have made of the cost to public funds of implementing their proposals on access to the countryside, including start-up costs and operational costs.  [126863]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w02.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 19 June 2000]:</i> Placing monetary values on the cost of the Government's proposals for creating a new statutory right of access to open countryside well in advance of such a right coming into force is inevitably subject to a degree of uncertainty. The Government have undertaken a Regulatory Impact Assessment which suggests the additional annual costs to the public sector, for which monetarised values have been derived, to be in the order of &#163;2 million to &#163;3 million a year, with one-off costs of about &#163;6 million.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what account local authorities are obliged to take of public health concerns when determining planning applications for telecommunications masts.  [126986]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Health considerations and public concern can in principle be material considerations in determining applications for planning permission and prior approval. Whether such matters are material in a particular case is ultimately a matter for the courts. It is for the decision-maker (usually the local planning authority) to determine what weight to attach to such considerations in any particular case. In doing so, authorities may have regard to the report of the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones published on 11 May.

<P>
<a name="00620w02.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Coaker: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what discussions he has had with the Scottish Executive on their advice to local authorities with respect to planning applications for telecommunications masts.  [126988]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w02.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 My officials regularly discuss aspects of telecommunications development with officials from the Scottish Executive. They have, in particular, held discussions about the range of actions being taken forward in response to the Stewart report's recommendations on planning.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w02.html_spnew4"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 Government planning policy for telecommunications is set out in Planning Policy Guidance note 8 (revised): Telecommunications, and the Department's Circular 4/99, "Planning for Telecommunications". In addition, a letter was sent to all Council leaders on 23 July 1999, providing advice about the health aspects of telecommunications masts.
<P>

<a name="00620w02.html_para3">In its response to the report of the Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones, issued on 11 May 2000 and placed in the Libraries of both Houses, the Government said that they were minded to introduce a requirement for an application for full planning permission for all new

<P>

<a name="00620w02.html_para4">We aim to issue a consultation document in the summer, with a view to being able to introduce revised procedures and guidance by the end of the year. In the meantime, Local Planning Authorities should continue to deal with planning applications for telecommunications on the basis of the current legislative arrangements and policy guidance.

 The NIO has a well established policy on smoking. A complete ban on smoking has operated effectively in the Department since 1995.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what arrangements have been made for the appointment of a new Police Authority for Northern Ireland to succeed the present Authority whose term of office expires on 28 June.  [127323]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mandelson: </B> 
 The Police Authority has a vital task to perform in securing the maintenance of an effective and efficient police force. It also has a very important role to play in continuing to enhance the relationship between the police and the public it serves in the period before the planned Policing Board takes over from the Authority.
<P>

<a name="00620w02.html_para10">I have therefore appointed the current Chairman, Vice-Chairman and 16 members of the Police Authority for Northern Ireland to serve from 29 June 2000 for a further three years (as required by statute) or until the Policing Board takes over from them, probably at the end of March 2001. I have also appointed four new members and in making those appointments I have, as required by the Police (NI) Act 1998, consulted the 26 local district councils. In addition, and in accordance with the guidelines issued by Dame Rennie Fritchie, the Commissioner for Public Appointments, applications for appointment were invited from other individuals. As a result, the Authority widely represents the community and will provide a necessary measure of continuity in the period leading to establishment of the Policing Board.

 The aim of the Employment Service is to help people without jobs find work and employers to fill their vacancies. The Employment Service in Scotland makes a significant contribution to an efficient and flexible labour market and to meeting the Government's objectives of high and stable employment and growth, opportunity for all and social inclusion. Its main priority is to help people faced with particular difficulties in the labour market move from welfare and economic inactivity into sustainable employment. It is taking forward an ambitious programme of technological change and business improvement and is preparing for the merger with the Benefits Agency in 2001. I am announcing today the targets we have set for the Employment Service in Scotland for 2000-01, which relate to its four key objectives.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Employment Service in Scotland aims to make a major contribution to an efficient and flexible labour market and to the Government's objectives of high and stable levels of employment and growth, opportunity for all and social inclusion. The Employment Service in Scotland works closely with employers, and with its private, public and voluntary sector partners to provide a quality service for all people without a job and to promote employment opportunities for all who can work. It aims to attract a diverse range of vacancies and to fill those vacancies quickly by matching the right people and skills with the right jobs. Its main priority is to help individuals facing particular difficulty in the labour market to move from welfare and economic inactivity into sustainable employment. It does this through correct application of the JSA regime, delivery of the New Deals and the pilot ONE service, and through the provision of appropriate advice training and support. The Agency has achieved much over the past three years. The challenge and opportunity now facing it is to sustain continuous improvement in its services to jobseekers and employers and to make these services more accessible and relevant to customer needs, through effective use of modern technology and close working with a wide range of partners.</FONT></UL>

 A formal review of the Zimbabwe Republic Police (ZRP) Organisational Development Project in October 1999 showed that it was successful in contributing to DFID's objectives as set out in the Public Service Agreement.

 Currently, we are providing &#163;10 million of programme aid to the Government of Sierra Leone for two purposes: to meet the Government's debt service obligations to the international financial institutions (IFIs); and to help pay the salaries of public sector teachers and health workers, and the police. The programme aid grant is administered on behalf of the Government of Sierra Leone by Crown Agents Financial Services Ltd. (CASL). CASL make current debt service payments direct to the IFIs on behalf of the Government of Sierra Leone as they become due. CASL reimburses the Government of Sierra Leone for prior expenditure on public sector salaries, and then carries out independent audit checks on payroll to guard against fraudulent claims.

<a name="00620w06.html_para10">I am pleased that the Assembly has decided to continue the Bus Subsidy Grant scheme in the current financial year. Of the &#163;5 million budget, &#163;3 million is reserved solely for boosting the number and range of services in rural areas. The balance is available for use at local authorities' discretion--which can include yet further support to rural services. These figures are in addition to approximately &#163;10 million a year which authorities already spend on subsidising non-commercial local bus services throughout their areas.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>As part of the BOWMAN project, we have examined a number of alternative technical options, and have reviewed whether the basic approach to BOWMAN remains valid in the light of rapid developments in the mobile communications field. The analysis demonstrates that BOWMAN can be a robust solution to the military requirement. Our primary effort has been directed to working with Archer Communications Systems Limited (ACSL), the nominated BOWMAN contractor, to establish whether an adequately de-risked solution can be provided on taut contractual terms. In parallel, study contracts were placed earlier this year with Computing Devices Canada and Thomson CSF to ascertain whether suitable alternatives to the current ACSL solution for BOWMAN might be available. These studies have reported and are being evaluated.</FONT></UL>

These are described in more detail in the consultation document, a copy of which can be found in the Library of the House and on the internet at www.mod.uk/commercial/ppp/dera/.
<P>

<a name="00620w07.html_para3">Under current proposals, we envisage that the capabilities provided by West Freugh will form part of the NewDERA company. It is, therefore, likely that West Freugh would transfer to the private sector.
<P>

<a name="00620w07.html_para4">Our proposals are designated to secure a long-term future for both NewDERA and those elements to be retained within the Ministry of Defence. The new freedoms proposed for NewDERA will open up a range of commercial opportunities not previously available and help secure jobs in the longer term.
<P>

<a name="00620w07.html_para5">No final decisions on the PPP will be taken until all the inputs received during the consultation exercise, which ended on 9 June, have been fully analysed. We hope to be in a position to make an announcement on the way ahead for DERA before the summer recess.

 <i>[holding answer 15 June 2000]:</i> The normal anti-malarial drugs for Sierra Leone are mefloquine, or chloroquine and proguanil tablets for aircrew. Supplies of these drugs were readily available. The reasons why some personnel deployed to Sierra Leone without supplies of mefloquine are being investigated by the Ministry of Defence. The French anti-malarial drug savarine, which is a combination of chloroquine and proguanil, was acquired locally as an interim measure and distributed within 24 hours of personnel arriving in theatre. Personnel who had deployed without supplies of mefloquine were transferred to mefloquine within four days of arrival in theatre.

<a name="00620w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hoon </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 June 2000]:</i> It is the Ministry of Defence's policy that all Service personnel should be up to date with routine vaccinations and that members of the Joint Rapid Reaction Forces should be up to date with certain additional vaccinations, depending on their degree of readiness. Personnel deploying to high risk areas should receive further vaccinations specific to the risks they face. Other aspects of medical preparedness will depend on the role of the deploying forces and the geographical location to which they are deploying.

These records are normally held by the individuals' parent units. Information may also be held on medical centre computer systems. Any medical treatment administered to personnel in-theatre is recorded for each individual in an operational medical record (Form F Med 965). This information is incorporated into F Med 4s on return. In addition, the Army records the nature and date of vaccinations given to individuals centrally on personnel information systems.

In addition, there have been over 350 downloadings of the second consultation document from the DTI website at www.dti.gov.uk/CACP/ca/distance/

To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry how he defines the difference between responsible risk takers and culpable bankrupts for the purpose of implementing the recommendations of the Insolvency Working Party; and if he will estimate the proportion of each.  [126035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w08.html_spnew6"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 I am satisfied that there is a clear distinction to be drawn between individuals who are dishonest or whose conduct with regard to their creditors is irresponsible and those whose use of credit and treatment of their creditors is conscientious and above board. Examples of irresponsible conduct would be an individual continuing to trade and incur credit at a time when he or she knew themselves to be insolvent; or an individual consumer obtaining credit without any regard to his ability to repay the debts incurred. Information available from Official Receivers indicates that the very great majority of individuals subject to bankruptcy are neither dishonest nor irresponsible.
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w08.html_wqn11"><B> Mr. Mitchell: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on what basis he estimates that seven to 12 per cent. of bankrupts are culpable; and what relationship these percentages have to the findings of the Insolvency Service's Study of Business Failures in January and February 1999.  [126040]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w08.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 An estimate of the number of bankrupts who may have been guilty of misconduct in relation to their creditors can be made by reference to the number of bankrupts reported by Official Receivers as having, prima facie, committed criminal offences; the number of bankrupts identified by Official Receivers as having committed criminal offences but in respect of whose affairs further investigation or prosecution would not, in the public interest, be warranted; and information obtained from Official Receivers as in their survey of Business Failures.

<P>

<a name="00620w09.html_para0">It is central to the role of the company auditor that he or she is independent in mind and in appearance. The provision of non-audit services to audit clients can call into question the auditor's independence of the entities being reported on. It will be appropriate for the new Ethics Standards Board, when it is established as part of the new independent Framework of Regulation for the accountancy profession, to look at the ethical rules and guidance in this area.
<P>

<a name="00620w09.html_para1">The law in the UK already requires that the bodies responsible for supervising the work of company auditors have adequate rules to ensure that the auditor does not have an interest likely to conflict with the proper conduct of the audit. The current professional guidance, which forms part of those rules, acknowledges that the provision of non-audit services may give rise to threats to independence. The auditor is required to put in place appropriate safeguards and to be able to demonstrate that he or she has reasonably concluded that those safeguards are adequate. Otherwise the auditor either cannot take on the audit engagement or cannot provide the non-audit service.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w10.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 Cycling on the pavement is a long-established offence under Section 72 of the Highways Act 1835. The Government's most recent consultation with the police on this subject was on the introduction of a fixed penalty offence for cycling on the pavement. The change was supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers.
<P>

<a name="00620w10.html_para1">The Home Office consultation exercise in 1996 on seven proposed new fixed penalty offences, including cycling on the pavement, revealed substantial public concern about inconsiderate and irresponsible cycling on the pavement in England and Wales, which particularly affected the elderly and disabled. The new fixed penalty offence allows the police to deal more simply and directly with particular local problems as they arise.

 I have received various representations from business interests since the introduction of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Bill to the House of Commons on 9 February this year. They have supported the broad aims of the Bill. Most have pressed for changes to minimise the uncertainty over the impact of Clause 12 (maintenance of a reasonable intercept capability). The Clause has been amended in response to some of these representations. The Alliance for Electronic Business pressed for affirmative resolution for the order under Clause 12. This was provided by amendment at Commons Report. We have also amended the Bill to require the Secretary of State to meet the marginal costs of interception. Some businesses have also asked for reassurances which have been given as to how we intend the regime to work. Others are pressing us about the costs of maintaining a reasonable intercept capability on the internet.

Amendments designed to clarify what should be contained in a decryption notice and to remove the Directors' liability in respect of Part III of the Bill were also a response to industry representations.

 The Criminal Records Bureau is being established within the framework of a Public Private Partnership. The Department has planned provision across the three financial years 1999-2002 for expenditure of around &#163;10 million in connection with the establishment of the Bureau. But the Bureau's full operating costs will not be known until a contract has been awarded to the private sector partner.
<P>

<a name="00620w11.html_para5">It has always been planned that the Bureau's costs should be recovered through the charges that it makes for certificates. Work on the level of fees must await information about the Bureau's operating costs. But we have made clear our determination to keep the cost of certificates as low as possible. Reducing or waiving charges in respect of particular voluntary organisations, or for the voluntary sector as a whole, would raise substantial problems of principle and would either place an added burden on the public purse or lead to an increased level of fee for others seeking certificates from the Bureau, who may be no less deserving than volunteers.
<P>

<a name="00620w11.html_para6">Part V of the Police Act 1997, under which the Bureau is being established, does not require volunteers to apply for certificates. It will generally be for organisations to decide who will require a certificate. Work is continuing on estimating the likely number of applicants for certificates, building on work on demand estimates and market research, and will be subject to consultation before final conclusions are reached.
<P>

<a name="00620w11.html_para7">Before we make Regulations to prescribe various matters including charges for certificates, we shall undertake a Regulatory Impact Assessment, in consultation with representatives of voluntary organisations and others.

In each year the major Home Office campaigns have been on fire safety, electoral registration and special constables recruitment. The higher expenditure in 1999-2000, was largely accounted for by additional expenditure on fire safety and on publicity to explain the new voting system for the European Parliamentary election.<P>

<P>
<a name="00620w11.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Chris Smith: </B> 
 Under the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 1990, the BBC has statutory responsibility for the administration of the television licensing system. TV Licensing carries out the day to day administration of the licensing system as agent for the BBC. The wording of TV Licensing's renewal reminder letters is therefore a matter for TV Licensing and the BBC, and not one in which the Government can intervene. The BBC has, however, confirmed that it is not promoting the TV licence as an Account Payable.

 We have condemned the use of criminal armed force by the kidnappers in Fiji and demanded the release of all the hostages, the restoration of democratic, constitutional government and the arrest of the hostage- takers. In pursuit of these aims, I participated in the meeting of the Commonwealth Ministerial Action Group on 6 June which agreed to suspend Fiji from Commonwealth Councils and to send a CMAG delegation to Fiji.

Provided this timetable is met, work on the second phase of the project to restore the river-beds and banks would begin in summer 2001.

<a name="00620w13.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 UN sanctions are making it harder for UNITA to continue fighting and put pressure on UNITA to return to the negotiating table. We commend the work of the Expert Panel of the UN Angola Sanctions Committee in investigating violations of the sanctions and developing recommendations on tightening implementation. The UK strongly supported the adoption of UN Security Council resolution 1295 on 18 April. The resolution welcomes the Panel's report, stresses the obligations of all member states to comply with the measures against UNITA and expresses the readiness of the Council to consider action in relation to states it determines to have violated those measures. This shows the determination of the international community to make sanctions bite.

 There is no consensus within the European Union or the United Nations for investment sanctions at the moment, nor do we have any plans to introduce such measures. But we do discourage trade and investment in Burma by UK companies. In March, I met the Chief Executive of Premier Oil, and made clear to him our deep concern about their investment in Burma and that we would welcome their moving out as soon as and to the fullest extent that they lawfully can. We regularly give business inquiries a statement on the nature of the Burmese regime and the state of the economy.

<a name="00620w13.html_para2">The European Union has recently adopted a freeze on funds held by members of the Burmese regime.

Staff input is required at the beginning and end of the process, but very little intervention is needed during the course of the recovery.

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is clear from the figures quoted above that the clearance target for Widows Benefit claims was not met for 1999-2000.

NIRS2 provides the BA with its benefit calculations including those for entitlements to Retirement Pension and Widows Benefits.</FONT></UL>

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. It is assumed that the Category A rate of basic Retirement Pension is raised to the level of the Minimum Income Guarantee in 2001-02 (assumed to be &#163;84.80 for those aged 75 to 79, and &#163;90.20 for those aged 80 and over).<P>





2. It is assumed that basic Retirement Pension recipients with entitlement of less than the full Category A rate receive a pro-rata increase, except married women in receipt of the Category BL pension, who receive an increase such that the Category A and Category BL pension together are equivalent to the appropriate couple rate of the Minimum Income Guarantee.<P>

3. These estimates include a saving of &#163;30 million from the removal of the 25p age addition currently paid to those aged 80 and over.<P>

4. Costs are rounded to the nearest &#163;100 million and are in 2000-01 prices.<P>

5. Costs include benefits whose rates are linked by statute to the rate of basic Retirement Pension.<P>

6. Gross costs are estimated by the Government Actuary's Department. Costs net of means-tested benefit savings have been estimated using the Policy Simulation Model. <P>

<P>
<a name="00620w17.html_spnew7"><B> Ms Jowell: </B> 
 There already exists a high degree of flexibility in the Gateway for those with severe social problems, not least through the individually tailored support from the New Deal Personal Adviser. They are able to make use of systematic assessment techniques to identify problems that may be preventing the young person moving into employment. Young people will then, if necessary, be referred by their adviser to a range of provision which can help them with jobsearch, training in basic skills, dealing with issues such as drug or alcohol abuse. This help can be continued beyond the Gateway when the young person is on an option.
<P>

<a name="00620w17.html_para3">Advisers will also be able to defer entry to the new Gateway to Work by a few weeks for those young people who have other issues that need to be resolved and who would not be ready to benefit from the course.

<P>
<a name="00620w17.html_spnew9"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 14 June 2000]:</i> Health and safety issues have always been included in the National Curriculum. The revised curriculum, which will take effect in autumn 2000, contains clearer and fuller statements of the general principles applying to health and safety teaching, including the importance of risk assessment. Subject specific requirements are highlighted in individual subject orders. The only new requirement relates to Information and Communications Technology to reflect the massive increase in the use of computers in schools in recent years.
<P>

<a name="00620w17.html_para4">&#163;6 million is available to schools from the Standards Fund to support the implementation of the revised National Curriculum. In addition, the Health and Safety Executive and the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority have produced joint guidance on teaching health and safety issues which is available at www.hse.gov.uk/policy/ genteach.htm.

<P>
<a name="00620w18.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Teachers employed to teach in institutions for young people maintained by social services departments and in prison institutions for young offenders are not, as of right, subject to the terms of the School Teachers' Pay and Conditions Document and are not eligible to apply for the threshold in the current round of the assessment process. In response to representations received from institutions wishing to mirror the threshold arrangements, we are actively considering how to open up threshold training and the external assessment process to such institutions once the immediate pressures of the current application round have reduced.

<P>

<a name="00620w18.html_para2">The Government are well on target to deliver their pledge to limit infant classes to 30 pupils. At the same time, average class sizes in maintained primary schools went down for the second year running--from 27.5 in January 1999 to 27.1 in January 2000, after rising for the previous 10 years. The average size of junior classes also fell, from 28.4 in January 1999 to 28.3 in January 2000. Maintained secondary classes are already much smaller than primary, with around five fewer pupils on average. The pupil:teacher ratio in secondary schools in January 2000 was 17.1. It is worth bearing in mind that secondary classes rose steadily under the previous Government--in 1998 the figure was 19.9; and that in the Budget, secondary headteachers received between &#163;30,000 and &#163;50,000 each to spend as they choose. If they spent it on teachers, they could reduce the secondary pupil:teacher ratio by 0.4.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment if he will list by LEA in England the amount each local authority spent on education above its education SSA for each of the past five years.  [126906]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00620w19.html_spnew5"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The following table shows by LEA the amount in &#163; million by which each authority budgeted above or below its education SSA for the years 1995-96 to 1999-2000. Budget figures are taken from Local Authority Revenue Account (RA) returns, and include a centrally calculated estimate of the amount of education related capital expenditure from the revenue account (CERA). Figures for 2000-01 are not yet available: in this and future years, budget data which are more precisely comparable to education SSA will be available from the section 52 returns submitted by local education authorities, including their own estimate of CERA.
