 The Ministry of Defence is organising this training in two different ways.

Second, indirectly through our support to the development of international training centres of excellence. Examples are the Kofi Annan International Peacekeeping Training Centre in Ghana, the Peace Support Training Centre in Kenya, the Tactical Peace Support Training Centre in Bloemfontein, South Africa and the Jaji Peacekeeping Training Wing in Nigeria. Helping to build such training centres, as well as the training of trainers, has a major multiplier effect and is in line with the UK and wider international policy for the development of African PSO capacity over the longer term.

 No assessment has been made. I understand from the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, Centro, who are the promoters of the scheme, that they expect the construction to start mid 2007 and to be completed in 2010. This is, however, subject to powers for the extension being confirmed by Parliament and to our consideration of a final business case, which is expected to be submitted in the spring. Although the Department announced on 20 December 2004 that the Secretary of State had decided to make an Order under the Transport and Works Act giving powers for the scheme, the Order will need to be subject to special parliamentary procedure before it can come into force, as it involves the compulsory purchase of open space without other land being offered in exchange. It is expected that the Order will be laid before Parliament later this month.

Notes:<br>

<br>
1. Claims may still be made for incidents relating to 2001&#150;02 and later years.<br>

2. There is no direct correlation between the columns as:<br>

(i) claims may be successfully defended, so although a claim is made there may be no payment made against that claim.<br>

(ii) the year of incident may be earlier than year of payment.<br>





3. Claims may be for a number of incidents, not solely MRSA. Therefore, the level of payment made will not only relate to MRSA. MRSA may be only a small element of the claim.<br>

4. Before 2002, lower value CNST claims were handled locally, so data will not be on the NHS LA database. These values were determined with the NHS LA on a trust by trust basis.<br>

When the 9th EDF became operational in April 2003, all previous EDFs were consolidated into EDF9.

 As stated in the White Paper on the treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe (CM 6309), qualified majority voting was extended to 16 new or existing areas by the Amsterdam treaty, which came into effect in May 1999, and further extended to 31 new or existing areas by the Nice treaty, which came into effect in February 2003. Unanimous agreement is still required for the most important decisions: for tax, social security, foreign policy, defence, and decisions on the financing of the EU affecting the British budget contribution.

<p><a name="st_188"><a name="50113w21.html_spnew3"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 Illegally imported meat has not been subject to the normal food safety checks associated with legally imported meat. Thus there is a risk that it may contain human pathogens, including pathogens not normally found in the UK. On 19 July, Defra published the updated report on the risk assessment undertaken by the Veterinary Laboratories Agency (VLA) (the original was published on 6 March 2003). Copies of both reports have been placed in House Libraries.

<p><a name="st_189"><a name="50113w21.html_spnew4"><b> Mr. Bradshaw: </b> 
 No. Illegal imports of meat are normally destroyed without undue delay, though if the seizure was made solely because the importer failed to comply with the pre-notification requirements of Products of Animal Origin Regulations 2004, Customs may agree, after consultation with Port Health Authorities, to the product being re-exported.
</p>


<p>
<a name="50113w21.html_para4">
<a name="stpa_136">The Government have considered the feasibility of testing samples taken from seized illegally imported products of animal origin for a range of animal diseases. It concluded that the endemic nature of these diseases in many countries around the world results in a low but continuous risk of infected meat reaching the country through illegal routes. This means that all such seizures are treated as a potential animal and human health risk and destroyed, as soon as possible, by incineration. The risk of disease relates to the possibility that infectious material in illegal imports may be consumed by animals. Very small amounts of infectious material may cause disease and are likely to be only a small proportion of any illegal imports. There is thus very little chance of finding infected material by testing samples. Similar considerations apply with regard to the testing of samples for human pathogens.

Notes:<br>

1. Figures relate to financial years except for one trust who provided figures for calendar years and for 2004 to 30 November.<br>

2. If a patient was admitted in one year and their episode carried into the next year the number of bed days are attributed to the year in which the admission took place and the admission is only counted once in the year it occurred.<br>

3. If a patient is admitted when aged less than 18 years and the patient turns 18 years of age during their episode, bed days after the patient turns 18 years of age are included in total length of stay.<br>

4. Where possible the number of bed days was calculated excluding days on leave, but one trust was unable to exclude days on leave from its figures.<br>

5. Figures include patients admitted to psychiatric wards in Muckamore Abbey hospital, which normally caters for learning-disabled patients.<br>
