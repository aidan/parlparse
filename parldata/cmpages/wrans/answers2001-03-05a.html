To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what specific funds have been allocated to (i) Cheshire local education authority and (ii) Halton local education authority since May 1997 for <i>(a)</i> pre-school, <i>(b)</i> primary school, <i>(c)</i> secondary school, <i>(d)</i> special school and <i>(e)</i> post-16 education.

 <i>[holding answer 14 February 2001]:</i> The funds allocated to Cheshire local education authority for each category since 1997-98 are shown in the table. Figures for Halton are available only from 1998-99, when it became a unitary authority. The figures include each authority's Standard Spending Assessment, Nursery Education Grant, Standards Fund, Schools Standards Grant, and Budget Support Grant. For some specific funds that are not distributed on the basis of these categories, we have estimated the amounts for each category. From 1998-99 Nursery Education Grant has been used to fund free places in the private, voluntary and independent sectors and new free places in the maintained sector. New places in the maintained sector are funded only for one year via Nursery Education Grant, and after that are normally funded through Standard Spending Assessment.
<P>

<a name="10305w01.html_para0">In 1997-98, Cheshire County Council included Halton and Warrington. Since 1998-99, Halton and Warrington have been separate unitary authorities.

<P>

<a name="10305w01.html_para3">The level of funding of students by the Further Education Funding Council (FEFC) is determined by a tariff system which provides a number of "units" of funding for various aspects of the course and student. Most "units" are for the length and type of course; others cover achievement, entry and additional support, for example.
<P>

<a name="10305w01.html_para4">The average level of funding (or ALF) per unit varies between colleges, mostly for historical reasons but is converging by deliberate council policy. The ALF (1998-99) for Godalming College is &#163;16.91 and for Farnham College is &#163;17.75. This methodology will continue for the first year following the inception of the LSC. Following that, a revised system will be introduced which will simplify the FEFC system but maintain separate elements for course length and type and for achievement.

<a name="10305w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Peter Ainsworth: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment what representations he has received regarding the teaching of Shakespeare in secondary schools; and if he will make a statement.  [150539]<P>

<a name="10305w01.html_spnew3"><B> Jacqui Smith </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 15 February 2001]:</i> The requirement for secondary schools to teach Shakespeare, as well as other major literary figures, was identified clearly in our review of the National Curriculum, which was completed last year. We maintained a consistent position, despite some proposals to the contrary, that pupils between the ages of 11 and 16 should be required to study the works of a range of major writers and poets, including two plays by William Shakespeare. The range also includes plays, novels, short stories and poetry from the English literary heritage. Major classical authors are represented, including Jane Austen, Charles Dickens, John Milton and William Wordsworth.
<P>

<a name="10305w01.html_para6">These proposals were the subject of wide consultation, which produced strong public support. We have no plans to change the requirement for the teaching of Shakespeare in secondary school.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Employment (1) what the target ratio is of <i>(a)</i> learning support units and <i>(b)</i> pupil referral units to secondary schools;  [150712]
<P>
<UL>(2) how many additional pupil referral units he estimates are needed September 2002 in order to meet the Government's commitment to provide a place for all young people who have been excluded from school. [150795]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10305w01.html_spnew4"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 The ratio of Learning Support Units to secondary schools varies from LEA to LEA. Some, such as City of Nottingham, have chosen to set up LSUs in all their secondary schools; others have targeted those schools with greatest need in terms of rates of exclusion, 



<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 2001 : Column: 4W</I><P>
attendance and severity of behavioural problems. However, in Excellence in Cities areas there is an average of one LSU for every two secondary schools. There are now over 1,000 LSUs in England.
<P>

<a name="10305w01.html_para7">We are providing education authorities with the resources to ensure that all excluded pupils receive a full-time education by 2002. Such education will take place in a range of settings including PRUs, the voluntary sector, further education and work experience. From April, funding to tackle truancy and exclusion increases to &#163;174 million and already there are over 1,000 more places and nearly 600 more teachers, instructors and education support assistants at PRUs compared to 1997. Education authorities are assessing locally their requirements for increasing provision taking account of the number of exclusions and the successful re-integration of excluded pupils into mainstream school. In 2000 one third of PRUs reported offering full-time provision to pupils and two thirds offered 13 or more hours tuition each week. Planned LEA funding for PRUs increased by 13 per cent. this year compared to last, and we expect to see a 10 per cent. rise in the number of PRUs in 2001 compared to 2000. LEA plans indicate that in 2001 nearly two thirds of authorities will move to the full timetable for excluded secondary pupils. The recent Ofsted Annual Report noted the improving performance of PRUs and in particular highlighted improvements in teaching, pupil progress and re-integration into mainstream school of key stage 2 and 3 pupils.

<a name="10305w02.html_para0">Compared to 1998-99, before the introduction of golden hellos for maths and science, graduate recruitment is up 23 per cent. for maths and 8 per cent. for science. In September 2000, golden hellos were extended to modern languages and technology. Graduate recruitment for 2000-01 is up by 13 per cent. and 23 per cent. respectively compared to last year.

<a name="10305w02.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Information from the Department's 2000 Annual Schools Census shows that the proportion of pupils "known to be eligible for free school meals" was 16 per cent. in mainstream specialist secondary schools currently operational, and 18 per cent. in other mainstream maintained secondary schools. For those mainstream specialist schools designated in 1996 or earlier, the proportion of pupils "known to be eligible for free school meals" was 14 per cent.: for those mainstream specialist schools designated after that date the proportion was 17 per cent.

 <i>[holding answer 28 February 2001]:</i> My Department has no specific mandate to set up training and financial support structures for voluntary organisations. It is the Home Office Advice Communities Unit that has overall responsibility within Government for the voluntary sector. However, the voluntary sector is essential to the achievement of our objectives and we have put in place a number of arrangements for improvement the way we work with voluntary organisations and to help them improve the quality of their work.
<P>

<a name="10305w02.html_para3">We already provide support and technical assistance to providers working on particular initiatives such as Surestart, Millennium Volunteers and the New Deal Innovation Fund. We have established a short-term Voluntary Sector Support Unit within the Department to enhance the relationship with the sector, and we are introducing a national Funding Formula through the Employment Service and the Learning and Skills Council with effect from April this year.

<P>

<a name="10305w02.html_para4">With the establishment of Learning and Skills Council, we are introducing a Common Inspection Framework, a system of approved providers, longer-term contracts and "joined-up" purchasing arrangements.
<P>

<a name="10305w02.html_para5">We have recently commenced work on developing a new framework for our relationships with providers which will harmonise best practice around the Department and its associated bodies. A consultation exercise on the basis for this framework will be carried out in the spring.

 The academic requirements for the Fast Track Teaching programme reflect the demands it will make on those who will participate. The key requirements were published on the Fast Track Recruitment website at the time of the launch in October 2000. They have not been changed since that date. 1,574 applications were received by the closing date of 31 January. In common with accelerated progression schemes for other professions, applicants will undergo a rigorous staged assessment process. We expect that process to continue into April. To date over 400 applicants have proceeded to the second stage. Of those who did not, 21 have asked for their applications to be reviewed. In one case the review has resulted in the applicant progressing to the second stage.

 In 1998-99, the latest year for which figures are available, Devon local education authority spent &#163;11.9 million on home to school transport. The figure for England for the same year was &#163;444 million. These figures are for all forms of transport: we do not have any means of estimating the amount spent on taxis.

<a name="10305w03.html_spnew2"><B> Jacqui Smith: </B> 
 My Department does not allocate money to local education authorities specifically for school transport. Money for this purpose is included in LEAs' standard spending assessments, but it is up to individual authorities how they spend it. In 1998-99, the latest year for which figures are available, LEAs in England spent a total of &#163;444 million on all forms of school transport; we do not have a breakdown of how much of this was on buses.

<a name="10305w03.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 I am delighted to announce that the Government's response to the Task Force, entitled "Towards Inclusion--civil rights for disabled people", is published today. Copies are available in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="10305w03.html_para0">We are already taking forward the Task Force's recommendations on civil rights in education in the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill, which received its Third reading in the House of Lords on 1 March. My hon. Friend the Under-Secretary of State, Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions, the Member for Streatham (Mr. Hill), announced on 7 December that he would be consulting separately on the Task Force's civil rights recommendations on transport. The Disability Rights Commission, on which the Task Force made previous recommendations, has been open to the public since 25 April 2000.
<P>

<a name="10305w03.html_para1">"Towards Inclusion" describes our proposals for amending the Disability Discrimination Act's provisions on the definition of disability, employment and access to goods, services, facilities and premises. These proposals will have a major impact on promoting equality for, and safeguarding the rights of, disabled people. They include: covering more people with HIV and cancer; ending the DDA's small employer exemption by 2004; bringing within scope of the DDA occupations and employment such as the police, fire-fighters, prison officers, barristers and partners in business partnerships. By making these changes, we will bring over 600,000 disabled people, in a range of jobs and occupations, into its scope. We will also improve the process for making tribunal complaints; extend the scope of the DDA to cover most functions of public 



<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 2001 : Column: 14W</I><P>
bodies--not just services to the public as now; and introduce a new duty for public bodies to promote equalisation of opportunities for disabled people. We are seeking views on our proposals by 8 June. In addition, we have asked the DRC, as part of its role to monitor and review the DDA, to consider further some other Task Force issues.
<P>

<a name="10305w03.html_para2">"Towards Inclusion" also describes how we have taken forward the Task Force's non-legislative recommendations and outlines the wide range of positive Government action for disabled people over the last four years, in all areas of life.
<P>

<a name="10305w03.html_para3">Our 1997 manifesto made a major commitment to disabled people. We promised to support their comprehensive and enforceable civil rights. With the help of the Disability Rights Task Force, the steps we have taken over the last four years--and what we now propose in "Towards Inclusion"--meet this commitment. We are on the way towards creating a truly inclusive society for disabled people.

 There are currently around 310,000 Sierra Leonean refugees, and around 122,000 Liberian refugees, in Guinea. Many have been there for a number of years. There are also significant numbers of internally displaced Guineans in the south of the country, in the area adjoining the Liberian and Sierra Leone borders.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> A number of new Defence IT-related projects are planned to commence during the coming financial year. It is impracticable to list all new initiatives, but the most important is the Defence Information Infrastructure (DII), which will enter its initial assessment phase during 2001-02. This is planned to provide a computing infrastructure across the whole of Defence, and is an important step forward, since it represents a change from stand-alone IT projects to the development of a single Defence-wide computing infrastructure on which both office and business applications will be mounted. The DII is based on, and is planned to subsume, a number of related IT projects. Other business application projects being considered include DRUMM (material management capability), DSMS (Defence Supply Management System), P2P (Purchase to Payment, a component of the Defence e-Commerce programme) and SGIS (Surgeon General's system). All of these are in their formative stages, with completion expected over the next three years. Since contracts for these projects have yet to be awarded and are subject to commercial confidence, I am withholding the information under Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> Information Technology is a key component of many Ministry of Defence (MOD) projects, both large and small. Consequently the MOD has a large number of information-related systems in service, under development or planned. Many projects are relatively small and are undertaken within the delegations given to budget-holders and Defence agencies. Comprehensive records of these projects are not held centrally. As part of the MOD response to the McCartney report on improving Government IT projects, records are being compiled for medium to large-scale projects. Since these records include commercial in confidence details of projects, I am withholding the information under Exemption 13 of the Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. Some 45 projects are currently listed and work continues to complete the list and ensure that all useful data have been captured.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what progress has been made on the Gulf Veterans Medical Assessment Programme; and if he will make a statement.  [151814]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10305w04.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Spellar: </B> 
 The Gulf Veterans Medical Assessment Programme has been in existence since October 1993 and at the end of February of this year 3,105 veterans had been seen. A paper on the findings from the first 1,000 veterans was published in the <i>British Medical Journal</i> in January 1999. A paper on the second 1,000 veterans will shortly be published in the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps and a paper on the third 1,000 veterans, and the 3,000 in total, is almost ready for submission for publication in a peer-reviewed journal. A presentation based on this last paper was made by the head of the GVMAP at a recent conference on Gulf illnesses in the United States.
<P>

<a name="10305w04.html_para0">Psychiatric illnesses are predominant among the illnesses seen at the GVMAP, of which Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder, with or without co-morbidity, is the most common. The GVMAP physicians have found a few other Gulf related illnesses, predominantly of a respiratory or dermatological nature. They have not found any evidence of a unique syndrome among Gulf veterans or any unusual pattern of disease among veterans who attended the programme. They have not seen any evidence of increased immunological, neurological or renal diseases, or the appearance of any unusual cancers. The symptoms presented by veterans who have attended the GVMAP are similar to those reported by members of the general population attending their GPs' surgeries.

The Ministry of Defence's assessment is that UK tanks used fewer than one hundred 120mm rounds against Iraq's military forces during hostilities (this equates to less than one metric tonne of DU). Additional rounds were fired by UK forces during earlier work-up training to establish the round's Mean Point of Impact. In a paper published in December 2000, the US Government reported that US forces in the Gulf had fired ammunition rounds containing some 290 metric tonnes of DU.

 The Directorate of Defence Policy in the Ministry of Defence was renamed the Directorate of Policy Planning in autumn 1999, although the role it undertakes remains similar. It supports the strategic planning process which arose from the Strategic Defence Review, and undertakes policy development work on a range of issues. It also carries out work in support of the Defence Diplomacy initiative and the Government's conflict prevention agenda.
<P>

<a name="10305w05.html_para16">The Directorate does not generally publish reports in the public domain in its own right, but it had a major input, for example, into three recent Ministry of Defence publications (Defence Policy 2001, The Future Strategic Context for Defence and Policy Paper 1: Defence Diplomacy).
<P>

<a name="10305w05.html_para17">The Directorate currently comprises 22 full-time Ministry of Defence employed personnel, both civilian and military, and one French military exchange officer. It does not contain any special advisers.

<a name="10305w05.html_para18">In undertaking its work, the Directorate works with a wide range of bodies in the Ministry of Defence, other Government Departments, the academic community and other interested parties. Special advisers do not routinely participate in its work, although they may be involved in discussion of work undertaken by the Directorate, in the normal way.

 The Investment Strategy was published as a result of the 2000 Spending Review, which sets out new plans for investment for 2001-02 to 2003-04. At the same time, the Government committed themselves to producing documents that would show how Departments planned to use this funding by setting out a strategic plan for both new investment and the use of existing assets. The Defence Investment Strategy is the result. The Strategy sets out the strategic context the MOD is working in, an analysis of its existing asset base, future investment plans and the systems the Department will be adopting to deliver value for money.
<P>

<a name="10305w06.html_para0">The exceptional circumstances under which sites may be offered to other public bodies are where it will ensure the future preservation of an area of importance for nature conservation, a listed building or scheduled monument or to preserve a community facility which would have no alternative use. Details of the sites which have been disposed of in this way over the last four years are not held centrally, and the costs of retrieving this information would be disproportionate.

All community-based orders contain a focus on the consequences of the offending for the victim. Local victim-offender mediation and mentoring projects have been established to support the YOT in the delivery of programmes. The team also works closely with the Odyssey under-18 drug and alcohol project. Two thirds of young people in contact with the YOT receive an input on education and training.

<a name="10305w09.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. Ruane: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department if he will set out, with statistical information relating as directly as possible to the Vale of Clwyd constituency, the effects on the Vale of Clwyd of his Department's policies and actions since May 1997.  [151931]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10305w09.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Charles Clarke: </B> 
 The Home Office is working to build a safe, just and tolerant society in which the right and responsibilities of individuals, families and communities are properly balanced, and the protection and security of the public are maintained. Detailed information on the impact of Home Office policies across the full range of responsibilities is set out in Home Office Annual Reports. A copy of the most recent report, "Home Office Annual Report 1999-2000", is available in the Library. Information on recorded crime and policing is also published. "Recorded Crime England and Wales, 12 months to September 2000" and "Police Service Strength England and Wales, 30 September 2000" can be found in the Library. The recorded crime statistics include information on recorded crime by basic command unit and crime and disorder partnerships.
<P>

<a name="10305w09.html_para0">The impact of Home Office policies and actions is not normally examined by constituency and the statistics which the Department collects, such as recorded crime, cannot be matched in the way requested, although examples relating to the Vale of Clwyd constituency or the immediate locality are set out as follows:
<P>

<a name="10305w09.html_para1"><i>Closed Circuit Television (CCTV)</i>
<P>

<a name="10305w09.html_para2">The Rhyl south-east scheme was awarded &#163;159,000 under the first round of the CCTV initiative. The scheme is a four-camera extension of the existing town centre system, covering three educational sites with additional surveillance capabilities for the surrounding residential and smaller commercial areas. The scheme proposes to impact on incidents of criminal damage, burglary and anti-social behaviour.
<P>

<a name="10305w09.html_para3"><i>Reducing Burglary Initiative</i>
<P>

<a name="10305w09.html_para4">One scheme, covering houses in multiple occupancy in Colwyn Bay, Abergele and Rhyl, elderly persons sheltered housing in Flintshire, and the areas of Gwenfro and Y Wern in Wrexham was awarded &#163;33,000 under round two of the reducing burglary initiative. Interventions include: covert observations; high profile and targeted policing; high profile media press strategy; preparation/distribution of crime prevention literature and a crime stoppers campaign.
<P>

<a name="10305w09.html_para5"><i>Youth Offending Teams (YOTs)</i>

by producing 98 per cent. of court reports within the agreed timescales. A bail supervision scheme has been established to reduce the incidence of secure remands and reoffending by young people while on bail. The YOT is also performing well against national standards and objectives with 90 per cent. of all final warning assessments being completed within 14 days.
<P>

<a name="10305w09.html_para7">A community reparation scheme is being operated in support of the community-based court orders and 11 agencies are supporting community reparation work. As a result, 60 per cent. of local reparation work is community-based. There is also a trained YOT worker in place to consult and liaise with victims of crime on their willingness to become involved in direct reparation work. The YOT has also developed protocols with appropriate agencies with the aim of involving parents in the youth justice process.
<P>

<a name="10305w09.html_para8">The Youth Justice Board is also providing funding for Splash schemes to be run during Easter and summer school holidays in 2001.

<a name="10305w09.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 Unmeasured sewerage charges consist of a fixed charge and a charge based on the rateable value of the property, both of which vary by water company. Information on unmeasured sewerage charges published by the Office of Water Services (Ofwat) show that in England and Wales in the financial year 2000-01, the weighted average fixed charge is &#163;41.50 and the weighted average charged based on rateable value is 46.89p in the pound. Figures for South West Water, which covers Devon, are &#163;42 and 112.35P in the pound respectively. The charges for the properties in the former Prison Service quarters estates are based on South West Water's figures and are equivalent to the charge which would be made by that company.

<a name="10305w10.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I have today published a Command Paper, CM 5066, entitled "Proceeds of Crime Bill: Publication of Draft Clauses." Copies have been placed in the Library. It is also available on the Home Office website, www.homeoffice.gov.uk.
<P>

<a name="10305w10.html_para1">The draft clauses we are publishing provide for the establishment of an asset recovery agency; the introduction of civil recovery; the application of taxation powers to suspected criminal assets; the creation of new specific powers for the tracing and investigation of criminal assets; the restraint of assets of suspected persons during a criminal investigation instead of only at the point of charge; improvements in the United Kingdom's ability to assist foreign jurisdictions; and the reform and updating of confiscation procedures and money laundering offences. The Bill, the work on which has been undertaken on a collaborative basis, will introduce equivalent measures in Scotland and Northern Ireland, adjusted for the legal systems of those jurisdictions.

otherwise, allow their vehicles to be used by persons seeking to enter the United Kingdom clandestinely. Owners, hirers and drivers of vehicles found to have carried clandestine entrants are jointly and severally liable to a penalty of &#163;2,000 for each clandestine entrant carried.
<P>

<a name="10305w10.html_para3">Since 3 April, when the provisions were implemented, and as at 28 February 2001, a total of 815 civil penalties have been imposed on persons found to have carried between them 4,514 clandestine entrants. Eighteen of the penalties have been imposed on the owners, hirers and drivers of self-drive vehicles in respect of a total of 193 clandestine entrants carried.

<a name="10305w10.html_para4">A code of practice, issued in accordance with the legislation, sets out the practical measures that should be taken by those seeking to prevent unauthorised entry into their vehicles, and provides a basis for a defence against a penalty should clandestine entrance nevertheless be found. Vehicle owners who believe they are unable to fulfil the requirements of the code of practice are advised to seek ways to offset any financial liability to which they may be exposed.

 <i>[holding answer 26 February 2001]:</i> There is a lot of detailed work to be done to implement the concept of universal banking services between now and 2003 when it is due to come on stream. The project is at too early a stage in its development to be prescriptive about issues such as whether the Post Office will need to register as a bank; or whether there will be a single payment systems manager.
<P>

<a name="10305w10.html_para9">The intention is that the Post Office card account will permit phased withdrawal of benefits. With regard to the setting up of direct debits, users of the basic bank account element of universal banking services will be able to benefit from direct debit facilities, which will mean that gas and electricity bills are reduced. It is also the intention of the Post Office to provide a bill payment service alongside the card account, with the aim that such payments will attract discounts in a similar way to those offered to direct debit customers. Development of this is at an early stage.

In addition, between 1 January 2000 and 11 February 2001, seven standard individual export licences (SIELs) and four open individual export licences (OIELs) have been issued covering goods with this rating. As regards how many of these licences covered the export of depleted uranium, investigations are being made and I will write to my hon. Friend as soon as possible and place a copy of that letter in the Library of the House.
<P>

<a name="10305w11.html_para0">Manufactured products of which depleted uranium materials form part would be controlled under the relevant entries in Part III of Schedule I of the Export of Goods (Control) Order 1994 and also under the relevant entries in Annex 1 of the Dual Use and Related Items (Export Control) Regulations 2000. The control would cover the product itself and not the depleted uranium contained therein. Consequently, it would entail disproportionate cost to establish which, if any, licences covered the export of manufactured products of which depleted uranium materials form part.

<a name="10305w12.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Alan Johnson </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2001]:</i> An estimate of the number of workers being paid below the national minimum wage can be made from central estimates based on the Office for National Statistics' new earnings and labour force surveys. However, this in itself is not an indication of the extent of non-compliance. There are a number of factors which need to be taken into account. Exactly which jobs and workers have been included in the surveys, for example, the different components of pay received and the composition of hours of work, can all affect the estimates. There is also the issue of sampling variation in the survey results, which means that any estimates should properly be provided as a range. The surveys do not tell us how many people are receiving free accommodation, are Government trainees, or are working for their family business and thus exempt. Account needs to be taken of the level of economic activity in the informal economy, which may not be picked up by the central estimates. The Low Pay Commission is monitoring and evaluating the impact of the minimum wage and is due to report its findings by July. I look forward to receiving the commission's report. My Department is also working with the Inland Revenue, which enforces the national minimum wage and administers the Working Families Tax Credit, to obtain indications of the level of minimum wage non-compliance from those sources.

 The Hull branch of the Crown Prosecution has worked closely with the police and courts to implement a number of changes which have reduced delay in the prosecution process. Other changes now in hand aim to improve the preparation of more serious cases for trial in the Crown court.
<P>

<a name="10305w12.html_para7">In October 1999, in line with national policy, the Narey proposals were implemented. Defendants now appear in Hull magistrates court within 36 to 72 hours of being charged by the police. Before this change there was often a delay of four to five weeks. To ensure that all relevant information is available for court, CPS lawyers and caseworkers attend at the police station and liaise with police staff prior to court. This means that in spite of the shorter timescales more cases can be finalised at the first hearing rather than being adjourned.
<P>

<a name="10305w12.html_para8">Further changes in January this year have enabled serious cases such as robbery, rape and murder to get to the Crown court much more quickly. In one recent case a defendant appeared at Hull Crown court only eight days after committing an offence of robbery and was sentenced to three years' imprisonment. Last year it would have taken around 12 weeks to deal with the case. All these changes illustrate the Government's successful policy of speeding up the work of the criminal justice system.

<a name="10305w12.html_para9">Progress is being made on the structural changes recommended by Sir Iain Glidewell's review of the CPS.

<P>
<a name="10305w13.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 Guidance on the methodology for multi-modal Studies (GOMMMs), published by DETR in March 2000, provided a framework for applying the Government's new approach to appraisal (NATA) as part of the multi-modal study process. GOMMMs was followed by the Access to Hastings study which was completed in November 2000. The final report for this study provides a table of impacts which contains all the significant costs and benefits of the strategies. The balance of this information gives an 'overall net value' of the strategies. This includes an assessment of the affordability of the strategies, represented in more conventional terms of a cost benefit analysis.
<P>

<a name="10305w13.html_para11">An error was made by the consultants in their cost-benefit analysis for their two preferred strategies within the final report. Revised figures have been circulated and provide a benefit-cost ratio (BCR) of 0.5 for Strategy 12 ("without bypasses") and of 1.0 for strategy 13 ("with bypasses"). An assessment of the A259 Hastings bypass schemes provided a BCR of 1.7. These figures relate only to the economic assessment and not to other aspects of the appraisal, for example the environmental assessment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10305w14.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 As part of the ongoing South East and East of England Regional Air Services (SERAS) study we asked BAA and other operators of major airports to provide technical assistance to the Department's consultants who are preparing possible options for development of airports to serve the study area. This work by the airport operators is subject to audit by the Department's consultants. The appraisal of the options, in line with the published framework, is being carried out entirely by our consultants.
<P>

<a name="10305w14.html_para12">We are currently appraising a very large number of options and will proceed through successive sifts to narrow down these options to a final shortlist, on which there will be a full public consultation before Ministers come to decisions. The published terms of reference clearly indicate that the study should consider both scenarios incorporating additional capacity and no additional capacity, and should consider both terminal capacity and runway capacity.
<P>

<a name="10305w14.html_para13">In advance of the consultation, it would be premature to comment on the status of any specific option. Releasing information in the early stages of a possible project, in advance of final options, could result in unnecessary and lengthy blight, as well as multiplying uncertainty and anxiety. This approach is consistent with my Department's Code of Practice on the Dissemination of Information during Major Infrastructure Developments.

 The membership and size of a local strategic partnership will depend on local circumstances. To be effective any strategic partnership will need to involve the key public agencies who provide most local services, such as local authorities, the health authority, police, Employment Service and Benefits Agency. However, local strategic partnerships must also include the private sector, voluntary organisations and local people in their core membership. The specific membership in any area should reflect local needs and priorities (as identified by the community strategy and local neighbourhood renewal strategy). Local authorities should take the first steps to ensure that a local strategic partnership is set up, building on existing effective partnerships in the area wherever possible.

 Vehicle Examiners (VEs) and Traffic Examiners (TEs) employed by the Vehicle Inspectorate check buses and coaches at the roadside and at operators' premises for roadworthiness, emissions, weight and compliance with drivers' hours and other traffic legislation. Where serious defects are found, or offences detected, an immediate or delayed prohibition notice may be issued and the offence may be reported for prosecution. The tables show the number of passenger service vehicles checked in the West Midlands Traffic Area and the enforcement action taken in 1999-2000 and in the half year to the end of September 2000.

<a name="10305w15.html_wqn2"><B> Mr. Yeo: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will advise the removal of flower heads from the winter and spring trials as a precautionary measure in line with the advice from the Under-Secretary of State, the hon. Member for Stretford and Urmston (Ms Hughes), in a Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions press release of 23 August 2000.  [151539]<P>

 <i>[holding answer 1 March 2001]:</i> The News Release of 23 August 2000 set out the arrangements for the farm-scale evaluations of autumn oilseed rape. It recognised that the review of separation distances for GM crops published by MAFF earlier that month had highlighted that increased separation distances might be required for certain types of oilseed rape. As an interim measure the News Release announced 100 m separation distances for varietal association oilseed rape pending full consideration of the NIAB report. If as a result the separation distances turned out to be greater than 100 m, consideration would be given to other risk reduction measures such as removal of flower heads from the rape plants to prevent pollen dispersal.




<P>
<P><I>5 Mar 2001 : Column: 57W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10305w15.html_para0">MAFF announced the outcome of their review and the distances to be applied to future rounds of the farm-scale evaluations on 6 February 2001, <i>Official Report,</i> column 492W. As a result, the Government have asked the agriculture and farming industry body SCIMAC to incorporate two changes into their revised code of practice on GM crops. The first is to continue to apply the 100 m separation distance used at the autumn sown sites where varietal association oilseed rape was nearby, as mentioned in the 23 August press release. The second is an increased distance of 80 m for maize crops. This is intended to ensure that contamination of neighbouring crops does not exceed 1 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10305w15.html_para1">The MAFF announcement means that it is not necessary to remove the flower heads from the GM oilseed rape fields presently growing or planned for this spring where they are near conventional crops of varietal association oilseed rape. There are no maize or beet sites presently being grown. The new separation distance for maize crops will be implemented at all of the spring 2001 sites, when they are sown later in the year.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will list those local authorities which have been advised by the Audit Commission to increase their reserves in each of the past three years.  [152142]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10305w15.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 It is the responsibility of the independent auditors appointed by the Audit Commission to consider the financial practices of authorities and to comment direct to an authority where they identify any matter which gives any cause for concern. This may include the level of an authority's reserves. The Audit Commission does not advise authorities on the level of reserves nor does it keep any central record of the recommendations of individual auditors.

 The regulation of fares is a matter for the Strategic Rail Authority. The Authority has no current plans to extend or change the existing formula for capping regulated fares on the railways, but it is reviewing the relationship between performance and fare caps. The current arrangements will apply to new or revised franchises including Chiltern and South Central, unless or until revised arrangements are subsequently agreed.

<P>
<a name="10305w16.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 The great majority of the British Railways Board's (BRB's) responsibilities have been assumed by the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) as a consequence of the Transport Act 2000. The management of the BRB records is, therefore, a matter for the SRA. With the ending of the BRB's operational responsibilities, a decision was made in 1997 to rationalise the archive and to retain only those documents necessary to meet the on-going requirements of the Board to deal with its continuing legal liabilities. Under an appraisal process agreed by the Public Record Office (PRO) and the Railway Heritage Committee, records of historical importance are being deposited with the PRO or County Record Offices. Railtrack (and where appropriate any other successor body) are being advised of those records in which they may have an interest for the on-going running of the railway. The building in which the former BRB Records Centre is housed is now much larger than that appropriate for the number of records held and will be sold in due course.

 The review of Part L of the Building Regulations is now almost complete. The Government wish to implement the changes at the earliest opportunity to maximise the reduction in Co <sub>2</sub>  emissions that will result. In order to allow the construction industry the maximum time possible to gear up to the changes in the Building Regulations with regard to energy efficiency, we are working towards publishing the proposed draft Approved Document in the near future, in advance of its formal publication, with a view to making amendment regulations in August of this year.
<P>

<a name="10305w16.html_para1">The draft cannot be finalised and formally published until after we have received the responses to the current consultation on Part E of the Building Regulations, which deals with sound insulation.

This consultation closes on 20 April 2001.
<P>

<a name="10305w16.html_para2">A key issue in the consultation on Part L was the target U-values.

<a name="10305w16.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Robert Ainsworth: </B> 
 Under Regulations laid before Parliament in December 2000, North West Water and other water companies are embarking on major programmes of new and improved treatment to minimise the capacity of water to dissolve lead from pipes. These programmes should enable the Drinking Water Directive's interim standard of 25 microgrammes of lead per litre of water (25 gPb/l) to be substantially met by December 2003, and will go a long way towards meeting the final standard of 10 gPb/l which has to be complied with by December 2013. Where the standards are not met, water companies will need to replace (or line) their own lead pipes and advise consumers as to any action that it is desirable that they take in the interests of their health. We shall know the full extent to which these additional measures will be needed when the treatment programmes have been completed. Property owners remain responsible for the pipes within their own properties.

Where the BFI finds evidence of persistent service failings, we will use our statutory powers to direct the authority concerned on the standards it is to achieve and the time scales for doing so.

 Investment in income-related benefits such as the Minimum Income Guarantee has provided the most effective and immediate way of tackling poverty. Modernising current systems through the development of tax credits and more tax-like assessments of benefits will provide a more efficient and simpler way of ensuring that people on low and modest incomes receive the security to which they are entitled.

Some 16,400 pensioners in Ilford, North will benefit from the substantial increases in the basic State Pension this April and next; this year's increase is &#163;5 a week for single pensioners and &#163;8 for couples. In addition we have introduced free TV licences for the over-75s, of whom we estimate there are about 7,000 in Ilford, North. 2,700 pensioner families in Ilford, North are receiving the minimum income guarantee, which we introduced in April 1999 to help our poorest pensioners.

To ask the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland what has been the cost to public funds, broken down by Department, of <i>(a)</i> establishing and <i>(b)</i> running the Saville inquiry up to 31 December 2000.  [149876]<P>

<P>
<a name="10305w22.html_spnew0"><B> Dr. Reid: </B> 
 The cost of the Bloody Sunday inquiry to my Department, from its establishment in January 1998 to 31 December 2000, was &#163;33,834,904. In addition, I estimate that around &#163;81,705 was incurred in staff and other administrative costs within the Department over the same period. Since no departmental staff are employed full-time on inquiry work, it is not possible to give precise figures.
<P>

<a name="10305w22.html_para0">I am advised that the Ministry of Defence's expenditure until 31 December 2000 was &#163;8,823,819. This includes the cost of staff employed full-time on inquiry-related work.

<a name="10305w22.html_para1">Other Departments do not employ staff full-time on inquiry work so are able to estimate only the costs to them. I am advised that the approximate expenditure of the Cabinet Office for this period was &#163;33,600; for the Home Office the figure was &#163;56,000 <sup>1</sup> ; and for the Treasury Solicitor's Department the figure was &#163;12,247. The security and intelligence agencies have also incurred costs of this nature, but it is not Government practice to disclose expenditure by these agencies. I am not aware of any other Department incurring expenditure in connection with the inquiry.

Both the legal and accountancy figures for post-December 2000 represent payments made against invoices received after 31 December 2000. Those invoices cover some work undertaken prior to 31 December. In particular, the expenditure reflects the detailed and comprehensive review of all the contracts undertaken by the NMEC, and also reflects the management and finance support provided to the company's executive. Both of these areas of work are essential to the successful implementation of the company's programme to achieve solvent liquidation.

 Bolton, West, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, is benefiting from the long-term action we have taken to build economic stability and secure high and stable levels of growth and employment. Since the General Election, claimant unemployment in the constituency has fallen by 439, or 33 per cent, youth unemployment is down by 67 per cent. and long-term unemployment has fallen by 66 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10305w24.html_para0">Macro-economic stability is being complemented at the micro-economic level by the Government's policies to ease the transition from welfare into work and to make work pay. To the end of December 2000, the New Deal for 18-24-year-olds had helped 447 young people in Bolton, West constituency gain valuable skills and experience--238 (53 per cent.) of whom had moved into employment. The Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), introduced in October 1999, is helping to make work pay for low and middle income families.

 The child care tax credit in the Working Families Tax Credit supports the National Child Care Strategy not only by making child care more affordable but by ensuring that the help we give goes to those using safe, good quality, child care. By the end of August 2000, 124,000 working families were getting money towards their child care costs through the Working Families Tax Credit. This is far in excess of the 47,000 families who received child care help at the high-water mark of family credit.

 The Vale of Clwyd, along with the rest of the United Kingdom, is benefiting from the long-term action we have taken to build economic stability and secure high and stable levels of growth and employment. Since the general election, claimant unemployment in the constituency has fallen by 504, or 26 per cent., youth unemployment is down by 79 per cent., and long-term unemployment has fallen by 57 per cent.
<P>

<a name="10305w25.html_para0">Macro-economic stability is being complemented at the micro-economic level by the Government's policies to ease the transition from welfare into work and to make work pay. To the end of December 2000, the New Deal for 18 to 24-year-olds had helped 809 young people in the Vale of Clwyd constituency gain valuable skills and experience--393 (49 per cent.) of whom had moved into employment. The Working Families Tax Credit (WFTC), introduced in October 1999, is helping to make work pay for low and middle income families. In August 2000, 2,000 families in the constituency were benefiting from WFTC.
<P>

<a name="10305w25.html_para1">The Government are also committed to developing policies which enable all pensioners to share in the country's rising prosperity. As a result of the recent pre-Budget report, all pensioners, including 15,800 in the Vale of Clwyd, will receive an above-inflation increase in the basic state pension from April 2001. Single pensioners will receive an extra &#163;5 a week, and couples will receive an extra &#163;8 a week. All pensioners aged 75 or over have also been entitled to a free TV licence since November 2000--including around 10,000 in the Vale of Clwyd.

This will also apply to the sale of new homes. The majority of homes are marketed by estate agents.

We hope that the Kimberley process will lead to the adoption by the end of the year of an international certification scheme for rough diamonds, as envisaged in the United Nations resolution adopted by the General Assembly last December. Such a scheme would make an invaluable contribution to preventing illegally mined rough diamonds fuelling civil conflict.

<P>
<a name="10305w29.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Quin: </B> 
 Since the outset of the OTMS in 1996, disposal of cattle has been by two means, either by direct incineration of the carcase, or by rendering of the carcase followed by the storage and subsequent incineration of the rendered material. There was then, and remains, insufficient capacity directly to incinerate all of the cattle

slaughtered. The majority are, therefore, rendered. All OTMS rendering plants operate under strict controls enforced by the Environment Agency and the relevant local authority to protect both public and environmental health. To assess the safety of OTMS operations, the Environment Agency commissioned a number of studies from independent expert consultations of the risk from BSE to human health via different environmental pathways, based on the precautionary principle. These were produced in consultation with the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) and published in 1997. They showed that the risks are negligible compared to other risks in daily life and endorsed SEAC's advice to the Government in 1996 that the current and proposed methods of dealing with animal waste material from the slaughter of cattle are safe.

Its Food and Veterinary Office (FVO) carries out inspection missions to all member states to check on the implementation and effectiveness of EU BSE control measures. An additional programme of urgent FVO missions is currently under way. Spain was visited in the week beginning 11 December 2000 and Sweden in the week beginning 29 January 2001. The reports of these missions will be published on the EU Commission website, as is normal practice.

The vast majority of these related to a planned service change in dermatology where, due to the anticipated cessation of a service level agreement on 31 March 2001, the trust would accept no further referrals after 1 January 2001. I further understand that, following discussions between the trust and the health authority, the trust is once again accepting referrals for this service.

 The Stewart report on mobile phones and health provided a rigorous and comprehensive assessment of existing research and considered the possible effects on health of mobile phones and base stations (masts). The report concluded that the balance of evidence indicates that there is no general risk to health of people living near base stations on the basis that exposures are expected to be small fractions of guidelines. However, in view of the concerns expressed by residents near base stations and the indirect effect on people's health, the report made a number a recommendations aimed at improving the public consultation and the availability of information about the siting of base stations.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health what evidence he has assessed in relation to the possible subverting of healthy prions in mammals to rogue prions by reaction with organophosphates in the presence of manganese; and what implications such a reaction would have for the use of insecticide lotions in school hair lice eradication programmes.  [151236]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10305w32.html_spnew0"><B> Yvette Cooper: </B> 
 The hypothesis that organophosphates (OPs) cause BSE in cattle by reacting with prions in normal mammalian cells to produce abnormal prions has been assessed by the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee. This is an independent expert committee established by Government to advise on all matters relating to spongiform encephalopathies. The committee concluded that none of the available scientific evidence indicates that the BSE epidemic is related to the use of OPs. This hypothesis was not consistent with the available epidemiological evidence. For example it does not explain the high incidence of BSE in Great Britain alone when such compounds are used throughout the world. Nor does it account for the fact that the BSE epidemic in Northern Ireland lagged behind that in Great Britain by some 2 years, despite the fact that OPs were used earlier, and at higher concentrations, in Northern Ireland.
<P>

<a name="10305w32.html_para0">Since the evidence does not support the hypothesis, there are no current implications for hair lice treatments containing OPs. Such products are licensed by the Medicines Control Agency in the United Kingdom; it has to be satisfied regarding safety, quality and efficacy before such licenses are issued.

As with other public authorities, health authorities have a duty under the Human Rights Act 1998 not to act in any way which is incompatible with a right under the European Convention on Human Rights. It is for the health authorities concerned to ensure that they consider, and seek appropriate advice on, whether their acts or decisions are compatible.

 <i>[holding answer 01 March 2001]:</i> The information requested is not collected centrally. Information from drug action team template returns indicate that &#163;151.8 million was spent on drug treatment in England in 1999-2000 by all agencies, although this is likely to be an underestimate due to incomplete data, as some drug action teams were unable to provide data either in time or in the format required.

 Applications for listing of appliances in part IX of the drug tariff take different lengths of time to consider depending on the complexity of any issues raised. Processing times are around a month in very simple cases but can be over a year in the more difficult cases. Types of product which are new to part IX tend to raise more complex issues and hence do take longer, but this is not invariably the case. Target times have not been set, but our constant aim is to deal with applications in the minimum time consistent with full consideration.
