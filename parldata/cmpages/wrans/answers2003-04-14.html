 The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Welsh Assembly have completed the public consultation on the bird registration scheme.
<P>

<a name="30414w01.html_para0">The consultation provoked over 400 responses from individuals; groups and organisations known to have an interest in schedule 4 and other birds; central and local government organisations; police forces and other enforcement agencies. A summary is being made available on the Department's website.
<P>

<a name="30414w01.html_para1">Having analysed the responses, Defra and the Welsh Assembly have decided to:

<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w01.html_wqn1"><B> Mr. John Smith: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (1) what estimate she has made of the costs to industry of the adoption of <i>(a)</i> emission limit values and <i>(b)</i> a national emission reduction plan under the revised Large Combustion Plants Directive;  [108552]
<P>
<UL>(2) whether <i>(a)</i> a power station and <i>(b)</i> generating unit are treated as combustion plants under the revised Large Combustion Plants Directive;  [108554]
<P>
(3) whether emission trading will be possible under a national emission reduction plan within the revised Large Combustion Plants Directive.  [108553]<P></UL>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w01.html_spnew1"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The Government are currently considering the implementation of the revised Large Combustion Plant Directive (2001/80/EC), in particular, the costs and benefits of the options.
<P>

<a name="30414w01.html_para3">Article 2(7) of the revised Directive defines a combustion plant as "any technical apparatus in which fuels are oxidised in order to use the heat thus 



<P>
<P><I>14 Apr 2003 : Column 478W</I><P>
generated". It provides for certain qualifications and exceptions to this definition (eg exclusion of gas turbines licensed before 27 November 2002) which do not constitute combustion plants for the purposes of the Directive.
<P>

<a name="30414w01.html_para4">Article 1 of the revised Directive provides that it only applies to combustion plants (as defined in Article 2), "the rated thermal input of which is equal to or greater than 50MW, irrespective of the type of fuel used (solid, liquid or gaseous)".
<P>

<a name="30414w01.html_para5">Accordingly, if a power station or generating unit falls within the provisions of Articles 1 and 2 of the Directive and does not benefit from any of the exclusions set out in Article 2(7), it will constitute a combustion plant for the purposes of the revised Directive.
<P>

<a name="30414w01.html_para6">Article 4(6) of the revised Directive, which deals with the implementation of the Directive via a "national emission reduction plan" specifies the requirements that those plans must include, which among others comprise "objectives and related targets, measures and timetables for reaching those objectives and targets, and a monitoring mechanism" (Article 4(6) (a)). This Article further provides that "the national emission plan shall reduce the total annual emission of nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (S02) and dust from existing plants to the levels that would have been achieved by applying the emission limit values referred to in paragraph 3 to the existing plants in operation in the year 2000".
<P>

<a name="30414w01.html_para7">There is nothing in the revised Directive to prohibit emissions trading in the context of a national emission reduction plan, though any emissions trading would have to comply with all other requirements of Community law, including rules of competition and state aids.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs if she will make a statement on progress with achieving transparency in respect of the European working groups for which the Department is responsible.  [105732]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 The Government have long been committed to greater openness in the EU Institutions. This was a key theme of the UK Presidencies in 1992 and 1998. Making it easier to gain access to non-sensitive documents is crucial to this. The Government welcomed Regulation 1049/2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents. As a result, more documents are released to the public, while genuinely sensitive documents are given the protection they need.
<P>

<a name="30414w01.html_para10">Accountability and transparency of Council business to Parliament are ensured by the scrutiny process, to which the Government are also firmly committed.
<P>

<a name="30414w01.html_para11">We strongly supported the measures agreed at the Seville European Council to make the Council more open when in legislating mode. We remain committed to increasing transparency. The Future of Europe Convention is also looking at ways to make the EU more open.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 Government have redirected, and match funded, a proportion of production linked subsidy payments into rural development measures since 2001. In the current negotiations on CAP reform we are pressing for both a shift in support from production-linked subsidies to environmental and rural development measures and a significant increase in the UK's share of current EU funding for rural development programmes. We are committed to increasing expenditure on the England Rural Development Programme. The detailed

arrangements for delivering this commitment will depend on the outcome of the on-going negotiations on the reform of the CAP.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs pursuant to her answer of 1 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 644W, on fur farming, whether the compensation scheme for fur farmers is in conformity with the Human Rights Act 1998.  [108035]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w01.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Morley: </B> 
 On Thursday 13 March 2003 the High Court gave judgment quashing the Fur Farming (Compensation Scheme) (England) Order 2002. The Government's view is that the compensation scheme conforms with Human Rights legislation. An application has been made to appeal.

To ask the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs what assessment her Department has made of the value for money of <i>(a)</i> direct incineration and <i>(b)</i> rendering followed by incineration of carcases under the Over-30-Month Scheme.  [108928]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w01.html_spnew7"><B> Alun Michael: </B> 
 The cost of rendering and subsequent incineration of rendered products is less expensive than that of the direct incineration of cattle carcases. However, there are some benefits to the direct incineration of carcases in terms of quicker re-imbursement of compensation sums to the Exchequer from the EU. Both methods of disposal are used under the Over-30-Month Scheme and each represent good value for money.

 Along with the other water supply companies, Cambridge Water and Anglian Water Services produce water resources plans, which look forward 25 years. These plans are updated annually by the companies, and are reviewed by the Environment Agency for consistency with its national and regional water resources strategies. The proposed housing expansion in and around Cambridge will be factored into this process.

 The scope of the control on the provision of technical assistance in relation to weapons of mass destruction (WMD) was drawn up after consultation on the draft Export Control Bill which sought views on the Bill and on the Government's proposals for the content of the secondary legislation. The scope of this control is in line with both the new WMD controls on the transfer by any means of technology and with the WMD provisions contained in the EC Dual-Use Regulation. The EC Dual-Use Regulation requires member states to control the physical export and electronic transfer of dual-use goods or technology which the exporter or transferor knows, or has been informed, is or may be intended use in connection with WMD.

To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what help will be given to district councils that have asylum seekers in respect of <i>(a)</i> housing, <i>(b)</i> health and <i>(c)</i> education.  [107332]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w06.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In respect of housing, the National Asylum Support Service (NASS) has entered into contracts with the private and public sector to provide accommodation for destitute asylum seekers. Only local authorities contracted to NASS would be asked to provide accommodation for asylum seekers placed in their areas. Other district councils would not be required to provide accommodation for asylum seekers.
<P>

<a name="30414w06.html_para5">Only upper tier authorities are responsible for providing education and healthcare. People applying for asylum in the UK are entitled to full use of the NHS without charge. Primary Care Trusts are the statutory organisations responsible for providing their residents&#151;including asylum seekers&#151;with health care and are funded directly to enable them to achieve this. Local education authorities fund the education service and receive most of their funding through general grant.

<P>
<a name="30414w06.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Edward Davey: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what research his Department has undertaken into the ability to pay of <i>(a)</i> pensioners and <i>(b)</i> low waged households in England in relation to the council tax.  [108425]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w06.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 We have not undertaken such research. However, council tax benefit, administered by the Department for Work and Pensions, is available to help low income households pay their council tax. Council tax benefit is paid to around 3.9 million households in England, of which around 2 million are pensioners.




<P>
<P><I>14 Apr 2003 : Column 497W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30414w06.html_para6">In addition, central Government surveys collect some relevant information on an ongoing basis. The Expenditure and Food Survey, for example, collects information on the percentage of household income that is spent on local taxes, and information is available for each income decile.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w06.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Edward Davey: </B> 
To ask the Deputy Prime Minister what the average council tax as a percentage of the average <i>(a)</i> wage and <i>(b)</i> state pension in England was in each financial year since 1997.  [108426]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w06.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 The following table gives figures for the average council tax per dwelling (net of council tax benefit) as percentages of average gross earnings and of the full basic state pension for each year since 1997&#150;98.
<P>

<a name="30414w06.html_para7">It should be noted, however, that the figures given do not necessarily reflect the relative abilities of wage earners and pensioners to pay council tax. Gross earnings and basic state pension figures are not comparable as measures of income, and neither of them can be said to represent disposable income. Gross earnings figures are, for example, before tax and other deductions, whereas the basic state pension represents a relatively small proportion of the income received by many pensioners. Furthermore, it has been assumed, in the absence of precise information, that reductions in council tax as a result of council tax benefit are spread evenly across all council taxpayers, whereas it is likely that, in reality, pensioners are assisted by benefit to a greater extent than wage earners.

 Following the Government's response to the Equal Opportunity Commission Task Force 'Just Pay' report, all departments and agencies are committed to reviewing their pay systems by April 2003 and to prepare action plans to close any equal pay gaps. The Cabinet Office has issued guidance to assist in these reviews. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister and its agencies are on course to complete the reviews by the end of April. non-departmental public bodies were not formally covered by the commitment, but they are undertaking reviews as a matter of good practice.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w07.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 There is a range of measures in place to guard against abuse in the e-voting pilots. This includes the use of voter specific PIN numbers and passwords, real time electronic registers to cast and record votes and systems to prevent an electronic vote being cast where voter identification has been used previously. Should a voter find that a vote has already been cast in his name, he will be entitled to ask for a tendered ballot in the normal way. All pilot authorities are under a legal obligation to report instances of fraud to the Police and the Electoral Commission, the appropriate authorities to investigate alleged electoral abuse. The Commission will conduct a thorough post-election evaluation exercise looking at all aspects of the programme, including fraud and security, to consider what lessons need to be learnt for the future.

<a name="30414w07.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Leslie: </B> 
 All e-voting pilots will be subject to pre-election independent security checks and post-election surveys and evaluation, the results of which will be made available to participating authorities and the public. E-voting authorities are required to work closely with all stakeholders including the public to demonstrate how their arrangements do not enhance the opportunity for fraud or undermine the secrecy and security of the poll. This includes use of public testing demonstrations and voter awareness programmes to gauge opinion and instil public confidence.

tendered contract let by the Office of Government Commerce (OGC), who alone dealt with the contract award process. Use of the OGC contract is available to those public bodies who sign up to the OGC Framework agreement. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's central offices, Rent Service Agency, Fire Service College and Planning Inspectorate all use this contract, and as such, procure mobile services from it via a simple ordering procedure. The contract can supply services from Orange, O2 and Vodafone; the latter are the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's predominate supplier.

<P>

 The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister was created on 29 May 2002. Since then, &#163;912,000 has been spent on telephone costs for the central Office of the Deputy Prime Minister during financial year 2002&#150;03. Figures for Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's agencies and non-departmental public bodies are not held centrally, and could be provided only at disproportionate cost. The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister's internal directory is stored electronically and all its staff and one of the Executive Agencies (The Planning Inspectorate) have on-line access to it.

1997&#150;2002 are actual figures. These are not yet available for 2002&#150;03 and therefore budgeted figures have been given. The definition of ring-fencing was updated last year to reflect the types of grant which now exist. Some grants previously classified as ring-fenced are not now classified in this way. The key distinction made remains that ring-fenced grants are those which restrict local authority spending. For completeness the following list includes all special grants inside Aggregate External Finance. Further details of classifications are in an annex to the freedoms and flexibilities announcement of 26 November.

 I have been asked to reply.

<a name="30414w11.html_para0">A statutory disregard of &#163;10 is applied to War Disablement Pensions and War Widows Pensions when calculating entitlement to income-related benefits. In the case of Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit, local authorities have the discretion to apply a further disregard up to the full amount of any War Pension in payment. Any amount on top of the statutory disregard is funded from authorities' own resources.
<P>

<a name="30414w11.html_para1">Local authorities, through their discretionary schemes, are best placed to determine the needs of their local residents, taking account of local priorities. At the end of March 2003, 387 local authorities were disregarding War Pensions in full and from this month April 2003, six more authorities have given an undertaking to apply a full disregard. A further four authorities apply a disregard in excess of the statutory &#163;10, and have confirmed their intention to make further improvements to their local schemes. The remaining 11 authorities apply the statutory disregard.

<a name="30414w11.html_para3">The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) conducts an annual survey into the level of opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan. This reported that the level of cultivation in 2002 was 74,000 hectares. This was higher than the mid-1990s average but below the record level of 1999 (91,000 hectares).
<P>

<a name="30414w11.html_para4">The UNODC is in the process of carrying out the 2003 survey. Its results will be published in the autumn. In March 2003 the UNODC published an Opium Rapid Assessment Survey for Afghanistan.

 We are aware of the potential for ethnic strife which is a result of the Government of Iraq's policy of 'Arabisation', which forced many Kurds, Turkomans and Assyrians from their homes in Kirkuk and other towns in the north of Iraq over the past 10 years.

 The UK military is working to establish safe and secure environments in the areas of Iraq it controls. This will allow humanitarian agencies to enter and provide humanitarian assistance where it is needed. It is likely that some areas will be made secure more quickly than others.
<P>

<a name="30414w11.html_para9">Aid agencies seek to operate within a 'humanitarian space' made secure by the controlling forces rather than being directly escorted by military forces. The latter could be seen to undermine the independence and impartiality the agencies require to gain access to those in need.

 The provision, use and management of water are central to both sustainable development and poverty reduction. Nearly two thirds of the world's population will be living in countries of significant water stress by the year 2025. If we do not pay more attention to equitable water management we will see conflict and war generated by water shortages. 1.2 billion people lack access to safe drinking water, and 2.4 billion people lack access to basic sanitation. The provision of clean drinking water and sanitation is essential to prevent 2 million children dying of diarrhoea every year. Carrying water also exhausts women and keeps girls out of school.

 Zimbabwe continues to suffer from a major humanitarian crisis. Assessments indicate that 6.7 million people (50 per cent. of the population) required food assistance from December 2002 until the next harvest due in May. However, there has been little access to displaced farm workers or to urban areas where there are serious concerns about vulnerability. Early indications are that this year's maize harvest while double last years will still be 40 per cent. less than required.

We have directly funded NGOs that are providing supplementary food to 1.5 million, mostly children, pregnant and nursing women and the elderly.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on information he has received on <i>(a)</i> the number of homes which have been destroyed and <i>(b)</i> how much land has been used as a result of the construction by Israel of the separation fence in the West Bank.  [107113]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w14.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Construction of the fence has only recently begun. The Palestinian Environmental NGOs Network (PENGON) estimated in March 2003 that 100 buildings, most of them used as stores, had been demolished as a result of fence construction. When completed the fence is expected to be 360km long. Officials from our Embassy in Tel Aviv and our Consulate in Jerusalem who have travelled to Palestinian areas affected by construction of the fence have reported that a corridor up to 40 metres wide in places has been cleared for the fence's path.
<P>

<a name="30414w14.html_para0">The proposed path of the fence, as described in the Israeli media, would run east of the Green Line for most of its length. Approximately 10 per cent. of the entire West Bank would lie to the west of the fence. Palestinian land is being seized for fence construction, cultivated farmland is being destroyed and some towns will be separated from surrounding farmland by the fence. Current estimates indicate the northern and Jerusalem sections of the fence, approximately 215km long, will leave 290,000 Palestinians on the Israeli side of the fence. Of those, some 70,000 do not have Israeli residency permits and, as a consequence, may feel it necessary to move east of the fence in order to retain access to basic services.
<P>

<a name="30414w14.html_para1">Our view is that, the building of the fence, and the adverse impact it will have on Palestinians living in the West Bank, is unacceptable. We have made our opposition known to the Israeli Government.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w14.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 The Government do not keep a list in the form requested. But to assist I can say that B'Tselem, the Israeli Information Centre for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories, has made allegations that 98 Palestinians have been assassinated by the Israel Defence Forces between 29 September 2000 and 6 April 2003. A further 45 Palestinians who had no known

affiliation to any militant group were also killed in these operations. B'Tselem's website (www.btselem.orR) gives further details of the Palestinians killed. Since 6 April there have been two further targeted killings carried out by the IDF resulting in the deaths of eight Palestinians, including at least four civilians.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department what his estimate is of the total spending of his Department on entertainment in each year from 1994&#150;95 to 2002&#150;03; and if he will make a statement.  [92377]<P>

 Home Office expenditure on official entertainment is made in accordance with departmental guidance on financial procedures and propriety based on the principles set out in Government Accounting.

<a name="30414w15.html_para12">The following figures relate to the cost of entertaining non-civil servants (hospitality) and civil servants (management entertainment). Details of such expenditure are only held centrally for financial years 1997&#150;98, to 2001&#150;02. The figures for 2002&#150;03 are forecasts.
<P>

<a name="30414w15.html_para13">The increase in expenditure from 1999&#150;2000 is due to an element of incorrect expenditure coding, resulting coding, resulting in the inclusion of accommodation and subsistence costs. It is not possible, without disproportionate cost to separate these costs, and consequently these figures are not directly comparable with those provided in previous years.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Home Department under what circumstances a person granted <i>(a)</i> humanitarian protection and <i>(b)</i> discretionary leave to remain will be able to be joined in the UK by a spouse or dependent children.  [108215]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w16.html_spnew0"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 A spouse or dependent child will normally be allowed to join a person who has been granted limited leave under either the humanitarian protection or discretionary leave policies, only once they have been granted indefinite leave to remain, or settlement, in the United Kingdom. A person will not be eligible to apply for settlement until they have three years humanitarian protection or six years discretionary leave (more for people who are considered to be of bad character or conduct).

<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w16.html_spnew1"><B> Beverley Hughes: </B> 
 It is not Government policy to give access to mainstream benefits to those failed single asylum seekers who cannot currently be removed from the United Kingdom. We have always recognised that in some cases failed asylum seekers will be unable to leave the United Kingdom immediately through no fault of their own. In such circumstances the person can apply for accommodation to be provided under Section 4 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999. Where accommodation is provided it is on a full board basis.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what criteria childminders must fulfil in order that their clients may claim children's tax credit.  [107480]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w16.html_spnew4"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The child care element of the Working Tax Credit is available for safe, secure, good quality childcare which is approved or regulated. That is why childminders must be registered with the appropriate regulating authorities. Each regulating authority decides on the criteria and standards childminders should reach before they can be registered. For England, the Office for Standards in Education (OFSTED) registers childminders against the National Standards for Under Eights Day Care and Childminding. In Scotland, the regulating authority is the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care. In Wales, it is the Care Standard's Inspectorate for Wales and in Northern Ireland it is the local Health and Social Services Trust.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w16.html_spnew5"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Working Families' Tax Credit has been replaced by the new Working and Child Tax Credits. Nine out of 10 families with children will be eligible for the Child Tax Credit.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer if he will make a statement on the progress being made to ensure that all recipients who are eligible for child tax credit are able to receive it.  [107289]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w16.html_spnew6"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The Inland Revenue has written directly to claimants of Working Families', Disabled Person's and children's tax credits, inviting claims for the new tax credits, and followed that with up to four reminders. Employees receiving Children's Tax Credit through their PAYE codes received a special insert with their 2003&#150;04 coding notices, and there is a prominent reference to the new tax credits in the uprating letter going to all seven million Child Benefit recipients. These direct contacts are being supported by a high-profile publicity campaign on television, in the press, on radio and online&#151;aimed at everyone entitled to the new tax credits.
<P>

<a name="30414w16.html_para0">Child Tax Credit is paid directly to the person in the family mainly responsible for looking after the children. Claimants can choose to receive it weekly or 4-weekly. The first payments are being made this week&#151;the first week of the tax year.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many families with children are expected to be ineligible for the child tax credit because their earnings are too high.  [107406]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w16.html_spnew7"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 Nine out of ten families are expected to be eligible for Child Tax Credit. Therefore it is estimated that 10 per cent. of families with children have annual household income that is too high for them to receive the Child Tax Credit.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w16.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer what proportion of claimants for the new tax credits have opted for payment by girobook.  [107418]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w16.html_spnew8"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The new tax credits are paid either directly by the Inland Revenue, or by the employer&#151;with wages. The Inland Revenue aims to make any direct payments of tax credits into a bank account but, where suitable banking facilities are not available, tax credits are paid by girocheque.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w16.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Willetts: </B> 
To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many allegations of improper use of the childcare tax credit have been communicated to the Inland Revenue's Childminder's hotline; and how many of these have led to <i>(a)</i> an investigation for fraud, <i>(b)</i> a penalty for fraud, <i>(c)</i> a successful prosecution for fraud and <i>(d)</i> a custodial sentence on grounds of fraud.  [107419]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w16.html_spnew9"><B> Dawn Primarolo: </B> 
 The child care element is only one component of both Working Families' Tax Credit (WFTC) and Disabled Person's Tax Credit (DPTC). An enquiry into a WFTC/DPTC award may involve more than one element of non-compliance.

To ask the Chancellor of the Exchequer how many claims for the working families tax credit have <i>(a)</i> been identified as being appropriate for further investigation because of the possibility of fraud, <i>(b)</i> been investigated for fraud, <i>(c)</i> proved to be partially or wholly fraudulent, <i>(d)</i> led to a penalty because of fraud, <i>(e)</i> resulted in a successful prosecution for fraud and <i>(f)</i> led to a custodial sentence on the grounds of fraud in each year since the credit began.

A meaningful average of the time taken to reach a decision on the claim is not available, because the new tax credits have only just been introduced.

 <i>[holding answer 8 April 2003]:</i> The introduction of the Child Tax Credit and the Working Tax Credit represents a large one-off piece of work for the Inland Revenue.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what powers he has to override <i>(a)</i> schools admissions decisions and <i>(b)</i> the design of school catchment areas.  [108474]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w19.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 School admissions decisions, such as setting admission arrangements and oversubscription criteria and deciding which children should be allocated a school place in accordance with those arrangements, rest with the admission authority for the school in question: the local education authority for community and voluntary controlled schools, the governing body for foundation and voluntary aided schools.
<P>

<a name="30414w19.html_para0">My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State can intervene only in limited circumstances. First, if a school governing body or local education authority is acting unreasonably or in default of a statutory duty, he may&#151;if he thinks this expedient&#151;direct them to put things right. These direction powers might be used, for example, to secure a child's entry to a community or voluntary controlled school if the governing body had refused to comply with the decision of the LEA (the admission authority) to admit that child. Secondly, if a LEA intends to direct the governing body of a foundation or voluntary aided school, which has refused to admit a child, to admit him or her, and the governing body refers the matter to the Secretary of State, he may uphold the LEA's decision to make the direction, or decide that the child should be admitted to another school instead.
<P>

<a name="30414w19.html_para1">Many admission authorities use catchment areas to help decide which children should be admitted, if there are more applicants than places. The Admissions Code of Practice includes catchment areas in its list of common and acceptable over-subscription criteria. My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State would only direct an admission authority to make changes to its choice of catchment area if he was satisfied both that the admission authority had acted unreasonably in the very strict sense the courts defined in the 'Wednesbury' case, and that it was expedient for him to intervene.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what net percentage increase per pupil Barnet is receiving from central Government funds in 2003&#150;04; and if he will make a statement.  [109184]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w19.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Figures for 2003&#150;04 for all central Government funding for education, including formula funding and grants, and which are fully comparable with those of 2002&#150;03, are not yet available. In particular not all grant allocations have yet been made. Compared with 2002&#150;03, Barnet's Education Formula Spending Share per pupil for 2003&#150;04 has increased by 7 per cent.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w19.html_wqn7"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of the <i>(a)</i> percentage and <i>(b)</i> cash increase necessary in (i) the schools budget and (ii) the individual schools budget in Barnet fully to meet his passporting requirements.  [109185]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w19.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 Based on the passporting targets given to authorities in December 2002, Barnet was required to increase its schools budget from &#163;133.5 million in 2002&#150;03 to &#163;167.4 million. This increase of &#163;34 million includes the LSC provisional grant of &#163;18 million and &#163;1.5 million of specific formula grants. The required passporting increase thus equates to an increase of &#163;15 million or 11.3 per cent. over the 2002&#150;03 schools budget figure.
<P>

<a name="30414w19.html_para2">The Secretary of State's passporting requirements do not extend to the individual schools budget; it is for local education authorities, in consultation with their school forums, to make decisions on the distribution of funding within the schools budget.
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w19.html_wqn8"><B> Mr. Dismore: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what assessment he has made of representations from Barnet council that <i>(a)</i> the cost pressures on schools to set a statemented budget in Barnet equate to 8.5 per cent., <i>(b)</i> the net loss in support from the changes to the standard fund is &#163;4 million net and <i>(c)</i> the centrally retained budget is one of the lowest in (i) London and (ii) the country; and if he will make a statement.  [109186]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w19.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Miliband: </B> 
 The Department does not collect information on the distribution of salaries by local education authority. It is therefore not possible for us to assess cost pressures on an individual local authority basis.
<P>

<a name="30414w19.html_para3">The Standards Fund DfES grant has changed from &#163;9.8 million in 2002&#150;03 to &#163;7.6 million in 2003&#150;04&#151;a reduction of &#163;2.2 million. The figure for 2002&#150;03 includes class size grant of &#163;109,333. The funding for class size grant is now distributed via the Education Formula Spending Shares. Barnet received an increase in EFS per pupil of 7.0 per cent on a like for like basis.
<P>

<a name="30414w19.html_para4">In terms of dealing with cost pressures, it is the increase in central spending, rather than the size of that spending in relation to other authorities, which will have a significant impact on the increase which Barnet's schools will see.

 Officials wrote to all local authorities on 21 February 2003 enclosing Start Up Guidance on children's centres. There are 136 local authorities that have wards rated as among the most disadvantaged 20 per cent. Of these 124 were given indicative funding, and targets for reach and child care places. The remaining 12 will be individually assessed on a case by case basis to determine the level of funding required.
<P>

<a name="30414w20.html_para2">Local authorities are now beginning their strategic planning and will make decisions at a local level as to the best sites to develop children's centres. Sure Start Unit regional teams will work closely with local authorities over the spring and summer in developing these plans and local authorities will then submit their final strategic plans by 15 October 2003 at the latest. It is at that point that we will have full details of which wards will have children's centres.

 There are no plans to establish new Education Action Zones (EAZs). The first EAZs were established in September 1998; the last one started in May 2000. When they complete their five-year statutory term, they will transform either into an Excellence in Cities (EiC) Action Zone in an EiC area, or into an Excellence Cluster in a non-EiC area. There will be no new EiC Action Zones, other than those statutory zones that are transforming into EiC Action Zones in EiC areas. My predecessor, the hon.

To ask the Secretary of State for Education and Skills what the authorised uses of the pupil identification number are; whether the use of the pupil identification number for non-education purposes is permitted; if he will bring forward legislation to prevent the use of the number for non-education purposes; and if he will make a statement.  [104519]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w22.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. Stephen Twigg: </B> 
 The purpose of the "unique pupil number" (or UPN) is to facilitate the collation of information about pupils accumulated over the course of their school career and so to create profiles of their progress. These profiles are built up from the Pupil Level Annual Schools Census (PLASC) showing the whereabouts and status of the pupil each January in terms of (for example) the school they were attending, their special educational needs, eligibility for free school meals and ethnic group, plus information obtained separately from schools, marking agencies and exam boards on their results in Key Stage assessments and public examinations. The profiles are stored in a National Pupil Database.
<P>

<a name="30414w22.html_para3">A small number of technical staff engaged in collating the pupil level data and creating the profiles have access to pupils' UPNs and names. Analysts in the Department and partner agencies (Ofsted, QCA and LSC) have access to anonymised profiles for use for statistical purposes only. LEAs, and through them schools, can access the profiles of their own pupils (including UPNs and names in this case) in order to fill gaps in their own data which have arisen through information being lost as pupils move from school to school.
<P>

<a name="30414w22.html_para4">Analysis of the profiles in the national database provides schools, LEAs, the Department and its partners with major new information to support standards raising and other policies such as ethnic monitoring. Schools are also helped to make appropriate provision for their pupils by being able to obtain from the national database more complete information about them.
<P>

<a name="30414w22.html_para5">The introduction of UPNs in 1999 was preceded by extensive discussions with the then Data Protection Registrar. The system is operated in a manner agreed with her in order to minimise any threat to personal privacy which might be posed if access to and use of UPNs and the National Pupil Database were not properly controlled.
<P>

<a name="30414w22.html_para6">The use of UPNs for non-education purposes is not permitted. There is no evidence that any agencies or organisations have attempted to use UPNs improperly for non-education purposes. If such evidence began to emerge, powers exist under the Data Protection Act 1998 which would enable the Department to set out in a Parliamentary order the permitted uses of UPNs, thereby rendering their use for any other purpose illegal.

 The Schools Access Initiative provides resources to help make mainstream schools accessible to pupils with disabilities. The funding is allocated to local education authorities and it is for each authority to decide its priority schemes. In total, Buckinghamshire LEA has received &#163;1.3 million through the Schools Access Initiative in the years 2000&#150;03.
<P>

<a name="30414w23.html_para1">At the end of the financial year LEAs are required to report back to the Department the projects funded from the Initiative. According to the reports received from Buckinghamshire LEA, no projects in schools in the Buckingham constituency were funded from Schools Access Initiative in 2000&#150;01. In 2001&#150;02 Gawcott Community Infant School received &#163;20,230 and Royal Latin School &#163;17,805. LEAs have until 25 July 2003 to return reports for 2002&#150;03.

 There is no fixed fee for part-time higher education. Unlike the position for full time provision, higher education providers are free to set the fees for part-time higher education at a level they choose. We announced in the White Paper "The future of higher education" that we would improve the package of support for part time students by introducing a new fee support grant for those whose income is below certain thresholds, and who are studying courses that are at least half-time. Full details of the package will be announced later in the year.

 The implications for the funding of institutions if variable fees are not used are a matter for the devolved nations. The devolved administrations for Scotland and Northern Ireland have responsibility for student support. This Department is currently responsible for student support for higher education students in England and Wales. Whilst this remains the case, the funding implications for both administrations of deferring variable fees will be taken into account when providing funding for students in England and Wales.

<i>Notes:</i><P>

1. Information for the years 1995&#150;96 to 1998&#150;99 is reproduced from the House of Commons Defence Committee Seventh report "The Strategic Defence Review: Defence Medical Services" published on 27 October 1999. The final outturn for 1998&#150;99 was the same as the estimated figure contained in the HCDC Report.<P>

2. The figure for 1995&#150;96 is the cost of the DMS estimated by Defence Cost Study 15(DCS 15). The figure contained in the DCS 15 report included primary care costs, estimated at &#163;81.1 million. This has been removed here to allow accurate comparison with the figures for subsequent years.<P>

3. Figures for 1996&#150;97 to 2001&#150;02 comprise the costs of the Surgeon General's Department and the four medical agencies (the Defence Secondary Care Agency, Defence Dental Agency, the Defence Medical Training Organisation, and the Medical Supplies Agency), the single Service Medical Directorates General, the Institute of Naval Medicine, the Centre for Aviation Medicine and British Forces Germany.<P>

4. The estimated figure for 2002&#150;03 comprises the costs of the Defence Medical Services Department (formerly the Surgeon General's Department) and the three medical Agencies (the Defence Secondary Care Agency, Defence Dental Agency, and the Defence Medical Training Organisation), the single Service Medical Directorates General, the Institute of Naval Medicine, the Centre for Aviation Medicine, British Forces Germany and the Medical Supplies Agency, which was transferred to the Defence Logistics Organisation in April 2002. Figures for Germany cover secondary care for Army and RAF personnel and primary care for Army personnel from 1996&#150;97 to 2000&#150;01 and both Army and remaining RAF personnel in 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03.<P>

5. Except where advised above, primary care costs cannot be provided without disproportionate effort as they are disaggregated and are embedded in individual units' budgets.<P>

6. In financial year 2001&#150;02, the Ministry of Defence changed accounting systems to include full Resource Accounts (which include costs of fixed assets etc, not reported previously). However, the figures for 2001&#150;02 and 2002&#150;03 in the table have been adjusted to allow comparison with prior years.<P>

7. Estimated costs for 2002&#150;03 include additional expenditure relating to military action against Iraq.<P>

 <i>[holding answer 11 April 2003]:</i> Findings from two major independent epidemiological studies funded by the Ministry of Defence into Gulf veterans' illnesses following the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict have been published. The results from a study of mortality were published in "The Lancet" on 1 July 2000. The researchers found that the number of deaths and the causes of death in the comparison group comprising of those who did not deploy to the Gulf were similar to those for Gulf veterans. There was however a small non-significant excess of non-disease related deaths among Gulf veterans, particularly due to accidents.
<P>

<a name="30414w25.html_para3">Results from an epidemiological study of ill health were published in the May 2001 edition of "Occupational and Environmental Medicine". The researchers found that Gulf veterans reported symptoms with a greater severity than those who were not deployed to the Gulf although the overall severity of symptoms was not high. There was no evidence of any illness unique to Gulf veterans. In terms of symptom severity, the various symptoms reported were ranked in generally the same order by both groups. The researchers found no evidence of a "Gulf War Syndrome". Weak associations between particular self-reported exposures (handling pesticides, vaccinations and exposure to oil well fire smoke) and particular types of ill health were found although no indication was given of a link between "handling pesticides" and actual contact with the pesticides. In another study, clinical tests on a number of Gulf veterans who had significant neuromuscular symptoms were carried out. A paper reporting results from the study was published in "Neurology" on 26 November 2002. The paper reports that the researchers found no neurophysiological evidence for a specific neuromuscular disorder that could be linked to deployment to the Gulf. In addition, interim results have been published from the Ministry of Defence's Vaccines Interactions Research Programme. On 1 April 2003, <i>Official Report,</i> column 55WS, I announced that preliminary results from the current phase of the study using marmosets are available and were presented by means of a scientific poster. These preliminary results indicated no apparent adverse health consequences three months following the administration of vaccine and/or pyridostigmine bromide (the active chemical in Nerve Agent Pre-treatment Sets tablets) to marmosets.
<P>

<a name="30414w25.html_para4">The findings from other studies are yet to be published. Full details of all the Gulf veterans' illnesses related research studies being funded by the Ministry of Defence are available on the Internet at: www.mod.uk.issues/gulfwar/research.htm.
<P>

<a name="30414w25.html_para5">A considerable amount of research into Gulf veterans' illnesses has been undertaken in the United States and the United States Department of Defence have also funded research in the UK. There is scientific 



<P>

evidence that some veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf conflict report a large number of multi-system, multi-organ, non-specific, medically unexplained symptoms as well as recognised medical conditions. However, the overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community is that there is insufficient evidence to enable this ill-health to be characterised as a unique illness, condition or 'syndrome'.

 None. The Ministry of Defence accepts that some veterans of the 1990&#150;91 Gulf Conflict have become ill and that many believe this ill health is related to their Gulf experience. A large number of multi-system, multi-organ, non-specific, medically unexplained symptoms have been reported by some Gulf veterans as well as recognised medical conditions. However, the overwhelming consensus of the scientific and medical community is that there is insufficient evidence to enable this ill-health to be characterised as a unique illness, condition or "syndrome". The MOD's approach must be guided by the scientific and medical community and therefore does not recognise "Gulf War Syndrome" as a medical condition.

 I assume the hon. Member is referring to a letter published in <i>The Lancet</i> on 2 March 2002 entitled: "Paraoxanse (PON1) polymorphisms in farmers attributing ill health to sheep dip." The letter reports outputs from a Government funded study and suggests that organophosphate pesticides contribute to the reported ill health of some people who dip sheep. The final report from the study referred to in the letter is not yet available. When it is, we will consider carefully all of the study's findings and implications in consultation with inter-departmental colleagues and expert advisers. Medical treatment for service personnel is the responsibility of the Defence Medical Service and for those who have left the armed forces, the NHS. I refer the hon. Member to the answer I gave on 4 April 2003, <i>Official Report</i>, column 881W, to the hon. Member for Woking (Mr. Malins) regarding compensation. We are considering arrangements for assessing the health of United Kingdom service personnel involved in military operations in Iraq. I expect to make an announcement shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w26.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hoon: </B> 
 Cluster bombs are only used strictly in accordance with international law. This includes the principles of distinction and proportionality as well as precautionary measures to be taken in planning and conducting an attack, as contained in the First Additional Protocol of 1977 to the Geneva Conventions of 1949. The targeting process takes account of these principles in matching the type of weapon used to the target to be attacked. There will be circumstances when it would be considered more appropriate to use other munitions than cluster bombs. These circumstances are more likely to arise in urban or populated areas as cluster bombs engage targets that cover an area. However, a decision on which type of munition to use has to take into account all the circumstances at the time of an attack. It follows that it would be unlikely that cluster bombs would be used in an urban unpopulated area.

due to service. Payments under a new Armed Forces Compensation Scheme would replace awards currently made under the War Pension Scheme and the Armed Forces Pension Scheme for injuries or illness caused on or after the date of implementation. The new scheme should provide simpler and fairer arrangements that recognise the special status of the armed forces and focus better on those personnel most severely disabled.

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what factors are taken into account in determining whether to approve or oppose windfarm applications in low-flying tactical training areas; and if he will make a statement.  [109164]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w26.html_spnew10"><B> Dr. Moonie: </B> 
 The Department fully supports the Government's targets for renewable energy. Every proposal received is considered individually by at least seven separate technical advisers, each with their own specialism. The criteria for users is the likely effect of the development on operational capability and the ability to train our pilots safely.
<P>

<a name="30414w26.html_para9">The presence of wind turbines in most areas of the United Kingdom presents no difficulty to low flying aircraft as these and other naturally tall structures are taken into account as part of route planning. However, within the tactical training areas, a large proliferation of obstacles is avoided as this would negate the value of the training. For these reasons, wind farm proposals may compromise flight safety to an unacceptable level and result in an objection from the Department.

 Full resources have been allocated to the Powershift programme for 2003&#150;04 to meet all expected demands&#151;as they have been in previous years. Within each financial year my Department continually monitors demand for PowerShift grants to ensure, in the light of other pressures, appropriate resources are available to support the wider use of cleaner fuels such as LPG.

<P>
<P>

 We have received 10 letters about off-road motorcycles from Members of Parliament from 2000 to 2003 and five from 1997 to 1999.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w30.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 There are already sufficient powers to regulate the use of motorcycles off-road, and we do not see the need for a review of the legislation.
<P>

<a name="30414w30.html_para0">A vehicle&#151;even if specifically designed for off-road use&#151;used on the public highway should comply with the Road Vehicles (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986. The rider should also hold a current driving licence, vehicle excise duty, insurance, and wear a safety helmet. A motorcyclist riding an off-road machine on a road could be prosecuted for failing to comply with these requirements.
<P>

<a name="30414w30.html_para1">There is no evidence to suggest that other vehicles are being used illegally to cause serious problems.

<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w30.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The riders of motorcycles used both on and off road are required to have a driving licence. Should scramble bikes be used solely off road there is no requirement for a driving licence, and we do not believe it would be justified.

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>David Jamieson has asked me to reply to your recent Parliamentary Questions about noise reduction measures on the trunk road and motorway network.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>In 2002&#150;03, the Agency spent &#163;5.9 million on noise mitigation measures such as noise barriers on trunk roads and motorways, against a ring fenced annual budget of &#163;5 million. In addition, it is our policy to use low-noise surfacing whenever a road surface needs renewing. In 2002&#150;03, &#163;235 million was spent on resurfacing trunk roads and motorways, two per cent. above the budget for this work.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>For 2003&#150;04, the allocation for resurfacing concrete trunk roads and motorways is &#163;52 million. The programme for 2004&#150;05 is currently still under development. We shall be resurfacing the highest priority sections of concrete road ahead of maintenance need, in order to reduce traffic noise.</FONT></UL>




<P>
<P><I>14 Apr 2003 : Column 591W</I><P>

<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Following consultation with local highways authorities and others, the following criteria were announced on 17 October 2001 for prioritising the surfacing of concrete roads with quieter material:</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(i) that wherever possible the application of quieter surfaces will fit in with normal maintenance needs;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(ii) that priority will be given to those sites where treatment would benefit the greatest number of people;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iii) that the works will be carried out in such a way to minimise disruption to the general public and users of the network;</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>(iv) that priority will be given to roads, opened since June 1988, where actual noise levels have turned out to be significantly higher than predicted at the time of the public inquiry.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>These criteria have been used to prioritise the list of schemes announced on 1 April. The main determinants of priority are the number of properties affected (proxy for criterion ii) and for newer roads, the increase in noise levels above those predicted at public inquiry (criterion iv). The high priority group is defined by sections of road which affect more than 100 properties per km or for which the current noise level is at least 3 dB(A) greater than predicted at public inquiry (an increase of 3 dB(A) is equivalent to the noise increase expected from a doubling of the volume of traffic on a road). The medium priority group is defined by sections of road which affect more than 10 properties per km or for which the current noise level is 1 dB(A) greater than predicted at public inquiry, which equates to a noticeable noise increase.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>It is expected that the sections indicated as having a high priority will be completed by the end of March 2007, subject to funding being available. We expect to resurface sections of road in the medium or low priority groups between April 2007 and March 2011, subject to funding being available. Where there is an identified maintenance need, some of the medium or low priority sections may be resurfaced earlier, for road safety reasons.</FONT></UL>

<P>
<a name="30414w32.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 Following South Africa's request to have its driving licences recognised for licence exchange purpose, the driver testing and licensing standards in that country were assessed by Departmental officials and found to be satisfactory and comparable to those in GB. As a result from 2 July 1999 residents in Great Britain with valid South African licences have been able to exchange them for British licences without passing a further driving test.

 I have asked the Chief Executive of the Highways Agency, Tim Matthews, to write to my hon. Friend.
<P>

<a name="30414w32.html_para2"><i>Letter from Tim Matthews to Mr. Woodward, dated 14 April 2003</i>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I have been asked by David Jamieson to reply to your six recent Parliamentary Questions about ongoing works to the northbound bridge of the M6 Motorway Thelwall Viaduct, in Cheshire.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The Highways Agency is responsible for the operation, management, maintenance, and improvement of the trunk road and motorway network in England, including the Thelwall Viaduct, which typically carries some 150,000&#151;160,000 vehicles per day. All but one lane of the northbound viaduct was closed in July 2002, following the discovery of a failed roller bearing.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Detailed investigation has concluded that all 136 roller bearings on the northbound viaduct should be replaced before further traffic lanes can be opened on the viaduct. The increased scale of the problem has led to a thorough analysis of all the issues on the viaduct and, over the course of the next few months, this further work will enable us to establish a realistic programme for the works.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>The current restrictions comprise three narrow lanes in each direction on the new southbound viaduct and a single lane on the northbound viaduct, to facilitate traffic leaving the M6 at Junction 21, in Warrington. There are advance warning signs on all the motorway approaches to the works advising of likely delays, but there is no convenient diversion route using the motorway network. Traffic could be diverted along the M62, M60, M56, and A556, but this would add around 15 miles to 



<P>
</UL></FONT><P><I>14 Apr 2003 : Column 601W</I><P>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>journey lengths, and parts of this diversion are already at full capacity during peak periods. We will continue to monitor traffic patterns closely and keep under review all possible diversion routes to mitigate the effect of the restrictions.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Laboratory testing and investigations into how the bearings have failed is substantially complete. These findings will be used to inform the design process for the replacement of the bearings and associated works required to bring the structure back fully into long-term service. A different kind of bearing has been specified to replace the failed roller bearings. We are content that these bearings will not be susceptible to the same failure as the existing bearings, and that there is no risk of a repetition of the problem. Our thorough maintenance inspection regime revealed the current problems and this regime will continue to monitor the condition of this and our other bridges in future years.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are conscious of the effects that restrictions on the viaduct are having on local businesses, and are working closely with affected stakeholders, in particular Warrington Borough Council, to identify the scale of the impact on the local community. Traffic-count information on both motorways and the local road network is being collected to enable the changes in driving patterns to be quantified and appropriate mitigation measures devised.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>We are currently looking at a phased re-opening of lanes on the northbound viaduct. Initially, the strategy will be to open a second lane on the northbound viaduct at the earliest opportunity. This will enable four running lanes to be reinstated in each direction and should significantly reduce delays for southbound traffic, which is currently restricted to three lanes.</FONT></UL>
<P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>I hope this is helpful. If you would like any further information about this matter, you may wish to contact the Agency's Project Manager for the viaduct repairs, Paul Hupton, Room 703, Sunley Tower, Piccadilly Plaza, Manchester, Ml 4BE (Tel 0161 930 5641).</FONT></UL>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport if he will make a statement on the role of the <i>(a)</i> Mersey Tunnels Police Force and <i>(b)</i> British Transport Police in the context of a major emergency.  [109210]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w32.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Mersey Tunnels Police Force's jurisdiction is the Mersey Tunnels, the approaches and any marshalling area. A written accord exists between the Tunnels Police and Merseyside Police of close co-operation in the event of a major emergency where the tunnels are involved.
<P>

<a name="30414w32.html_para3">The British Transport Police (BTP) play a full part in the British police service within their railways jurisdiction, including the response to any national emergencies.

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what research evidence underpins the work of the Highways Agency in deciding the best environmental protection measures for major trunk road developments, with particular reference to motorway widening.  [108659]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w32.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Jamieson: </B> 
 The Highways Agency's approach in deciding the best environmental protection measures for major trunk road development is founded on advice contained within the Agency's Design Manual for Roads and Bridges. This advice is supported by the results of research undertaken by the Agency and others. Details of the Agency's research activities can be found in the research compendium on the Highways Agency website.

<P>
<a name="30414w33.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Alexander: </B> 
 Training programmes include discussions of the regional implications of policy development as appropriate. The CMPS Partnership Programme takes course members to the regions to see the implementation of policy in action. Other courses have case studies and speakers that examine regional issues. In addition a number of specific programmes are offered which include: "Working with the devolved administrations" and "Devolution in action".

<a name="30414w33.html_para0">All moves of civil servants between departments are made in the best interests of the business of the departments concerned. The mobility of staff between HQ policy and regionally based directorates and Government Offices (GOs) is an important part of departments' HR strategy to deliver the Government's regional agenda. Information on mobility between regions, HQs and GOs is not held centrally.

 The Leeds Teaching Hospitals National Health Service Trust believes this incident to be an extremely rare occurrence. Since then, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority has asked clinics to put new procedures in place to minimise risks even further. The judgment issued last November in the High Court of Justice and the statement issued by the trust made clear that any patient with concerns should discuss them with the trust. Those discussions are a matter for the trust and its patients. So far, five people have raised concerns with the trust, three families have received counselling and one family is considering DNA testing. So far, no one has taken a DNA test.

However, the National Health Service Chief Executive Bulletin Number 7 (March 2003), which was sent to all strategic health authority (SHA) and primary care trust (PCT) chief executives, included a reference to the local election purdah and drew attention to Cabinet Office guidance on the conduct of public servants during election periods.

To ask the Secretary of State for Health if he will list for <i>(a)</i> England, <i>(b)</i> each NHS region and <i>(c)</i> each strategic health authority the proportion of patient occupied floor area not compliant with (i) statutory health and safety regulations and (ii) statutory fire safety regulations in each of the last six years.  [100854]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w36.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 Data on the proportion of patient occupied floor area that is not compliant with statutory health and safety and statutory fire safety regulations, including compliance with the national health service firecode standards, began in 2001&#150;02 and is shown in the tables. Figures are not yet available for 2002&#150;03.




<P>
<P><I>14 Apr 2003 : Column 614W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="30414w36.html_para2">These figures reflect the proportion of the estate that is not fully compliant. Figures are collected for each category separately, and some of the areas covered by one category will also fall into the other. Non-compliant estate will cover a wide variety of conditions, including that which is just below standard. Therefore the figures do not indicate levels of risk, and despite significant proportions being non-compliant, the degree of risk to patients could be very small. Trusts make every effort to remedy any concerns from local enforcement bodies as quickly as possible. This is reflected in the very small numbers of injuries and deaths arising as a result of fires and reportable health and safety incidents in NHS hospitals in England, despite the very high numbers of people who use healthcare premises.

 The Government are committed to action to prevent and manage obesity in children and adults, particularly as it increases the risk of coronary heart disease, diabetes and some cancers. The Government are not considering statutory instruments to reduce obesity. However, action to address obesity is being taken forward through the national service frameworks for coronary heart disease, older people and diabetes. The National Institute for Clinical Excellence have also been asked to develop guidance on identification, prevention and management of obesity and maintenance of weight reduction. The Health Development Agency is setting out the evidence base for effective interventions on the prevention and treatment of overweight and obesity, and the maintenance of weight loss.

[108001]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="30414w38.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hutton: </B> 
 The second tranche of smallpox vaccines is being procured by way of a competitive tendering procedure. A notice was placed in the Official Journal of the European Communities in October 2002, seeking expressions of interest from any company wishing to tender for the contract. No company was approached on an individual basis and invited to bid.
<P>

<a name="30414w38.html_para1">Impfstoffwerke Dessau Tornav Gmbh (IDT) was not approached during the first smallpox vaccine procurement process. It was known from the outset that IDT were a sub-contracting partner of Bavarian Nordic, with whom PowderJect had an exclusive agreement to act as their suppliers for smallpox vaccine.
<P>

<a name="30414w38.html_para2">In selecting the strain for the new smallpox vaccine, the Department of Health sought advice from a specially convened expert subgroup of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI). Experts considered that there was no difference in efficacy between vaccines based upon the Lister strain and those based upon the New York City Board of Health (NYCBH) vaccinia strain as both were known to have been effective in the past.
<P>

<a name="30414w38.html_para3">The JCVI sub-group also concluded that there is a greater body of evidence to demonstrate the efficacy of the Lister strain vaccines against the more severe form of smallpox "variola major" in the past than there is for the NYCBH based vaccines. The view was taken that using a different strain for our new vaccine than that chosen by the United States offered the greatest safeguard in the event of difficulties arising with the production of either new vaccine.

 If we are to ensure protection against passive smoking in public places, we need action nationally and locally both to raise awareness of the risks associated with passive smoking and to increase the prevalence of smoke free environments.

<P>

<a name="30414w38.html_para4">At a national level, the Department has, since 1998, worked with the hospitality industry to reduce the problem of exposure to passive smoking through the development of a Public Places Charter.

We encourage all employers to introduce smoke-free workplaces, but are particularly concerned about the implications such a code would have for the hospitality sector and small businesses. While consideration of the ACoP continues, other action is being taken to encourage the provision of smoke-free areas in public and workplaces. We recognise that making places entirely smoke free is not always going to be possible and encourage in these circumstances other measures to be taken to reduce people's exposure to smoke.
<P>

<a name="30414w38.html_para6">Locally, the Department is funding tobacco control alliances across England to work in communities to raise awareness and to increase the number of smoke-free environments.

 The fall in the percentage of men aged 65 receiving both the basic State Pension and additional State Pension between September 1995 and September 



<P>
<P><I>14 Apr 2003 : Column 635W</I><P>
2002 is due to the reduction in the number of men aged 65 in receipt of net additional State Pension over that period.
<P>

<a name="30414w41.html_para6">Gross additional State Pension entitlement for men aged 65 has been steady in recent years. 92 per cent. of men aged 65 who were receiving a State Pension, received gross additional State Pension in September 1999, compared with 91 per cent. in September 2002.
<P>

<a name="30414w41.html_para7">However, the percentage of men aged 65 in receipt of net additional State Pension is falling because of the increase in excess Contracted Out Deduction cases due to the interaction between the gross additional State Pension and Contracted Out Deduction calculations. There are two reasons for this. The first reason is that there are more early leavers with fixed revaluations coming into retirement. These revaluations were in the past far higher than the current revaluations meaning that more people have excess Contracted Out Deductions than in the past and these excess Contracted Out Deductions themselves are larger. The second reason is that there are relatively low post award upratings experienced in the last few years, which means that it takes longer to reduce the excess Contracted Out Deductions and for the gross additional State Pension to exceed the Contracted Out Deductions.

The project will be comprehensively evaluated and will include research surveys after one and two years. Adviser numbers for the project are yet to be confirmed but will reflect projected client volumes in each ERAD district.

<a name="30414w42.html_spnew6"><B> Malcolm Wicks: </B> 
 Our strategy for tackling fraud focuses on prevention by tightening the gateway to benefits, making stringent checks to verify a person's identity and details of their claim at the outset.
<P>

<a name="30414w42.html_para10">The Department has introduced a range of measures to strengthen the evidence of identity procedures as well as improving the security of National Insurance Numbers (NINOs). People claiming benefits, including housing benefits, and anyone they are claiming benefit for, now have a statutory obligation to prove their identity, as provided for in the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997. This ensures that the NINOs being used belong to the people in question before any benefit is paid.
<P>

<a name="30414w42.html_para11">The Department introduced a Verification Framework in 1998 to help reduce the amount of fraud and error entering local authority benefit administration. The Framework provides local authorities with recommended minimum standards on the checks they must make to verify information provided by customers when assessing claims for housing benefit and council tax benefit. 80 per cent. of local authorities have so far signed up to the Framework.
<P>

<a name="30414w42.html_para12">The Targeting Fraud campaign is part of our long-term strategy to prevent fraud before it happens, underlining our message that benefit fraud will not be tolerated. Evaluation shows that public attitudes are moving in the right direction as a result of the campaign.
<P>

<a name="30414w42.html_para13">Jobcentre Plus is providing a more comprehensive and integrated service for all benefit claimants. One-to-one interviews create a personal environment where the full and accurate details of a claim can be established and customers can be reminded of their responsibility to notify us of changes to their circumstances.
<P>

<a name="30414w42.html_para14">We have made excellent progress in the fight against fraud and error. By March 2002 we had reduced fraud and error in income support and Jobseeker's allowance by 24 per cent. compared to 1998.

In the interim, staff receive a variety of training including a H&S induction course for staff working on Trillium sites, training in how to prevent and calm difficult or aggressive situations for staff with face-to-face contact with customers, and a number of health and safety leaflets and videos which are used to prompt and reinforce safe working practices.
<P>

<a name="30414w44.html_para4">The hepatitis virus is spread by contact with the bodily fluids of an infected person, or by cross blood infection. Therefore in principle, staff working in a DWP business are at low risk of contracting the hepatitis virus through dealing with customers.
<P>

<a name="30414w44.html_para5">The first contact with a customer is normally by telephone. If during the course of the conversation, the staff member becomes aware that the customer has an infectious disease, the computer record is noted to alert staff who subsequently deal with the customer. Customers with the hepatitis virus do however have full access to all the services provided by Jobcentre Plus but, wherever possible, those customers would be dealt with by telephone or post.
<P>

<a name="30414w44.html_para6">Most of the time, staff will be unaware of when a customer has the hepatitis virus. They are therefore encouraged to safeguard their own health at all times by considering their own basic hygiene, and not taking any risks if a customer is bleeding. All blood spillages must be treated as infected regardless of the source. Detailed advice and guidance on how to maintain basic hygiene when dealing with discarded needles/syringes or blood spills is available on the Jobcentre Plus health and safety website.
<P>

<a name="30414w44.html_para7">As with all our records, information held by Jobcentre Plus on a customer's health is protected by the Data Protection Act.

 Joint Working Unit (JWU) was set up in April 2001 as a result of recommendations made following reports produced by Lord Grabiner into the informal economy and the Scampion report countering benefit fraud in the then Department of Social Security.
<P>

<a name="30414w44.html_para12">The main focus of the JWU's work is to promote, encourage and facilitate joined-up working across central government departments and with local authorities and to act as formal stewards of the powers enacted by the Social Security Fraud Act 2001.
<P>

<a name="30414w44.html_para13">Examples of joint activities with other government departments include the Joint Shadow Economy Teams, which are made up of members from this Department, Her Majesty's Customs & Excise and the Inland Revenue. The aim of the teams is to bring those working within the informal economy into the real tax paying economy and keep them there. The Joint Fashion Industry Teams focus on those working in the fashion industry, looking at businesses who are suspected to be potentially, collusive or non-compliant employers. Operation Gangmaster was initially set up to investigate the use of agricultural gangmasters and their

The strategies are then implemented through Joint Operational Boards. JWU also acts as the Departmental contact for local authority groups such as the National Anti-fraud Network, the London Team Against Fraud and the Local Authority Investigation Officers Group. The JWU also supports the implementation of a joined-up intelligence-led investigative process for local authorities. It is currently working with Nottingham and Cardiff authorities by co-locating Intelligence Officers within the East Midlands and Wales Operational Intelligence Units.

This function includes ensuring the Fraud Act powers are understood and implemented effectively, accurately, securely and efficiently. The Unit is also responsible for the management of the relationship with our external information providers, and the provision of advice and expert guidance to front-line staff in both the Department and local authorities.

<a name="30414w46.html_para3">People undertaking residential training are entitled to receive Jobcentre Plus allowance payments. The payments are equal to the rate of benefit that participants were entitled to immediately prior to commencing the training, with an additional &#163;10 premium paid to support the cost of attendance.
<P>

<a name="30414w46.html_para4">For those in receipt of income support or income-based jobseekers allowance prior to receiving Jobcentre Plus allowance payments, an adjustment is made to ensure that entitlement to passported benefits such as housing benefit and council tax benefit are preserved. In addition, for those in receipt of incapacity benefit, special linking rules apply which protect their underlying rate of benefit for up to two years.
<P>

<a name="30414w46.html_para5">These arrangements ensure that people do not lose out financially through undertaking training. We have no plans to change these arrangements at present.

 Secondments are part of the Interchange initiative which promotes the exchange of people and good practice between the civil service and other organisations. All sectors of the economy are involved: Voluntary, Education, Health, Public and Private. Interchange is a key component of the reform agenda. The Modernising Government White Paper committed us to increasing interchange, in particular by bringing in more people on secondment and sending more of our people out.
