 The Sex and Relationships Education (SRE) steering group was established in March 2008 and had its final meeting in October 2008, at which it signed-off its report and recommendations to Government.

The young-people survey was supplemented with a residential event with a small group of UK Youth Parliament members to discuss issues in more detail. The administration of the surveys, the analysis of the results and facilitation of the residential event were undertaken by the Sex Education Forum, which was paid &#163;13,625 to carry out this work; and</p>

 DWP treats temporary and permanent employees in the same way. All employees are paid on the basis of an annual salary and not an hourly rate. The appropriate starting salary is determined by grade and employees are normally recruited onto the minimum of their pay band. Progression up the pay band is based upon the annual pay review. It is possible for employees within a grade to be on different rates of pay but this is normally due to factors such as individual length of service or the effects of pay increases following previous promotion.</p>

1. Interpretation of these data needs to take account of changes in recent years to Jobcentre Plus procedures for taking and handling vacancies. These figures are not fully comparable over time and may not indicate developments in the labour market. A more detailed explanation is available on the nomis website.<br>
2. Notified vacancies include any speculative placings recorded by Jobcentre Plus. Datasets from May 2006 may reflect substantially reduced levels of speculative placings as part of the notified series. Consequently, care should be taken in interpreting time-series data.<br>
3. The stocks of unfilled vacancies reflect more accurately job opportunities available via Jobcentre Plus. In the case of unfilled vacancies, use of the figures on live vacancies is recommended (i.e. excluding suspended vacancies), and this is the default option. Live vacancies may still include some vacancies which have already been filled or are otherwise no longer open to recruits, due to natural lags in procedures for following up vacancies with employers.<br>
4. Data are unrounded.<br>
5. Figures cover only those vacancies advertised through Jobcentre Plus, and so will not capture all available vacancies. Comprehensive estimates of all job vacancies (not just those notified to Jobcentre Plus) are available from the monthly ONS Vacancy Survey since April 2001, based on a sample of some 6,000 enterprises. However, the ONS survey is currently designed to provide national estimates only.<br>

For example, to give customers more convenient access, we have more than half a million vacancies on-line at any time (our website receives close to one million job searches every working day), and new claims to benefit are predominantly taken by telephone with some taken on-line. We remain the largest office network in Government with 747 modern Jobcentres which are supported by 31 contact centres and 79 main benefit processing centres. This has brought our customer facing services together in a more coherent and integrated network and I believe Jobcentre Plus is well-placed to respond to the full range of economic conditions.</p>

Applications for the period include all applications from potential non-resident parents or parents with care as well as, for the period to 14 July 2008 all applications from Jobcentre Plus when a parent with care applies for benefits and their details are sent directly to the Agency. Many of these applications are in fact a change of circumstance on an existing case or are closed prior to a maintenance schedule being set up.<br>
2. Applications resulting in a payment include cases both where a payment has been made through the Agency and where a maintenance direct agreement has been arranged between a non resident parent and parent with care.<br>
3. This table consists of information already published in tables 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 of the Child Support Agency Quarterly Summary of Statistics.<br>
4. From 14 July 2008, new benefit claimants were no longer compelled to use the Child Support Agency. This has resulted in a reduction in the number of applications and potential applications received from Jobcentre Plus and therefore the number of clearances.<br>
5. A significant proportion of applications cleared and which have progressed to payments stage in August and September 2008 will not yet have received the first payment, the number of cases cleared in these months that subsequently receive payment will rise.<br>
6. The figures in this table are a snapshot of the status of cases at the end of September 2008 and are therefore subject to revision.<br>
7. This table counts applications for Child Support. Not all applications become live cases. Information on the number of cases that are progressed clerically is not included in this table.<br>
8. Refers to cases assessed as initially having a positive maintenance liability, which also progress to payment stage, including Maintenance Direct Cases. It does not include cases initially assessed with a positive maintenance liability which are subsequently closed or reassessed as not having a maintenance liability.<br>

 In general, the Foresight report provided helpful reassurance that scientific evidence supports the welfare reforms the Government are and will be making. More specifically, as chapter 8 sets out, its findings fed into Professor Dame Carol Black&#146;s review of the health of the working population of Britain. The Government have accepted her recommendations and will be developing the first ever cross-Government national strategy for mental health and employment, which will help us improve work outcomes for people with mental health problems across the spectrum.

 The national insurance number (NINO) is a unique personal reference number used for tax, national insurance contributions, social security benefits, state pension, tax credit and student loan award purposes. The number links an individual with their tax payments and national insurance contributions to Her Majesty&#146;s Revenue and Customs and the Department for Work and Pensions, and is needed to make a claim to benefit.

 The proposal to change the allowed length of backdating from 12 months to three months was part of a wider package of pensions measures to increase take-up and make benefit processes simpler. Older people will be able to claim pension credit, housing benefit and council tax benefit in one phone call without having to fill in, sign or return any claim forms. This will benefit thousands of pensioners often put off by complicated claim forms and the fear of large amounts of personal information being required. Over the long-term the package results in extra expenditure for pensioners, rising to &#163;250 million per year by 2050.</p>

1. For 2007-08 figures marked with an asterisk (&#147;*&#148;) are not yet available from FRAIMS. Therefore, the information for the four quarters represents FIBS data only. Although this information is recorded on individual cases, it cannot be extracted at a summary level. Work is currently being undertaken to enable this to be done.<br>
2. The same applies to providing data on the number of persons being fined following conviction, although it is not envisaged that average fine values will be able to be generated. The amount of fine imposed is a matter for the courts<br>
3. Information has been included in the above tables showing the number of Administrative Penalties issued.<br>
4. Administrative Penalties are used for less serious cases of fraud; those where the overpayment is below &#163;2,000. Formal cautions are designed to correct claimant behaviour by getting them to admit to the offence. Administrative Penalties, which became available through the Social Security Administration (Fraud) Act 1997, give the claimant the opportunity to avoid prosecution by paying a penalty of 30 per cent. of the overpayment, as well as having to repay the overpayment in full.<br>

Last month Jobcentre Plus took an average of 10,000 new vacancies every working day, with many more coming up through other recruitment channels. Together with the advice and support provided through Jobcentre Plus, this means that most of those who become unemployed can find another job quickly; over half of new claimants leave jobseeker&#146;s allowance within three months and around three quarters leave within six months.</p>

As you know the Secretary of State announced recently an extension of the service.</p>
</ul><a name="90112w0011.htm_brev5"><a name="09011226000951"><ul><p class="tabletext">Employers are made aware of the service in three main ways. First, Jobcentre Plus is informed by the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform when employers notify redundancies of 20 or more employees. We contact each of those employers to discuss the range of support that Jobcentre Plus is able, with its partners, to offer employees, and to decide which measures will be helpful. Second, we provide information through channels that employers use regularly, including: the Jobcentre Plus website www.iobcentreplus.gov.uk/employers, the websites of organisations who help to deliver the rapid response service to employers and a range of leaflets and business/trade media. Third, some employers receive an account management service from Jobcentre Plus in return for their commitment to helping our individual customers to find work. In that context, employers facing difficulties may discuss their needs directly with Jobcentre Plus and appropriate levels of support will be offered.</p>

We also make efforts to identify situations where employers are making fewer than 20 people redundant and to offer rapid response service-style support whenever we consider this likely to be the most effective way of helping the people involved.</p>

 We are currently engaged in the most substantial peacetime naval shipbuilding programme since the first world war. This is centred on the Type 45 destroyers, the Astute class submarines and the future aircraft Carriers. Following on from these we will have the future surface combatant and successor class submarine. This programme will provide the capability the Royal Navy needs to remain one of the world's most powerful maritime forces. As the House knows we have announced that the in-service dates of the carriers will be delayed by one to two years allowing closer alignment for the entry into service of the aircraft which will fly from them. HMS Daring, the first of class of the T45 destroyers, is expected to enter service next year with its five successors at a rate of approximately one a year thereafter. The House will also know that there has been some delay to the Astute programme. We are re-baselining the programme and I will make an announcement in due course. The future surface combatant will follow-on from the carriers, but it is far too early to announce an in-service date. The future surface combatant and the successor class submarines are at the very early stages of design.</p>

 The effect has been very positive. We are pressing ahead with Future Lynx and giving a new priority to the Warrior upgrade and the FRES reconnaissance vehicle. These are all very important programmes for current operations and the nation's future defence capability. We have been able to do this by re-profiling the carrier build programme without any loss to defence capability. Although the in-service dates of the new carrier have been delayed, of which the House is aware, this has allowed us to more closely align their entry into service with the aircraft which will fly off them.</p>

 Jackal was bought for Afghanistan in response to the requirements of that theatre. It provides excellent mobility and firepower and is well adapted for manoeuvring in the Afghan desert.

 The Department for Communities and Local Government and the Devolved Administrations lead on homelessness policy. They have strategies that recognise veterans issues. The Ministry of Defence does not collect on a national basis data on the numbers of homeless veterans. We have however estimated that the proportion of veterans among the non-statutory homeless population, at least in London, has fallen over the last 10 years. Independent research by the university of York published this year has shown that the proportion of veterans among the non-statutory homeless population in London in 2007 was about 6 per cent. This is a much lower proportion than in the mid-1990s when separate research reported a figure of 20-25 per cent.</p>

 The Ministry of Defence and its Agencies have several hundred computer systems in use ranging from corporate IT systems serving thousands of users across the Department and its Agencies, to business area systems serving smaller communities. The following data cover those systems within the MOD and its Agencies where accreditation is centrally controlled by Defence Security and Standards Assurance (DSSA), which are either connected to the MOD networks, or are stand alone above Secret, or are systems that contain significant value to the MOD e.g. those systems that contain particularly sensitive or personal data. It does not include those systems where authority for accreditation has been delegated e.g. stand alone systems with no onward connectivity, and where a further breakdown of information could be provided only at disproportionate cost.</p>

 The information requested is not held. I can confirm that in preparation for Operation TELIC in 2003 large numbers of Reservists were called out, some at very short notice. This was because the rapidly developing situation in Iraq at that time required us to act quickly and we were not able to give as much notice to Reservists as we would have wished. Since then, the mobilisation process now ensures that Reserve units receive advance notice that they will be required to provide individuals to support a specific operation (this can be up to six months notice). More importantly, once Reservists have been selected for mobilisation, we  <br>

However, it must be accepted that the nature of military operations means that inevitably individuals may receive less notice of mobilisation due to rapidly changing requirements.</p>

 The Sellafield site is managed by Sellafield Ltd., a company not a public body. The low level waste repository facility near Drigg is similarly managed by a private company. It was necessary to provide the contractor for this facility with a nuclear indemnity but before doing so I am told that the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) approached the private nuclear insurance market in 2007 in connection with insurance for nuclear liability claims to courts outside the UK and not party to the Paris and Brussels Convention. It became clear from these discussions that commercial insurers were not prepared to quote on these potential liability claims. This established an insurance industry position in principle, in light of which the NDA and its professional advisors concluded that the position that insurers would take on the specific issue at Sellafield was clear and therefore no additional conversations were required.</p>

In assessing economic impact the study has focused on those sectors that are expected to be most significantly impacted by tidal power development. Where possible, impacts have been quantified in terms of employment and gross value added variances.</p>

 The operating framework for the national health service, which sets out the specific business and financial arrangements for the NHS in any given year, first made specific references to supporting carers in the 2008-09 report. The recently published operating framework for 2009-10 goes further. It requires primary care trusts (PCTs) to work with their local authority partners and publish joint plans on how their combined funding will support breaks for carers, including short breaks, in a personalised way.</p>

It is being run by a consortium led by the Expert Patients Programme and includes the three main carers&#146; organisations (Carers UK, Crossroads and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers) and Partners in Policymaking. &#163;4.4 million per year has been allocated to fund this programme.</p>

 My previous answer highlighted the importance of gloves and aprons in supporting good hygiene practices in an influenza pandemic. The quantities and type of gloves and aprons, based on the number and type of patient interactions, are currently being investigated. The large numbers required and the need to ensure availability at point of use strongly favours the creation of a pandemic stockpile (without impacting on the Business As Usual requirement for these products).

 A review of the arrangements under Part IX of the Drug tariff for the provision of stoma and urology items&#151;and related services&#151;in primary care is currently under way. One of the stated aims of the review is that it seeks to make service provided by and payment provision to dispensing appliance contractors (DACs) and pharmacy contractors more equitable. A number of proposals have been put forward in consultation issued by the Department and extending the expensive prescription fee to DACs has been raised by respondents and will therefore be considered. The consultation closed in September 2008; details of the how this work will progress in light of responses and a final impact assessment will be published in the new year.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health to what proportion of primary care trust revenue allocations for the 2009-10 financial year the health inequalities formula has been applied, with the meaning described on page 28 of his Department&#146;s Report of the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation published 8 December 2008.

 One Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) objective is to help to reduce avoidable health inequalities through resource allocation. To achieve this objective, a separate health inequalities formula has been developed which targets funds at the places with the worst health outcomes. This is a more transparent way of contributing towards the reduction in health inequalities through resource allocation, and highlights our commitment to tackling the issue of health inequality.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_402"><a name="90112w0038.htm_para3"><a name="0901137001938">ACRA could not determine the proportion of allocations to apply the health inequalities formula to and left it to ministerial decision. Ministers decided to apply the formula to 15 per cent. of the allocations, excluding the mental health component of the formula (which already includes an adjustment for unmet need) and HIV/AIDS. This keeps the distribution of funding between the most and least deprived areas in line with the previous formula.</p>

 The Adapting to Climate Change programme is responsible for the co-ordination of the Government's work on adaptation in England. In Northern Ireland&#151;as in Scotland and Wales&#151;the devolved Administration is responsible for considering how climate change will affect issues such as health, education and planning.

It focuses specifically on the impacts on, and the need for adaptation by, the public sector in Northern Ireland.</p>

 Bluetongue is caused by a virus within the Orbivirus genus of the family Reorvirades. At present 24 distinct serotypes have been identified as a result of serum neutralisation tests.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_474"><a name="90112w0045.htm_para3"><a name="09011348000839">Bluetongue was first described in South Africa but has since been recognised in most countries in the tropics and sub-tropics. Since 1999 there have been widespread outbreaks of Bluetongue in Greece, Italy, Corsica (France) and the Balearic Islands (Spain). Cases also occurred in Europe in Bulgaria, Croatia, Macedonia, Kosovo and Yugoslavia. These cases have been well north and west of the disease's previous normal distribution. It appears that the virus has spread from both Turkey and North Africa.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_475"><a name="90112w0045.htm_para4"><a name="09011348000840">Bluetongue serotype 8 (BTV-8) was first found in Western Europe when it was detected in the Netherlands in summer 2006, after which it spread to Belgium, Luxembourg, Western Germany and parts of North East France in the same year. In 2007, Northern Europe experienced a dramatic increase of new cases in all existing infected areas, and cases numbered into the many tens of thousands as disease steadily spread across Europe.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_476"><a name="90112w0045.htm_para5"><a name="09011348000841">Uptake of vaccine has varied by region in England and Wales and over time. Sales data from the supply chain suggests that enough vaccine has been sold across the whole of England in 2008 to vaccinate around 60 per cent. of susceptible animals.

<i> [holding answer 18 December 2008]:</i> The Environment Agency published a policy statement on composting and the potential health effects from bioaerosols produced as a result of the composting process in 2001. This set out its requirement for site specific bioaerosol risk assessments (for proposed composting facilities within 250 metres of dwellings or workplaces). The figure represents a precautionary measure and the point at which a site specific bio-aerosol risk assessment is required. The policy applies to all composting activities irrespective of waste type. Kitchen food waste cannot be composted in open windrows.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="90112w0046.htm_para4"><a name="09011348001153">Since then, further work in this area has been undertaken by various parties. This has reiterated that there is insufficient information to determine the risk to human health from bioaerosols from composting. It has recommended that the trigger distance remain in place. This is a precautionary approach, based on research which has shown that bioaerosols should reduce to background levels within 250m. In 2007 the Environment Agency issued a revised policy statement which re-affirmed the need for site specific bioaerosol risk assessments to be carried out.</p>

 The Department for International Development is providing &#163;4.5 million over the period 2006-07 to 2008-09 to the Governance and Transparency Fund to strengthen national civil society in Afghanistan. This is providing assistance&#151;delivered through several international NGOs (including Cranfield University, Relief International and Making Integrity Work) working with a wide range of local partners including the Afghan Civil Society Forum, Integrity Watch Afghanistan, the Afghan Institute for Management Training and Enhancement of Indigenous Capacities, the Killid Group.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_591"><a name="90112w0053.htm_para23"><a name="09011348001999">Delivery of aid through Government of Afghanistan (GoA) channels is the most effective way to build state capacity, ensure value for money, and co-ordinate funding with national priorities. At local level, the National Solidarity Programme (NSP) supports the creation of Community Development Councils (CDCs), which decide, on behalf of their village or community, what is most needed in their area. So far over 21,700 Community Development Councils have been established across Afghanistan with over 45,200 projects under way or completed. NSP is being implemented across the country by 28 local and international NGOs and by UN Habitat.</p>

 Strengthened, transparent and accountable policing and justice systems are critical to protect Afghanistan&#146;s population from insecurity and criminality. The UK is working with the US and EU to reform the Afghan police and funding a bilateral mentoring programme in Helmand province. The UK provides over 50 experts for this purpose. We are working with the Government of Afghanistan (GoA) to strengthen both the formal justice sector (through the GoA&#146;s National Justice Programme) and the informal justice system. Improving people&#146;s access to justice and dispute resolution is a critical aspect of this work, through legal aid and training in legal and rights awareness. The UK&#146;s justice adviser in Helmand has for example established a Women and Children&#146;s Justice Group, helping vulnerable groups to have their rights better protected.</p>

Around 4.5 million people are currently vulnerable to food scarcity with women, children, and the poorest disproportionately affected. In 2008 DFID provided the World Food Programme (WFP) with &#163;11 million to respond to the food crisis. WFP deliver food on the basis of a Food Vulnerability Assessment which ranks districts in terms of food vulnerability and informs delivery priorities accordingly.</p>

DFID funds the HALO trust (an expected &#163;4.6 million in 2008-09) to undertake a demining programme, in order to return hazardous areas to productive use and reduce the threat to the population.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_595"><a name="90112w0053.htm_para27"><a name="09011348002005">DFID Afghanistan has developed a Gender Equality Action Plan to drive awareness and focus on gender issues within our development programme. The plan covers gender-disaggregated results monitoring, explicitly mapping staff and programme resources against gender objectives, and an internal skills development programme. A significant portion of our effort will be focused on building partnerships within the GoA and with other donors&#151;particularly multilateral institutions&#151;to increase their contribution to addressing gender inequality. DFID will lobby UNDP, the World Bank, and the Ministry of Agriculture to strengthen their approaches to gender issues.</p>

 The Government strongly support the development and use of non-animal alternatives where possible, use of animals in scientific procedures will not be licensed if alternative non-animal techniques are available. The National Centre for Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), which the Home Office part-funds, was established in May 2004 and acts as a focal point for research into the 3Rs.

It was argued that in certain projects the severity limits should have been set at substantial rather than moderate. In its judgment issued on 23 April 2008, the Court of Appeal overturned the High Court&#146;s earlier finding that the former Chief Inspector had erred in law in assessing severity limits in the relevant project licence. On this point, the Court found that neither the former Chief Inspector nor the Secretary of State had adopted an erroneous approach to the published Guidance on the Operation of the 1986 Act regarding the assessment of severity limits.</p>

 Many factors influence trends in the use of animals under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, including the economic climate, global trends in scientific endeavour and strategic decisions by funding bodies. The increase in the use of genetically altered strains seen over recent years has also had an impact as advances in genetics open up new and promising avenues of medical research.</p>

 The Home Office has no remit to approve or accredit overseas primate breeding centres. However, the use of any non-human primate under the authority of project licences issued under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 from an overseas source requires prior approval which is given only if the conditions at the breeding centre are acceptable to the Home Office at that time. The Home Office has not visited any primate supply and breeding facility in Cambodia.</p>

In my reply to your question of 17 December 2008, <i> Official Report</i>, column 857W, I advised you that we had previously considered the suitability of a laboratory primate breeding centre in Cambodia, and are reviewing its potential suitability in the light of additional documentation recently received. No approval for requests for the import of non-human primates will be considered until the centre in Cambodia has been visited by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Inspectorate.</p>

 The UK Borders Act 2007 provides for biometric information collected by the Secretary of State to be retained as long as retention of that data is necessary. The specified functions, for example, include functions under the Immigration Acts or for the prevention or detection of an offence. Where an individual leaves the UK permanently, his biometric data will only be retained in circumstances where they continue to be of use for the purposes prescribed in the regulations. Retention of biometric information will therefore enable the UK Border Agency to identify those who may seek to abuse immigration control by returning to the UK in a false identity, and help to assure the identity of those who are entitled to be here.</p>

<meta name="Date" content="12 Jan 2009">

<notus-date day="12" month="1" year="2009" textMonth="Jan"></notus-date><b>12 Jan 2009 : Column 300W</b><br>

<p><a name="stpa_723"><a name="90112w0063.htm_para3"><a name="09011371001058">One of the main benefits of the scheme is the early dialogue between a police officer and a duty prosecutor. This consultation enables those cases that are evidentially weak, which can not be strengthened to meet the Code for Crown prosecutors, to be stopped there and then. Under previous arrangements these cases would have entered the court system. A costly and often ineffective exchange of correspondence between the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and police would follow in an attempt to obtain evidence to support the individual case. A high percentage of these cases were then discontinued later in the process, often after several court appearances and after the police had expended additional and unnecessary effort in trying to obtain evidence.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_724"><a name="90112w0063.htm_para4"><a name="09011371001059">A further benefit has been the improved relationships between police and CPS from close partnership working that has enabled them to better manage other linked initiatives including the Criminal Justice Simple, Speedy Summary (CJSSS) and the Streamlined Process that have improved case management and reduced delay in the courts.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_725"><a name="90112w0063.htm_para5"><a name="09011371001060">There are several other benefits to the police. Dialogue with a Duty Prosecutor enables borderline and more complex cases to be strengthened, and police officers can be directed at that point to supply only what is really required in terms of the evidence needed to support the case. The original business case for statutory charging also points to further benefits for the police through the potential to enhance the police skills base in dealing with evidential issues as a result of early dialogue with the CPS. The business case predicted that around 238,000 cases per annum would be charged by the CPS and a further 20,000 would be stopped at the point of charge. The benefits to the police in the original business case for statutory charging were estimated to be &#163;6.5 million based on this prediction of caseload.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_726"><a name="90112w0063.htm_para6"><a name="09011371001062">In practice the benefits to the police are far greater than this. With 550,000 cases now being considered by the CPS each year, the number of cases that are stopped at the point of charge which fail to meet the code test was 160,000 during 2007-08 which provides substantially more benefit to the police than was originally estimated in the business case.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_727"><a name="90112w0063.htm_para7"><a name="09011371001063">The Government take all aspects of police bureaucracy very seriously and we continue to keep the implications of the charging process, in respect of the amount of paperwork involved, under close review.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_728"><a name="90112w0063.htm_para8"><a name="09011371001064">I have now appointed Jan Berry as our national independent advocate for achieving reductions in police bureaucracy. I have asked her to identify and examine a number of key policing processes and to make recommendations on how these could be reformed to reduce the amount of paperwork generated for officers.

Data at Basic Command Unit level (BCU) are only available from 1999-2000 and the BCUs within the Thames Valley police force area were re-structured in 2005-06. In addition, detection rates data are subject to wide variation where small numbers are involved.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_772"><a name="90112w0066.htm_para2"><a name="09011371001317">Non-sanction detections that contribute to detection rates have fallen in recent years reflecting a significant shift by many forces away from recording detections of crime where no further action is taken. For this reason overall detection rates over time are not fully comparable.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_773"><a name="90112w0066.htm_para3"><a name="09011371001318">From 1 April 2007 the rules governing recording of non-sanction detections were revised to reduce the scope within which they can be claimed to a very limited set of circumstances.</p>

 There has been a significant and sustained reduction in vehicle crime. Since 1997 all vehicle crime is down by 57 per cent. The police recorded a 5 per cent. decrease in the number of cars stolen between 2006-07 and 2007-08. This decrease is also reflected in the British Crime Survey for 2007-08 which shows a reduction of 11 per cent. for vehicle-related thefts compared with 2006-07.</p>

The Crime Strategy outlines our approach that Crime and Disorder Reduction Partnerships, Community Safety Partnerships and other local partners should focus on the issues of greatest priority in each locality through local area agreements. As part of the local area agreement process 98 of the 150 local areas have chosen serious acquisitive crime, of which vehicle crime is an important component, as one of their key priorities for improvement. Central Government are also held to account through Public Service Agreement 23 which measures the progress in tackling serious acquisitive crime.</p>

crime. Current issues the group is addressing include ensuring Penalty Notices for Disorder are issued appropriately and consistently, developing and disseminating good practice guidance for local retailers and crime reduction partnerships to work more effectively together, and designing a new Commercial Victimisation Survey. The introduction of neighbourhood policing teams will also ensure that retailers concerns are reflected in local policing priorities. This will be backed up by guidance from the National Police Improvement Agency, and the reforms set out in the Policing Green Paper &#145;From the neighbourhood to the national: policing our communities together' to give local people, including businesses, a greater say in how their neighbourhoods are policed.</p>

In her letter of 23 July she advised the Committee that there were around 1,650 such individuals who were detained beyond their sentence under immigration powers.

 The UK has for some time been pressing for the adoption of the EU Code of Conduct as a Common Position; we welcome its adoption in December 2008, which changes the code's status from politically to legally binding on all member states. Export licence applications are currently subject to assessment by the Consolidated EU and National Arms Export Licensing Criteria, adopted in 2000 and announced in this House on 26 October 2000. This brought together in one place principles underpinning both UK legislation and the EU Code of Conduct, to ensure a consistent approach to export licensing. This became part of statutory guidance. As export licence applications are made under the Export Control Act 2002, this remains the same with the Common Position. We will not therefore require any significant change to UK legislation to implement the Common Position, and will be in a position to implement it without delay.</p>

 Cyprus is going through its worst water shortage for many years owing to prolonged dry seasons and lower than average rainfall year-on-year. The government of the Republic of Cyprus has looked to counteract this in several ways, including for the short term, imposing restrictions on water usage to conserve the reservoir levels and importing water from Greece. In the longer term, the Government of the Republic of Cyprus is looking at the potential of building more desalination plants to convert sea water into drinking water.</p>

 Independent research indicates that by the end of 2008 Russia will have overtaken the UK to become the second largest internet market in Europe, with 40.3 million internet users, and that there will be 7.4 million households (14 per cent.) with a broadband connection. These numbers are rising rapidly, and it is expected that in 2012 there will be 59 million internet users in Russia, and 21 million households with broadband access.</p>

 In November 2008, the BBC Russian Service broadcast about 45 hours of live news and current affairs programming on its radio service, per week on average, as well as about 34 hours per week of features and other pre-recorded programming, of which about three hours were original production and the remaining hours repeats.

 The political situation in Thailand remains uncertain. The Thai Constitutional Court ruled on 2 December to dissolve three government coalition parties, including the People&#146;s Power Party, and banned executive members of the parties, including Prime Minister Somchai, from politics for five years. The leader of the Democrat Party, Abhisit Vejjavija, was elected Prime Minister on 15 December and is in the process of forming a new government. However, we cannot rule out the possibility of further demonstrations and violent unrest. We continue to urge all parties to resolve their differences peacefully, respecting the rule of law and Thailand&#146;s democratic institutions.</p>

In the absence of agreement, it would be possible for the new owner to ask the Lands Tribunal to overturn the agreement.</p>

In addition to this, North East schemes in the current regional funding allocation being progressed by the Highways Agency include the A69 Haydon bridge bypass, which is in construction and improvements to four A19 junctions through Tyneside. The Highways Agency is also looking at options for addressing congestion problems on the A1 Newcastle Gateshead and Western bypass, but any scheme is likely to be complex and take time to deliver, and must be developed in parallel with the Tyne and Wear authorities&#146; proposals for addressing local traffic problems. In addition we expect, subject to satisfactory business cases, to invest over &#163;70 million over the next five years in major bus priority infrastructure  <br>

<p><a name="stpa_944"><a name="90112w0084.htm_para7"><a name="0901143001677">On rail, the Rail White Paper committed to introducing additional rail capacity to meet peak demand in the Northern cities, including Newcastle. The DfT Rolling Stock Plan published in January 2008 showed that around 42 additional carriages would be available for TransPennine Express and around 182 additional carriages for the Northern franchise. Both these franchises serve the North East. We will also be investing over &#163;290 million on the renewal of the Tyne and Wear Metro system between 2010 and 2019.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what recent discussions he has had with Virgin Trains on passenger capacity on their West Coast Main Line services; what <i> (a) </i>legislative provisions and <i> (b)</i> guidance issued by his Department govern the number of persons who may be accommodated in one unit of passenger rolling stock, with particular reference to health and safety requirements; what sanctions apply to train operating companies which operate services on which such limits are exceeded; and if he will make a statement.

 The Secretary of State met with Sir Richard Branson (Virgin Trains) and Mr. Brian Souter (Stagecoach) on 19 November to discuss the upgrade of the West Coast Main Line. This upgrade of the infrastructure has allowed the new timetable, which started on 14 December 2008, to increase capacity on many of the West Coast Main Line services, most notably a 50 per cent. increase of services between London and Birmingham/Manchester and a 70 per cent. increase for these services on the weekends.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_945"><a name="90112w0084.htm_para8"><a name="0901143001680">There are no legislative provisions regarding crowding on trains. The Office of the Rail Regulator states that there is no legal limit on the number of passengers that can travel in any given train coach. In this, trains differ from other modes of transport&#151;most notably buses and aeroplanes. The heavy engineering involved means that trains are designed to operate effectively and safely even when they are fully loaded to maximum capacity. The number of passengers on board does not affect a train's operating performance or structural integrity.</p>

<i> [holding answer 18 December 2008]:</i> Following public concern about the clustering of betting shops in certain areas and the potential risks this might pose for vulnerable people, the Government outlined plans for DCMS to look into the scope and extent of this issue in &#147;Fair Rules for Strong Communities&#148; which was published on 2 December 2008. DCMS will work with DCLG to investigate the issues and ensure that the licensing and planning systems are thoroughly examined.</p>

They can also review licences to ensure that premises are adhering to their licence conditions and other provisions of the Act, including the three licensing objectives. In addition, betting shops require relevant planning permission from their local authority.</p>

As a Department we also track data across all other grades to check progress. At SCS level we met all of our targets for 2008. For the tracking grades, we made good progress on gender and ethnicity but fell short of our targets for disability.

The Government&#146;s view was that the investigation was likely to conclude that such a sale would constitute unlawful state aid, and accordingly notified the Commission on 3 May 2006 that it did not intend to proceed with a sale on those terms and was looking at alternative models.</p>

 The loans will be available to SMEs within the European Union definition; eligible companies will be able to apply for new loans for a period of up to six months from the inception of the fund. The repayment period will be three years or as agreed with the company within this time frame. In order to qualify applicants must be able to demonstrate that the absence of such funding is exposing the business to the risk of significant short-term contraction or endangering its existence. Loans from the fund will normally only be made where the existing financiers (including bankers) are, at the time of application to the fund, willing to maintain some borrowing facilities on agreed terms. Applicants, through their business plans, should be able to demonstrate a positive impact on jobs, either through job creation or job retention. The fund will be run on a fully commercial basis and will provide individual loans of up to &#163;250,000. Loans from the fund cannot be used to pay down existing borrowings and business assets could be taken as security at the fund manager's discretion although this would not generally extend to personal guarantees or charges over individuals' private residences. If security is not taken, this fact will be reflected in assessing the &#147;commercial&#148; rate of interest to be applied.</p>

 BERR monitors both cement production and the import of both cement and clinker to the UK. These statistics are published both annually in the "Construction Statistics Annual" and through the monthly "Statistics of Building Materials and Components". Currently around 10 per cent. of UK cement is imported, and an almost similar proportion of clinker for cement production. The sector is reporting that there is currently world over-capacity for cement production. Historically, the sector has varied the level of imports to suit their market, commercial and operational decisions. We would expect this to continue.</p>

 The purpose of Constructionline is specifically to reduce duplication of effort by allowing tenderers to answer the key prequalification questions once. After that, tendering organisations only need to ask the project-specific questions of tenderers. This significantly lowers the financial and administrative burdens on SMEs, which make up the vast majority of the construction industry. Constructionline's questions are drawn from HSE's requirements for contractors in respect of health and safety. Constructionline works closely with other industry organisations and Government on health and safety matters, and will be a member of the &#145;Safety Schemes in Procurement Competence Forum (SSIP)&#146; when it is formally launched in April 2009.</p>

 Post Office Ltd. continues to explore and develop opportunities to expand the range of financial and other services offered through post offices. The recently announced Savings Gateway scheme will be available through the post office network and the Government will continue to explore the scope for introducing additional work.

<i> [holding answer 17 December 2008]:</i> None. Postcomm, the industry regulator, in accordance with its statutory responsibilities, carried out a consultation on the management of and access to the postal address file (PAF) in 2006 and published a decision document in April 2007 which laid down new safeguards for the future management of the PAF. The consultation asked all PAF users for comments on a series of proposals designed to make sure that the database is managed and made available to other organisations wishing to use it on fair and reasonable terms. Following the consultation, Postcomm held discussions with Royal Mail, which agreed to implement all the recommendations outlined in the report. These included the setting up of an independent PAF Advisory Board to give independent advice to the Address Management Unit of Royal Mail on behalf of PAF users.

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of a figure, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality.

 Effective public fundraising is important for the charity sector. Professional fundraisers are required to make a statement indicating that they are paid, when fundraising from members of the public. The Charities Act 2006 has strengthened this requirement, and professional fundraisers must now also state the amount of remuneration they receive in connection with an appeal. It also provides for a new licensing regime for public charitable collections and the Office of the Third Sector has announced plans to undertake independent research into the costs and benefits of implementing this regime.</p>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180 to 220<br>
<i> Key Coefficient of Variation (CV) </i><i> (%) Statistical robustness</i><br>
* 0 = CV &lt;5 Estimates are considered precise.<br>
** 5 = CV &lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise.<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt; 20 Estimates are considered acceptable.<br>
**** CV = 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes.<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>
It should be noted that the aforementioned estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels, mobile home sites etc.).<br>

Guide to Quality:<br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>
<i> Key Coefficient of Variation (CV) </i><i> (%) Statistical robustness</i><br>
* 0 = CV &lt;5 Estimates are considered precise.<br>
** 5 = CV &lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise.<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt; 20 Estimates are considered acceptable.<br>
**** CV = 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes.<br>
<i> Note</i>:<br>
It should be noted that the above estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels, mobile home sites etc).<br>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

** 5 = CV &lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise.<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt;20 Estimates are considered acceptable.<br>
**** CV = 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes.<br>

<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>
<i> Key Coefficient of Variation (CV) </i><i> (%) Statistical robustness</i><br>
* 0 = CV &lt;5 Estimates are considered precise.<br>
** 5 = CV &lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise.<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt;20 Estimates are considered acceptable.<br>
**** CV = 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes.<br>
<i> Note:</i><br>
 It should be noted that the above estimates exclude people in most types of communal establishment (e.g. hotels, boarding houses, hostels, mobile home sites etc.)<br>

<sup>(4)</sup> Coefficients of Variation have been calculated for the latest period as an indication of the quality of the estimates, as described below:<br>
<i> Guide to Quality:</i><br>
The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within -/- twice the CV - for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220<br>
<i> Key Coefficient of Variation (CV) (%) Statistical robustness</i><br>
 * 0 = CV &lt;5 Estimates are considered precise.<br>
** 5 = CV &lt;10 Estimates are considered reasonably precise.<br>
*** 10 = CV &lt;20 Estimates are considered acceptable.<br>
**** CV = 20 Estimates are considered too unreliable for practical purposes<br>
<i> Notes:</i><br>
It should be noted that the country of birth question in the LFS:<br>
excludes those who have not been resident in the UK<br>
excludes students in halls who do not have a UK resident parent<br>
excludes people in most other types of communal establishment (e.g. Hotels, boarding houses, hostels, mobile home sites etc)<br>
is grossed to population estimates that only include migrants staying for twelve months or more<br>
microdata are grossed to population estimates consistent with those published in Autumn 2007, meaning estimates are not entirely consistent with the figures published in the monthly Labour Market Statistics First Release.<br>

The Coefficient of Variation (CV) indicates the quality of an estimate, the smaller the CV value the higher the quality. The true value is likely to lie within +/- twice the CV&#151;for example, for an estimate of 200 with a CV of 5 per cent. we would expect the population total to be within the range 180-220.<br>

This power can be exercised by the Commission for the purposes of carrying out its functions but does not authorise the use of force to enter premises. However, it is a criminal offence to intentionally obstruct the Commission from entering premises.</p>

These powers and the associated safeguards are set out in schedule 1 of the Bill, which proposes to insert a new schedule 19A into the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000.</p>

The Commission must also satisfy a justice of the peace that documents are on any premises that were withheld following an earlier request made under paragraph 2(2) of the schedule or that are otherwise relevant to the investigation.

We are also working with the United Kingdom Human Trafficking Centre to develop support services for victims trafficked into forced labour.</p>

 Clause 11 of the Political Parties and Elections Bill would reintroduce the long-standing principle which existed prior to the passage of the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000 that all spending used by candidates for the purposes of their election campaign should count towards the candidate spending limit (often referred to as &#147;triggering&#148;).</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1119"><a name="90112w0116.htm_para1"><a name="09011437004977">The legislation defining candidate spending has been updated since the previous system of triggering was in place and clause 11 does not propose a return to the precise wording that existed prior to 2000. Section 76 of the Representation of the People Act 1983 ("the 1983 Act") described candidate expenses as those "on account of or in respect of the conduct or management of the election". This wording was removed from section 76 of the 1983 Act by section 132 of the 2000 Act. Section 27 of the Electoral Administration Act 2006 ("the 2006 Act") inserted new section 90ZA into the 1983 Act, which clarifies that "election expenses" in relation to a candidate at an election means any expenses incurred at any time in respect of any matter specified in Part 1 of Schedule 4A of the 1983 Act (also inserted by section 27 of the 2006 Act) which is used for the purposes of the candidate's election after the date when he becomes a candidate at the election. A person is defined as a &#145;candidate' according to section 118A of the 1983 Act.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1120"><a name="90112w0116.htm_para2"><a name="09011437004978">Clause 11 of the Bill would not restore the previous wording of the 1983 Act.

The key problems which the Neill Report identified were around which items of expenditure should count towards election expenses and which should not; and when a constituency campaign is to be deemed to have begun. These problems were identified again in the judgement of the England and Wales Court of  <br>

Appeal (Criminal Division) in the case of Fiona Jones Desmond Whicher, R v. [1999], which quoted from the Neill Report. The then Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales, Lord Bingham of Cornhill, noted that there was no simple and decisive test to determine whether an expense was or was not to be regarded as en election expense within the meaning of the Act at the time.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1122"><a name="90112w0116.htm_para4"><a name="09011437004980">In the case of which items should count towards election expenses, Neill specifically criticised Schedule 3 of the 1983 Act. That Schedule provided a form of return for candidates to complete their declaration as to election expenses. As Neill noted, however, the form largely reproduced the equivalent Schedule in the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Act of 1883 and was therefore considerably out of date. Neill recommended that the Schedule should be revised such that it contained a full and up to date list of items of expenditure (recommendation 46). The 2000 Act accordingly repealed Schedule 3 of the 1983 Act. The 2006 Act inserted new Schedule 4A into the 1983 Act. This Schedule lists in detail the matters which are, and are not, to be regarded as election expenses, providing far greater clarity for candidates than under the previous system of triggering that existed before 2000.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1123"><a name="90112w0116.htm_para5"><a name="09011437004981">In the case of determining when a constituency campaign is deemed to have begun, Neill noted the considerable doubt on this point for candidates and political parties, as the 1983 Act made no attempt to define the period of the election or the election campaign. However, Neill concluded "despite the difficulties, it is possible for parties, nationally as well as locally, to distinguish in most situations between election and non-election spending".</p>

<p><a name="stpa_1124"><a name="90112w0116.htm_para6"><a name="09011437004982">Neill therefore recommended that the precedent established by the 1983 Act should continue to be followed, and that expenditure limits should continue to be set in terms of the purpose for which expenditure is incurred rather than in terms of any specified time period (recommendation 51). It is this principle, specifically endorsed by the Neill Report, which clause 11 of the Bill seeks to restore with regard to the candidate spending limit.</p>

 As I wrote in a letter sent to Members of Public Bill Committee on the Political Parties and Elections Bill on 19 November 2008, a copy of which I have placed in the Library of the House, depending on the circumstances of the case, and depending on the nature of the expenditure that led to a complaint, if an MP was found guilty of abusing the Communications Allowance then the follow-on effect might well be that the expenditure would have triggered that MP's candidate expenditure limit. That would be the case where the Communications Allowance is used to fund expenditure on a matter listed in schedule 4A for the purposes of promoting his or her election as a candidate at a general election. However, being found guilty of breaching the rules regarding use of the allowance would not automatically lead to a triggering of an MP's election expenses.</p>

 Officials from National Offender Management Service (NOMS) and the Department for Work and Pensions are working in partnership to ensure offenders receive financial assistance and benefits without unnecessary delay once released. Where there is a delay in receiving benefit claimed for, this is normally due to incorrectly completed benefit application forms or lack of formal identification. NOMS is now assisting offenders in gaining formal identification as part of normal resettlement processes and works closely with visiting Jobcentre Plus officials to ensure timely and accurate applications are made wherever possible. NOMS has also embarked on a number of other initiatives to assist in this process such as; exploring the benefits of arranging bank accounts, providing money management advice, financial capability training and assistance with setting up a Freshstart interview with Jobcentre Plus on release.</p>
