<a name="00203w01.html_wqn0"><B> Mr. Geraint Davies: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions if he will make a statement on the report and recommendations of the Review Body on Senior Salaries on the Greater London Authority.  [107864]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w01.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Prescott: </B> 
 The Review Body on Senior Salaries report on the initial pay, expenses, pensions and severance arrangements for the Mayor of London and members of the London Assembly is published today. Copies are available in the Libraries of the House. The Prime Minister and I are grateful to the Chairman and Members of the Review Body for their work.
<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para0">The main recommendations of the Review Body with regard to pay are:

</TABLE>


<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para1">The Review Body recommended that pay levels should be uprated annually beginning on 1 April 2000 by the same percentage as the average of the movements in the mid-points of the nine senior civil service pay bands below permanent secretary and that an independent review of pay levels should take place in 2002 and then at intervals of three years.
<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para2">The Review Body also recommended that a Mayor of London, Deputy Mayor or an Assembly member who is also an MP, an MEP or a salaried Office-Holder in the House of Lords should receive an abated salary in respect of his or her GLA role equal to one third of the relevant GLA salary; the Mayor, Deputy Mayor and Assembly members' pension arrangements should be provided through the Local Government Pension Scheme; and that severance payments should be made only to the Deputy Mayor, and only if he or she loses that role other than at an election. The Review Body also expressed the view that members of the Authority should receive travel and subsistence payments similar to those available to staff of the Department for the Environment, Transport and the Regions.
<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para3">The Government have decided to accept the Review Body's recommendations on pay, expenses, pensions and severance arrangements in full. We recognise that it has been extremely difficult to evaluate the weight of responsibilities for unique positions which do not yet exist. In particular, the Review Body concluded that there was currently insufficient evidence about additional 



<P>
<P><I>3 Feb 2000 : Column: 648W</I><P>
responsibilities of the Chair of the Assembly and of membership of a functional body to reach a view on whether there should be additional remuneration for these roles.
<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para4">The Government acknowledge the uncertainties, and have therefore decided to invite the Review Body to carry out an early review of remuneration and pensions. This review would begin nine months after the new Authority became fully operational. It would therefore progress on a basis of fact and experience rather than on the inevitable current basis of anticipation of roles and responsibilities. The statutory guidance on ethical standards, issued under section 66 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999, will require the Authority to have due regard to the SSRB's recommendations in deciding future salaries.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what action he is taking to address the concerns of game managers and pigeon fanciers with respect to predation of game birds and racing pigeons by birds of prey; and if he will make a statement.  [108604]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The issues arising from the recovery of some bird of prey populations and their impact on game bird and moorland management and on racing pigeons have been addressed by the UK Raptor Working Group.
<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para5">This group, jointly chaired by my Department and the Joint Nature Conservation Committee, and comprising experts from the fields of bird conservation, game management and pigeon racing, has funded significant research and considered information from a wide range of sources including leading authorities and relevant specialists. The group has now agreed a package of recommendations and submitted its final report to UK Ministers. Copies are available in the House Libraries.
<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para6">I welcome the publication of these recommendations and hope they will help provide an integrated solution to the problems presented by birds of prey to game bird managers and pigeon fanciers. Implementation of these recommendations will of course be a matter for the devolved administrations and I will be asking English Nature for advice with respect to implementation in England.

<a name="00203w01.html_para7">This document is the final part of a series of publications associated with the Water Industry Act 1999. It comprises:

<a name="00203w01.html_para11">The proposals in this document deliver the Government's key water charging objectives: fair and affordable water charges--particularly for vulnerable customers--and the sustainable use of water supplies and protection of the aquatic environment.
<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para12">The guidance sets out the Government's approach to key water charging issues. It encourages water companies to develop charging systems that are fair and affordable, and take account of environmental considerations. Customers should expect stable and predictable bills, and charges should be transparent and closely related to services provided.
<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para13">The Water Industry (Charges) (Vulnerable Groups) Regulations 1999 offer new, additional protection to customers who might face hardship affording their bills because they use large amounts of water for essential purposes and pay on a measured basis. Customers will qualify for assistance if they are in receipt of income related benefits or tax credits (Income Support, Income-based Jobseeker's Allowance, Working Families Tax Credit, Disabled Person's Tax Credit, Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit) and either

<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para14">Customers in these circumstances will be entitled to pay the average charge for the company that supplies them, rather than their actual measured charge. This represents a significant new step to tackle water poverty.
<P>

<a name="00203w01.html_para15">The Water Industry Act 1999 restricts water companies' powers to impose meters on customers. However, the Government accept that metering may be acceptable in some circumstances, such as when a customer is using a large volume of water for discretionary purposes. The Water Industry (Prescribed Conditions) Regulations 1999 therefore set out conditions when companies will continue to be permitted to require customers to have water meters. These include circumstances such as automatic garden watering, automatic replenishment of a large pond or swimming pool, very large baths, high consumption showers and certain types of water softening unit. These Regulations also give the Secretary of State power to permit metering in designated areas of water scarcity. No such areas are designated at present. Any application for designation would need to be considered by the Secretary of State, consulting the Director General of Water Services, the Environment Agency and bodies representing customers in the relevant area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w01.html_spnew3"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 A start will be made in 2000-01 on 13 of the 37 schemes in the targeted programme of improvements announced in "A New Deal for Trunk Roads in England"--six more than previously planned. The acceleration of six schemes by bringing their starts forward from 2001-02 reflects our commitment to modernising the country's transport system. All the schemes in the targeted programme were assessed using the New Approach to Appraisal against our criteria of safety, environmental impact, economy, accessibility and integration.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what progress has been made with the secondary legislation setting out detailed arrangements for the Greater London Authority elections.  [108703]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w02.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Hill: </B> 
 I intend to lay a number of orders and the elections rules to give effect to the following decisions.
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para0"><i>Early voting</i>
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para1">I shall shortly be laying the necessary secondary legislation to allow voters who wish to vote in person, but cannot do so on 4 May, to vote early. The order will provide for voting in one or two locations in each borough on 27, 28 and 29 April 2000, between 7 am and 9 pm daily. The precise locations of early voting polling stations will be publicised locally and voters will complete ballot papers in the normal way. This will be a new option, and is in addition to postal and proxy voting, which will also be available.




<P>
<P><I>3 Feb 2000 : Column: 651W</I><P>

<i>Elections rules</i>
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para2">Consultation on the detailed elections rules is now complete and these will be laid shortly. As well as providing for all aspects of the running of the elections these will provide for the hours of polling to be between 7 am and 9 pm. They will also provide for the following levels of deposits and signatures for candidates.
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para3">Each Mayoral candidate will be required to gather 330 signatures--ten from each London borough and the City of London--in support of his or her candidacy. They will also be required to pay a deposit of &#163;10,000, which would be forfeited if a candidate fails to obtain 5 per cent. of the vote.
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para4">Assembly candidates will not be required to collect signatures in support of their candidacies. In respect of deposits, there will be different arrangements for the different categories of candidate. Parties with a list of candidates, and independent candidates contesting London-wide list seats, will be required to pay a deposit of &#163;5,000, which will be forfeited if they fail to obtain 2.5 per cent. of the vote.
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para5">Candidates contesting Assembly constituencies will pay a deposit of &#163;1,000 which will be forfeited if they fail to obtain 5 per cent. of the vote.
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para6"><i>Election expenses</i>
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para7">Following consultation on the proposed limits for candidates' and third parties' election expenditure, I will lay a draft order shortly setting out the following maximum spending limits for the GLA elections:
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para8"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;420,000 per mayoral candidate;

</FONT></UL>
<a name="00203w02.html_para13"><P>
<BR>
<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>&#163;1,800 per third party supporting or opposing assembly constituency candidates.
<P>
</FONT></UL>
<a name="00203w02.html_para14">These limits will enable candidates and parties to fight effective campaigns, at either the London-wide or the constituency level.
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para15">Some political parties have expressed concern that candidates in GLA elections, in common with local elections generally, are not entitled to a free mailshot. We believe that a free London-wide mailing would be particularly vulnerable to abuse by unscrupulous candidates seeking to gain advertising at the tax payers expense for the cost of a deposit. Following the consultation exercise we have lowered the proposed limits to provide a more level playing field for less well resourced parties and independent candidates, and will allow parties with both a Mayoral candidate and a London-wide list to pay for a single election mailshot to every London household should they wish to.
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para16">The order is subject to affirmative resolution in each House of Parliament. If approved, the limits will come into force on the day after the day on which the order is made. Candidates' limits will cover any expenditure as defined in section 76 of the Representation of the People Act 1983.




<P>
<P><I>3 Feb 2000 : Column: 652W</I><P>

<i>Disqualification</i>
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para17">An order will be laid in draft before each House of Parliament specifying the offices and appointments, the holders of which will be disqualified from being elected or being the Mayor or an Assembly member. This order supplements the disqualification arrangements already contained in section 21 of the Greater London Authority Act 1999 and other legislation.
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para18">We intend the GLA to be an inclusive authority, which works in partnership with other organisations on London's behalf. We are therefore keeping to a minimum those offices and appointments which a person will not be able to combine with membership of the GLA. The order will specify only those offices which are required to be or seen to be politically impartial; are with a body which will scrutinise the GLA or one of the functional bodies; or are with a body which may exercise a quasi-judicial role over the GLA or a functional body. I have today placed in the Library of the House a list of offices and appointments which will be designated in the order. Conflicts with public offices, whether of interest or of time pressures, will also be covered in the statutory guidance on ethical standards to which the Authority will be required to have regard. I intend to publish this guidance shortly.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w02.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> Water quality has been extensively tested at many points and at various times along the River Ribble and elsewhere as part of the comprehensive programme of studies into problems with compliance with the EC Bathing Water Directive along the Fylde coast. The main purpose of the programme has been to determine the inputs of faecal contamination to the area, and their patterns of dispersion and impacts on bathing waters, in order to establish the need for further improvements to the sewerage infrastructure. Measurements have also been taken to develop a water quality model of the River Ribble and its estuary. I will arrange for the Environment Agency, North West Region to send my hon. Friend a copy of their report on these issues.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w02.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> Recently completed investment schemes have improved water quality in the Ribble Estuary, although these have not yet brought compliance with the EC Bathing Water Directive along the Fylde coast. The Environment Agency considers that further improvements are required to treatment and storm water management at Wigan/ Skelmersdale and to stormwater management at Southport and combined sewer overflows in Preston to ensure compliance at Southport and Lytham with the EC Bathing Water Directive. The Agency is currently investigating the possibility that compliance problems in the Blackpool area are caused by contaminated groundwater from beneath the town.

 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> The Environment Agency has monitored each of the significant discharges in the area thought to impact on bathing water quality along the Fylde coast. The main focus of discussion has been on steps to reduce sewage discharges operated by North West Water but the Agency has been in contact with other dischargers where it appears that they may be implicated in the problems of compliance with the EC Bathing Water Directive.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what assurances he has received from North West Water and the Environment Agency that the latest investment programme to improve bathing water quality along the Fylde coast will result in compliance with EU directive standards.  [106368]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w02.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> The completed improvement schemes and further planned improvements are considered necessary to ensure compliance with the EC Bathing Water Directive along the Fylde coast. Whether these works will be sufficient to ensure compliance or whether additional measures will be required will be clearer as the results of current investigations into the causes of failure become available and are assessed.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what recent assessment he has made of the possible contribution of animal and avian waste to bathing water quality along the Fylde coast.  [106363]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w02.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> The Environment Agency's current assessment is that animal and avian waste is unlikely to make a significant contribution to the overall bacterial load, in terms of compliance with the EC Bathing Water Directive. However, the Agency is undertaking further studies to refine this assessment.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w02.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> Recent measures required of North West Water and completed in 1999 were the provision of ultra-violet disinfection in Southport, Hesketh Bank, Preesall and Preston sewage treatment works; a substantial increase in the stormwater storage associated with the Fylde tunnel; improved stormwater arrangements at Fairhaven/Lytham, Hesketh Bank, Harrowside and Preston works; and closure of the works at Hambledon with transfer of flows to Fleetwood.
<P>

<a name="00203w02.html_para22">Further works required as soon as possible include treatment enhancement and stormwater management at Southport and combined sewage overflows in Preston. All these measures are considered necessary to ensure bathing water compliance in the area.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w02.html_spnew10"><B> Mr. Meacher </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 24 January 2000]:</i> The Environment Agency estimate that the contamination load of agricultural runoff and other non-water company discharges into the River Ribble is small, in terms of compliance with the EC Bathing Water Directive, compared to discharges by North West Water. But to determine whether contamination from animals can be significant in some circumstances, studies are being undertaken to discover the geographical origin of animal faeces, including the forensic examination of washed-up material to determine the diet of the producer animal; and bacterial "fingerprinting" to determine whether there are any types characteristic of particular animal species.

 Steadier growth in the economy and the introduction of expenditure plans that cover a full three years will free the construction industry from the damaging stop-go cycle that has so constrained its performance in the past. It will also provide a more secure base for innovation and improved profitability in the future. The Government are also encouraging the industry to radically improve its performance through implementing the recommendations of the Construction Task Force as set out in "Rethinking Construction".
<P>

<a name="00203w03.html_para1">It is too soon to assess what impact these initiatives are having on the long term performance and profitability of the industry. However, as a part of our drive to encourage radical change, we published last April the first set of standard, industry wide, key performance indicators (KPIs).

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w04.html_spnew2"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The Civil Aviation Authority and other accredited UK and international bodies have published requirements and guidelines concerning aircraft wiring and the prevention of in-flight fire and smoke for many years.
<P>

<a name="00203w04.html_para1">The UK airworthiness codes already prescribe mandatory requirements for electrical wiring design and installation which are intended to prevent the aircraft as whole being put at risk in the event of wiring faults or serious malfunction of the electrical system or any connected equipment. In particular, there is a requirement that wiring must not be able to create a fire or smoke hazard under temporary or continuous fault conditions. Demonstration of compliance with these requirements is required for all aircraft. Also, British Standards Institute and European aeronautical cable specifications and standards define flammability and toxicity requirements for aircraft wiring, as well as defining standardised methods of testing aircraft wire.
<P>

<a name="00203w04.html_para2">In addition to the mandatory requirements, CAA have also published guidelines on electrical wiring and electrical protection. For example, the CAA Civil Aircraft Airworthiness Information and Procedures (CAP562) contain instructions on inspection and testing of electrical circuits, installation and maintenance of electrical cables, protection against electrostatic discharge, care and maintenance of electrical power supplies, electrical cable failure and procedures for resetting thermal circuit breakers.
<P>

<a name="00203w04.html_para3">These requirements and guidelines are well established and well known throughout the UK aviation industry. In addition, the CAA proposes to submit to the Joint Aviation Authorities by September 2000 a consolidated version of its established guidelines concerning aircraft wiring and the prevention of in-flight fire and smoke, for promulgation throughout the JAA member states.

 The UK Confidential Human Factors Incident Reporting Programme (CHIRP) is run by the CHIRP Charitable Trust. The January 2000 edition of CHIRP's publication "Feedback" contains a "Key Word analysis" of reports received in 1999, which indicates that the key words 'commercial pressure' appeared in 7 per cent. of the 141 reports received that year in the flight deck category. The analysis notes that in view of the voluntary nature of the reporting process, the results have no statistical significance.

To ask the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions what steps the Government are taking to ensure that rudders of UK-registered 737 aircraft are fault free.  [108026]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w04.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 The United States' Federal Aviation Administration is the regulatory authority responsible for overseeing the safe design of Boeing aircraft and for issuing information necessary to maintain their continued airworthiness. The Federal Aviation Administration has issued Airworthiness Directives covering both inspections of the Boeing 737 rudder system as well as revisions to flight crew operating procedures. These directives are intended to reduce the likelihood of possible rudder system faults compromising the aircraft's safety.
<P>

<a name="00203w04.html_para4">The United Kingdom Civil Aviation Authority requires that any Federal Aviation Administration directives applicable to Boeing 737 aircraft are complied with by UK operators and carries out regular surveys to monitor, and if necessary, enforce compliance. Although the Authority reserves the right to vary Federal Aviation Administration directives for the UK fleet, it has had no cause, to date, to impose additional requirements with respect to the Boeing 737 rudder system.

[108032]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w04.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mullin: </B> 
 There are no international standards governing the qualifications of civil aviation authority inspectors, but the International Civil Aviation Organisation "Manual of Procedures for Operations Inspection, Certification and Continued Surveillance" recommends that to carry out a flight inspection of an aircraft, an inspector should be qualified in that type of aircraft.
<P>

<a name="00203w04.html_para5">In the United Kingdom, all helicopter flight inspections, together with technical evaluations of the helicopter, equipment, and operation are undertaken by Civil Aviation Authority Flight Operations Inspectors who possess a current Airline Transport Pilots Licence (Helicopters), and have had considerable commercial operating experience often including management or training duties. Not only are proficiency checks undertaken, but regular line flying duties in a variety of roles are carried out by all helicopter Flight Operations Inspectors.
<P>

<a name="00203w04.html_para6">The CAA has 13 specialist helicopter Flight Operations Inspectors.




<P>
<P><I>3 Feb 2000 : Column: 662W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="00203w04.html_para7">There are some aspects of helicopter operations which can be audited or checked by suitably trained Inspecting Staff, who nevertheless do not hold a professional helicopter pilots licence. For example examination of pilots duty hours and training records would not necessarily require professional piloting expertise in order to evaluate their validity and integrity.

<P>
<a name="00203w07.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Caborn </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 2000]:</i> The Government are aware that the tariff preferences available under the Lome Convention are incompatible with the rules of the WTO in so far as they discriminate between developing countries and thus require a waiver from GATT Article I. The current waiver expires in February 2000 along with the Convention itself and will have to be renewed by agreement with other WTO member governments for the preferences to continue. We strongly support the WTO, which is why we argued for a new, WTO-compatible approach to EU trade relations with Lome countries after the current Convention expires.
<P>

<a name="00203w07.html_para0">Both the EU and our Lome partners have agreed in principle with this approach, which will enter into force after a transitional period of eight years, during which time the current trade arrangements will be rolled over, and a new WTO waiver sought for this rollover period. The Government believe that this approach will give Lome countries the best chance of integrating more fully into the multilateral trading system, thereby promoting their sustainable development and contributing to poverty eradication.

To ask the Prime Minister what derogations Her Majesty's Government have applied for in respect of the United Kingdom's membership of the Council of Europe and its hosting of appeal courts empowered to uphold the death penalty in other countries; and if he will make a statement.  [107625]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w08.html_spmin0"><B>The Prime Minister</B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2000]:</i> The United Kingdom has no derogations in respect of its membership of the Council of Europe. In cases where the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council acts as an appeal court for an independent state, including states which impose the death penalty, it does so as an integral part of the judicial structure of that state rather than of the United Kingdom. It is for these states to decide whether they wish to continue to use the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council as their final court of appeal. Her Majesty's Government cannot interfere in the judicial processes of another state. But this in no way implies that the United Kingdom condones the death penalty: the United Kingdom regularly raises these issues, bilaterally and with European Union partners, with such states pressing their Governments to abolish the death penalty.

 We decided to participate in the operation in East Timor in support of the decisions of the international community and our long standing ally and friend Australia. The decision to deploy the Gurkhas to East Timor was taken principally because they were based in Brunei and therefore already acclimatised and able to deploy quickly. Moreover, some Gurkhas also speak Malay, which is closely related to the Indonesian language and was of considerable use during the operation. The deployment of Brunei based Gurkhas also minimised potential overstretch implications.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w08.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 2000]:</i> I assume that the question relates to walk-on equipment which may be carried on the Chinook Mk2, such as binoculars, cameras and computers. The presence of such equipment would depend on the purpose of a particular flight and no general statement of value would be meaningful.
<P>
<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Defence what recommendations in the Chinook Mk2 test were made on the use of in-flight UHF transmitters and walk-on equipment; and if they were written into the CIA release.  [108053]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w08.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 2000]:</i> It was recommended that, because of the vulnerability of the automatic flight system to the Ultra High Frequency band, particular care should be taken when introducing UHF on-board transmitters to the Chinook as Special Trial Fits or walk-on equipment. The Controller Aircraft Release for the Chinook Mk2 in January 1994 stipulated that no carry- on-board equipment was cleared for use. No electronic equipment had been introduced to the aircraft by Special Trial Fit.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w08.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Spellar </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 2 February 2000]:</i> The Ministry of Defence is currently engaged with the Womens' Royal Voluntary Service (WRVS) in negotiating the renewal of their contractual relationship. The WRVS, like the Service Sound and Vision Corporation, the Navy, Army and Air Force Institute and the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association (Forces Help), is a charitable-based organisation working in partnership with the Services. WRVS employees, working with the Army are line managed and appraised annually by their National Director and the Commanding Officer of the Unit to which they are assigned. The WRVS maintains a regular dialogue with the Directorate of Personal Services (Army). This process ensures that the WRVS is apprised of developments in Welfare Policy and practices in the Army.
<P>

<a name="00203w08.html_para8">Welfare is a function of the Chain of Command within the Army. The Army Welfare Service (AWS) fulfils only one part, albeit an important part, of the overall delivery of welfare support within the Army. They are an in-house organisation providing specialist support and advice to Army individuals, their dependent families and the Chain of Command. Their activity is focused on the LAND Command component of the Army, although they can provide a point of contact for the Army based elsewhere. Where the AWS operate alongside the WRVS, they do so in partnership, each bringing particular and complementary skills to the overall welfare delivery. There is no direct line management relationship between the AWS and the WRVS.

<P>

<UL><FONT SIZE=-1>Healthy life expectancy combines mortality and morbidity into a single index. Using the General Household Survey question on self-reported general health, ONS has calculated that in England in 1995 <sup>1</sup>  a woman aged 65 could expect to live a further 13.2 years in good or fairly good health, and a man aged 65 could expect to live a further 11.4 years in good or fairly good health. This compares with total life expectancy figures at age 65 of 18.4 and 14.8 years for women and men respectively.</FONT></UL>

 There are currently no plans to change the overall departmental expenditure limit of HM Customs and Excise.

<P>
<a name="00203w13.html_spnew1"><B> Ms Hodge: </B> 
 Transferring the responsibility for child minding and day care regulation to the new and distinct Early Years Directorate in Ofsted will enable the best of the present regulatory system for child care to be brought together with that for nursery education inspections. This will help create greater coherence and integration and will lead to improvements in the quality of child care and early years education services. The new Directorate will deliver its services through a national and regional structure supported by a local presence.
<P>

<a name="00203w13.html_para0">Establishing new national standards will ensure consistency across the country. The present system has led to widely varying interpretations; a national framework delivered at a local level will ensure greater clarity and consistency for providers, including child minders. In addition, local authorities will continue to provide training, guidance and advice to child minders and prospective child minders to encourage them to meet the relevant standards for registration.
<P>

<a name="00203w13.html_para1">Parents will have access to open information from Ofsted reports and this will enable them to make better informed choices. This will ensure that parents have greater trust and confidence in the quality of the child care services available locally.

 Officials from my Department meet from time to time with the British Council, who administer the Montserrat Emergency Award Scheme, to discuss the scheme's effectiveness, guidance on eligibility criteria, numbers of Montserrat students involved and the associated funding required. The scheme began in 1997, following volcanic activity on Montserrat, and provides students with bursaries to help meet the costs of their higher education tuition in England and Wales. My Department is providing &#163;1.322 million to support 198 students in the current financial year.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w14.html_spnew2"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 The Government are well aware that there is widespread concern about the fairness of the current formula for funding local authorities. The Government announced in November 1998 a review in partnership with local government to look for a way of distributing revenue support grant which is simpler, more stable, more robust and fairer than the present arrangements for Standard Spending Assessments. The Government will be issuing a Green Paper on options for change by the Summer.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w14.html_spnew3"><B> Ms Estelle Morris: </B> 
 Centrally allocated funds, including the Standards Fund and funding for capital work, are usually distributed on a formula basis or as a result of bids from Local Education Authorities, not via bids from individual maintained schools. Non-maintained special schools can bid directly for capital grant, but there are no such schools in Somerset. Until March 1999 grant maintained schools bid to the Funding Agency for Schools (FAS) for capital grants on a rolling programme. Between May 1997 and March 1999, 13 bids from grant maintained schools located in Somerset and Bath and North East Somerset were successful. The FAS maintained no record of the number of unsuccessful bids. Schools in Somerset have also led two successful bids for setting up Education Action Zones.

<a name="00203w14.html_spnew11"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Under the Freedom of Information Bill, a fee may be charged by a public authority, in accordance with regulations made by the Secretary of State. The regulations will set an 'appropriate limit', whereby if the cost of complying with the request exceeds that limit they would be exempt from that obligation under clause 11 of the Bill. These regulations are currently being prepared and it is intended that they will be circulated in draft as soon as possible. However, without pre-empting the regulations the Government's view have been that the 'appropriate limit' should be the same as the &#163;500 threshold for disproportionate costs which currently applies to parliamentary questions. It is not possible to make accurate projections of the number of requests that will fall outside this limit at this stage. However, I am confident that the percentage of cases where the exemption is claimed and the applicant refused will be very small.
<P>

<a name="00203w14.html_para2">It is, of course, possible that this threshold would be exceeded on occasions where, for example, an application required a significant amount of work on the part of the authority in drawing the information together. In such circumstances, the authority would still be required to consider the disclosure of the information, under clause 13 of the Bill, if to do so would be in the public interest. Therefore, even if the 'appropriate limit' is exceeded, it is still possible, because of the nature of the information, that it will be disclosed.

 The exact information requested is not held centrally. However, information is available on the number of recordable offences for which a 1998 sample of persistent young offenders had been convicted.
<P>

<a name="00203w16.html_para0">This indicates that a total of 173 individual persistent young offenders were sentenced on one or more occasions during 1998 following apprehension by the Avon and Somerset police. Of these 33 had been sentenced for a total of between five and nine recordable offences, 64 had been sentenced for between 10 and 19 recordable offences, 65 had been sentenced for between 20 and

49 recordable offences, and 10 had been sentenced for 50 or more recordable offences. The remaining individual had been sentenced for four recordable offences.
<P>

<a name="00203w16.html_para1">We define persistent young offenders as having at least three previous convictions and being apprehended for a further offence within three years of their most recent previous sentence.

<a name="00203w16.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Mike O'Brien: </B> 
 Our policy is to ensure that law is in place to safeguard the welfare of animals offered for sale as pets. This applies as much to reptiles in do-it-yourself stores, as it does to animals sold through other outlets. We intend that the law should be effectively enforced.
<P>

<a name="00203w16.html_para3">We believe that the Pet Animals Act 1951 (as amended), together with the Protection of Animals Act 1911 (as amended), meet that objective. Although there is

no plan to introduce tighter controls at present, we will keep the situation under review to ensure the law is able to address the issues.
<P>

<a name="00203w16.html_para4">Under the 1951 Act, persons in the business of selling pet animals must be licensed by local authorities. The licence conditions have to cover the suitability and cleanliness of the animals' accommodation, feeding arrangements, and protection from disease and fire. The local authority may inspect licensed premises at all reasonable times, and a breach of licence conditions may result in a fine of &#163;500 and/or three months imprisonment for the offender, as well as his or her disqualification from keeping a pet shop in future.
<P>

<a name="00203w16.html_para5">Under the 1911 Act, it is an offence, punishable by a fine of up to &#163;5,000 and/or six months imprisonment, to cause unnecessary suffering to any domestic or captive animal, and this includes animals kept as stock by persons trading in pets, both before and after their sale.
<P>

<a name="00203w16.html_para6">In addition, some species of reptile may be lawfully kept, after purchase from a pet supplier, only by someone suitably licensed under the Dangerous Wild Animals Act 1976. Others may be threatened species controlled under the Convention on the Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), under which welfare requirements must be satisfied before the animals concerned are allowed to enter the country. There is control over their subsequent movements.

<P>
<P>

the proposal. Most member states did not produce accurate statistics in 1993. Fundamental questions, such as whether it was a country-by-country or a Europe wide target, were not addressed. There is no mechanism for a year-on-year reduction.
<P>

<a name="00203w17.html_para0">A European conference was held in April 1997 to discuss the 50 per cent. target. The United Kingdom was represented by Home Office officials, a member of the Animal Procedures Committee, and interest groups. It was generally agreed that the 50 per cent. target was unrealistic, unhelpful and over-simplistic. The reduction target was recognised as ignoring the importance of refining experiments to minimise suffering. It was suggested that specific types of animal use (for example, the use of primates and aspects of regulatory testing) should be targeted.
<P>

<a name="00203w17.html_para1">Neither Directive 86/609/European Economic Community, nor the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, make provision for controlling the overall number of procedures. The Act requires that project licences be granted only if the benefits have been weighed against the costs and the purpose of the work cannot be achieved by other means. We cannot dictate how many applications for new project licences will be submitted, nor how many proposed programmes will satisfy the requirements of the Act, particularly the cost/benefit assessment. We are, however, ensuring that animals are used in scientific procedures only where this is fully justified and that the overall numbers of animals used is minimised as far as possible. We are also pressing for advances in the 3Rs of reduction, refinement and replacement.

 Under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, 375 local partnerships have been established in every area across the country to develop local crime reduction strategies to address local demands. Over time these will provide a measure of crime more relevant to people's everyday experience. The Crime Reduction Strategy, launched by the Government last November, sets out how we are working with partnerships and the steps we are taking to reduce crime. The Government have a range of measures and initiatives to deal with violent crime in particular. They include the following:

The Youth Justice and Criminal Evidence Act 1999 includes new measures to help vulnerable witnesses such as rape victims (eg banning their cross-examination by a defendant). One of the reasons for the increase in sexual offences is the greater likelihood that victims will report the offence because of improved handling by the police;

 Information about local policies on the treatment of Alzheimer's disease is not routinely collected and assessed centrally, but I understand that West Kent Health Authority is funding the prescribing of Aricept by consultants to patients with uncomplicated Alzheimer's disease. In developing its policy, the health authority took into account the evidence on clinical and cost effectiveness of Aricept, and did not consider it sufficiently convincing to support more widespread prescribing.

2. All estimated State Second Pension payments include SERPS payments on SERPS accrued before 2002 and are rounded to the nearest whole pound. The State Second Pension is assumed to be introduced in 2002.<P>

3. All calculations are based on a full working life of 49 years. Earnings at the lower earnings threshold (&#163;9,500 a year) have been assumed in every year of the working life.<P>

 The Intervention Milk Price Equivalent (IMPE) is a derived value for the price of the milk which goes into the manufacture of intervention products in the dairy sector. It has no formal basis either in the CAP regime or in UK law and is used only as a commercial negotiating mechanism between milk sellers and purchasers. The Government make no calculation, therefore, of its value. For each 1 per cent. decline in the euro against sterling, EU milk support prices in the UK also fall by 1 per cent.

 Subject to Parliamentary approval of the necessary Supplementary Estimate for Class V, Votes 1, 2 and 3 the Lord Chancellor's Department Departmental Expenditure Limit for 1999-2000 will be increased by &#163;26,934,000 from &#163;2,421,244,000 to &#163;2,448,178,000. The increase is the net effect of a transfer for &#163;505,000 from the Department of Social Security relating to the costs of recruiting and re-appointing panel members for Unified Appeals Tribunals; a transfer from the Reserve for &#163;25,000,000 in respect of the additional legal aid costs following implementation of the Narey reforms; a transfer to the Home Office for &#163;200,000 in respect of a contribution towards the costs of the IBIS (Integrating Business and Information Systems) Criminal Justice System Unit; and take up of End Year Flexibility entitlement in the sum of &#163;1,629,000.

 My right hon. Friend the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and I propose to publish a White Paper later this year setting out the Government's proposals for reform of the framework of communications legislation. This will include proposals for changing both the Telecommunications and Broadcasting Acts as a basis for legislation when parliamentary time allows. The White Paper will accordingly be broad in its scope, covering both infrastructure and content issues. It will draw on responses to the options for reform of the broadcasting and telecommunications framework set out in the Government's June 1999 statement "Regulating Communications: The Way Ahead" and will take full account of emerging conclusions from the current review of the European Union regulatory framework for communications. The work will be taken forward by a joint DTI/DCMS team to ensure a coherent and consistent approach to the regulation of the converging communications industries.

<P>
<a name="00203w23.html_spnew5"><B> Kate Hoey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 27 January 2000]:</i> The Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment (CABE) forwarded to the Secretary of State a copy of its letter of 16 December to Lord Foster of Thames Bank. This letter strongly supported the design which would

<P><I>3 Feb 2000 : Column: 732W</I><P>
meet the primary function of a football stadium, and noted how it could be converted for an athletics event but that it was essential that this provision should not compromise the stadium when used for football. CABE further stressed the importance of the work of the Wembley Task Force in ensuring the surrounding area provides a fitting environment.

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to his oral statement of 1 December 1999, <i>Official Report</i>, column 306, which bodies advised him that it seemed unlikely that Wembley could provide an appropriate venue for the World Athletics Championships.  [107299]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w23.html_spnew8"><B> Kate Hoey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 28 January 2000]:</i> The conclusions were drawn from the Ellerbe Beckett report. While Wembley National Stadium Ltd. subsequently addressed many of the issues outlined in a statement on 1 December 1999, the proposed solution was not the ideal for athletics as it required substantial investment without a lasting athletics legacy and would not have been suitable as the centrepiece for any future Olympic bid.

 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2000]:</i> Stadium Australia, which I understand has minimum C60 sightlines based on a focal point on the outside edge of the outside line around the whole track, has set the 



<P>
<P><I>3 Feb 2000 : Column: 733W</I><P>
current benchmark for quality of sightlines required for the Olympics. This was acknowledged by the Wembley design team at the recent Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee inquiry into Wembley. We were assured throughout the project that the new Wembley would be capable of being upgraded for Olympics. However, it became clear once we had seen the detailed proposals for Olympic configuration in early October last year, that Wembley did not meet this benchmark and brought into question the possibility of Wembley being the centrepiece of a future Olympic bid.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, pursuant to his answer to the hon.

[107839]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w23.html_spnew10"><B> Kate Hoey </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 31 January 2000]:</i> My Department has made no specific assessment of the Wembley proposals against other stadia in Europe. In respect of the Wembley proposals we were concerned to ensure that we did not rule out the possibility of a future Olympic bid. The report from Ellerbe Beckett along with evidence from the BOA and my officials who attended the Wembley National Stadium Ltd. mock up of the proposed seating, confirmed the inadequacy of the sightlines in 80,000 athletics mode.

 <i>[holding answer 28 January 2000]:</i> An informal proposal was made by David Richards, Chairman of the FA Premier League on 16 December 1999 in the margins of a meeting at No. 10 to discuss the proposed Football Foundation. This was relayed to my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State by DCMS officials and followed up by more formal discussions between my Department and the Football Association. These concluded with the meeting between my right hon. Friend the Secretary of State and Mr. Ken Bates on 22 December 1999 at which it was agreed that &#163;20 million would be returned over the next five years, with best endeavours to repay the money more quickly if possible. The precise details of the repayment are matters for Sport England and the Football Association.

 The Iranian media reports referred to in my previous answer described the three people killed in the Mujaheddin-e-Khalq Organisation's attack on the town of Ilam as civilians. Whatever their affiliation, this was an act of terrorism, which I strongly condemn.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what discussions he has had with the Iranian Government on the position of women in Iran in relation to the report by the UN Rapporteur on Human Rights.  [108148]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w25.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We and our EU partners regularly raise with the Iranian authorities our concerns over a number of their human rights policies, including the situation of women in Iran. The EU sponsored UN General Assembly Resolution on human rights in Iran, adopted on 17 December, called for further action by the Iranian Government to ensure the full and equal enjoyment by women of their human rights.
<P>

<a name="00203w25.html_para2">The Special Rapporteur's report of September 1999 expressed concern over certain women's rights issues and also highlighted a number of improvements. He particularly welcomed the efforts of the Iranian President and other senior figures in the executive to press for a change in attitude towards women and women's issues. He also welcomed the greater participation of Iranian women in politics and higher education.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what reports he has received on persecution of Christians in Pakistan in each of the last 12 months; and if he will make a statement.  [107948]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w25.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 We have received a number of reports about the position of Christians in Pakistan and have raised our concerns with the Pakistani authorities. Our High Commission in Islamabad maintains a regular dialogue with Christian and human rights groups and the Pakistani authorities on this issue. Since the coup on 12 October 1999, General Musharraf has promised Pakistan's minorities that their rights would be respected and that they would be treated as equal citizens. We shall continue to monitor the situation closely and raise our concerns.

<P>
<a name="00203w25.html_spnew6"><B> Mr. Hain: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary has discussed the Sudan with his Egyptian counterpart on a number of occasions, most recently in Cairo on 20 January. Our objective is to see a comprehensive negotiated settlement in the interests of all Sudanese. We continue to support the IGAD initiative as the best vehicle for actioning this.

 We are aware of reports of displacement of people in Upper Nile to places such as Bentiu and Yirol as a result of factional fighting. We expect to see further reports on this issue from a Canadian study which we understand may be published in the near future.

<P>
<P>
<a name="00203w25.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Battle: </B> 
 None. The British Trade and Cultural Office in Taipei reports regularly on economic developments. The economic consequences of last September's earthquake have been comprehensively covered in the course of that reporting.
<P>

<a name="00203w25.html_para3">The human cost of the earthquake was severe and tragic. The United Kingdom joined many other members of the international community in contributing to the relief effort.
<P>

<a name="00203w25.html_para4">Economic dislocation proved to be less grave than the Taiwan authorities initially feared. Considering the magnitude of the tremor, infrastructural damage to industrial premises was relatively light, the bulk of lost industrial output being caused by disruption in power supplies. Economic indicators show that Taiwan's economic performance has now returned to at or near its pre-September level.
