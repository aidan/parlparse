 The &#147;Homelessness Code of Guidance for Local Authorities&#148; provides guidance in respect of women fleeing domestic violence which accords with legislation and case law.

It is not considered reasonable for a person to continue to occupy accommodation if it is probable that this will lead to domestic violence or other violence against that person (or against someone who normally resides as a member of that person's family, or any other person who might reasonably be expected to reside with that person).</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government what changes have been made to planning policy on the protection of the best and most versatile agricultural land since May 1997. [157447]</p>

 The Government&#146;s planning policy on best and most versatile (BMV) agricultural land is set out in &#147;Planning Policy Statement 7: Sustainable development in rural areas&#148; (PPS7), published in August 2004. PPS7 replaced &#147;Planning Policy Guidance note 7: The Countryside, Environmental Quality and Economic and Social Development&#148; (PPG7), published in February 1997, which included policy guidance on (BMV) agricultural land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_82"><a name="71019w0004.htm_para4"><a name="07101930000546">PPG7 said that, within the principles of sustainable development, BMV agricultural land (defined as grades 1, 2 and 3a) should be protected as a national resource for future generations and its development should not be permitted before opportunities had been assessed for using previously developed or lower grade land.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_83"><a name="71019w0004.htm_para5"><a name="07101930000547">In December 2000 the Government&#146;s Rural White Paper &#147;Our Countryside: the future&#148;, signalled that policy affecting planning decisions relating to BMV land should be changed. The White Paper said that decisions about proposed development affecting BMV agricultural land should take account of the overall value of the land and that agricultural quality should be treated only as one factor. It therefore proposed that BMV agricultural land should no longer be protected as a national agricultural resource and that decisions about proposed development affecting such land should left to local planning authorities. It also proposed that powers for the Minister of Agriculture to intervene in decisions on BMV agricultural land should be repealed.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_84"><a name="71019w0004.htm_para6"><a name="07101930000548">PPG7 was subsequently amended by a parliamentary answer given by the planning Minister the right hon. Member for Greenwich and Woolwich on 21 March 2001 to reflect the White Paper&#146;s policy proposals.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_85"><a name="71019w0004.htm_para7"><a name="07101930000549">These policy changes were carried forward into PPS7. This asks local authorities that the presence of BMV agricultural land should be taken into account alongside other sustainability considerations when determining planning applications. The policy also says that where significant development of agricultural land is unavoidable, local planning authorities should seek to use areas of poorer quality land in preference to that of a higher quality, except where this would be  <br>

But we are still in a transitional phase and there will be a further period of &#145;bedding down&#146; which is bound to highlight the need for further business process, technical and training changes.</p>

These new calculations were first used in 2003, and are not comparable with data prior to March 2003. The data from 2003 onwards used here are termed comparable because they have been calculated on the old basis to allow comparison.<br>

 Officials have been discussing with various representative organisations ways of implementing the new regime which will both minimise the impact on pleasure boat users, and ensure that any additional compliance burden is as small as possible. As part of this process, HMRC published at 1 August 2007 a consultation on options for the implementation of the new regime. As announced at Budget 2007, private pleasure craft owners will continue to be able to use red diesel at the rebated duty rate until 1 November 2008.</p>

Some UK residents are not captured by the LFS including students living in halls of residence who do not have a UK-resident parent, and people living in other types of communal establishment (such as hostels, hotels, boarding houses, or mobile home sites). These factors may contribute to the LFS giving a slight underestimate of the foreign born population as a proportion of the total UK population.</p>

 Education, including sexual and reproductive health education, is one of the most significant factors in preventing the spread of HIV in the next generation. In Swaziland, two-thirds of teenage girls in school are free from HIV, while two-thirds of girls out of school have HIV. Girls, boys and adults with more education are more likely to have knowledge of key prevention techniques, including condoms to help prevent HIV infection and insecticide impregnated bed nets to prevent malaria infection, and more able to persuade their partners, and in the case of bed nets, families, to use them.</p>

<i> [holding answer 15 October 2007]:</i> The Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union does not change the existing provisions relating to the co-ordination of employment policies, currently set out in the Employment Title (VIII) of the Treaty establishing the EU under Articles 125-130. The employment provision in Article five relates to the Lisbon Strategy for Jobs and Growth, whereby all member states agree non-binding guidelines on employment and report annually on their main employment policies that relate to the Guidelines. This is principally to generate exchange of good practice on reforms that will help increase employment across the EU. This process is also supported by the European Social Fund.</p>

 The National Patient Safety Agency collects reports of patient safety incidents on the National Reporting and Learning System (NRLS). All national health service trusts have been able to report into this system since late 2004. Complete statistics relevant to this question are available for the years October 2005&#151;September 2006 and for October 2006&#151;September 2007. Staff usually report patient safety incidents before any further investigation or follow-up has taken place.</p>

A copy of the report is available in the Library. Primary care trust executives (chief executives and board level directors) are paid a spot rate salary which is determined (within a range) by the size of the population the PCT serves; for ambulance trust executives it is determined by their expenditure on emergency services and activity.</p>

 The prostate specific antigen (PSA) test measures the level of PSA in a man&#146;s blood. However, it is not perfect. Some men with prostate cancer do not have raised levels of PSA. Two-thirds of men with raised levels of PSA, depending on the cut off level used, do not have prostate cancer.
