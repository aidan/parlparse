 The Government have introduced legislation to establish a new code of practice for alcohol retailers. This will ensure that all alcohol retailers sell alcohol responsibly, by banning irresponsible promotions which encourage excessive drinking and can lead to crime and disorder.</p>

 We lobbied Russia several times before the first suspension of negotiations over the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) mission in Georgia in December 2008. In response to the Greek Chairmanship's proposal to revive negotiations, the UK accepted in principle a compromise text that met many of Russia's key concerns. Despite the efforts of the Greek chairmanship, Russia decided to block the renewal of the mandate. Russia's counter-proposals were unacceptable to the other participating states in the OSCE.</p>

 DEFRA's policy is not prescriptive in relation to the disposal technology procured by an authority using private finance initiative (PFI) funding. DEFRA does however insist that a thorough appraisal of the options is performed and documented as part of the Outline Business Case (OBC). The technology selected for the OBC forms the basis of the OBC costings but does not determine the choice of technology which is ultimately selected in the procurement stage. Hence PFI credit support is not tied to any type of technology and is available to projects both with and without combustion as part of their waste management solution.</p>

 Viable alternatives to child labour in Afghanistan include raising family incomes and increasing the availability of primary and secondary education. The Department for International Development (DFID) is helping raise family incomes by spending over &#163;180 million on economic development over the next four years (nationally and in Helmand province). DFID&#146;s support for schooling comprises a &#163;225 million contribution to the Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF) over the next four years.</p>

 The UK&#146;s strategy for helping poor countries respond to the impact of the recession includes mobilising additional external resources, especially from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other international financial institutions. An extra $50 billion of concessional resources for low-income countries was committed at the London summit in April. The IMF has increased concessional funds to crisis affected countries, helping partner governments to maintain funding of social programmes.</p>

 The Severn tidal power feasibility study will include two public consultations. The first of these was held earlier this year when my Department sought views on the scope of the work, including a recommended shortlist of schemes for further analysis.

 In February 2008, the Department published best practice guidance for joint working between the national health service and the pharmaceutical industry, where this benefits patients, and within appropriate governance arrangements. To support NHS organisations and companies who wish to enter into such projects, the Department published in March 2008 an interactive toolkit to support joint working, entitled &#147;Moving Beyond Sponsorship&#148;.</p>

 The pharmaceutical price regulation scheme (2008) announced that subject to discussion with affected parties, the Department will introduce generic substitution in primary care. This is a complex issue with many interested stakeholders. Discussions with key stakeholders and interested parties are still underway and are expected to continue into early summer. Some representations have also been received in written format. Issues covered are broad but include implementation implications, for example, whether to exclude certain categories of medicines for clinical reasons. We want to make sure we engage with all stakeholders in the best way possible and are currently considering how best to do so.</p>

<i> [holding answer 11 May 2009]: </i>The National Apprenticeship Service online vacancy matching system has been developed to provide a high quality service to employers wishing to recruit apprentices, and to young people and adults considering an apprenticeship. This will help deliver the objective outlined in World-class Apprenticeships to expand and improve the quality of our apprenticeship programme.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_366"><a name="90625w0017.htm_para0"><a name="0906265000905">At the end of April 2009, 4,157 vacancies were live on the system; a total of 8,051 vacancies have been posted since 12 January 2009 when the system went live. 93 vacancies have been filled through the service with 2,445 vacancies having current applications. The figures at this stage provide provisional data on apprenticeship applications. Feedback from a number of employers suggest that the recruitment process can take up to four months. In addition, the system was built to allow employers flexibility to integrate the advertising of apprenticeship opportunities on the system, with their own HR systems. In these instances candidates click through the Vacancy Matching System to the employers' own recruitment website. The National Apprenticeship Service (NAS) is looking at how feedback can be obtained from these employers, mainly national companies, without putting undue bureaucracy on them.</p>

 Records are not held of the number of prisoners granted temporary release. However, the numbers of temporary release licenses issued in 2007-08 was 441,167. This figure is the total of all individual licences issued, as some prisoners will be granted temporary release on a number of occasions and as a result will be issued with multiple licences over the course of a year. The 2008-09 figure will be published in the Offender Management Caseload Statistics 2008 at the end of July 2009.

Prisoners are not granted temporary release unless they meet the eligibility criteria and pass a stringent risk assessment.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_415"><a name="90625w0025.htm_para2"><a name="0906265003332">The table shows the sentences handed down to and the average custodial sentence length (ACSL) for determinate sentences for those aged 21 and over under sections 18, section 20 and 47 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 for 2007. The table also shows the sentences handed down to and the ACSL for offenders aged under 21, sentenced under sections 18 and 20 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 for 2007. Also included is the number of indeterminate sentences for the section 18 offences. These data are based on the offences under section 18, section 20 and section 47, where such offences were the principal offences for which the offender was sentenced. Where an offender has been sentenced for more than one offence the principal offence is the one for which the heaviest sentence was imposed, where the same sentence has been imposed for two or more offences the principal offence is the one for which the statutory maximum is most severe.</p>
