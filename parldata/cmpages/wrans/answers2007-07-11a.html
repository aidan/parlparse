 The Fire and Rescue National Framework sets out the priorities and objectives for all fire and rescue authorities in England, The framework is a statutory guidance document which is laid before Parliament and the current framework is for 2006-08. Within the framework we provide details of any targets set for fire and rescue authorities and for local authorities where they have a fire function e.g. county fire and rescue authorities. Since April 2005 the Government have had a public service agreement target which is:</p>

Fire and rescue authorities also have an efficiency target to deliver which commenced in April 2005 of &#163;105 million of cashable efficiency savings by 2007-08. Again, fire and rescue authorities are on track to deliver this efficiency target. Further information on these targets and other priorities for the fire and rescue service can be found within the national framework document.</p>

 We are not able to calculate the total costs of events to mark Veterans Day 2007 as many of these are borne by event organisers and are not collected by the Department. The MOD committed approximately &#163;470,000 to such events from its veterans budget. However, this figure does not include the costs of participation by armed forces units, such as military bands, in events organised to celebrate the country&#146;s veterans; these costs cannot be separately identified but the involvement of such units has not been large scale.</p>

The nearest approximation is &#145;near cash&#146; which comprises cash expenditure and adjustments relating to accrued and pre-paid expenditure.

 Operating authorities (OAs), that is, the Environment Agency, local authorities and internal drainage boards, are required to produce annual Medium Term Plans (MTPs) setting out their proposed flood protection and prevention schemes for the following three years. Each project will include some form of cost benefit analysis and this will form part of the calculation of the priority score for the scheme. A fully detailed cost benefit analysis is only likely to have been undertaken when a scheme comes forward for final approval either internally in the Environment Agency or, historically, by DEFRA.</p>

The list of schemes in the MTP will be added to as new ones are identified by OAs and may displace others with lower priority scores. There are many schemes in the MTP for which a need can be defined but which have a very low priority score. These are unlikely to receive funding for many years, if at all, but are nevertheless promoted by the OA. These should not be regarded as &#147;cancelled or postponed&#148; because they have never received funding approval and, for this reason, the information is not available in the form requested.</p>

 We know that women living in families with no one in work are more likely to be living in poverty. All of our labour market policies are gender-neutral although some by their nature help more women than men. As a result of this Government's policies nearly 2 million more women are now employed than there were in 1997.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_413"><a name="70711w0007.htm_para8"><a name="07071174000291">And with a lack of affordable child care being the greatest barrier to getting work for many women we are determined to continue to build on our policies, which, since 1997, have already resulted in a doubling of the number of child care places in England and, with extra help through the tax credit system, have significantly improved affordability. In addition, the London Childcare Affordability Project, which is jointly funded with the Greater London Authority, is testing the effectiveness of providing additional subsidies in the capital, where costs tend to be higher.</p>

 The Student Associate Scheme began in the academic year 2003-04, The following table details the budget for each academic year to date. The scheme has proved to be extremely successful with schools, higher education institutions and undergraduates. Its two twin aims are to use the undergraduates as role models for school pupils and to encourage bright undergraduates into initial teacher training (ITT) by giving them a taste of life in front of a classroom.  The Training and Development Agency for Schools, who administer the scheme, are about to carry out an assessment process which will try to ascertain how successful the scheme has been in terms of its twin aims. Data should be available in October 2007. However, previous limited research suggests that around 40 per cent. of participating undergraduates go on to ITT, In recognition of its success, the Treasury will announce on 5 July 2007 that the scheme will be extended and placements doubled over a three year period.</p>

 Where communities are ethnically diverse their schools should aspire to reflect that diversity. However, it is unlawful for schools to take account of a child's ethnic background when allocating places. What is important is that all parents are able to exercise their fundamental right to decide what school they would like their child to attend confident that they will not be discriminated against because of their background. The new school admissions code, which came into force on 28 February 2007, has established a framework to ensure that every child has an equal opportunity to attend a good school. In addition, the governing bodies of maintained schools in England have a duty under section 38 of the Education and Inspections Act 2006 to promote community cohesion and Ofsted will report on the discharge of this duty.</p>

 We do not expect any impact on potential diploma take up because of the functional skills requirement.

 The overwhelming majority of gaming machines currently operating under Part III of the Gaming Act 1968 will not require significant alteration when the Gambling Act comes fully in to force on 1 September. Where adjustments are necessary, the Department has invited the gambling industry to provide estimates of the time period necessary to implement the regulations under section 240 of the Act. The Department has received several responses, which will be carefully considered as the regulations are finalised in the coming weeks.</p>

 The DCMS Simplification Plan sets out where we think there may be scope to adjust the licensing regulations to remove any unnecessary burdens on those putting on licensable activities, including live music. In addition, the Live Music Forum published its report on 4 July 2007, and made a number of recommendations relating to the Licensing Act 2003, which we will consider carefully before responding formally.</p>

Ofcom have also introduced new rules on the content of advertisements targeted at primary school children. These rules ban the use of celebrities and characters licensed from third-parties (such as cartoons), promotional claims (such as free gifts) and health or nutrition claims. Ofcom announced the new rules in February 2007.</p>

This exceeded the target of 75 per cent. for 2006 and demonstrates a considerable increase from the estimated 25 per cent. in 2002. This target will rise to 85 per cent. by 2008.

<i> [holding answer 9 July 2007]:</i> Home Office Ministers have had no meetings with the Pompidou Group of the Council of Europe in the last 12 months. There was a Ministerial meeting of the Group on 27-28 November 2006 which I was unable to attend, but at which the United Kingdom was represented by our Ambassador to the Council of Europe and a Home Office official. The meeting endorsed a programme of work for experts in the field for the period 2007-10 in furtherance of the Group&#146;s core mission of contributing to the development of multidisciplinary, innovative, effective and evidence-based drug policies in Council of Europe member states, in particular in the areas of prevention, treatment, criminal justice, research, ethics and co-operation between operational staff at airports.</p>

 It is Home Office policy to avoid staff travel wherever possible by the use of systems such as videoconferencing or teleconferencing or by encouraging home working. However where travel is necessary such as for commuting staff are encouraged to take up interest-free loans for season tickets. The use of public transport for duty travel is encouraged by restricting on site car parking, and making use of travel websites for information services and to simplify ticketing arrangements. Staff are also informed about local transport initiatives and promotions. Where the location or nature of the work makes the use of public transport impractical for staff, car sharing is encouraged.</p>

 The Learning and Skills Council (LSC) uses individual learner level data to calculate overall apprenticeship framework achievement rates. Over the past few years the framework achievement rates have increased dramatically from 24 per cent. in 2001-02 to 59 per cent. so far in 2006-07. Framework completion relates to achievement of elements&#151;NVQ, technical certificate, key skills and employer rights and responsibilities. Apprentices who do not achieve all elements are not counted as full achievements but may well have completed one or more of the components including a vocational qualification.

The armed forces provide opportunities for training for all, no matter what was achieved in school or college. The literacy and numeracy standards of all recruits are assessed and those identified with poor skills for life are then given systematic support, so that before they start their vocational training, the minimum standard that all are operating at, is entry level 3 in numeracy and literacy. That support is contextualised, making learning applicable to the workplace, with the target that all have gained at least level 1 qualifications in literacy and numeracy (equivalent to GCSE level at D-G) within four years of joining, with opportunities to then gain vocational qualifications at level 2.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_471"><a name="70711w0014.htm_para8"><a name="07071196000586">The armed forces train their personnel, with support from DIUS, so that they have transferable skills and nationally recognised vocational qualifications, to enable them to take up a civilian career when they leave service. The armed forces is one of the largest deliverers of apprenticeships in the country, in the past year some 5,500 apprenticeships, nearly 2,500 advanced apprenticeships and over 7,500 stand-alone NVQ or other level 2 qualifications were completed by armed forces personnel. In addition, assistance with resettlement is provided, to ensure personnel are fully prepared for civilian life.</p>

 We are working to ensure that women have access to abortion services as soon as possible as evidence shows that the risk of complications increases the later the gestation. We have invested &#163;8 million to improve early access and set a standard of a maximum waiting time of three weeks. Primary care trusts&#146; performance in this area is being measured as part of the Healthcare Commission&#146;s annual healthcheck.</p>

The latest data for 2006 show that progress is being made to increase early access: 65 per cent. of national health service funded abortions took place at under 10 weeks compared with 51 per cent. in 2002.</p>

In 2006, 87 per cent. of abortions were NHS funded, compared with 78 per cent. in 2002. In addition, since 2002 we have collected patients self-reported ethnicity data to monitor access to services by all groups.</p>

 The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists (RCOG) evidence-based guideline &#147;The Care of Women Requesting Induced Abortion (2004)&#148; gives recommendations to commissioners and service providers on the information to be given to women contemplating an abortion, following an abortion and on women&#146;s counselling needs.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_499"><a name="70711w0018.htm_para2"><a name="070711104000553">The guideline states that professionals involved in abortion services should be equipped to provide women with the information they need, including accurate knowledge about possible complications and sequelae of abortion, in order to give genuinely informed consent. Clinicians caring for women requesting abortion should try to identify those patients who require more support in decision making than can be provided in the routine clinic setting. Facilities for additional support, including access to social services, should be available. Appropriate information and support should be available for those who consider, but do not proceed to, abortion. The guideline also recommends that referral for further counselling should be available for the small minority of women who experience long-term post abortion distress.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Health what the reasons were for the increase in the gross deficit in the primary care trust sector between 2005-06 and 2006-07. [147578]</p>

<p><a name="st_351"><a name="070711104000892"><a name="70711w0021.htm_spnew2"><a name="070711104001168"><b>Mr. Bradshaw:</b>
 The primary care trust (PCT) sector reported a &#163;633 million gross deficit at the end of 2006-07, which is a &#163;17 million deterioration from the position reported at the end of 2005-06. However, the proportion of PCTs reporting a deficit has reduced from 36 per cent. in 2005-06 to 27 per cent. in 2006-07.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_521"><a name="70711w0021.htm_para2"><a name="070711104000893">From 2006-07, we have stopped the movement of money round the national health service through brokerage or planned support. As we anticipated, this reform of the NHS financial regime has exposed deficits which might otherwise have remained hidden. As part of the strategy to manage the financial position in their overall economy in 2006-07, strategic health authorities (SHAs) were able to top-slice PCT allocations to create SHA reserves. Although this top-slice may have contributed to the less than 3 per cent. increase in the overall PCT gross deficit, this money is not lost, but held by the SHAs on behalf of the NHS. PCTs are entitled to repayment of their contribution over a reasonable period which should not normally exceed the three-year allocation cycle.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_522"><a name="70711w0021.htm_para3"><a name="070711104000894">A clearer measure of PCT financial performance is shown by considering the in-year financial position, as this excludes both the Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB) adjustments in respect of prior year performance and the impact of the top-slice of PCT allocations. The in-year deficit of the 55 PCTs that recorded a deficit in 2005-06 was &#163;326 million. This underlying position improved significantly to a &#163;348 million in-year surplus by the end of 2006-07.</p>
