 This Government condemn hostage taking under any circumstances. On 3 May my right hon. Friend the previous Foreign Secretary and my hon. Friend the Member for Cunninghame, North (Mr. Wilson) met the families of the three soldiers kidnapped by Hizballah on 7 October and the reservist Colonel kidnapped on 4 October. The Government are doing what they can to help and have raised these cases, and continue to do so, with the relevant countries in the region pressing particularly for access to the hostages for the ICRC. We strongly support all efforts to secure the release of all hostages, particularly efforts led by the United Nations Secretary General.

<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_wqn1"><B> Fiona Mactaggart: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs what guidance he has given on the use of ministerial discretion in overturning the decisions of entry clearance officers overseas; and if he will place a copy of the guidance in the Library.  [801]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_spnew1"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 Entry Clearance Officers (ECOs) consider entry clearance applications and apply the Immigration Rules to determine whether to grant or refuse entry clearance. In exceptional circumstances, an FCO Minister may exercise his/her discretion to overturn an ECO's decision, if the Minister considers that in fact the requirements of the Immigration Rules have, or have not, been met. This discretion extends only to decisions made in accordance with the Immigration Rules. The exercise of discretion to make a decision outside the Rules is only undertaken by a Home Office Minister.

To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if firm dates have been set for EU membership for <i>(a)</i> Cyprus and <i>(b)</i> Turkey.  [307]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_spnew2"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 No firm date has been set for the accession of any candidate country to the EU. However, the Gothenburg European Council agreed that, provided progress towards meeting the accession criteria continues at an unabated pace, the road map for enlargement should make it possible to complete negotiations by the end of 2002 for those candidates that are ready. The objective is that they should participate in the European Parliament elections of 2004 as members. The Government fully support this approach.




<P>
<P><I>27 Jun 2001 : Column: 88W</I><P>

<P>

<a name="10627w01.html_para0">Both Turkey and Cyprus are candidates for the EU. Cyprus is well advanced in its negotiations, having provisionally closed negotiations in 22 out of the 31 chapters of the EU's acquis communautaire. Turkey has yet to begin negotiations, as it has not fulfilled the Copenhagen political criteria (covering issues such as human rights, the rule of law and respect for and protection of minorities). The Government look forward to further progress by Turkey, in line with the priorities set out in the EU's Accession Partnership with Turkey.

<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_wqn3"><B> Mr. Spring: </B>

<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_spnew3"><B> Peter Hain: </B> 
 My right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary met a number of his counterparts from the Central European EU applicant countries at the European Council meeting in Gothenburg on 15-16 June. The Government attach the utmost importance to the enlargement of the EU and my right hon. Friend the Foreign Secretary and I intend to expand our dialogue with the applicants in the coming months. Programmes of inward and outward visits are under discussion.

<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_wqn4"><B> Mr. Spring: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he has a strategy to achieve peace in <i>(a)</i> Kosovo, <i>(b)</i> Macedonia and <i>(c)</i> the Balkans in general; and if he will make a statement.  [308]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_spnew4"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The UK is working closely with its partners and key international organisations to bring peace and stability to the Balkans.
<P>

<a name="10627w01.html_para1">In Kosovo, we fully support the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) in their efforts, in accordance with UN Security Council resolution 1244, to secure the establishment of a democratic, tolerant, multi- ethnic society and to achieve lasting security for all of Kosovo's population. Elections to a Kosovo Assembly in November 2001 will deliver the provisional democratic self-governing institutions foreseen in UNSCR 1244, and will provide an important opportunity for the people of Kosovo to have a say in how Kosovo is to be run. Extremism and organised crime are significant regional problems, and are the biggest internal threat to stability in Kosovo. We support UNMIK and KFOR in their efforts to combat extremism and to promote law and order throughout the province.
<P>

<a name="10627w01.html_para2">In Macedonia, we strongly support the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the country and condemn all acts of extremist violence. We welcome the efforts of EU High Representative Solana and NATO Secretary-General Lord Robertson to promote inter-ethnic dialogue and an overall political settlement. The British Ambassador in Skopje has played a key role in recent months as Mr. Solana's Special Representative. We welcome the 25 June decision of the EU's General Affairs Council to appoint a senior political figure, Francois Leotard, as Mr. Solana's new full-time resident representative in Skopje. In the light of recent events, we hope he will be able to encourage all the parties to take the political process forward rapidly, to 



<P>
<P><I>27 Jun 2001 : Column: 89W</I><P>
head off the risk of further violence. We are discussing with Allies a possible NATO role in disarming NLA members in support of any peace agreement.
<P>

<a name="10627w01.html_para3">The key elements of our regional strategy are fostering regional co-operation, inter-ethnic reconciliation and economic reform through the Stability Pact and the EU's Stabilisation and Association Process. As it made clear at the Zagreb summit, the EU has offered the incentives of potential EU membership, generous trade access and technical assistance in return for commitments to democracy, regional co-operation and economic reform. We also continue to take tough measures against extremists and organised crime whose activities continue to undermine the region.

<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_wqn5"><B> Mr. Spring: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the position of Her Majesty's Government regarding <i>(a)</i> the recent developments in Kashmir and <i>(b)</i> the scheduled meeting between Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee and Chief Executive General Pervez Musharraf.  [309]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 We are concerned by the increasing violence in Kashmir. We have therefore welcomed the recent announcement that talks will take place between Prime Minister Vajpayee and President Musharraf in July. I hope that this leads to constructive and meaningful dialogue and progress on all the issues that divide India and Pakistan.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_spnew7"><B> Mr. Bradshaw: </B> 
 The Secretary of State met Lord Levy on 19 June. He and Lord Levy will meet as necessary.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Straw: </B> 
 I had planned to visit Macedonia on 26-27 June. However, in the light of developments overnight in Skopje, I decided it would not be right to go ahead now. But I am keen to make an early visit to Skopje and will do so at the earliest opportunity.
<P>

<a name="10627w01.html_para4">I am currently considering proposals for visits to a number of other countries. The House will be informed when decisions have been made.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_wqn9"><B> Mr. Spring: </B> 
To ask the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs if he will make a statement on the progress of the Stability Pact in South Eastern Europe.  [313]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w01.html_spnew9"><B> Mr. MacShane: </B> 
 The Stability Pact for South-East Europe, in which the EU plays a leading role is aimed at increasing economic confidence in the region, and bringing its states into Euro-Atlantic structures. It is making good progress and has taken an active role in the achievement of two regional agreements. On 27 June, on the eve of the Stability Pact Regional Table meeting in Brussels, Ministers from the region are expected to sign a Memorandum of Understanding on trade liberalisation, while representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovinia, Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia are expected to sign an agreement on refugee returns. While concern remains over political developments, in Macedonia and the UK played a leading role in bringing the trade negotiations to a successful conclusion, supporting the Pact's Macedonian-led trade liberalisation group with expertise and technical assistance.

 We have regularly expressed concern at the highest levels in Khartoum about incidents of aerial bombing of civilian targets. We do so bilaterally and also with our European partners through the EU/Sudan Political Dialogue. We also issued a statement, with our EU partners, calling for restraint by both sides in the wake of the renewed SPLA offensive in Bahr al Ghazal.

<P>
<a name="10627w02.html_spnew1"><B> Tessa Jowell: </B> 
 I am announcing today a &#163;150 million initiative to target Lottery money at those most deprived local authorities which have received less lottery funding than other parts of the UK.

<a name="10627w02.html_spnew2"><B> Dr. Howells: </B> 
 The Radio Authority is responsible for awarding radio broadcast licences under the terms of the Broadcasting Acts. United Christian Broadcasters already hold two satellite radio licences issued by the Radio Authority.
<P>

<a name="10627w02.html_para0">The Broadcasting Act 1990 disqualifies bodies whose objects are wholly or mainly of a religious nature from holding a terrestrial national analogue radio licence or a digital radio licence issued by the Radio Authority. The White Paper, "A New Future for Communications", announced our intention to lift the ban on religious bodies from holding local digital licences, at the next legislative opportunity. The White Paper also invited comments on relaxing the restrictions regarding the ownership of other licences by such bodies. We are currently considering the responses made. The Government will publish details of their proposals in a draft Bill as announced in the Queen's Speech.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w02.html_spnew3"><B> Tessa Jowell </B> 
 <i>[holding answer 25 June 2001]:</i> The Government are committed to banning all forms of tobacco advertising and promotion, with certain limited exceptions, and will be introducing legislation in due course concerning tobacco sponsorship of sport. In the Draft Regulatory Impact Assessment to the Draft Tobacco (Prohibition of Advertising and Promotion) Regulations published in 1999, the annual cost of tobacco sponsorship of sport was estimated at &#163;43 million. It is difficult to estimate the extent to which this sponsorship income would be lost as much may well be replaced by other sources.

We are also working closely with European and International colleagues towards global harmonisation in the fight against doping in sport.

 I want to ensure that my Department is fully able to play its part in meeting the Enterprise and Productivity Challenge which the Government set last week for this Parliamentary session. I am therefore announcing today a review of the priorities and structure of my Department. I have asked to receive initial recommendations by mid September.
<P>

<a name="10627w03.html_para1">In addition, on 13 June I announced a major review of my Department's support for business. Some &#163;1 billion a year of support is made available to business and I want to ensure that this funding is properly targeted as part of my drive to help UK businesses get to the future first. The review of business support will focus on two strands: industrial support and manufacturing; and then wider business support. I hope to be able to announce first results by late summer.
<P>

<a name="10627w03.html_para2">Both of these reviews will be undertaken in consultation with business and the Department's other stakeholders.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w03.html_spnew5"><B> Mr. Wilson: </B> 
 The UK packaging waste regulations implement European Parliament and Council Directive 94/62/EC on Packaging and Packaging Waste. This Directive aims both to reduce the environmental impact of waste packaging and to ensure the functioning of the single market with respect to packaging. The single market provisions of the Directive require member states to ensure that packaging may be placed on the market only if it complies with certain essential requirements and heavy metals limits. These measures are implemented in the UK through the Packaging (Essential Requirements) Regulations SI 1998 No. 1165 and enforcement powers have been given to local Trading Standards Departments. These regulations fall under my area of responsibility.
<P>

<a name="10627w03.html_para4">In addition to my responsibilities for these regulations my department represents the UK at meetings of the technical adaptation committee set up under Article 21 of Directive 94/62/EC.

My right hon. Friend the Minister for the Environment has the responsibility for these regulations.

<P>

<a name="10627w04.html_para0">In line with the policy relating to injuries, set out in the published criteria, those games were excluded from the calculations and the players subsequently met the criterion of playing in at least 75 per cent. of competitive international matches in the previous two years prior to the applications being lodged with the Department.

In the event of the European Union carrying out a civilian policing operation, the United Kingdom would not be obliged to contribute any police officers, but would decide in the light of circumstances whether it was appropriate for the United Kingdom to contribute to the operation, and, if so, at what level of numbers.

 The Prime Minister set the tough target of reducing the number of people sleeping rough in England to as near to zero as possible and by at least two thirds by 2002.
<P>

<a name="10627w05.html_para1">In 1998, there were approximately 1,850 people rough sleeping in England. In June 2000, published figures indicated that approximately 1,180 people were sleeping rough, (546 in London and 634 outside of London). This

<P>

<a name="10627w05.html_para3">These include helping people sleeping rough on the streets with drug, alcohol and mental health problems; helping former rough sleepers rebuild their lives through education, training and employment; and preventing a new generation of rough sleepers particularly those leaving care, the armed forces and prison.

 The Government are committed to working with the road haulage industry to deliver a sustainable distribution system. The 2001 Budget announced a programme of measures, discussed in the Road Haulage Forum and supported by the key partners, to help the industry modernise and improve its environmental performance. We are now working with all parties to implement these. The next meeting of the forum, to be chaired by the Minister for Transport, will take place on 5 July.

 It is already our policy to promote a positive approach to planning for renewable energy as part of the UK's climate change strategy.

<P>

To ask the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions what plans the Government have to increase the scope of business rate relief for rural services.  [836]<P>
<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w05.html_spnew7"><B> Dr. Whitehead: </B> 
 The Rating (Former Agricultural Premises and Rural Shops) Act 2001 will introduce a new scheme of rate relief for new, small-scale farm diversification enterprises. It will also extend the mandatory element of the village shop rate relief scheme to all food shops with rateable value of no more than &#163;9,000 in a designated rural settlement with population up to 3,000. We intend to commence the provisions of the Act in the near future. At the same time, we will increase the flat rate discount for premises used for the breeding and rearing of horses and ponies to &#163;3,000 rateable value.
<P>

<a name="10627w05.html_para6">Since 5 April 2001, mandatory relief under the village shop rate relief scheme has been available to the sole pub or petrol station with rateable value of no more than &#163;9,000 in a designated rural settlement with population up to 3,000. Earlier this year we consulted on a proposal to extend the agricultural rating exemption to ensure it included share and contract farming and machinery rings. We are currently considering this in the light responses received. The extension would require primary legislation.

<P>
<P>
<a name="10627w05.html_spnew8"><B> Mr. Raynsford: </B> 
 In July last year the Government announced the establishment of a joint DETR/Local Government Association taskforce to review procurement in local government in the light of the requirements of best value. This Government have given a clear commitment to improving public services and procurement lies at the heart of better services for local people.
<P>

<a name="10627w05.html_para7">The taskforce has completed its work and its report, "Delivering Better Services for Citizens", is being published today. Copies of the report have been placed in the House Libraries
<P>

<a name="10627w05.html_para8">I am grateful for the thorough manner in which Sir Ian Byatt, the chairman, and the members of the taskforce have conducted this review. The report provides a challenging analysis of current procurement practice and makes a number of recommendations for change. It is an important contribution to the debate on the modernisation of local government and the provision of high quality services to local people.
<P>

<a name="10627w05.html_para9">The DTLR and the LGA have agreed to consult jointly on the report. I intend to provide a detailed response to its findings in the autumn, together with an action plan for implementation.

<a name="10627w06.html_spnew0"><B> Mr. Boateng: </B> 
 There are no plans to increase the VAT registration threshold to &#163;100,000. As announced in the statement on 18 June by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry on enterprise and productivity, Customs are now consulting on a new VAT flat rate scheme. This will make it easier for many smaller businesses with taxable turnover of up to &#163;100,000 to calculate the amount of VAT due and simplify their bookkeeping requirements.

We recognised there were difficulties with the original &#163;100,000 requirement and reduced this to &#163;50,000 in 1999. My Department grant aids the technology colleges and youth sport trusts, which provide advice to schools about raising sponsorship and raise funds themselves to support applicant schools. The network of 684 specialist schools shows that applicant schools across the country, including those from rural and inner city areas, have successfully raised the sponsorship required. We shall keep the sponsorship criteria under review.

 The Government's view remains that the relative merits of three and two-tier systems of school organisation are a matter for local discussion and determination. Schools should be organised in a way which supports the delivery of the highest possible standards of education and which also reflects parental preference. Local education authorities and school governing bodies, rather than central Government, are best placed to decide on which pattern of provision is most effective for their area.

 In determining remuneration the Lord Chancellor is required to consider three statutory factors under section 25(3) of the Access to Justice Act 1999: (a) the need to secure the provision of services of the description to which the order relates by a sufficient number of competent persons and bodies; (b) the cost to public funds; and (c) the need to secure value for money. Recent remuneration measures under that Act have therefore considered value for money.

<a name="10627w09.html_para3">In publicly funded family work, the Lord Chancellor introduced the Family Graduated Fees Scheme for junior and Queen's Counsel, on 1 May 2001. The scheme provides for set fees, graduated to take account of complexity and specific issues in the case. In criminal cases, regulations introduced in September 2000 have controlled more tightly the circumstances where QCs or more than one advocate might be allowed for the defence in Crown court cases. Individual case contracts have been introduced in high cost cases. These secure the provision of legal services at a fixed price. New regulations, to be introduced in October, will extend the existing 10-day advocates graduated fees scheme for Crown court trials to cases lasting up to 25 days.

 It is open to parties who believe items of cost to be unreasonable to challenge those costs in a court assessment. While it is a matter ultimately for the courts, the Government believe that recoverability includes reasonable premiums reasonably incurred, including premiums on policies taken out before any proceedings start. As long as liability insurers wish to be able to recover their costs in cases that they win, it is not unreasonable for claimants to take out insurance against that risk at the outset and to seek to recover the premium in cases where they are successful.
