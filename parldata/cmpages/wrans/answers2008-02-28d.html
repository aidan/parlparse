 It is not possible to say how many people in Hendon are entitled to receive a winter fuel payment. This is because not everyone aged 60 or over will be entitled to a payment.

2. Only the broad industry groupings under the ITC are shown above, because numbers are relatively small, and to aid interpretation of the figures.<br>
3. By the end of the period shown over 75 per cent. of bankruptcies are recorded as non-traders and so have no associated industry classification.<br>
4. The geographical information presented above is based on bankrupts&#146; postcodes and is subject to an element of missing or unusable data. Nationally, this has been decreasing from around 12 per cent. in 2000 to 4 per cent. in 2006.<br>

<i> [holding answer 28 February 2008]:</i> Judaism is one of the three minority religions officially recognised under the Iranian Constitution. While we do have general concerns about freedom of religion and belief in Iran, we understand that the Jewish community has relatively good relations with the wider Muslim community in Iran. The Iranian Jewish community does face some institutional discrimination, but we do not believe that the community faces systematic persecution. We continue to monitor the situation closely and officials in Tehran and London regularly meet representatives of the Jewish community to discuss the situation of Jewish people in Iran. In December 2007 the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution about human rights in Iran. The resolution, which was co-sponsored by the UK and all other EU member states, acknowledged and expressed concern at the situation of religious and ethnic minorities in Iran. We will continue to make clear to the Iranian authorities that persecution of individuals on the grounds of their religious beliefs is unacceptable and contrary to Iran's international human rights obligations, and that the rights of Iran's religious minorities should be equal to those of all Iranian citizens.</p>

<i> [holding answer 22 February 2008]:</i> The Government's position on tests of the performance of multi-foil insulation products and their proposals for complying with the High Court judgment of 2 November 2007 are explained in Communities and Local Government Circular 6/2007 and the parallel letter to local authorities and approved building control inspectors which were issued on 7 December 2007. These can be found on the CLG website at:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_311"><a name="80228w0013.htm_para1"><a name="08022891000780">The Department does not assess the practical and environmental merits of particular types of insulation materials, as building regulations and guidance do not make specific requirements for such materials. When issuing approved guidance on achieving compliance with the building regulations' energy efficiency requirements for construction work, it relies upon internationally recognised generic insulation performance values for construction materials and a wide range of expert advice on how these materials can be practically assembled into construction elements such as walls, roofs etc.</p>

This investment supports over 400 evidence-based programmes across England and Wales. All of these programmes are available to support young people involved in antisocial behaviour and crime in order to reduce their involvement, as part of a tiered approach that involves ISOs where appropriate. As part of the &#163;31.2 million, approximately &#163;458,000 was allocated more specifically to address the needs and risks presented by those involved in antisocial behaviour, some of whom will be subject to an ISO.</p>

This question has been answered on this basis. It means, for example, that some people who are UK nationals will be included in the total of &#147;foreign born&#148; and that people who are working but are above state pension age are not included.</p>

 The Department has not made such an assessment.

Local authorities are welcome to submit innovative proposals to the Department for funding as pilot or demonstration schemes within the major scheme funding regime. During 2006, the Department part-funded a research project to assess the potential role of biomethane as a renewable transport fuel, although this did not examine it&#146;s potential in ultra light rail specifically.

<i> [holding answer 5 February 2008]:</i> It is not possible to provide such a breakdown, as the costs to industry and Government will vary. As part of the CSR 07 settlement the Government are committed to reducing DEFRA&#146;s animal health and welfare budget by &#163;121 million by 2010-11.

<i> [holding answer 5 February 2008]:</i> No. We do not anticipate that legislation to facilitate the introduction of other revenue raising mechanisms as part of the wider responsibility and cost sharing agenda for animal health and welfare will be in place before the end of the current CSR settlement period.

Depending on vaccine availability and the disease situation, once vaccination is progressing broadly across the Protection Zone, the intention is to extend or modify the zone in order to permit further vaccination. This will allow a phased approach as vaccine is delivered.</p>

This takes no account of the radiative forcing impact of the release of emissions at altitude, not does it reflect the climate impact of aircraft contrails or emissions of other gases not controlled under the Kyoto protocol.</p>

This, and other information, will help inform the implementation of Fisheries 2027, a long-term vision for sustainable fisheries. DEFRA officials have spoken with a number of fishermen from the above areas who have expressed an interest in participating in the pilot and, in due course, they will be holding meetings in the three pilot areas to discuss details of the Scheme. I have not offered compensation but costs of equipping participating vessels will be met by DEFRA.

allocations by producer organisations under economic link arrangements. A key determinant on whether or not a swap is agreed is if there is economic benefit for the UK in making the swap. Based on this, two international cross-year swaps have been completed with Germany and the Netherlands to acquire an additional 150 tonnes of valuable North sea sole quota in 2008 for inshore fishermen operating in the southern North sea. Additionally, similar cross year swaps have been agreed to gain 38 tonnes of North sea Whiting and 26 tonnes of Irish sea Plaice for the inshore fleet. Other international swaps have also taken place. These will not have been carried out for the specific benefit of the inshore fleet. However, the inshore fleet will have benefited in many instances from a share of the extra fish gained for the UK as a whole.</p>

 On 8 February 2008, the Environment Agency received reports of fish deaths on the River Colne (which flows through Huddersfield in West Yorkshire) and investigated immediately. Initially, only stone loach were affected. However, as the event progressed, larger fish including trout and grayling were also found to be dead or dying. Samples were taken by Environment Agency officers and these are currently being analysed at its laboratory. Early analysis has not detected any pollutant which would have caused a fish kill. However, the Environment Agency believes that a spillage of pollution probably entered the river on 7 February and was slow-acting in nature.</p>

 DEFRA and Foreign and Commonwealth Office officials regularly meet members of the Wildlife and Countryside LINK whale working group and the whalewatch coalition which together comprise the principal anti-whaling non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in the UK. My hon. Friend the Member for Brent, North (Barry Gardiner) met the group on 26 April 2007 and had frequent and close contact with NGOs present at the 59th meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Anchorage. Since taking up office in June 2007, I have attended an extremely productive meeting with officials and the group on 11 October, and have also met representatives of some NGOs individually, including the International Fund for Animal Welfare. The Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, (Hilary Benn) has also had discussions with Greenpeace.</p>

 As stated in my answer of 6 February 2008, <i> Official Report,</i> column 1296W, I consider that it would be inappropriate to provide details of both the pro/anti-whaling countries and International Whaling Commission (IWC)/non-IWC member countries the UK has lobbied on this issue and the letters and documents sent to them. This is because this information could compromise our efforts to persuade countries to join (or in some cases not to join) the IWC or to support the UK in its opposition to whaling. As this process is ongoing it is unlikely that we will consider it appropriate to release these details in the medium term.</p>

 Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) posts regularly report back on this issue. The information that we receive informs subsequent discussions that the UK has with countries, whether or not they are members of the International Whaling Commission (IWC). Formal replies to ministerial approaches by way of letters are rare, but a lack of response does not necessarily indicate lack of action. I do not believe that any of those who joined the IWC last year actually responded to the letters that had been sent.</p>

 There has been limited assessment made.

A publication based on this was published in the <i> Emergency Medicine Journal</i> in 2007 (using information from 2004). This work did not draw definitive conclusions on the effect of walk-in centres on A and E attendances, and the effect varied from site to site.</p>

 The Government announced in May 2007 that that they had reached a ground-breaking agreement with the alcohol industry, meaning that, by the end of 2008, most alcoholic drinks labels should include alcohol unit information and the daily sensible drinking guidelines. This agreement is United Kingdom-wide.</p>

Although this is not formally part of the voluntary agreement that has been reached with the industry, it is being strongly encouraged to implement the pregnancy advice.</p>

Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire SHA<br>
Essex SHA<br>
Norfolk, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire SHA.<br>
<i> Notes:</i><br>
<i> Finished in-year admissions:</i><br>
A finished in-year admission is the first period of in-patient care under one consultant within one health care provider, excluding admissions beginning before 1 April at the start of the data year. Admissions do not represent the number of in-patients, as a person may have more than one admission within the year.<br>
<i> Data Quality:</i><br>
HES are compiled from data sent by over 300 national health service trusts and PCTs in England. The Information Centre for health and social care liaises closely with these organisations to encourage submission of complete and valid data and seeks to minimise inaccuracies and the effect of missing and invalid data via HES processes. While this brings about improvement over time, some shortcomings remain.<br>
<i> Assessing growth through time:</i><br>
HES figures are available from 1989-90 onwards, During the years that these records have been collected, the NHS there have been ongoing improvements in quality and coverage. These improvements in information submitted by the NHS have been particularly marked in the earlier years and need to be borne in mind when analysing time series.<br>
Changes in NHS practice also need to be borne in mind when analysing time series. For example, a number of procedures may now be undertaken in out-patient settings and may no longer be accounted in the HES data. This may account for any reductions in activity over time.<br>
<i> All Diagnoses count of Mentions:</i><br>
These figures represent a count of all mentions of a diagnosis in any of the 14 diagnosis fields in the HES data set. Therefore, if a diagnosis is mentioned in more than one diagnosis field during an episode, all diagnoses are counted.<br>
<i> Diagnosis Codes Used:</i><br>
F10 - Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol<br>
K70 - Alcoholic liver disease<br>
T51 - Toxic effect of Alcohol<br>
<i> Ungrossed Data:</i><br>
Figures have not been adjusted for shortfalls in data (i.e. the data are ungrossed).<br>
<i> Low Numbers:</i><br>
Due to reasons of confidentiality, figures between 0 and 5 have been suppressed and replaced with &#147;*&#148; (an asterisk).<br>
<i> PCT and SHA Data Quality:</i><br>
PCT and SHA data were added to historic data years in the HES database using 2002-03 boundaries, as a one-off exercise in 2004. The quality of the data on PCT of treatment and SHA of treatment is poor in 1996-97, 1997-98 and 1998-99, with over a third of all finished episodes having missing values in these years. Data quality of PCT of general practitioner (GP) practice and SHA of GP practice in 1997-98 and 1998-99 is also poor, with a high proportion missing values where practices changed or ceased to exist. There is less change in completeness of the residence-based fields over time, where the majority of unknown values are due to missing postcodes on birth episodes. Users of time series analysis including these years need to be aware of these issues in their interpretation of the data.<br>

 It is not a matter for the Department to give advice to commissioning bodies on treatment of particular conditions. It is for the Royal Colleges to give advice to practitioners while the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) provides national guidance on promoting good health and preventing and treating ill health. NICE guidance suggests the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprophen in the first instance for the treatment of endometriosis as well as trialling the contraceptive pill. If neither of these treatments work, then NICE recommends surgery to remove endometrial deposits. If conservative methods do not work, and symptoms remain severe then NICE recommends hysterectomy, with or without removal of the ovaries.</p>

ACRA has made good progress on some major aspects of its work programme, it has requested, and been granted, additional time to finalise the work that it is doing to review the formula.

 Pace of change policy for revenue allocations to primary care trusts (PCTs) is considered by Ministers prior to each allocations round. However, for the 2008-09 revenue allocations, the decision was made to freeze the weighted-capitation formula to give the Advisory Committee on Resource Allocation (ACRA) the time it requires to finalise its review of the formula. Therefore, in 2008-09, all PCTs will be given the same uplift of 5.5 per cent. freezing the distance from target for each PCT. The flat-rate increase of 5.5 per cent. on each PCT&#146;s 2007-08 revenue allocation will ensure that every PCT has sufficient growth in funding to honour their service commitments.</p>

Any new formula is likely to have an impact on the target allocation for some PCTs. Some PCTs may move from being under target to over target and vice versa. Giving all PCTs the same uplift avoids moving PCTs towards their current target allocation in 2008-09 and then having to reverse this the following year.</p>

 To ask the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills what representations he has received proposing changes to the method of calculating interest on student loans since June 2007. [185235]</p>

 During the third reading of the Sale of Student Loans Bill on 23 January representations were made by my hon. Friends the Members for Nottingham, South (Alan Simpson) and for Hayes and Harlington (John McDonnell) who suggested that the consumer prices index (CPI) should be used in place of the retail prices index (RPI) when determining the rate of interest on student loans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_478"><a name="80228w0032.htm_para0"><a name="0802296001637">My hon. Friend the Member for Great Grimsby (Mr. Mitchell) has also made representations on this matter in early-day motion 263 which suggests changes to the method of calculating interest on student loans.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_479"><a name="80228w0032.htm_para1"><a name="0802296001638">In addition the Department has received some 206 written representations since June 2007 about the student loan interest rate. We are not able to say how many of those proposed changes to the method of calculating interest.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_480"><a name="80228w0032.htm_para2"><a name="0802296001639">We do not believe that it is necessary to change the way interest is calculated. Student loans are not like commercial loans. The Government make no profit but subsidise the interest rate and absorb other associated costs. Interest is charged using a widely recognised measure of inflation, so students only pay back in real terms the amount they originally borrowed. This is achieved by linking the interest rate for student loans to the annual rate of inflation as defined by the RPI. The interest rate is recalculated each year at the beginning of September using the RPI figure from the previous March. This is the methodology that has always been used. Over time it ensures the student loan interest rate will be equivalent to the rate of inflation but with a time lag.</p>

<p><a name="stpa_481"><a name="80228w0032.htm_para3"><a name="0802296001640">For the vast majority of student loan borrowers, who have income contingent loans, any increase in interest rate will not affect borrowers' ability to pay, or the amount that they are liable to pay each month. Repayments are linked to the ability to pay and this amounts to 9 per cent. of earnings above &#163;15,000.</p>

 The vast majority of pharmacy students already study the subject as a first degree rather than as an equivalent or lower level qualification. The redistribution of &#163;100 million by 2010 would enable the same number of pharmacy students to be funded as now but with even more studying the subject as a first degree. In that way we will increase and widen participation which is our top priority. We also value those who have already got a first HE qualification and who want to retrain in a different subject. There will be opportunities for them available, for example, through Foundation Degrees and employer co-funded provision.</p>

We are asking the Funding Council each year to look at levels of demand for subjects which might in future be regarded as key because of their economic or social significance, and to advise us on the best way forward. The first such review should take place starting in December 2008, in the light of entry data for the 2008-09 academic year. That would be an opportunity to have another look at pharmacy and other subjects in the light of the data that will then be available.</p>

 Officials in the Ministry of Justice have discussed with their Australian counterparts the effectiveness of legislation introduced there to combat suicide websites&#151;the Criminal Code Amendment (Suicide Related Material Offences) Act 2005. I understand that since the legislation came into force in January 2006 there have been no prosecutions.</p>

 The Internet Watch Foundation considers complaints about websites where the content is criminally racist, obscene or contains indecent photographs of children.

 The Government have worked with the internet industry, through the Department of Health's suicide prevention strategy and otherwise, to discourage them from hosting sites which may encourage suicide. Typically, indeed largely because of the responsible approach taken by UK internet service providers, such sites tend to be hosted abroad. Work on developing a kite mark standard for internet filtering software is being taken forward through the Home Secretary&#146;s task force for child protection on the internet.</p>

 There have been a considerable number of cases involving tax issues pursued before the European Court of Justice (ECJ) since 1998 and a complete list of the direct tax cases and indirect tax (VAT) cases may be found on the courts website at:</p>

</ul>
<p><a name="stpa_520"><a name="80228w0036.htm_para4"><a name="0802297000144">However HMRC does not keep records of the precise impact any ECJ judgments may have on either litigation pursued solely in the UK courts or on specific decisions that may have been taken in their dealings with individual taxpayers as a result of any such decision. It follows that there are no records held that would indicate what impact, if any, such decisions may have had in terms of paying tax back to private companies. The information requested could not be obtained except at disproportionate cost.</p>

 Between the 1 August 2007 and the 31 January 2008 the SA online filing service was out of operation on 19 separate occasions for an overall total of 113 hours. Ten of these disruptions and 62 of the total hours were for planned and essential maintenance and upgrades by either HMRC or the Government Gateway. Other disruptions to the service were as a result of technical failures.</p>
